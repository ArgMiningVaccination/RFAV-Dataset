Sheikh Zayed Theatre Session 1 366 An increase in the taste for education of vocational school graduates amid the COVID -19 pandemic. Is there a 2Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland. 3Educational Research Institute (IBE), Warsaw, Poland Abstract In this paper we explore the potential impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the intentions of graduates of Polish secondary vocational schools to continue education by comparing two student cohorts, the 2017 pre -pandemic cohort and the 2021 pandemic one. Drawing on the human capital inv estment model we argue that labor market entry conditions have deteriorated in the pandemic, thus leading to a decrease in the opportunity cost of continuing education. Using data from representative surveys of students in the final grades of VET schools, coordinated by the Educational Research Institute in Warsaw we find an increase in the taste for further education in the pandemic. At the same time, this effect is heterogeneous with respect to the socioeconomic background of students, as well as, partly, to the economic sector of occupation they are trained in. While students of tertiary educated parents do not increase their intentions to continue education, most probably due to saturation effects, graduates coming from less educated backgrounds are more willing to remain in education in 2021, thus reducing the gap. Importantly, students experiencing economic hardship do not respond to the decreased opportunity cost of schooling, perpetuating inequalities at the bottom of the social structure. 170 Learn ing Loss during the Covid -19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Paris, France. 2Nuffield College, Oxford, United Kingdom. 3Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, Oxford, United Kingdom. 4Department of Social Policy and Intervention, Oxford, United Kingdom. 5Swedish Institute for Social Research, Stockholm, Sweden Abstract How has learning suffered from school closures duri ng the COVID -19 pandemic? Several studies have addressed this question, but the answer varies depending on context. We conduct a pre -registered systematic review and meta - analysis to better understand factors driving this variation. We consider both the le ngth of school closures and the severity of the pandemic, as well as variation by subject domain, student age and socio -economic background. Double screening of search results against eligibility criteria identified 61 estimates of learning loss across 24 studies. Initial results show significant setbacks in learning across a range of student ages in both reading and mathematics. These setbacks are largest either early in the onset of the pandemic, or in places that experienced prolonged school closures in excess of 300 days. Our results suggest that some countries instituted effective countermeasures by keeping the length of school closures to a minimum and providing remedial resources. 241 Inequality in homeschooling during the Covid crisis Thijs Bol University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands Abstract In the spring of 2020, all schools in the Netherlands were closed, and children kept up with schoolwork from home. During the school closure, parents were expected to take a pivotal role in this \"homeschooling\". Parents could aid the learning of their children with material resources (i.e., workplace, device or computer) or immaterial resources (parental involvement in learning). In this article I investigate inequalities in these resources. and t hus the extent to which parents were able to help their children with their schoolwork. I use novel data collected in April 2020 among a large and nationally representative sample of Dutch parents with children in primary and secondary education. I find large social disparities in homeschooling. Children from higher educated parents receive more support with their schoolwork than children from lower educated parents. This educational gradient in parental support is partly driven by a gradient in ability to help: higher educated parents feel much more capable to help their children with schoolwork than lower educated parents. Differences in material resources were small and mostly negligible in size. These findings indicate that inequality in parental involve ment is a crucial mechanism in understanding learning disparities that are caused by Covid -19 driven school shutdowns across the world. 197 Educational Inequalities before and after the COVID -19 Pandemic in South Korea: Achievement Gaps by Family University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of. 2Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of Abstract The unequal impact of the Covid -19 Pandemic on education, which has resulted in school closures and subsequent learning loss, has been a major concern among education researchers. Recent research evidence based on various pre-post comparisons of standardized test scores shows that such concern was not unfounded in many countries an d regions, despite the fact that no discernible increases in achievement gaps were detected in some cases. A major limitation of this growing body of evidence, in comparative perspective, is that nearly all of the studies are focused on Western societies. Using new data from the National Assessment of Educational Achievement (NAEA) in South Korea, we present one of the first non -Western findings about the Pandemic's impact on achievement gaps. We estimate how gaps in standardized scores of reading (Korean), math, and English by family background, gender, and region changed after the Pandemic began compared to pre -Pandemic trends by tracking them from 2012 to 2020. We find that there was no consistent increase in parental education gaps. However, the disadvan tages of students with low family social capital and those from rural areas increased significantly across all subjects among middle school students (9th graders). For high school students (11th graders), female advantages increased significantly in all su bjects for high school students. Changes in time use patterns (games/music/video, social media, and private supplementary classes) are insufficient to explain the estimated result, according to a set of mediation analyses, leaving underlying mechanisms to be investigated further. Mobility and Methods (I) - Session 1 09:20 - 10:40 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 2. Wolfson Theatre Session 1 90 Cumulative Advantage, Intergenerational Reproduction, and Life Course Mobility: A Synthetic Approach Thomas A DiPrete Columbia University, New York, USA Abstract Cumulative advantage (CA) is a mechanism for attainment that arises when past advantages and accomplishments aect future life chances. This paper reviews the principal features of the cumulative advantag e model and then considers the question of how the CA model can be elaborated to shed light on the institutional mechanisms that influence the potency of CA processes to aect life course mobility. The paper argues that the importance of CA mechanisms on li fe course mobility also depends on the complementarity and substitutability of resources that flow across generations for accomplishment -based resources. Because intergenerational resources may interact with CA processes to aect outcomes, CA is potentially a mechanism that aects rates of intergenerational as well as life - course mobility. A deeper understanding of the importance of CA processes for mobility and inequality calls for the study of these mechanisms both within specic institutional contexts and as aggregate characteristics of a society's mobility regime. The paper proposes concrete strategies for empirical progress on these questions. 77 Is the 'unidiff' model still a proper statistical instrument for mobility trends? An analysis of educational mobility in 20 European countries between 2000 and 2018 Tomas Katrnak Masaryk University, Faculty of Social Studies, Brno, Czech Republic Abstract The text deals with the 'uniform difference' (Erikson, Goldthorpe, 1992) or 'log-multiplicative' (Xie, 1992) model ('unidiff' model), which has been the most popular statistical instrument for social mobility analysis for the last 30 years (Breen, 2004; Breen, M\u00fcller, 2020). The author presents the logic of the model, which has so me interpretative advantages but is connected with two conceptual problems. The first problem is the assumption of a uniform change of odds ratios, which means that the effects of social origins on social destinations change equally. The results of the unidiff model are therefore in societal terms but not in terms of social classes, even though it is reasonable to assume that social origins affect social destinations differently. The second problem is the 'intervening variable' problem (Goldthorpe, 2007): t he inclusion of the next variable (typically gender) in unidiff analysis. That problem is usually solved by comparing results from more unidiff models estimated by the categories of the intervening variable, which is, however, not proper analytical strateg y. The author offers to solve both these problems as an extension of a regression -type layer effect model (Goodman, Hout, 1998, 2001) into a more -way mobility table. This solution is presented formally as well as empirically using the example of an analysi s of educational mobility in the European Social Survey (ESS) data from twenty European countries over five rounds (2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018). 311 Cumulative or intersectional (dis)advantages in school performance? evidence from French data, base d on the maihda approach. Philippe Coulangeon1,2, Camille Peugny3 1Sciences Po, Paris, France. Paris, France. 3Universit\u00e9 Versailles Saint -Quentin en Yvelines, Guyancourt, France Abstract This paper aims at identifying intersectional effects of class, gender, and origin in cognitive and educational outcomes of young French middle -school students (Exam and standardised test scores in French and mathematics, cognitive tests in 6th and 9th grades) by means of a Multilevel Analysis of Individual Hete rogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) approach. Our analysis identifies strong contextual effects of the combination of class, gender and origin which are nonetheless nearly totally captured by the additive effects of these three variables. The re levance of the intersectional approach is this not generally supported. However, we identify some under or over -additive effects symptomatic in some specific stratum which call for further analyses. 182 Linked Lives: An Extended Dyadic Perspective on In come Trajectories in China Cheng Cheng1, Yang Zhou2 1Singapore Management University, Singapore. 2Central University of Finance and Economics, China Abstract Research on intergenerational mobility has considered how parental education directly affects children's life chances, net of children's education. We propose an extended dyadic perspective to study social mobility in an extended family framework : the edu cational attainment of oneself, parents, the spouse, and the spouse's parents may each have an independent effect on one's long -term income trajectories. These effects, however, may be gendered, considering the gender division of labor and gender asymmetry in intergenerational relations. Using multilevel dyad growth curve modeling and longitudinal dyadic data from the China Family Panel Studies 2010 -2018, we examine how personal income trajectories vary by the education of oneself, one's spouse, parents, an d parents -in-law. Results suggest that men benefit from various extended family resources: the husband's income grows faster not only with his own education but also the education of his wife, his parents, and his parents -in-law. In comparison, women benef it mainly from their own human capital and parental resources; spousal and in -law resources have limited effects on the wife's long-term income growth. In the context of rising income inequality and volatility, our study provides an extended dyadic longitu dinal perspective in studying inter -and intra -generational income mobility. Migration and Occupational Mismatch - Session 1 09:20 - 10:40 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 3. Alumni Theatre Session 1 164 Ethnic and gender inequality in the school -to-work transition? Vertical and horizontal educational -occupational mismatches among children and grandchildren of immigrants in Mathieu 2Stockh olm University, Stockholm, Sweden Abstract A vast literature shows that first -generation immigrants are ofte n over -educated; meaning that their educational attainment is higher than what is required or observed for their occupation. Yet, we know very little about the potential educational mismatch among their children and grandchildren (the so -called second and third generations). Considering that the descendants of immigrants grow up and receive their education in the destination country, we expect that they experience lower levels of educational mismatch than their parents do. Remaining differences could be att ributed to an \"ethnic penalty\" due to discrimination. Using detailed information on the educational and occupational trajectories of the children and grandchildren of immigrants in the French Trajectoires et Origines (TeO2, 2019 -2020) survey, we are able t o study differences in vertical (educational attainment) and horizontal (field of study) educational mismatch among the descendants of immigrants and the majority population of French natives. We also examine a combined measure, which allows us to assess w hether some ethnic groups are more likely to experience a double burden of both vertical and horizontal educational mismatch. Results based on linear regressions show that non -European second -generation immigrants are more likely to be over -educated than t he majority population and European second -generation immigrants. When we control for age, differences become small. Among the third generation from both European and non -European origin, the level of vertical mismatch is similar to that of the majority po pulation. Horizontal mismatch is also higher among non -European second -generation immigrants once we control for years of education, while estimates reveal no differences in horizontal mismatch between the third generation and the majority population. Over all, we observe a process of convergence across generations in which the mismatch pattern of the third generation becomes closer to that of the majority French population. 134 Language used at home and educational -occupational mismatch of migrants by gen der Eyal Bar -Haim1,2, Debora Pricila Birgier3,4 1Department of Education, Ben Gurion University at the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel. 2Faculty of Educational , Bar -Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel. 3Department of Economy and Society, University of Gothenbu rg, Gothenburg, Sweden. 4Center for Economic Demography, Lund University, Lund, Sweden Abstract The association between literacy and labor market outcome is less explored relative to the association between educational attainment and migrant economic integration. The current study examines to what extent language as cultural capital shapes gender differences in educational -occupational mismatch among migrants. Using the PIAAC 2018 dataset, we employ a series of nested fixed effects linear mode ls in which our dependent variable is the perceived years of over -education and study the effect of language use at home, controlling for linguistic competence in the host country language. We find that migrants who use a different language than the host c ountry's language at home are more prone to educational -occupational mismatch. Migrant women, who are at higher risk of educational - occupational mismatch, suffer even more when using a foreign language at home. 126 Contextual effects on educational -occu pational mismatch by gender and migration status: A cross -country comparative study in Europe Debora Pricila Birgier Department of Economy and Society, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. Center for Economic Demography, Lund University, Lund, Swe den Abstract Immigrants were found to suffer from educational occupational mismatch (henceforward EOM), i.e., difficulty to obtain occupational status that corresponds with their educational level. However, most existing studies on this topic focus on male immigrants or use pooled samples of men and women, ignoring gender -specific aspects that might shape female employment status and occupational attainment. In addition, over -education among immigrants varies substantially across countries. To fill these tw o lacunas in the literature I examine the factors that shape gender differences in EOM among migrants and the extent to which migrant women suffer from double disadvantage in terms of occupational mismatch using a comparative approach. I use the EU Labor F orce Survey (EULFS) data for the years 2018 -2019 and compare the levels of gender differences in EOM of immigrants across 29 European countries. I focus on over -education, using the Realized Matches approach, which defines over -education based on the actua l educational levels of workers in each occupation. The preliminary results from separate models presented here indicate that in 22 out of the 29 countries studied migrants have higher levels of over -education relative to natives. In addition, in 21 countr ies, there are gender differences in over -education. Contrary to our expectations, while in most countries women are indeed the most disadvantaged group in terms of over -education, just in seven countries migrant women suffer from a double disadvantage. Re sults from multilevel logistic models suggest that Liberal and Mediterranean countries exhibit higher levels of over -education, and that in conservative and Mediterranean migrant women tend to suffer from double disadvantage, while, the welfare regime cann ot explain the cross -countries differences in the migrant to native gaps in over -education. The preliminary findings provide evidence on the social embeddedness of migrant penalties in terms of over -education in general, and migrant women specifically, and how they change according to host -countries institutions. 408 What You Got Ain't What You Get - The Role of Institutional Differences in Job Allocation between Sending Countries and Germany for Refugees' Status Downgrades Marvin B\u00fcrmann1,2, Dorian Tsolak1,2 1Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany. 2Bielefeld Graduate School in History and Sociology, Bielefeld, Germany Abstract It has been widely shown that refugees are disadvantaged in many dimensions of labour market outcomes in Germany an d other Western countries. Refugees are also the group to experience the steepest loss of status on migration compared to other immigrants while also showing massive loss of status in general. Following the model of relative risk aversion, it seems most li kely that refugees will try to re -attain their previous occupational status as individuals regard avoiding downward mobility generally as much more important than exhibiting upward mobility. Yet, in the light of a much different labour market in Germany co mpared to refugees' countries of origin, this status re -attainment process is highly non -trivial. Our work examines the impact of the German occupational structure for the first occupational status of refugees post migration, compared to their last pre -migration occupational status, all while still controlling for individual factors which may influence this status (re) -attainment process. Hereby, we use variables on standardization of educational credentials within occupations, unemployment rate and share o f foreigners, all on the occupational level. We use the IAB -BAMF -SOEP Survey of Refugees (samples M3, M4 & M5) from the German Socio -Economic Panel. While a massive loss of status (SIOPS) overall can be observed, our results show that working previously (a broad) in an occupation which is more standardized in Germany leads to less status loss. Likewise previous work in an occupation which has a high share of foreigners in Germany also reduces the loss of status, indicating homophily effects or previous exper ience of employers with foreign employees. When looking at the effect of realizing certain occupations, we see that working in a standardized occupation in Germany also leads to less status loss. However, working in an occupation with a high share of forei gners leads to more status loss overall, which points towards a problem of highly segregated labour markets. Household Division of Labour and Money - Session 1 09:20 - 10:40 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 4. Thai Theatre Session 1 101 Dual -Earner Couples' Work Hour Arrangements and Preferences for Reduced Work Hours - A Comparative Perspective. Ronit Waismel -Manor1, Asaf Levanon2 1Open University, Raanana, Israel. 2University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel Abstract The preference for reduced work hours is well -known to be associated with various social ramifications, but research on the determinants of workers' preference is scarce and mostly limited to investigating the role of individual characteristics. By contras t, we conceptualize \"time -squeeze\" at the household level from a comparative perspective. Building on the life -course perspective and scholarship on welfare policy, we examine the relationships between dual - earner couples' work hour arrangements and men's and women's own preferences for reduced work hours, as well as their desire for their spouses' reduced work hours in 19 countries. Using the 2010 European Social Survey, we document a pervasive preference for reduced work hours for both men and women. Mult ilevel models indicate that individuals generally report preferences for working hours for themselves and their spouses that conform to a modified male breadwinner -female homemaker template. Moreover, in comparison to couples in Nordic countries, individua ls in dual -earner couples in Anglo -Saxon and Continental European countries experience greater \"time - squeeze\". 141 The Rise of Cohabitation and 1Princ eton University, USA. 2European University Institute, Italy Abstract Entering a union is associated with gendered changes in work and earnings. However, there are differences between entering a cohabiting union, getting married, or transitioning from a coh abitation to a marriage with the same partner. In this paper, we use the European Community Household Panel (ECHP, 1994 -2001) and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU -SILC, 2005 -2019) to study how the gender gap in income and h ours worked changes upon entering different types of unions as cohabitation becomes more prevalent. Doing a cross - country comparison including fourteen European countries, we find that when cohabitation is not widespread in the 1990s women reduce working h ours and earnings at the time of entering their first marriage, but not when entering the first cohabiting relationship. We expect this gap to narrow in the 2010s but remain larger in countries that are late adopters of cohabitation 260 The Unequal Dist ribution of Cognitive Household Labor and the Mental Load Andreas Haupt1, Dafna Gelbgiser2 1Karslruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany. 2Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel Abstract Several studies in recent years have convincingly argued that cognitive housework is a third form of work that can be distributed unequally within couples. However, previous qualitative and quantitative studies on cognitive household labor are based on very small and often highly selective samples. As a r esult, we are currently lacking population - level information on the division of cognitive work in the household. To address this gap, we provides the first population -level assessment of the gendered division of cognitive labor in the household. To this en d, we analyze data on representative samples from nine countries, obtained from the Generations & Gender Programme. We also discuss how to approximate cognitive household labor with survey data and the limitation of existing quantitative measures. Second , prior studies did not assess whether and how the division of cognitive work in the household is associated with exhaustion, and whether women in particular are at greaterr risk of experiencing higher mental load. We explore this association in our popula tion-level data. To do this, we use information on the question of whether people are too tired to work well because of housework as an indicator of exhaustion and explore its association with cognitive labor. To compare, we also show the association betwe en physical household labor and exhaustion. Our multivariate models show a clear association between levels of cognitive household labor with exhaustion for women. This is not the case, however, for high levels of physical household labor. Importantly, we do not find any significant influences for both kinds of work on stress levels for men. Thus, women are more susceptible to negative implications of cognitive household labor on their mental health and labor force success. 419 Wealth and Money in Coup le Households: How do gendered wealth inequalities influence couples' money management in East Germany. 2WZB Social Science Center Berlin, Germany Abstract Wealth is an important dimension of social stratification and closely linked to gender inequalities. It is well established that women have lower incomes and wealth than men. These inequalities are most pronounced within heterosexual couples and aggravate once partners get married and have children. Similar to earnings, overall wealth levels and also gender wealth gaps are lower in East than in West Germany. Pr evious research has focused on explaining gender wealth inequalities at the household level mainly, less is known about possible consequences. Equality in control of money within couples is highly valued and this might buffer women's disadvantages in wealt h ownership. In this paper, we ask whether unequal wealth constellations affect how couples manage money and decide how to spend it. Our theoretical considerations are based on Emerson's exchange theory and Zelizer's gender perspective on the meaning of mo ney, which link resources to power (in -)equalities within couples. We compare East and West Germany in order to analyse how this association is shaped by different social policy and cultural contexts due to historical legacies. To test our hypotheses, we a pply random and fixed -effects multinomial logistic regression models to data from the German Socio -Economic Panel Study, which include detailed measures on wealth endowments. Preliminary findings indicate that in both, East and West Germany, most couples p ool their money and make joint decisions. However, women or men with substantially higher wealth and earnings also have more power over money than their partner. These effects are most consistent in East Germany and hold for wealth and earnings. In West Germany, we find these effects for wealth only, while men have more power over money independent of income constellations. Interestingly, a separated money management occurs more often in couples with unequal wealth distributions in East and West Germany. Mobility and Culture - Session 1 09:20 - 10:40 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 5. NAB 1.07 Session 1 26 Cultural reproduction or cultural mobility? The role of family, school, and gender for cultural attendance in Germany Gunna Otte, Dave Balzer, Tim Sawert , Marie Schlosser JGU Mainz, Mainz, Germany Abstract The public sphere is one of the arenas in which processes of social cohesion and distinction, and fragmentation play out. Cultural institutions have the potential to at tract diverse audiences, but they may also serve as places of social closure. It has repeatedly been demonstrated that high culture institutions are dominated by attendants from the more educated classes. According to the cultural reproduction hypothesis, familiarity with the arts is mainly learned in the parental home during primary socialization. In contrast, the cultural mobility hypothesis points to the educational system's capacity to instill cultural interest in young persons and to make them acquire cultural capital in secondary socialization. The two theoretical accounts thus postulate different interaction effects between education and parental background on cultural participation. In addition, recent research shows that the effects of parental soc ialization vary not only by the gender of the children, but also by the gender of the more culturally active parent, as well as the cultural domain. In our paper, we examine whether the data are more likely to support the hypothesis of cultural mobility or cultural reproduction, taking into account both gender - and domain -specific effects. For this, we draw on the so far largest population survey on cultural education and cultural participation in Germany, which was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and conducted in 2018. We find positive effects of socialization at home and at school for current cultural attendance in all domains, especially for high culture institutions. Most of our results support the cultural reproduc tion hypothesis over the cultural mobility model. In general, long educational careers instill cultural capital in children above their parental background. However, the educational system is not able to attenuate the gap in cultural attendance between the offspring of parents with different social background. 30 Envision Opportunity: How Teens Assess Opportunities and How Messages Involve Ruo-Fan Liu University of Wisconsin at Madison, Madison, USA Abstract Sociologists have shown that poor students have less favorable life chances owing to objective features, but they have paid less attention to how people frame opportunities and how such framing creates disparities in students' college destinies. I use a year of fieldwork, two waves of stud ent interviews, and supplemental interviews to examine how young people envision opportunities and how messages are involved after Taiwan's higher education and admissions reforms. The result suggests that whether students are embedded in homogeneous or he terogeneous environments will shape how they envision opportunities. In a homogeneous environment, where networks deliver similar assessments of the range of possibilities, middle -class students, given positive cues, occupied prestigious slots. Yet, in a h eterogeneous environment, negotiators have more space to reinterpret a situation as the process unfolds and further change admissions outcomes to be favorable. This approach illuminates the interplay between social class, opportunity envisioning, and quali ty of information. 87 Misrecognition Recognized? Cultural Participation, Status, University, London, Canada Abstract Bourdieu's misrecognition model argues that a cultural hierarchy exists that assigns status to cultural activities and objects. Yet, existing empirical research has paid little attention to whether or not this hierarchy exists and if it shapes cultural tastes and participation. In this paper, we analyze if cultural activities differ in terms of perceived status, the cultural hierarchy is similar across socioeconomic group s, and perceptions of status are associated with individual cultural tastes and participation. At the macro level, we find that cultural activities have different status (for example, opera has higher status than flea market) and status perceptions are sim ilar across socioeconomic groups. At the micro level, the perceived status of a cultural activity is positively associated with an individual liking and participating in this activity, especially for those (originating) in high socioeconomic positions. Ove rall, our results support the misrecognition model claiming that individuals use a widely accepted cultural hierarchy to signal membership of different socioeconomic groups. 298 Social Class, Class Mobility and Status Seeking Simon Bienstman Goethe Unive rsity, Frankfurt am Main, Germany Abstract This study contributes to the growing literature on social status by investigating the social -structural determinants of status seeking. Specifically, I investigate whether social class and intergenerational class mobility affect the relative importance people attach to status. Drawing on prior research from (social) psychology, economics and sociology, several competing hypotheses on the effects of class and class mobility on status seeking are formulated and test ed using pooled European Social Survey Data (rounds 1 -9). Preliminary results from hierarchical linear mixed effects models show that status seeking has an inverse relation to the status order implied by social class. That is, in contrast to what prior res earch indicates, it is those who have less status who strive for more. With regard to the consequences of mobility experiences, the results show a clear pattern of symmetric acculturation. There is no evidence of specific directional effects of downward or upward mobility on how important status is to those who experience mobility. Temporary Employment and Wages - Session 1 09:20 - 10:40 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 6. NAB 1.15 Ssssion 1 214 What do unions do to temporary workers' wages? Evidence from Spain, before and during the 2008 financial crisis Iv\u00e1n Canzio LIVES Centre, Lausanne, Switzerland. University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland Abstract The labour market dualization theory claims that labour unions bargain against the temporary workers and that they foster inequalities between temporary and permanent employees. Instead, the industrial relations literature frequently finds that unions commonly follow solidaristic strategies. This study contributes to the literature by ex ploring the effects unions have on temporary workers' hourly wages and the wage gap between permanent and temporary workers. The analyses rely on a series of cross -sectional surveys conducted between 2002 and 2010 in Spain, on of the most prominent cases o f labour market dualization. I distinguish between the individual effect of unions (union membership) and their contextual effect (the existence of workers' representation at the company). Results show that both the individual and contextual effect of unio ns were generally positive for the temporary workers' wages. Similarly, unions did not increase inequalities between the permanent and temporary employees. This situation changed during the first stages of the crisis, a period of massive job destruction: i n 2008 the temporary workers exposed to unions lost their wage advantage, while in 2009 the temporary workers were negatively affected by unions, which also widened the wage gap between permanent and temporary employees. Conversely, in 2010, when unemploym ent was still growing, these negative and unequal effects were no longer observed. Preliminary analyses suggest that the temporary workers under unions' influence were more likely to keep their jobs, but they did so at the expense of their salaries. To tes t the robustness of the primary results, union density at the sector level was tested as an alternative indicator of the contextual effect of unions. The results remained unchanged. Overall, findings suggest that unions have positive effects for the tempor ary workers' wages and do not increase wage inequalities between the permanent and temporary employees. 135 The effect of temporary employment on wages: A comparative study of eight countries Jonathan P Latner , Michael Gebel Universit\u00e4t Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany Abstract Despite decades of research, there remains a lack of clarity about the consequences of temporary employment on wage trajectories. Confusion exists about how to isolate the effect. Fixed effects models produced biased estimates because they fail to isolate the estimand. We use panel data from 8 different countries. The method is a dummy impact function. When decomposing the total effect into distinct transitions, the effect of a transition into or out of temporary employment is less negative than previously understood. Further, the effects disappear over time, such that after four years, there is little difference in comparable transitions. Finally, while most cross -national, comparative studies emphasize differences between c ountries, our results suggest that much of these differences are the result of biased estimates. We reduce confusion by improving and clarifying our understanding of the consequences of temporary employment on wages. The results contribute to broader the oretical, empirical, and policy debates. 143 Bridge for some, trap for others? Career phase variation in the long - term wage growth of temporary workers Leonie Westhoff Nuffield College, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract A substantial amount of literature has investigated whether temporary employment is a \"bridge\" into the labour market or a \"trap\" leading to an instable labour market career. Less attention has been paid to career phase variation in such effects, that is, whether the lo ng-term career outcomes of temporary employees differ with the career phase they are in. This paper seeks to fill this gap by providing a detailed examination of career phase variation in the long -term wage growth of temporary and permanent employees. Draw ing on data from the German Socio -Economic Panel (1995 -2018), growth curve modelling is used to construct wage curves of temporary and permanent employees in the early, mid - and late career. The results show that there is indeed career phase variation in t he long -term wage growth of temporary workers. Temporary workers at all ages face an initial wage penalty relative to permanent employees. However, the wage trajectories of temporary workers in the early career are very steep, leading to convergence with the wages of early career permanent workers after a few years. In contrast, temporary employees in the late and, in particular, mid -career experience long -term divergence from the wages of permanent employees. Further analysis shows that part of this career phase variation in wage growth trajectories can be attributed to differences in the subsequent labour market career of temporary workers. Specifically, in the mid - and late career, temporary employment appears to be associated with more instable labour ma rket careers, leading to inferior long -term wage growth. 379 Financial hardship while working: A comparison of non -standard and standard University, Netherlands Abstract Previous research on the consequences of non -standard work for income, job and employment insecurity most often excluded self -employed people. Yet the self -employed workfo rce increasingly includes solo self -employed persons who might be particularly vulnerable to suffer from these forms of insecurity. This study therefore explicitly directs attention to the self -employed and examines differences in financial hardship betwee n temporary employees, the solo self-employed, permanent employees and business owners. Moreover, this study adds to the literature by theorizing, based mainly on labor market insider -outsider theory, and tests whether those differences are conditional on macroeconomic performance and government social spending. To this end, authoritative cross -national data from 9 rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS), covering 32 countries and the period 2002 -2018, are used. The results of multilevel regression model s show that both temporary employees and solo self -employed workers experience more financial hardship, whereas business owners report less financial hardship than workers on a permanent contract. Macroeconomic decline aggravates the differences in experie nced financial hardship between these workers. Against our expectations, the gap in financial hardship between the solo self -employed and people who have a permanent contract is larger the higher the government expenditures on social protection. Altogether , especially people who have a permanent contract seem to benefit from government social spending. This could be because social assistance partly came into existence through negotiation by labor market insiders with a lot of bargaining power, that is, perm anent employees, who to this day might still experience the advantages of social protection. In many countries employment benefits are restricted in access to permanent workers, likely leading to more trust in their financial situation. The findings highli ght that for understanding financial hardship among non - standard workers it is important to include solo self -employed persons and to also take the country context into account. Covid19 and Health - Session 1 09:20 - 10:40 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 7. NAB 2.14 Session 1 20 State -level diversity, community social capital, and mental health during the COVID -19 pandemic: does race matter? HARRIS H KIM1, Republic of. 2Chung -Ang Univ, Seoul, Korea, Republic o f Abstract By drawing on nationally representative data from the Census Household Pulse Survey (CHHPS), we provide new evidence on the relationship between race and mental health among U.S. adults in the context of the Covid -19 pandemic. Based on three -level hierarchical linear models (with over 1.5M respondents clustered across 50 States plus the District of Columbia over the duration of 11 months), we find that contrary to conventional wisdom, Blacks are less depressed vis -\u00e0-vis their White counterparts. Moreover, this relationship is conditional on two contextual or state -level moderators: ethnolinguistic fractionalization and community social capital. Specifically, the \"Black advantage\" becomes amplified in ethnically more div erse states. In other words, ethnic diversity benefits minorities (Blacks are less depressed in more ethnically diverse states) but harms the majority group (White are more depressed in more ethnically diverse states). When it comes to state -level social c apital, a different pattern emerges. For Whites, living in a state with more social capital provides a buffer such that the effect of their race on depression is reduced. Hence, community social capital benefits Whites but not Blacks in providing mental he alth protection. We conclude that mental health during the current pandemic is powerfully driven by race, a critical individual -level factor, in combination with contextual -level factors (i.e., ethnic diversity and social capital). In sum, inequality in we ll-being during the pandemic in the U.S. is a product of an interplay between these variables. 206 Ethnic differences in the mental health effects of COVID -19: household and local context Alita Nandi1, Lucinda Platt2 1University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom. 2London School of Economics and Political Science, London, United Kingdom Abstract The Covid -19 pandemic and its accompanying restrictions on economic and social activities has had an impact on the mental he alth of all UK residents; but extant research has suggested that this impact may have been more severe for women and ethnic minorities. Using data from interviews conducted during 2020 with a nationally representative sample with ethnic minority boost samp les, Understanding Society Covid -19 Study, we examine the impact of the onset of the Covid -19 pandemic on the mental health of men and women from different ethnic groups as compared to their mental health as reported in the pre -pandemic period. We control for individual, household and local contextual variables that may independently impact mental health. We find that while all ethnic groups experienced worsening of their mental health, this decline was the highest for Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups, and for women. Looking at sex and ethnicity together, we found that the mental health impact was highest for Pakistani and Bangladeshi men. Existing research indicates that ethnic minorities living in areas with higher proportion of co -ethnic populations repor t better mental health and wellbeing. We therefore tested whether the mental health effects differed by neighbourhood composition. We find that living in areas with relatively high concentrations of own ethnic group residents does indeed moderate the nega tive mental health impacts for Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. We reflect on the implications of our findings for research both on neighbourhood ethnic concentration and the wellbeing impacts of the pandemic. 282 Covid -19: the role of neighbourhood deprivat ion in difficult times on individuals' health -related Statale, Italy. 4INED, France Abstract The Covid -19 pandemic is hitting societies hard, and people living in disadvantaged circumstances are among the most affected. We investigate the combined effects of the Covid -19 crisis and of living in a deprived neighbourhood on health related behaviours. We use longitudinal data from f ive British national cohort studies and we combine data gathered in the main surveys with the recent data from the Covid -19 survey (three waves, namely in March 2020, September 2020 and March 2021). As independent variable we use the Townsend index of neig hbourhood deprivation. Our main empirical contribution is a difference -in-difference model which allows to causally investigate the relationship between the pandemic and neighbourhood deprivation. Since the beginning of the crisis, all measures of health r elated behaviours have decreased significantly more for those living in more deprived neighbourhoods. The results, therefore, highlight the importance of reducing neighbourhood inequalities and the spatial clustering of disadvantages. 359 Mental Health' Effect of COVID -19 Confinement and Economic Support Measures among Older Populations in Europe and Israel: Variations by Age and Socioeconomic Status Gordey Yastrebov, Dina Maskileyson University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany Abstract This study focuses on the impact of confinement and economic support measures on the mental health of the older population (aged 50 and above) across twenty -five European countries and Israel. While studies evaluating the effect of confinement measures on mental heal th exist, they largely ignore the potentially offsetting effects of economic support measures. Moreover, previous findings on the effect of confinement measures are inconsistent, and many studies are based on cross -sectional designs. Using data from the Co rona Survey wave (2020) of the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we leverage the date of interview information to vary individual exposure to different policy contexts within countries. Overall, we do not find support for the negat ive effect of confinement measures on older adults' mental health. If anything, both confinement and support measures worked in tandem to soothe mental distress, resulting from the pandemic. The confinement effects, however, are contingent on age, potentia lly indicating that younger people are more likely to be negatively affected by lockdowns. However, we do not find that these effects varied in any systematic way by socioeconomic status. Coffee & Poster Session 1 10:40 - 11:20 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 33 If university students do paid work during their studies, does it increase their internal locus of control? Grace Chang London School of Economics and Political Science, London, United Kingdom Abstract University students are faced with the cost -bene fit decision to work while studying, often implicating disadvantaged students. Work may hamper student engagement and academic performance, but may also improve employability and skills. I examine whether university students doing paid work during their st udies improves their locus of control - the belief in one's ability to have control over their life events. Using longitudinal data on a cohort of English students, I model students' locus of control production at age 20/21. I find that engagement in paid work, rather than hours spent in work, increases students' internal locus of control. Students who work term -time have 0.12 standard deviations greater internal locus of control than students who do not work, and are driven by female students. Estimates du ring the holidays are smaller in magnitude and statistically insignificant. My study highlights the need to investigate wider student outcomes to narrow inequalities in university participation and experience. 43 Fair Gender Pay Gaps across Europe? Exam ining the Role of Occupational Contexts in 27 European Countries Ole Br\u00fcggemann1,2, Thomas Hinz1,2 1University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany. 2Cluster of Excellence: The Politics of Inequality, Konstanz, Germany Abstract It is still a puzzling question which gender inequalities in the labour market are perceived as fair and which are not - in the eye of the beholder. This study focuses on gender differences in the fairness perceptions of one's own wage and the role of the occupational context in dividuals are embedded in. Based on timely data collected from 27 European countries (ESS 2018), we contribute to the growing field of wage fairness perceptions by analysing the role of the occupational context (measured as the share of women and the gende r pay gap in the respondent's occupation), and how it moderates gender differences in fairness perceptions. Results indicate that - overall - female workers across Europe perceive their wages more often as unfairly \"too low\" than their male counterparts wi thin the same country context and occupation, and that this gender gap is more pronounced in occupations with a high proportion of women. 57 Ethnic registration and tertiary -level education of children of mixed native couples: Register -based evidence fr om Finland Camilla H\u00e4rtull , Jan Saarela \u00c5bo Akademi University, Vaasa, Finland Abstract In settings with unequal educational opportunities across ethnic groups, the ethnic affiliation of a child with intermarried parents may be of great importance for the child's future educational chances. Using register data that cover the entire population in Finland, we examine how the ethnic registration of children with mixed backgrounds relates to their probability of completing tertiary -level educ ation. The study context concerns two ethnic groups, Finnish speakers and Swedish speakers in Finland, that are native and have equal constitutional rights, but have unequal admittance rates to tertiary -level education in favor of the Swedish speakers. We find that a mixed background does not per se play any crucial role for the educational attainment. Instead, own ethnic affiliation matters for both men and women. Swedish -registered persons with mixed backgrounds are more likely to be high educated than th eir Finnish -registered counterparts. This difference is even more pronounced if the father is Swedish - registered and the mother is Finnish -registered. The results illustrate that the parental ethnic registration of children may have far -reaching consequenc es for the children's educational opportunities. Intermarried parents may well opt for the minority group if this choice appears to promote the child's future educational chances. 63 Decline of the Working Class Identity in Eastern Germany, 1991 -2018: A Counterfactual Decomposition Perspective Gundula Zoch1,2, Patrick Pr\u00e4g3,4 1University Oldenburg, Germany. 2Leibniz for Educational Trajectories, Leibniz, Germany. 3CREST, Paris, France. 4ENSAE, Paris, France Abstract Using a counterfactual decomposition perspective, we aim to explain the decline of working class identification in Eastern Germany after the fall of the iron curtain in 1990. From 1991 to 2018, the share of Eastern Germans identifying as working class fell from 61 per cent to 40 per cent. Drawing on fifteen waves of nationally representative, repeated cross -sectional survey data, we show first findings that important shifts in population composition in Eastern Germany have taken place, yet that the decline of the working class was more likely driven by a value change that took place at the same time. Future analyses will investigate this further, testing hypotheses about cohort replacement, unemployment, the decline of manufacturing, and the rise of the serv ice sector, and comparing the Eastern German development of class identity to that in Western Germany. 66 Post -retirement work and income inequality among older adults: Another aspect of cumulative disadvantage?\" Haya Stier1, Aviv Unive rsity, Israel. 2University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel Abstract Post-retirement work may have important consequences on patterns of inequality among older adults, depending on motivations to work and patterns of selection into work. Those who have not accumulated sufficient funds may decide to work in order to improve their economic position, thereby reducing income gaps among older adults. At the other end of the income distribution, highly educated people in high -paying jobs may continue the ir work post -retirement because it is economically efficient, in which case, post -retirement work may exacerbate existing inequalities. Policy considerations may also play a role in the decision to work post -retirement and may affect inequality among olde r adults by reducing (or encouraging) incentives to work. The current study examines the work patterns of Israeli retirees, focusing on factors associated with the decision to work and the choice between full or part -time employment. Gender differences are examined as well. We use the Israeli Income Surveys 2008 -2011, collected by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics. We selected men ages 68 -75 and women ages 63 -75. Age cuts were determined by Israel's official retirement age, which is the age for eligi bility for old-age allowance. Our preliminary findings show that the majority of men and women reaching retirement age indeed withdraw from the labor force. Those continuing work are the more privileged workers, with higher education and better occupations . These preliminary results indicate that post -retirement work may contribute to increases in inequality between educational groups. The next stage of our inquiry will be to conduct simulations to examine how post-retirement work and policy regulations aff ect inequality. We will also further investigate the quality of post - retirement work, to identify the groups most likely to enjoy the benefits of such work. 70 Reexamining the Equalizing Power of a College Degree: The Case of the Philippines Karol Mark Ramirez Yee University of Cambridge, United Kingdom Abstract Higher education has long been believed to enable disadvantaged families to exit poverty in the Philippines. While previous studies have found evidence to support this notion, most are now o utdated (covering the 1950s -1970s) or have limited scope. Further, to my knowledge, all previous researches have aggregated college graduates into a single category, irrespective of the diversity of the 2,399 public and private institutions in the country. Taking advantage of the Annual Poverty Indicator Survey (APIS) of 2014 \u2014notably, the only national data set to date which collected information on higher education institution attended \u2014I connect wage information customarily included in the APIS with a rich set of higher education covariates from the Commission on Higher Education to examine the 'equalizing power' of a college degree, providing novel insight on how higher education characteristics influence mobility in the Philippine context. I find that com pleting college alone is insufficient to exit poverty. While the promise holds true for graduates of High Status Public and High Status Non -Profit entities, most low -SES graduates of Regular and High Status For -Profits remain in poverty despite completing college (65% and 88.4% respectively). These findings underscore the stratifying role of higher education in the Philippines, offering nuance to policies and programs aimed at enabling mobility, while highlighting the need for further scholarshi p in the area to better scrutinize the causal factors that enable mobility for some graduates (High Status Public and Non -Profit), but impede the same for others (Regular and High Status For -Profit). 78 Signals, Educational Decision -Making, and Inequalit y: A Note on the Formal by Holm, Hjorth -Trolle and J\u00e6ger Gordey Yastrebov Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany Abstract This paper explores the assumptions and the implications of the formal ( mathematical) model outlined by Holm, Hjorth -Trolle, and J\u00e6ger in their article in European Sociological Review 35(4) (2019). The model links educational decision -making to social background inequality and academic ability and is said to conform to the key propositions of the Relative -Risk-Aversion (RRA) theory and the Compensatory -Advantage -Model (CAM). Its most original component is that it allows for the error in estimating one's ability, which, once known, impacts on the decision to (dis)continue educat ion. The error is said to have a differential impact on students of different social backgrounds, whereby social inequality in educational decisions is effectively maintained. The model also deserves attention and praise as one of the few attempts in our f ield to reason formally and provide a mathematical formulation of theoretical arguments. However, I scrutinize the model and show that (1) some of the models' assumptions may not be defensible; that (2) the most interesting and original hypothesis propose d by HHJ does not follow from the model; and that (3) the empirical implications of the model are wrongly interpreted in terms of probability differences. I then show which particular assumption is, in fact, required for HHJ's most original hypothesis to h old. The assumption is non -intuitive, and I conclude that the hypothesis, as formulated by HHJ, does not have a sound theoretical basis. 86 Family transitions and children's health inequalities - a longitudinal study using a stress -related biomarker Pauline Kleinschl\u00f6mer1, Mine K\u00fchn2, Lara Bister3, 1University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany. -Institute Demographic Research, Germany. 3Universtiy of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands. 4BiB Federal In stitute for Population Research, Wiesbaden, Germany Abstract Changes in the family structure, such as parental separation or stepfamily formation, lead to a deterioration in child outcomes. Most prior research focuses on educational success and psychosocia l well -being while physical health indicators are less often studied. In this paper, we analyse the effect of a change in family structure on children's stress, measured in the level of c -reactive protein, a corollary of psychological distress, detected in blood samples. Given that increased stress in childhood negatively affects later cognitive development and physical health, we contribute to a better understanding of social inequalities among children. Calculating first difference estimators, we analyse whether children experience higher stress levels after the transition to (1) a single -parent family or (2) a stepfamily than before. Our data comes from the German KiGGS study (collected in 2003/06 and 2014 -2016). Our findings indicate that only the transi tion to a single -parent family increases children's level of c -reactive protein. Transitioning to a stepfamily has no significant effect on children's stress level. 114 Refugees' Time Investments - Differences in the time use of refugees, other immigrants, and the native population in Germany Jana Kuhlemann MZES, University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany Abstract Since the 2015/16 refugee influx to Germany and other European countries, the host societies are challenged with the issue of refugees' integration. These recent arrivals may actively take part in the integration process via allocating their time strategically to activities promoting their integration, thereby rendering time use an investment in integration. Using a cluster analy sis approach, this contribution seeks to examine (1) whether and to what extent recently arrived refugees' time use differs from that of other immigrants and the host -country population in Germany, and (2) the role individual characteristics play in the ti me allocation of these groups. Findings will contribute to the understanding of recently arrived refugees' current situation in Germany and provide a basis for further research on the role of time use in their integration. Using data collected from 2016 to 2019 in the IAB -BAMF -SOEP Refugee Survey, the IAB -SOEP Migration Sample, and the German Socio -Economic Panel, I examine the time allocation to different activities of refugees and other immigrants who arrived in Germany between 2010 and 2019, and the nati ve German population with a cluster analysis approach. Furthermore, I explore the heterogeneity of time use patterns based on individual characteristics for these groups. Results suggest that refugees' time investment in labor -market activities is very lo w and that their investment in human -capital and leisure activities is higher compared to the other population groups for both men and women across all age groups. Overall, refugees' time use patterns are very different from those of other immigrants and natives. 129 Redistribution via taxes and social benefits in Switzerland Rudolf Farys1, Oliver H\u00fcmbelin2, Lukas Hobi2 1Institute of Sociology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. 2Bern University of Applied Sciences, Department of Social Work, Bern, Switzerland Abstract In our paper, we use a linkage of tax data with other administrative data to analyze how the collection of direct taxes and the payment of social benefits affect income inequality in the six Swiss cantons of Aargau, Bern, Lucerne , St. Gallen, Geneva and Valais. The results show that within -population market income inequality in working households is reduced by the tax and benefit system from 37.4 Gini points to 27.6, a reduction of 26%. A larger share of this reduction is due to s ocial benefits such as means -tested benefits and pensions (71% of the total effect). The effect associated with tax progression is much smaller (29%). In an international comparison, the low redistribution effect of direct taxes is striking in Switzerland, which can be explained, among other things, by Switzerland's federal organization. We also find differences between the cantons in the level of inequality as well as in the extent and composition of redistribution. 139 Educational reproduction in Sweden : A prospective study based on retrospective data Vanessa Wittemann University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany Abstract This study will examine educational reproduction of Swedish men and women born between 1930 and 1950 in a prospective design which makes it possible to not only investigate social pathways of reproduction but additionally taking demographic pathways, i.e., fertility into account. Using data of the Swedish subsample of the Generations and Gender Survey (GGS), I will adopt the method developed by Skopek & Leopold, 2020 to Sweden. This offers new insights about the number of high - and low -educated children, who men and women of different levels of education are expected to produce. Furthermore, the relative contr ibution of demographic and social pathways to the educational reproduction process is analysed. 142 Differential childcare utilisation patterns by migration background Evidence from a nationally representative Irish cohort study Stefanie Sprong , Jan Skop ek Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland Abstract A large body of literature looks at the effects of non -parental childcare on child development, highlighting the potentially equalising effects of early childhood education and care, which may be particularly relevant for children with a migration background. However, to properly understand these possibly beneficial effects, it is important to consider which children are more likely to experience different types of care by exploring differential ch ildcare utilisation patterns. This paper analyses the childcare choices by migration background, drawing on a nationally representative longitudinal dataset from the Republic of Ireland: The Growing Up in Ireland infant cohort. The preliminary results indi cate that children from families with a resident migrant parent are substantially less likely to be in non -parental care than children from native families, with the difference with native families being largest for migrant families that do not speak Engli sh at home. Using the Karlson -Holm -Breen (KHB) decomposition technique, we find that compositional differences play an important role in these differential childcare utilisation patterns; for English speaking migrant families about 60% of the difference co uld be explained and for non -English speaking families around 80%. Among the most important explanatory variables were the equivalised household income and the availability of kinship networks and social support. 148 Resilient or Vulnerable? Effects of the COVID -19 Crisis on the Mental Health of Refugees in Germany Laura Go\u00dfner1, Yuliya Kosyakova1,2, Marie -Christine Laible1 1Institute Nuremberg, Germany. 2University of Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany Abstract The COVID -19 crisis represents an event of increased psychological distress for everyone involved. Even though the pandemic had substantial consequences for the whole society, like during most crises, some population groups tend to be disproportionally affected and personal circumstances as well as individual personality traits are likely to influence the extent to which individuals are able to cope with the pandemic. In this paper, we seek to explore how recent refugees in Germany cope mentally with lockdowns impos ed by the German government. We rely on most recent longitudinal survey data from the IAB -BAMF -SOEP Survey of refugees, conducted yearly since 2016. As the fifth wave in 2020 was in the field when the second nationwide lockdown started on December 16th, we are able to apply a regression discontinuity design. Since it is arbitrary who was interviewed before and who after the start of the lockdown, we compare these two groups to uncover a treatment effect of the lockdown. First results show a significant negative effect of the December -lockdown on the life satisfaction of refugees. In further steps, we analyze which subgroups are affected more than others in this regard and aim to uncover so -called protective factors and personality traits that enhance the ability of being resilient during crises. Among others, we will analyze the role of an internal Locus of Control, a characteristic associated with the feeling of being responsible for one's own circumstances rather than attributing life's events to pure l uck or faith. Since mental health is an important prerequisite for all forms of integration, understanding the related needs in times of crises can be highly important for policy makers and other stakeholders in future crises. 176 Identifying the Spatial Patterns of Multidimensional Poverty: The case of Chile Magdalena Rossetti LSE, London, United Kingdom Abstract Although there is an increasing interest in looking at the spatial concentration of poverty, most of the research has focused on measuring pove rty for different spatial units, ignoring the spatial relationship between areas and inferring patterns of poverty from visually inspecting maps rather than measuring the degree of clustering using statistical measures. The few studies that adopt a spatial statistical approach are mainly concentrated in high -income countries, leaving a gap in knowledge for the global south. This paper contributes to bridging this gap by proposing a methodology that can be used in developing countries that do not have suffi cient administrative data for low levels of territorial aggregation needed to conduct the analysis, with Chile as the case study. Using the 2017 Chilean Census and data on the geographical location of public and private services, the methodology combines t he Alkire -Foster method and global and local spatial autocorrelation methods to assess the degree of clustering of multidimensional poverty and identify the location of different patterns of poverty across Chile. Results show that multidimensional poverty is not randomly distributed across the country and that poverty can take the form of hotspots, coldspots, high -lows, and low -highs in Chile. Moreover, as the geographical unit gets smaller, poverty appears to be more clustered. The relationship between high and low poverty areas becomes statistically significant, meaning that the analysis of poverty concentration at a smaller spatial scale provides more precision on the location and dimension of these patterns. 196 Outlier or not? The Birth Order Effects on Educational Attainment in China Shoudeng Zhang Department of Sociology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract Birth order is an important sibling -specific characteristic that generates sibling differences. Includ ing educational achievement, intelligence, and personality, the influence of birth order has been of interest to scholars for a long time. While empirical results and theories suggest negative birth order effects (the later, the worse), studies in China fi nd positive birth order effects (the later, the better) on children's educational attainment, which is interesting but confusing. This paper looks into the birth order effects in China using the sibling fixed -effects model. It gives answers to these questi ons: how and why is China has a seemingly different pattern of birth order effects? Is the difference between siblings really birth order effects, or a result of education expansion or gender preference? Using sibling fixed effects models, adjusted birth order index, and cohort analysis, this study finds that the net effects of birth order in China are negative when controlling for education expansion and gendered sibling structure. In other words, the later -born children tend to receive les s educational attainment. This finding is in line with the prediction of existing theories and is similar to what has been found in western countries. Seemed contrary to what has been documented in previous research in China, the most important contributio n of this study is isolating the net effects of birth order from education expansion. The birth order effects previously shown to be positive are in fact disguised by the expansion of education because the later -born cohorts are receiving more education du e to the macro trend rather than the within -family process. Cohort analysis shows that the negative birth order effects are most significant in people born after 1965, who benefit most from the implementation of the compulsory education system. This study also finds that the negative birth order effects are more severe for males. 208 Configurations of Inequality in the Workplace: The Role of Ethnic, Gender and Class Relational Workforce Composition in Explaining Wage Inequalities Ludmila Garmash University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel Abstract The current research explores the role of workplace demographic composition in explaining wage inequality within diverse work organizations in Israel. The main aim of the study is to uncover which workplace demog raphic structures - in terms of ethnicity and gender - promote more equality for the marginalized groups - Arab men and Jewish women - in comparison with Jewish men. This study contributes to the literature primarily through a re- conceptualization of class ic composition measures through the intersectional theoretical lens and its empirical testing. This includes two steps. First, the move beyond the one -dimensional measurement of workforce composition (gender or ethnicity), by applying the intersectional ap proach to the classic measure workforce composition of the workplace. Second, the paper introduces an alternative measure called 'relational workforce composition', which is designed to capture the dynamic of power relations among different (intersecting) status groups within the workplace. This relational measure considers the interaction between the total workforce and high -status positions composition while affecting the distribution of rewards within the workplace. Empirically, I analyze employer -employ ee data covering all gender and ethnically integrated Israeli workplaces in the private sector, and workers within them, for each year from 2000 -2015. 209 The Distribution and Allocation of Opportunities in the Swiss Education System Sara M\u00f6ser Univers ity of Bern, Switzerland Abstract In this contribution, Mare's (1981) conceptualisation of educational stratification made up by two dimensions - the allocation and the distribution of education - is applied to the Swiss context. To locate, where in the ed ucational system, i.e. at which transitions, the social stratification arises the Multiple Pathways Sequential Logit Mode is applied to panel data on the educational trajectories of two cohorts of Swiss students. This model, which was developed by H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen and Sirni\u00f6 (2020) based on Buis' (2017) extension of Mare's (1981) sequential logit model of educational transitions, is based on the concept that the overall effect of social background on final educational attainment is the weighted sum of passing each consecutive educational transition. The weights are constructed using three substantive distributional features at each branching point: i) the population at risk of making the transition; ii) the differentiating capacity of the transition and iii) the exp ected gains. The results show that socially selective transition probabilities can be observed at all educational levels. Due to their structural importance early educational transitions and transitions on the vocational pathway are identified as being hig hly consequential for overall social stratification. 215 The effect of COVID -19 on firms' training activities: Implications of the COVID -19 crisis on inequality in training opportunities Christoph M\u00fcller IAB, Germany Abstract The COVID -19 crisis led to far-reaching and immediate changes in work requirements and work organization. Training allows aligning workers' skills with changing work requirements. However, the crisis impeded the participation in training, as face -to-face measures were no longer poss ible especially in the beginning of the crisis. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to understand the prerequisites within firms enabling the implementation of training during the crisis. Using a novel firm -level survey linked with administrative data, I a pply a DiD -approach to study the role of E -learning use of firms for firms' training activities during the crisis. Furthermore, I explore whether the crisis is a driver of inequality in training participation by education, age and wages. I expect firms, wh ich were more resilient with respect to their training activities during the crisis, to differ in these characteristics, emphasizing once more the importance to counteract prevalent barriers in training participation. 218 Hidden dual misspecification bia s in propensity score methods Gerhard Krug Institute for Employment Research, Nuremberg, Germany Abstract In sociological empirical research, most hypotheses are tested on regression models. However, propensity score methods are increasingly used as an alternative, among others to avoid regression methods` vulnerability to functional form misspecification. If the propensity score is estimated by logistic regression, as is usually the case, functional form misspecification is also possible in propensity score matching. This is well -known in the statistical literature. However, it is often assumed that this bias is lower than in regression methods. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study and find that under some conditions pr opensity score methods even increase misspecification relative to regression methods. We distinguish two scenarios: In scenario 1 confounders are drawn from a normal distribution, as is the case in most simulation studies on the topic. In this scenario, propensity score methods are sensitive to functional form misspecification, but this bias is often not very large. In scenario 2, predictors are drawn from non -symmetric distributions (e.g. Chi -squared or poison) and bias increases substantially. Most notably, we find that bias is amplified especially under conditions where regressions are prone to misspecification, too. This means that in the very situation that makes researchers decide against regression methods (fear of functional form misspecificati on bias), their chosen alternative, propensity score matching, is most vulnerable to misspecification bias. We show that this is also true for many of the more recent methods proposed in the literature like entropy balancing, covariate balancing propensity score estimation or using machine learning methods to estimate the propensity score. Only one method was found to be free from what we call \"hidden dual misspecification bias\". 220 Adverse pregnancy outcomes in the United Kingdom following unexpected j ob loss Alessandro Di Nallo, Selin K\u00f6ksal Bocconi University, Milan, Italy Abstract Research has documented social and economic antecedents of adverse birth outcomes including involuntary job loss. Most previous work lacks high -quality data on conception, pregnancy outcome and exogenous job loss during pregnancy. We analyse fertility, partnership and work histories from the British survey UKHLS (\"Understanding Society\") to examine whether a woman's and/or her partner's involuntary job loss during a pregnanc y increases the risk of a miscarriage, abortion and non -live birth. Our preliminary findings show that risk of non -live birth increases when the mother or the partner are exposed to an unexpected job loss. Moreover, we find higher risk of miscarriage as a response to only partners' job loss. We find no relationship between unexpected job loss and risk of abortion. The findings suggest that a mother's or a partner's unexpected job loss adversely affects the completion of pregnancy. 221 Generational income inequality in Nordic welfare state Esa Karonen , Hannu Lehti University of Turku, Turku, Finland Abstract Stratification rese arch has often bypassed the question of between -generation inequality because the assumption has been that the future generation will always have better -living standards than those living today. The question is does the assumption still hold? This chapter examines how much generational income inequality explains total income inequality during 1970 -2018. We observe how income trajectories over age have developed between cohorts and what structural factors contribute to generational income inequality and the development of income trajectories over age between cohorts. Thus, we examine life course trajectories on income to reveal if there is advantaged and disadvantaged generations. We utilize the longitudinal census data of Statis tics Finland. The total population data allow us to compare the income of the birth cohorts born 1920 -1989 during the period 1970 -2018 and it includes over 5,000,000 cases. We use hierarchical random effect growth curve models to estimate how much cohort d ifferences explain income inequality between generations and how socioeconomic factors of education, occupation, unemployment and age structure have contributed to it. Our preliminary results show, that most differences are between -individual but we did find that baby boomer cohorts hold the highest income compared to younger cohorts, who are born after the 1950s. Women did not hold such baby boomer advantage, as their income trajectories increased from the oldest to the youngest cohor t. Factors related to income inequality, we found that age structure and education were the most important factors associated with income inequality. 224 Who gets better grades? An analysis on gender gaps and class compositionsin England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden Isabel J Raabe1, Isa Steinmann2 1University of Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. 2University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway Abstract Short Abstract School grades play an important role in school, as they determine future educational pathways and school -leaving degrees. A common finding is that girls get better grades, even after differences in achievement tests are considered. This study contributes to disentangling factors at both the individual and classroom level, that correlate with such gender gaps in grades. Specifically, we investigate three research questions: Within classrooms, who gets better grades? Between classrooms, where do we see individuals get better grades? In what kinds of classrooms do boys get better g rades than girls? We apply two -level regression models to large -scale survey data from England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden (CILS4EU). Preliminary student -level findings suggest that female students indeed receive better grades than their male cla ssmates, even after controlling for cognitive abilities and socioeconomic status. This advantage of girls seems to be partly mediated by girls' lower resistance to schooling. Furthermore, we find a moderation effect: Exhibiting school resistance has a larg er negative impact on girls' grades than it has for boys. Preliminary class -level analyses suggest that in classrooms with a higher proportion of girls, average grades are higher, and average school resistance is lower. In classrooms with a higher proporti on of girls, the average grades of girls are higher, but the average grades of boys are lower. Moving forward, we will investigate these associations in extended models including control variables and interaction terms. This study aims to contribute to the literature on peer cultures by investigating associations between gender gaps in grades and the emergence of resistance to schooling under different socioeconomic class composition conditions. We will furthermore investigate if such associations differ fo r boys and girls. We will investigate both common patterns across the four countries as well as discuss the implications of differential institutional setups by country. 229 Educational performance and dropout of first -generation students in Russia: the role of parental involvement and cultural capital Vardan Barsegyan1, Ineke Maas1,2 1Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands. 2Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands Abstract This is the first systematic study of educational perfo rmance and dropout of first -generation students (FGS) in Russia. FGS are university students whose parents have no university degree. Continuous generation students (CGS) are university students of whom at least one parent has a university degree. FGS are one of the most vulnerable categories of university students in the West: they have on average lower grades and they drop out more often compared to CGS. We ask in this study two questions: first, whether FGS also have a disadvantaged position in Russia. A nd second, which mechanisms explaining parental effects on educational success, can account for differences in educational performance and dropout between Russian FGS and CGS. To test our expectations, we used 1 -9 waves (2012 -2020) of the Trajectories in E ducation and Careers (TrEC) study. TrEC is an ongoing longitudinal cohort panel study of about 5000 Russian young people from 210 schools in 42 Russian regions. In 2011, a random sample of schools and classes (8th grades) were selected from a stratified po pulation of large Russian regions and urbanization levels; all students from each school class were surveyed. The same students were surveyed every 1 -2 years. We applied event history analysis for discrete time specifications to analyze dropout. We found t hat 46% of students ever enrolled in higher educational institutions are FGS. The risk of dropout is 25% higher for FGS compared to CGS. Especially social capital mechanisms play a role in explaining FGS's educational outcomes. The effects of social capita l get weaker when taking into account educational performance of students. 230 Ethnic differences in intergenerational homeownership in England and Wales Franz Buscha1, Emma Gorman1, Patrick Sturgis2, Min Zhang1 1University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom. 2London School of Economics, London, United Kingdom Abstract Intergenerational homeownership mobility is the correlation between parent and child homeownership. This correlation has increased for recent generations; the chances of owning your own home depend increasingly on whether your parents owned or rented when you were a child. Because home ownership is the substantial component of wealth for most individuals, this trend has implications for other dimensions of mobility, such as income and social class. In this paper we use linked Census data to document rates of intergenerational homeownership mobility across ethnic groups in England and Wales. We find substantial differences, with Black, Pakistani and Banglades hi families experiencing the lowest rates of homeownership, and the strongest link between parent and child homeownership. In contrast, the Indian group have homeownership rates similar to those of White British, and a weaker link between parent and child housing tenure. We also show that Black, Pakistani and Bangladeshi home ownership mobility is more sensitive to local house prices, compared to other groups. Our results show that the combination of increasing house prices, and low rates of home ownership within some ethnic groups propagates low ownership rates among many ethnic minority groups. This is likely, in turn, to exacerbate existing gradients in other dimensions of race -based inequality. 243 Intention to Migrate from Hong Kong: pushes, pulls, & identities Man-Yee Kan, Lindsay Richards University of Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract In 2020, Hong Kong saw the introduction of a new national security law that saw the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong restricted. The UK Government responded to the controversial law by offering a pathway to British citizenship for British Nat ional (Overseas) citizens (BNOs) in Hong Kong. As of January 2021, around 90,000 visa applications have been made. To examine the migration intentions and decision -making processes of Hong Kongers, we conducted two surveys in Hong Kong, in the Spring and A utumn of 2021, that are nationally representative of the BNO population. Our research aims are twofold. First, we aim to provide descriptive data of policy -relevant information, including the number of migrants intending to come, their socio -demographic pr ofile and economic situations. Second, we intend to add to knowledge on international migration decisions, covering the complex interplay of political and economic push and pull factors. We also emphasise the role of national identities - the complex and n ested mix of Hong Konger and Chinese identities - as a precursor to migration. Our preliminary findings suggest that a large number of people are intending to migrate to the UK under the new BNO scheme, and an even larger number are considering it as an op tion. Those who have decided to come tend to be younger, more educated, and more likely to be working in professional and managerial jobs than those staying behind. Those intending to migrate to the UK are far more likely to identify as a Hong Konger rathe r than Chinese. In terms of push and pull factors, we find that those intending to migrate are more pessimistic about the political, economic, and social environment than those intending to stay. Having the aspiration for trustworthy and high -quality insti tutions also comprise 'pull' factors to the UK. 369 Institutional Selectivity and Social Inequalities in Access to Higher Education: Why Do Low -SES Students Attend Less Selective Italy Abstract Institutional selectivity is expected to lead to better students' performances and degree completion. While, operating as a screening device, it is considered as a threat to equalit y of educational opportunities. Despite the ongoing debate on admission policies and their consequences, little research has investigated the effects of higher education selectivity, on students' educational choices and its consequences on class inequaliti es. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to fill this research gap by assessing the effect of institutional selectivity on social inequalities in application s to study programs among a cohort of high school leavers in Italy. We frame this issue into the rat ional choice paradigm by investigating to what extent secondary effects of social background on applications to a selective study program are accounted for by economic constraints and relative risk aversion (RRA). We use unique data from the longitudinal s urvey of the project 'Family background, beliefs about education and participation in higher education', first fielded in October 2013, that gives us information on the students' social background, their educational choices and the items referring to relat ive risk aversion and economic conditions. Employing the KHB method (Karlson, Holm and Breen, 2012) we assess to what extent the rational choice indicators account for social inequalities in applications to a selective study program, decomposing the effect s of social background and the secondary effects of social background. Preliminary results seem to be in line with expectations, indicating how students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to choose less selective study programs, than their more affl uent counterpart. However, more analyses are necessary in order to fully and precisely answer our research question. 285 Making it to an academic track: Heterogeneous effects of individual agency on early educational transitions in Switzerland Francesca Mele1,2, Marlis Buchmann1,2, Kaspar Switzerland. 2Department of Sociology, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. 3Social Research Institute, Institute of Education, University College London, London, United Kingdom Abstract In educational systems that use tracking, early manifestations of agency may be decisive for later educational opportunities. However, little is known about the role of agency in transitions in such systems, or about whether the role of agency differs depending on the socio -economic background and the educational tracks attended earlier. This study aims to address these gaps by investigating 1) to what extent individual agency shapes transitions to academic tracks in lower - and upper -secondary school; 2) whether family income moderates the effect of agency on the transition to academic tracks in lower -secondary school; 3) whether family income and the track attended in lower - secondary school moderate the effect of agency on th e transition to academic tracks in upper -secondary school. We use data from the child cohort of the Swiss Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (COCON) ( N=1273 first wave; 49% female). We first employ structural equation modelling to simultaneously inv estigate the role of the multi -item constructs study effort and persistence on the probabilities of transitioning into 1] academic vs. lower -requirement tracks at the lower -secondary level, and 2] academic vs. vocational/general tracks at the upper -seconda ry level. Then, two- and three -way interaction terms are used in logistic regressions to examine whether the effects of agency vary depending on family income and the track attended in lower -secondary school. Results show that whereas no significant effect of agency is found on the transition to lower -secondary school, higher levels of study effort are positively related to transitions to academic tracks in the upper -secondary school. The effect of agency on the transition to lower -secondary school does not differ significantly by family income. However, findings suggest that the probabilities to transition to academic tracks in upper -secondary school increase with the levels of study effort and persistence, especially among lower -income students who attende d academic tracks at the lower -secondary level. 312 The Effect of Non -migrants Attitudes towards Immigrants on Immigrants' Wellbeing in Europe Michaela edovi London School of Economics and Political Science, London, United Kingdom Abstract Current research suggests that migrants' wellbeing varies with context. One potential but under -researched driver of this variation is the non -migrants population's attitude towards immigrants (ATI). In this paper, I establish an association between ATI an d migrants' wellbeing. I employ non -migrants' ATI to measure the contact/exposure between migrants and non -migrants. I use five rounds of the European Social Survey (2010 -2018) to create a pooled dataset of immigrants and the second generation living in 22 European countries. I address the question, \"Are more positive attitudes towards immigrants in the areas where they live associated with higher life satisfaction of immigrants?\". To answer this question, I estimate OLS models of life satisfaction regres sed on an index of 6 measures of ATI aggregated to the subnational level (NUTS1/NUTS2) and control for individual -level predictors and country, year, and origin fixed - effects. Cross -national and cross -regional research design allows me to compare associati ons across countries and reveal within -country variation. I find a significant association between more negative regional ATI and lower migrant wellbeing, and its strength is comparable with the most important known predictors of wellbeing (e.i., education ). I also show that length of stay in destination moderates the strength of the association (only those more recently arrived are affected). Despite the well-attested link between self -assessed feelings of discrimination and wellbeing, I show that perceive d discrimination does not mediate the effect of ATI, suggesting that ATI contribute to immigrants' wellbeing beyond the effect of perceived discrimination and measure another mechanism of the contact effect. I show that the association is persistent across different country -groupings. These results imply that non-migrants' behaviour is strongly related to migrants' wellbeing and that the lived environment should be at the forefront of migrant wellbeing research. By showing the variation in ATI within countr ies, I confirm the importance of taking within -country heterogeneity seriously. Migration and Social Mobility - Session 2 11:20 - 13:00 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 1. Sheikh Zayed Theatre Session 2 430 International Migration and Social Mobility in Europe: The Effects of Parental Socio -Economic Status on Education and Occupational Status Attainment of and Non -Migrants Ayse Guveli1, Harry BG Ganzeboom2 1Department of Sociology, University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom. 2Department of Sociology, VU University Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands Abstract Migration has been a key condition for social mobility in the classical stratification and intergenerational social mobility research (Lipset and Bendix, 1959; Treiman, 1970). O n the individual level, migrants are expected to be more mobile relative to their parents than non -migrants while on the macro -level there would be more intergenerational mobility in immigration societies for both migrants and non -migrants (Tyree et al., 1 979). Attempts to investigate the effects of migration on social mobility were made in the 1960s (Lipset and Bendix, 1959; Blau and Duncan, 1967; Treiman, 1970), but since then research on social mobility and migration have developed along separate lines. Despite its plausibility, with a few novel exceptions (Li and Heath, 2018; Platt 2015; Zuccotti, Ganzeboom and Guveli 2017), social mobility research lacks interest in the international migration hypothesis. This research fills this gap by implementing the often -used Blau and Duncan (1967) status attainment model, which provide the most comprehensive explanation for the relation between migration and social mobility. We use the cumulative dataset of the European Social Survey (ESS rounds 1 -9) held biannual ly between 2002 and 2018, amended with two waves of the European Value Study (2008 and 2017), covering 49 European countries. Our preliminary findings show that migrants are indeed generally more intergenerationally mobile than the natives in the destinati on countries. However, this mobility does not result from a weaker direct effect of parental occupation on occupational status attained, but to lower returns to education that immigrants suffer from. In fact, the direct effect of parental occupation is sli ghtly stronger for migrants, in particular for migrants who have migrated together with their parents. 283 Immigrants' access to managerial positions Aleksander \u00c5 Madsen , Mats Lillehagen Department of Sociology and Human Geography, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway Abstract A significant body of American and European research has provided insight into immigrants' labor market participation and work performance. Still, very few studies have considered their access to positions of power and influence within organizations. We draw on organizational demography and relational inequality theory and make use of Norwegian economy -wide linked employer -employee administrative data to investigate (1) immigrants' access to managerial positions, (2) how firm characteristics shape their access and (3) whether it varies across immigrant generations. We exploit the detailed longitudinal register data on over 185,000 firms to test a set of hypotheses based on the extensive literature on how numerical majorit ies may respond to minorities within an organizational culture. In the study, we investigate both how the horizontal (co -workers) and vertical (managers) workplace composition of immigrants affects first - and second -generation immigrants' access to workpla ce authority. Our preliminary results show that there is substantial variation between firms in the ethnic composition of managerial positions and that immigrants' attainment of managerial positions vary over time and labor market segments. Our multilevel linear probability models with firm -level fixed effects and extensive individual controls show that both minority generations are disadvantaged in their access to managerial positions, but that descendants of immigrants are less disadvantaged. Further, we find that minority access to managerial positions becomes less likely when the proportion of minorities within firms grows. These findings are consistent with Blalocks' (1967) group threat hypothesis and with substantial intergenerational integration. Fina lly, what matters most for immigrants' attainment of workplace authority is the representation of immigrants at the managerial level. In workplaces where there are already immigrants in authority positions it is more likely that other immigrants will also access managerial positions. Taken together, our study shed new up -to-date light on immigrants' access to managerial positions in a modern welfare state. 122 The Civic Stratification of Status and Class Attainment: Micro - and macro -level effects of immig ration on intergenerational social mobility in Europe Irina EUI, Florence, Italy. 5University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom Abstract This paper assesses whether patterns of intergenerational social mobility vary between immigrants and nationals in Europe and the effects of migrants' inflows on European coun tries' overall intergenerational mobility. We use six pooled waves of ESS (2002 -2012) and EVS (2008) which include social mobility data as well as information on the migrant status of respondents, adopting both ISEI and the EGP class schema to model interg enerational social mobility. With both specifications, our results show a higher risk of downward mobility for first -generation immigrants from Central -Eastern Europe and non -EU countries relative to nationals and EU15 migrants. Intergenerational mobility is thus subject to 'civic stratification', depending on the origin and citizenship rights of immigrants. At the micro level, the status and class attainments of these two categories of migrants are also penalized by higher net migration rates. At the macro level, we find mixed evidence supporting the hypothesis of a fluidification of intergenerational mobility in the general population associated with higher immigration rates. 384 Occupational attainment and career progression among Iraqi immigrants adm itted under different categories in Sweden Julie Fournier European University Institute, Florence, Italy Abstract How immigration policy influences the subsequent integration of immigrants is a major concern for immigration countries. Although several studies have found that labour immigrants outperform family reunification immigrants and refugees on the labour market, the effect of the category of admission could not be disentangled from the effect of selection. Yet, besides their primarily sel ective aim, categories of admission also come with different rights and opportunities once immigrants have settled at destination. Moreover, most studies focus on one or two points in time. They have thus miss the temporal dimension of the legal path defin ed by categories of admission on the one hand and of the process of labour market integration on the other. This article contributes to the literature by analyzing how the category of admission influences the occupational attainments and trajectories of im migrants. Using detailed longitudinal data from the \"Migrant Trajectory\" collection of the Swedish registry and growth -curve analysis, I compare the occupational attainment at entry and the rate of progression of Iraqis admitted between 2009 and 2016 in Sw eden across category -of-admission groups. Iraqi labour immigrants, who need a job contract to be admitted in Sweden, are expected to enter the labour market at a lower occupational level. While for other groups I expect that most occupational mobility occu rs during the first years after admission, labour immigrants should experience little progression during the first four years as their residency permit remains conditional on being employed. Refugees and their family, who benefit from language courses and integration programs, are expected to experience the greatest progression. The categorical distinctions drawn based on the initial context of migration are thereby expected to durably ease the labour market integration of certain groups while hampering the process for others. 84 Paradoxes of Social Mobility in London Richard Breen , Jung In Nuffield College University of Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract Social mobility in London, when compared with rest of the UK, is characterised by (a) high rates of upwar d mobility, (b) social fluidity among people raised in London is about average but is low among those who currently live there, and (c) high rates of in - and out -migration. We consider three paradoxes. First, how do we explain the lower fluidity of Londo n as a destination than an origin? Second, how is it that absolute mobility is high but relative mobility is low? The third paradox follows from a widely reported result in studies of social mobility, namely that social fluidity is greater among people w ith higher levels of education. Yet, the proportion of people with a University degree is higher among people living in London than in any other region. How is this compatible with its relatively low social fluidity? We use restricted Labour Force Surve y data to address these paradoxes. Mobility and Methods (II) - Session 2 11:20 - 13:00 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 2. Wolfson Theatre Session 2 85 A Comprehensive Assessment of Census Record Linking Methods: Comparing Deterministic, Probabilistic and Machine Learning Approaches for the Study of Intergenerational Mobility Fangqi Wen1, Jung In2, Richard Breen2 1Australian National University, Canberra, Australia. 2Nuffield College, University of Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract 19th century Britain should be of great interest to students of intergenerational social mobility. Census data provide the best way of gaining comprehensive and detailed information about mobility in this period. We investigate a range of methods for linking o bservations across censuses: exact matching, probabilistic matching, and machine learning (ML) approaches. We draw 50 samples of 2% of men aged 0 - 19 from the 1851 census and try to link them to men aged 30 -49 in the 1881 census. We derive the upper bound s on the matching rate and we evaluate the methods in terms of their matching rate and the representativeness of the matched data. We use our preferred methods to perform full census linking. We compare estimates of intergenerational mobility from the 2% s amples with the full census estimate. Probabilistic matching using the fastLink method (Enamorado, et al 2019) performs very well, as do some ML approaches. 406 Unfair Educational Inequality in 99 Countries: A Theoretically Driven Machine Learning Approa ch Paolo Brunori1, Carlos G. Hernandez2, Moris Triventi3 1London School of Economics, London, United Kingdom. 2Joint Research Centre, Seville, Spain. 3University of Trento, Trento, Italy Abstract Although social stratification research has extensively scrutinized the degree of educational inequality over generations, time, and countries, in our view, this literature faces three limitations: 1) The theoretical and normative conceptualization of (in)equality of educational opportunity (IOP) is unsystematic; 2) previous research analyzed single individual circumstances (i.e., parental education, income or occupational class) while disregarding their interactions and cumulative consequences for educational attainment; and 3) it mainly covered dev eloped Western countries. This work aims to overcome these limitations by providing a theoretically informed analysis of unfair inequalities in students' academic performance drawing from John Roemer's (1998) normative theory of equal educational opportuni ty. We draw information from a pooled large dataset comprising all waves of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) (OECD 2021) across 99 countries worldwide from 2000 to 2018. To estimate IOP, we adopt a novel approach using machine learni ng algorithms \u2014transformation trees and bagging \u2014 to assess the relative weight (and interaction) of a more extensive set of ascriptive circumstances than previous research. This approach allows as to avoid underestimating inequality and rank circumstances cross -nationally and over time. We illustrate our formalization and estimation of Roemer's IOP in education for the case of the Netherlands, where we identify 9 types \u2014groups of individuals characterized by the same circumstances \u2014, and country of birth as t he most relevant circumstance in driving unfair educational inequality. 273 A novel examination of trends in vertical and horizontal inequalities in higher education: A large scale cross -national analysis Guido Salza , Moris Triventi University of Trento, Trento, Italy Abstract In recent decades there has been an overall expansion in enrolment to tertiary education in all economically developed countries. This trend allowed lower social background students to enter higher education to a greater extent than in the past, leading to a moderate decline in vertical inequalities in higher education attainment (Shavit et al. 2007). However, the effects of the HE expansion on horizontal inequalities remain unclear. This work aims to propose a nov el test of two classical theses about long -term trends in educational inequality: the maximally maintained inequality (MMI) hypothesis and the effectively maintained inequality (EMI) thesis. We will formally test whether social inequalities in tertiary edu cation attainment begin to decline only once participation rates among upper -class children reach a 'saturation level' and whether the reduction in vertical inequalities is paralleled by a growth of horizontal inequalities in graduation from different fiel ds of study. To this aim, we have built a novel cross - national dataset pooling together data from various surveys. Our analytical sample size ranges between 156,502 and 510,193 cases, including 44 countries and birth cohorts from 1950 to 1986. We propose a n original analytical design to investigate these issues in a cross -national perspective. We first rely on entropy -based measures to understand how social background categories are distributed across different fields of study in each combination of country and birth cohort. We then rely on meta -analytical techniques to pool together the estimates obtained in the first step and analyze their variation as a function of time and other macro -level covariates. This work has the potential to provide new insights on the long -term variation in social inequalities in education, the interplay between vertical and horizontal educational inequalities, and advance the application of quantitative methods to investigate these phenomena. 347 The multiverse of social cla ss schemes: a large -scale analysis of the explanatory power of ten alternative class schemes for social stratification research Carlos S. Barones1, Hertel H. Florian2, Smallenbroek D. Oscar1 1Sciences Po, Paris, France. 2Hamburg University, Hamburg, Germany Abstract While class analysis plays a central role in social stratification research, a systematic comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of current class schemes is missing. Our study compares ten class schemes across thirteen outcome s covering four research domains (education, labor market success, values and political preferences). We therefore ask to what extent social class schemes differ in the ability to map and explain the substantive variation of objective positions and subject ive attitudes relating to social class observable across societies. In particular, we compare (1) their predictive power and (2) their discriminant power, i.e. the ability to identify distinctive groups. Our analysis draws on data from ESS R1 -R9, ISSP2010 -2017 and EVS1999/2008 to incorporate as many countries as possible. In a first step, we study the pooled data of 24 countries. Depending on the outcome, analysis samples range from 80.521 to 470.192 observations. In a second step, we provide country estima tes for ten countries with sufficiently large samples. Our results indicate that, while EGP and ESEC are the most widely used class schemes in stratification research, they are systematically outperformed by other class schemes across most outcomes and fi t measures, including measures like the BIC that place a strong premium on parsimony. Our results thus invite social stratification researchers to reconsider the prominence that is traditionally accorded to these class schemes. Moreover, the EGP - MP and E SEC-MP variants separating managers and professionals systematically outperform the standard versions of these schemes, thus challenging the supposed homogeneity of the Goldthorpian service class. The two micro -level class schemes (Grusky's and ESEG -REV) d isplay the best model fit for a majority of outcomes, but for political outcomes and values the Oesch scheme is highly competitive. Hence, the right level of aggregation is to some extent also dependent on the outcome under study. 75 Social Mobility as C ausal Intervention Lai Wei , Yu Xie Princeton University, Princeton, USA Abstract Mobility effect has been an important subject of study for sociologists since the birth of the research area on social mobility. Empirical investigations of individual mobilit y effects, however, have been hindered by one fundamental limitation, that is the unidentifiability of mobility effect holding origin and destination constant. Given this fundamental limitation, we propose to reconceptualize mobility effects from the micro to the macro level. We ask alternative research questions about macro -level mobility effect: what happens to the population distribution of an outcome if we manipulate the mobility regime, that is, if we redistribute social destinations based on social or igin. The proposed method bridges the macro and micro agendas in social stratification research, and has wider applications in social stratification beyond the study of mobility effect. We illustrate the method with an analysis of the impact of social mobi lity on health in the United States. Home Ownership, Housing and Wealth - Session 2 11:20 - 13:00 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 3. Alumni Theatre Session 2 117 Four Decades of Racial Disparities in Housing Affordability Across U.S. Metropolitan Areas: A New Normative Approach. Or Cohen Raviv1, Danny Ben Shahar2, Stuart Gabriel3 1University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany. 2Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. 3UCLA, Los Angeles, USA Abstract Housing assets play a key role in the household wealth portfolio and in inter -generational wealth transmission. Yet, the study and measurement of housing affordability in the context of racial -ethnic inequality in the US has received only limited attention. Moreover, current measures of ho using affordability often suffer from an inherent bias that results from the positive correlation between income and housing expenses. We propose a new normative approach for measuring housing affordability that corrects for this bias by assessing the cost of housing consumption based on fundamental demographic, locational, and time characteristics. We employ data from the biennial American Housing Survey (AHS) along four decades (18 waves between 1985 -2019), using both the National survey (including more than 665K observations in 141 MSAs) and the Metropolitan survey (including about 500k Observations in 30 MSAs). Findings show that the traditional housing affordability measures, as compared to our normative approach, underestimate housing affordability bur den for minority groups compared to Whites, across all four decades. Furthermore, affordability distress among minority groups has increased in the past two decades. Also, no significant differences were found between Asians and Whites using both tradition al and normative measures. When interacting race with other demographic characteristics (gender and academic education), we consistently find the traditional affordability measures underestimated the gaps among Black and Whites. Our results shed new light on the racial discrepancies that underlie the housing market in the US, which may serve policy -makers in promoting affordability in those areas where it is most needed. 96 The Polarization of Real Estate Ownership and Increasing Wealth Inequality in Spai n Diederik Boertien , Antonio L\u00f3pez Gay Center for Demographic Studies (CED), Barcelona, Spain Abstract Research on the drivers of wealth inequality has mainly focused on processes that increase wealth accumulation at the very top of the distribution. But, recent cross -national research has emphasized how the distribution of housing wealth is an important determinant of levels of wealth inequality. In this paper, we extend this argument by studying whether changes in housing wealth contribute to increasing w ealth inequality over time. We use detailed data from the Spanish survey Encuesta Financiera de Familias to understand increasing wealth inequality between 2002 and 2017. We show how real estate ownership is becoming increasingly polarized: both the share of households without any properties as well as the share of households with multiple properties is increasing. Decomposition analyses show that the increasing ownership of multiple properties, particularly those over which households receive rent, is an important channel through which wealth inequality increased over time. 393 Keeping up with the Muellers: Housing Inequality and Status Competition in Germany Nora Waitkus1,2, Olaf Groh -Samberg3 1London School of Economics, London, United Kingdom. 2Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands. 3University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany Abstract This paper seeks to analyse how rising economic inequality fosters status competitive behaviour in Germany. Follo wing research on the USA we focus on housing as a \"relational good\" signalling social status. Drawing on data from the German Socio -economic Panel (1990 -2018) we show that average housing size has increased across socioeconomic groups but particularly at t he top of the distribution. Particularly the income rich in large cities are pulling away, but also mid income groups are increasing their relative housing sizes to a substantial degree. In large cities and amongst two adult with children households these developments are particulalry strong. To further test the hypotheses that increasing housing size can be taken as indication for a \"positional arms race\" amongst middle and upper classes, we analyse the impact of absolute versus relative house size on sat isfaction with housing. While we observe some variation regarding the level of satisfaction with current residence, we find that relative housing position is more strongly associated with levels of satisfaction than the absolute size of housing. We further investigate how levels of satisfaction are changing when classes move into a new dwelling. 385 House Price Inequality and Political Efficacy Matthias Haslberger , Mads A Elkjaer, Ben Ansell Nuffield College, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract A chronic housing shortage and surging house prices have become a major political issue in the United Kingdom and other countries. This paper investigates how perceptions of and information about inequality in house prices affect individuals' internal and external political efficacy, using new data from a large representative survey experiment that was administered in England and Wales. Previous research has established that people generally underestimate the extent of inequality in their community, and th at high inequality undermines political participation of disadvantaged groups. Therefore, we hypothesise that less affluent respondents exhibit lower political efficacy and that experimentally exposing respondents to information about inequality in house p rices at the local or national level reduces their political efficacy, especially among people who do not own their house. We find that respondents who own (more valuable) houses report higher political efficacy, while those who are more concerned about i nequality exhibit lower efficacy. However, informing respondents about the extent of inequality in house prices does not reduce external efficacy, and the effect on internal efficacy is positive. Moreover, we show striking heterogeneous effects. Non -owners have significantly lower internal efficacy than homeowners, but the gap vanishes when they are shown local house prices compared to the national distribution. This effect is particular to housing; it does not translate to other measures of affluence. These findings suggest that arguments which link perceptions of inequality and reduced political participation, may not apply to the housing market. Thus, our paper highlights the salience of the housing market for political behaviour and outcomes. Culture, Family and Migration - Session 2 11:20 - 13:00 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 4. Thai Theatre Session 2 185 Culture portability from origin to destination country. The gender division of domestic work among migrants in Italy. Elisa Brini1, Anna Zamberlan2, Paolo Barbieri2 1University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. 2University of Trento, Trento, Italy Abstract Gender inequality in the division of household labour persists over time. Whether this is the result of structural constraints or of cultural prefe rences originating from traditional gender norms remains an open question. We investigate the role of culture in explaining gender asymmetries in housework and childcare tasks. Through multilevel models based on microlevel data (the Istat SCIF survey), we examine the extent to which the division of household labour in migrant couples living in Italy relates to gender equity in their origin country, proxied by the Global Gender Gap Index. We also examine whether age at, or time since, migration affects cultu ral assimilation. We find visible gender differences in both the division of household labour and partners' involvement in different tasks. Most interestingly, migrants from more gender -equal countries display more equality in the division of unpaid labour , and vice versa. This result holds for migrants who were socialised in their country of origin, i.e., arrived in Italy when 18 or older, while no systematic variation is found among individuals born or socialised in Italy. This might suggest the presence of effective cultural assimilation mechanisms. Culture contributes to gender inequality in the intra -couple division of unpaid labour, yet nonnegligible differences exist between different housework and childcare tasks. Our study adds both to the literatur e on the cultural component of gender inequalities and to studies about migrants and cultural assimilation. 262 Acculturation to Gender Norms: Employment Trajectories by Migrant Origin after the Transition to Parenthood in Finland Elina Kilpi -Jakonen1, Sandra Buchler2 1University of Turku, Finland. 2Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany Abstract Employing the transition from parenthood back to the labour market as a proxy, we examine how children of immigrants acculturate to the gender norms of the countr y of destination. In order to look at processes of acculturation and variations therein, we analyse differences according to generational status, including age at migration, length of residence, as well as country of origin. To explain differences between groups, we control for other correlates associated with the length of parental leave, including employment before the birth and education level. Taking a couple -level perspective, we also examine the migration status and other characteristics of the father . Full population register data from Statistics Finland is used to analyse first births occurring between 1995 and 2015 to partnered women born between 1975 and 1995. Initial findings show that our expectations regarding acculturation are confirmed: the se cond generation tends to be closest to the majority, followed by the childhood migrants, while the largest differences are observed among the youth migrants. We find that education and employment are important for explaining differences in return to employ ment. Women with foreign -born partners are slower to return to employment after a first birth, but if they do their pay relative to their pre -birth pay tends to be higher, highlighting the importance of conducting couple -level research. 340 Restoring Cu lture and Capital to Cultural Capital: Origin -Destination Cultural Distance and Immigrant Earnings in the United States QIAN HE1, Theodore P. Gerber2, Yu Xie1 1Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA. 2University of Wisconsin -Madison, Madison, WI, USA Abstract An extensive literature in sociology has argued that cultural capital plays a pivotal role in perpetuating social inequalities. However, empirical tests of this proposition have primarily examined its influences on educational outcomes, n ot earnings, and they tend to define cultural differences in class -based terms, with the few analyses of labor market rewards limited to studies of hiring decisions, performance assessments, and job dismissals for elite jobs. We propose testing whether cul tural capital yields economic returns in labor markets by evaluating the influence of the cultural distance between immigrants' origin countries and the United States on their earnings. We consistently find earnings penalties for origin -U.S. cultural dista nce using the American Community Survey and the National Survey of College Graduates. Earnings penalties associated with cultural distance vary by immigrants' level of education, type of highest educational qualification, and age at migration to the U.S. A part from establishing that cultural capital renders monetary returns in labor markets, our findings help illuminate the uneven earnings penalties for immigrants, especially those with at least a bachelor's degree. 157 The Demographic and Socioeconomic Consequences of Restricting Access to Marriage for Young Migrants in Denmark Bojana Cuzulan1, Peter Fallesen2,1, Marie L. Schultz -Nielsen1 1ROCKWOOL Foundation, Denmark. 2Stockholm University, Sweden Abstract We investigate the effect of age -restricting immigrants' access to marry spouses from abroad on marriage behavior, fertility, and human capital accumulation. We exploit a Danish policy that imposed substantial constraints on the possibility of marriage mig ration for immigrants below 24 years of age originating from countries with high historical rates of marriage migration. Using a regression kink/discontinuity design with birth date as the assignment variable, we find that limiting access to marriage migra tion has pronounced postponement effects on age at entry into marriage and age at transition til parenthood. However, we find no effect of the reform on employment, educational attainment, or earnings. In total, our findings indicate no direct relationship between early family formation and development and return to human capital. 184 Fatherhood mechanisms in migration: Links between father presence and children's psychological well -being in Chinese migrant families Yan Zhang University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract As China is experiencing rapid urbanisation, many workers experiencing rural poverty migrate to cities, often leaving behind their children. According to a 2017 UNICEF report, the population of left -behind children (LBC) in China has reached a staggering 69 million in 2015, with 41 million living in rural areas, accounting for 38 percent of rural children. Many LBCs do not see either of their parents for an extended period of time and the vast majority of them do not live wit h their fathers. There are positives to economically incentivised urban migration, such as improved finances, but there are also significant disadvantages. The LBCs are often found to be prone to a range of emotional and psychological issues induced by par ental separation. However, research regarding the presence of fathers and children's psychological distress remains nascent. Many studies often associate a great amount of responsibility of childrearing with the mothers, and little with the fathers, which is likely due to the traditional gender norms in rural China. In addition, discussion of the distinction between the two mechanisms of fatherhood - migrant fathers and left -behind fathers, is also lacking. The left -behind fathers, who often assume traditio nally considered \"mothering\" roles to varying degrees and play an important role as left -behind carers, are not well understood. A two -wave data analysis was conducted using data from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) and a structural equation modelling ( SEM) design with latent variables. The study mainly evaluates whether high father presence, relative to low father presence, accounts for the variance in the levels of psychological distress for each LBC group. The study finds that children with migrant mo thers appear to be the worst -off in psychological well -being. Father presence is found to be a statistically significant predictor of children's psychological wellbeing, but only when the fathers are migrant workers. Education, Inequality and Mobility - Session 2 11:20 - 13:00 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 5. NAB 1.07 Session 2 367 Like Father, Like Child: Social Reproduction in the French Grandes \u00c9coles throughout the 20th Century St\u00e9phane Benveniste Aix-Marseille School of Economics, France Abstract Educational systems expanded over the 20th century in developed countries, and while most scholars found that it promoted social mobility, some argue that the top of the social hierarchy remains shielded over generations. In France, the most prest igious Grandes \u00c9coles are elite institutions for higher education. They constitute the main pathway to top positions in the public and private sectors. The present work provides the first results on intergenerational social reproduction in these schools ov er more than a century. We construct an exhaustive nominative dataset of 224,264 graduate students from ten of the leading Grandes \u00c9coles , spanning over five cohorts born between 1866 and 1995. We develop a new methodology within the literature using surnames to track lineages and find that families from ancient aristocratic lineage, Parisians, as well as descendants of graduates are highly over-represented in the top Grandes \u00c9coles , throughout the 20th century. Across cohorts, children of Grandes \u00c9coles ' graduates are 72 to 154 times more likely to be admitted, and up to 450 times to the exact same school than their father. This advantage a ppears remarkably stable for all cohorts born since 1916 and persists across multiple generations, emphasizing the existence of a \"glass floor\" for the French elites. 421 To who do you refer? Studying the effect of status on educational inequality. William Foley EUI, Florence, Italy Abstract Abstract There are big payoffs, pecuniary and otherwise, to a university education. Yet it is well -documented that working class students do not attend university at the same rate as their higher class peers, even when they have the same academic performance. I propose an explanation, based on status theory, for educational inequality at the school -touniversity transition. Status theory suppose that high -status groups - such as higher class people - benefit from prevalent cultural beliefs that they are generally more competent than average; whereas those from low status groups - such as the working class - are supposed to be less competent than average. But status is hard to measure, and it is difficult to identify or induce exogeneous shifts in status which might explain social outcomes. This paper builds a causal strategy based on the concept of a reference group - a group of people that an individual compares themselves to in order to fix their own rel ative position. Because people's estimate of their own socioeconomic position relies partly on where they stand in relation to their peers, exogeneous shifts in their reference group can lead to exogeneous shifts in their subjective social class and, there fore, their subjective status. This paper presents two studies based on the reference group strategy, one quasi -experimental, and the other fully experimental. The results, consistent with the reference group hypothesis, show that being placed in a higher class reference group does indeed negatively affect expectations of attending university. However, this effect is only found for lower class students. 16 Does More Schooling Lead to Less or More Inequality of Educational Opportunity? Michael Gr\u00e4tz Unive rsity of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden Abstract Critical theories of education but also the dynamics of skill formation model predict that the education system reproduces educational inequalities. Contrary to this hypothesis, empirical studies comparing the change in inequalities in academic performance over the summer to the change in these inequalities during the school year, have argued that schooling reduces inequalities in educational performance. The present study sheds new light on the question whether schooling affects educational inequalities by analyzing a natural experiment, which induces exogenous variation in the length of schooling, and allows us to investigate the causal, long -term effects of the leng th of schooling on educational inequalities. Some German states moved the school start from spring to summer in 1966/1967. These states introduced two short school years, which were each three months shorter than regular school years. We use variation in t he short school years across cohorts and states to estimate the causal effects of the length of schooling on inequalities in educational attainment using two German panel surveys. Less schooling due to the short school years did not affect inequalities in educational attainment. This finding runs counter to the results from the summer learning literature but also to the predictions of the dynamics of skill formation model and critical theories of education. We conclude by discussing the implications of this finding for our understanding of inequality of educational opportunity. 106 The influence of structural and relative changes in educational inequalities in Spain Ildefonso Marqu\u00e9s 3Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain Abstract In this communication we analyse trends in the structural and relative dimensions of educational inequality in Spain, that is, the relationship between social origin and educational attainment, in the period 1940 -1981 We employ a measure, the Mutual Information Index, which allows us to simultaneously observe and distinguish educational changes due both to educational expansi on and parental occupational upgrading (the structural effect) and to relative opportunities in controlling for the structural effect (the relative effect) net of educational inequality rates. Two hypotheses are formulated and corroborated. The first affir ms that, as new cohorts are incorporated, there is an improvement in educational opportunities, and the second that this improvement is due to changes in the structure and not to the relative effect, contradicting the usual conclusions of origin -education analyses. Our results point to a reduction in educational inequalities in the younger cohorts. This evidence, therefore, does not support the view that only the entry into modernity, experienced by Spain with particular intensity and acceleration, led to a n improvement in educational inequalities. According to the data collected, this progress continues to take place, albeit as a result of structural changes. 190 Effect of Paternal and Maternal Grandparents' Education on Children's Educational Attainment: The Case of Japan Aguru Ishibashi Senshu University, Kawasaki, Japan Abstract This study scrutinizes the differential effects of paternal and maternal grandparents' education on children's educational attainment using a novel method that combines structural equation modeling and multiple imputation of a representative dataset in Japan. Most of the previous three -generation mobility studies did not consider both lineages. Although a few studies analyzed four grandparents simultaneously, they covered only Western societies, and the results were mixed. Thus, it is worth examining East Asian societies such as Japan, which has a cultural difference in family systems from Western counterparts. Methodologically, we employed SEM with multiple imputation to overcome serious estimation biases in previous studies, which used OLS regressions to ignore missing information on grandparents' education. A representative Japanese dataset in 2006 with an analytical sample of 1,966 children showed that maternal grandpar ents' education directly affects children's educational attainment. This was robust even when education was measured by credentials instead of years of schooling or using another dataset. This paper makes a major contribution by highlighting the salience o f maternal genealogy in multigenerational mobility by the simultaneous estimation of paternal and maternal grandparents. The difference between the findings of this study, which used Japanese data, and those of the previous studies, which were located in W estern societies, might be attributed to cultural differences in family systems. The methodological contribution of this study is that while the previous studies omitted missing values, possibly leading to biased results, we introduced SEM with multiple imputation to realize less -biased estimation in the three -generation mobility studies. Work, Ethnicity and Migration - Session 2 11:20 - 13:00 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 6. NAB 1.15 Session 2 398 Disadvantages over the career: sickness absence among female immigrants in low -skilled jobs Elisabeth Ugreninov Oslo Metropolitan University, Oslo, Norway Abstract It is well documented that the immigrant populations in Europe have comparably poorer health and a higher health related absence from work than the native working populations. Some explanations are related to stressful migration itself and exposure of disadvantages in the destination country. Others, indica te that immigrants are healthier than the native -born population upon arrival in the new host country, also known as the healthy immigrant effect. To what extent, and where in the integration process immigrants' health may deteriorates is less understood. This study extends the current knowledge by focusing on lower educated female immigrants working within eight occupations where few formal skills are needed and examines the immigrant -native gap in sickness absence and the development of immigrants' sickne ss absence during their working career in the new host country (Norway). The study uses administrative register data with a total sample of 261 291 native women and 9 251 female immigrants, refugees or family reunited, who immigrated from non -EU countries (3356), Africa (1556), Asia (4082), or South and Central America (257) to Norway in the period from 2004 until 2008. The probability of sickness absence after years in work among natives and immigrants are following the same trend the first five years, the reafter the native -immigrant gap has an inverse U -shape, indicating that the difference between immigrants and natives decreases at the end of the ten -years period. The main reason for the decrease is driven by a lower sickness absence among natives with m any years in work, which might be due to a positive health selection. As immigrants are following the same pattern as natives, our preliminary results suggest that the increase in sickness absence are more affected by working conditions and individual fact ors than the healthy immigrant effect . 320 A dynamic perspective on ethnic inequalities in unemployment in Sweden Unit, Stockholm, Sweden. 3European University Institute, Fiesole, Italy Abstract A large body of research has aimed to understand the mechanisms driving ethnic and racial inequalities in unemployment. To the best of our know ledge, research has mainly focused on barriers to unemployment exit (i.e., becoming employed) and not many studies have focused on the role of unemployment entry. In this study, we take a dynamic perspective on ethnic inequalities in unemployment and contr ibute to the debate by examining inequalities in entry and exit from unemployment across second -generation immigrant groups and natives in Sweden. This marks an important extension to existing research because we are able to shed light on the extent to whi ch barriers to employment and the likelihood to lose a job contribute to inequalities in unemployment. Analyses are based on Swedish total population registers (Immigrant Trajectories Dataset). Correlated random - effects dynamic logit models are used to e stimate group -specific unemployment entry and exit probabilities and to derive long -term steady -state probabilities (SSP). In addition, we estimate counterfactual SSP according to two scenarios in which second generation immigrants have 1) natives' unemplo yment entry probabilities and 2) native's unemployment exit probabilities. Such counterfactuals allow to shed light on the most relevant dynamic in accounting for the ethnic unemployment gap. Our results show that equalizing unemployment exit does not redu ces unemployment inequality between second - generation immigrant groups and natives in Sweden. This result is against the idea that sees employer discrimination as the most important mechanism. On the contrary, equalizing unemployment entry reduces inequali ties in unemployment to a great extent. This points towards differences in precariousness to be a likely mechanism at work. 329 Does self -employment in home -country affect self -employment after migration? Evidence from Italy and Spain Ivana Fellini, Floriane Bolazzi Universit\u00e0 Milano -Bicocca, Italy Abstract Among the hypotheses that explain differences in immigrants' self -employment rates across host countries and by ethnic groups (e.g., co -ethnic social capital, blocked mobility, struc ture of opportunities), the home -country self - employment hypothesis (HCSE) states that immigrants from countries where self -employment is widespread are more likely to become self -employed after migration. Despite some consent, the studies which explore th is relation are few and evidence is controversial. In this paper, we aim to assess whether pre -migration self -employment affects post-migration employment and self -employment chances in Italy and Spain, two countries with similar characteristics and migrat ion histories. We exploit pre - and post -migration information on a sample of 7 545 immigrants in Italy and 8 805 in Spain, derived from two national surveys on the foreign population. In a first step, we estimate the influence of having been self -employed in the home country on the probability of both being employed rather than unemployed, and self -employed rather than employee in the host country, controlling for individual characteristics. We find that while pre -migration self -employment does not affect t he unemployment risk, it positively affects the probability of being self -employed. However, the differences across origin areas are negligible. As this contradicts the HCSE hypothesis, in a second step, we estimate the relation between the home -country se lf- employment rate and the probability to be self -employed both pre and post migration, controlling for home -country characteristics (e.g., income level, the size of informal employment). No evidence of a significant relation is found, in contrast with the HCSE hypothesis, suggesting that the individual experience matters more than the diffusion of self - employment. 108 How Do Immigrants Compete with Natives in the Labor Market? A Distributional Approach to Spatial, Occupational, and Workplace Dynamics JooHee Han , Are S Hermansen University of Oslo, Norway Abstract Whether immigration deteriorates natives' labor market status has long been debated. One missing piece in the puzzle of the current literature is that how the labor markets adjust to immigration through firms, where immigrant - native gaps in wages and jobs are generated and contested. We ask a slightly different question: How do natives' positions in wage distribution change with immigrant inflows at the municipality, the occupational ( national), and at the workplace level? Analyzing the Norwegian Registry data between 1997 and 2018 that cover the entire employments, we find that natives' wage distribution shifted upwardly along with the shift of increasing immigrant shares in employment across municipalities, occupations, and establishments. Further unconditional quantile regression analyses reveal that immigrant inflows lead to higher wage percentile ranks for natives, net of individual, firm level, and municipality attributes. The effe cts are the largest within workplaces and followed by national -occupation groups, and by within -municipalities. The upward shifts of natives' wage percentile ranks are mainly driven by low -skilled immigrants, whereas the influx of high -skilled immigrants c onversely pushes natives' wage percentile ranks down. While earlier studies find that immigration reduces intergenerational mobility by suppressing native wages at the bottom of distribution, we find the opposite dynamics that immigrant influx shifts nativ e wage distributions upwardly, which suggests that immigration, particularly low -skilled, may increase natives' intergenerational mobility. 232 Intersecting Inequalities? Stratification by Class, Race and Gender in Europe Florian R Hertel Universit\u00e4t Ham burg, Hamburg, Germany Abstract The presentations studies intersectional inequalities by race, gender and occupational position in 10 West European countries. The question is whether it is possible to (1) identify intersectional locations with regard to ra ce and gender in the European occupational structure and (2) whether poverty risks differ between individuals in these positions. To study these questions, I combined data from two surveys of white and Black Europeans for 10 West European countries. In bot h empirical analyses, I first study bivariate associations before studying intersectional group differences. Intersectional occupational differences are studied with loglinear models, whereas differential poverty risks are described based on regressions to account for sociodemographic differences between groups. The results yield that the European social structure is characterized by different intersectional locations in which occupational positions and status group membership most frequently coincide. Pove rty risks, furthermore, are not only differentially distributed between racialized groups but differ in intersectional locations also between racialized and genderized groups. In any case, I find evidence for a racialized and genderized hierarchy within th e studied European countries. Covid19 and Subjective Wellbeing - Session 2 11:20 - 13:00 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 7. NAB 2.14 Session 2 147 Perceived Conditions and Subjective Well -Being in Times of COVID - 19 among the Youth. The Moderating Role of Social Background Roger Fernandez -Urbano , Robin Samuel University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg Abstract This article investigates the relationship between perceptions of current conditions and subjective well -being among the youth population during the COVID -19 pandemic, using panel date from Luxembourg. It analyses how this relationship plays out across different social backgrounds. Luxembourg is a relevant setting because although being one of the highest GDP per capita countries in the world and one of the happiest, it has one of the highest percentages of working poor in the EU (i.e. 19%) the majority of them between 18 and 24 years old. Our results show that perceived conditions matter beyond objective micro and macroeconomic aspects. Contrary to our initial expectations, our results show the existence of a strong correlation between perceptions of conditions and subj ective well-being for high and low social background individuals and a weak and insignificant one for middle social background individuals. Furthermore, our results suggest that the relationship between perceptions and subjective well-being vary in the sam e way in the short and mid -term (i.e. differences in levels but not in slopes) for all the population as well as within each social group. The article stipulates several potential explanations for these results and present avenues for future research. 154 Social inequalities in Young People's Mental Health During the Covid -19 Pandemic: UCL, London, United Kingdom Abstract The Covid -19 pandemic disproportionately affected young people aged 16 to 25 years and has brought about a major increase in mental health problems. Although there is persisting evidence regarding SES differences in mental health status, there is still little knowledge of the processes linking SES to young peop le's mental health, in particular during the current pandemic. Guided by a stress process model this study examines the role of different psychosocial resource factors in mitigating the vulnerability to mental distress among disadvantaged young people. The research draws on a nationally representative longitudinal sample of 16 to 25 year -olds who participated in the Youth Economic Activity and Health (YEAH) online survey conducted in the UK between February and July 2021. Mental health was measured as a mul tidimensional construct, including assessments of negative (Hopkins Symptom Checklist) and positive (Warwick Edinburgh scale) affect, as well as life satisfaction. Socio -economic disadvantage was indicated by parental education and experiences of childhood poverty. Experience of stress was indicated by financial strain. Resource factors included indicators of optimism, self -efficacy, and social support. We controlled for age, gender, and economic activity of the young person (being in education, employment or NEET). The findings suggest sequential mediating processes where SES influences are partially mediated via financial strain and a range of psychosocial resource factors, which in turn also showed independent effects supporting mental health. There were differences in pathways linking SES to positive versus negative affect, highlighting the importance to differentiate clearly the dimensions of mental health, and to consider the role of multiple resource factors instead of single aspects to gain a more com prehensive understanding of the processes linking SES to young people's mental health. 166 Happiness in the midst of pandemic: Changes of subjective wellbeing in the Czech Republic Jan Klus\u00e1ek Sociology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic Abstract Using data from the Czech Household Panel Survey, this paper raises the question of who experienced the largest shifts in wellbeing during the COVID -19 pandemic and which factors contributed to faster recuperation. Despite evidence of the general decline in individuals' wellbeing during the COVID -10 pandemic, existing research does not provide a clear answer of who was most affected by this health crisis, how long -term the effect is, and whether the relative importance of various character istics changed in the post -COVID -19 situation. In particular, the existing research neglected the situation in the post -communist countries despite the fact that their population might be particularly vulnerable due to lower standards of living or lower tr ust in public institutions. The very preliminary results demonstrate that the onset of the pandemic was closely linked to a decline in subjective wellbeing. However, there was a high level of heterogeneity in the effects of pandemics. In particular, those who were forced to suspend their work activity were negatively affected, and suspending economic activity was especially hurtful for men and younger individuals. In contrast, there was no significant difference among those whose work situation has not chan ged, who started to work on home office or stop working because of the care allowance (i.e., provision for working parents taking care of children staying at home due to school closure). 46 The effect of material hardship on emotional wellbeing among peo ple in poverty during COVID -19 Alisa C Lewin , Michal Shamai, Sharon Novikov University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel Abstract This study examines the effect of material hardship on emotional well -being, focusing on the most economically vulnerable group \u2014people l iving in poverty, during a period of economic crisis. This study was carried out during the COVID -19 breakout, in Israel. Israel has an advanced public health system that was efficient in vaccinating its adult residents, but was less effective in respond ing to the economic crisis, especially among the lowest income groups. Method We conducted two waves of telephone surveys of people in poverty. Wave 1 took place from the middle of May -July 2020. Wave 2 took place in September -October 2020. We created three measures of hardship, by number, chronicity and by type. Results Our findings show that the number of hardships had a negative effect on emotional wellbeing. Our findings also point to the detrimental effects of long -term enduring hardshi p; people who, despite the crisis, succeeded in paying household expenses, both before COVID -19 and since it started, showed lower levels of emotional hardship than others. Conclusions Notwithstanding their formal and informal sources of social support, people living in ongoing poverty have few reserves to draw upon in times of crisis and they lack resources to withstand economic upheavals. Our findings show that COVID -19 increased material hardship and that material hardship affected emotional w ellbeing and that long - term material hardships has negative effects on emotional wellbeing. Policy Implications These findings show that material hardship takes an emotional toll. Policy should aim at reducing material hardship, thereby Lunch & RC28 Board Members Travel Awardees Meeting 13:00 - 14:00 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Lunch will be at the LG of NAB.

H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen1, of Turku, Turku, Finland Abstract Social mobility literature has provided extensive empirical evidence of the intergenerational transmission of social class. Although studies on careers have started to include some measures of family background, career mobility in terms of occupational transitions and how they are related to par ental class are still lacking evidence. Hence, this paper revisits the question of counter -mobility as a mechanism in the intergenerational reproduction of class positions: whether movements to and from the individual's starting class are drawn towards the parental class, and whether career movements decrease after reaching the parental class. We use Finnish register data to analyse class movements of the 2003 -2004 graduation cohorts during their first 14 years of individual careers. Results from multinomia l conditional logit regression demonstrates that career movements are drawn by the parental class across all social origins. Particularly strong impact is among those from self -employed backgrounds, whereas the middle classes are least affected. Further, i f individuals attain the same class as parents, their career movements reduce if they are in self -employed or upper service class. The results demonstrate the importance of how individual careers are steered by the family background to career mobility into maintain social reproduction of class throughout an individual's career. 303 What do we really know about social class mobility in the UK? Colin Mills University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract The conventional view is that in the UK relative rates of social mobility, viewed from a social class perspective, have fluctuated trendlessly since at least the early 1970s. But is this conclusion sustainable after we make the effort to examine all of the relevant evidence? I code data for both men and women from 28 cross -sectional surveys to a common social class schema (NS -SEC) and chart the course of change in relative mobility rates from 1963 to 2018. I then make comparisons with the patterns discovered by other scholars using similar coding procedu res but different data sources. The weight of evidence, taken at face value, seems to favour the conclusion that the association between social class origin and destination declined up to at least the beginning of the 21st Century. This is most clearly the case for men but is probably also true for women. The magnitude of the decline is quantified by a counterfactual simulation and found in some cases to be quite substantial. If this is true it is inconsistent with some the pessimistic mood of a lot of popu lar and academic commentary about social mobility in the UK. I go on to ask whether it is now time to reject the old orthodoxy or alternatively whether claims of its demise are premature and the apparent trend towards greater social fluidity merely an effe ct of data deficiencies and methodological artefacts. 195 Historical evolution of intergenerational class mobility and educational effects in urban Argentina Sandra Fachelli1, Pablo Dalle2, Jorge Ra\u00fal Argentina Abstract Our paper focuses on a first historical approach to the analysis of time variations in intergene rational class mobility over a group of survey years in urban Argentina, specifically in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (AMBA), from 1960 to 2017. Intergenerational social mobility will be analyzed according to positions in the class structure (EGP class scheme), taking into account the interviewees' class position and that of their fathers, using loglinear models and counterfactual analysis when it applies (Breen, 2010). Our findings show a social fluidity process for men but not for women. The counter factual analysis show that most of social fluidity for men is due to a reduction in direct class origin -class destination effect. No evidence of educational expansion effect was found, showing differences with its important role that has been shown in inte rnational results (Breen and M\u00fcller, 2020). This is a work in progress and its great value is that it is the first time that a research can be carried out based on a long-term perspective of social mobility, with almost all data available for a 60 yearperiod, which favors the possibility of considering counterfactual models in urban Argentina (AMBA). This meant a very hard process of rese arch and harmonization of data carried out over more than three years. A very important process of adaptation was performed, in order to translate these data to an international social mobility language in order to interact with the RC28 community. 242 Does family always come first? Social fluidity and not exploited advantages over birth cohorts of Italian women Filippo Gioachin , Anna Zamberlan University of Trento, Italy Abstract This article analyses gender differences in social mobility and in the effect of social origins on social destinations over cohorts. Most studies suggest a weaker origins -destinations association and 'perverse' fluidity for women. Less is known about the mechanisms underlying it and women's class -specific mobility patterns. W e rely on retrospective Italian data including respondents born between 1930 and 1985 who entered the labour market when aged 16 -35. We analyse ISEI and the probability to hold a part -time job through growth curve random models, further differentiating the group of women based on their fertility history. We find increased social fluidity and decreased direct effect of social origin for Italian women over career and over cohorts, compared to men. Women, especially mothers, have become increasingly more likel y to hold part -time jobs. This holds true for all classes of origin, in line with the expectation of upper -class women not exploiting background -related advantages. Women from the service - class even show downward mobility trajectories over birth cohorts an d over their careers. Elites, Distinction and Taxation - Session 3 15:30 - 16:50 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 2. Wolfson Theatre Session 3 249 \"Tagged at the Opera\": When Culture Becomes Signals of Status on Social Media Stine M\u00f8llegaard , Rikke H Rasmussen, Mads M J\u00e6ger Department of Sociology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark Abstract Theories in sociology hypothesize that people use cultural lifestyles to signal their social standing to others (Bourdieu 1984). Empirical research addresses this hypothesis by estimating associations between socioeconomic position (SEP) and cultural participation, finding that individuals in h igh SEPs tend to prefer \"highbrow\" cultural activities (e.g., opera and ballet) while those in low SEPs tend to prefer \"lowbrow\" activities (e.g., hip -hop and stand -up comedy). Although consistent with the idea people use cultural lifestyles to signal thei r social standing, this research does not analyze how people broadcast their lifestyle. In this paper, we focus on social media as a broadcast platform for signaling social standing via cultural participation. We analyze if young people are more likely to let others know they attended a cultural activity if they think this activity has high status compared to if they think it has low status. Theoretically, we argue that social media is a \"front stage\" that people use to broadcast their identity and SEP in -group, while also demarcating boundaries to out -groups. As social media are ubiquitous and important in most (young) people's everyday lives, they are instrumental in signaling identity, belonging, and group membership. We analyze new survey data in which y oung Danes reported on interest and frequency of participation in 12 cultural activities (highbrow and lowbrow), perception of the status of each activity, and whether they posted on social media that they attended each activity. We find that people are mo re likely post on social media that they attended a cultural activity if they think this activity has high status compared to if they think it has low status. Second, people from low SEPs are more concerned about signaling status via cultural participatio n than are people from high SEPs. 127 Fifty Shades of Elite Distinction? Evidence from Library Takeout for the Entire Population of Denmark Ea Denmark. 2Statistics Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark. 3The London School of Economics and Political Science, Department of Sociology, London, United Kingdom. 4University of Oxford, Department of S ocial Policy and Intervention, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract Stratification of cultural tastes have been called \"the most consistent finding in the sociology of taste\". Conventional theories assume that elites' tastes and consumption differ from those of other groups (e.g. Simmel, Veblen, Bourdieu). In this paper, we propose a falsificatory approach and study elite differentiation in cultural taste in domain where it is more unlikely to be found: Danish library takeout. We combine population -level registry data on all non - fiction books taken out from public libraries with indicators of economic and class status (wealth, income and occupation). This allows us to analyse granular measures of differentiation (e.g. preferences between popular or highbr ow genres, diversity in genre selection, takeout by popular authors etc.) while retaining a sample size that enables capturing cultural tastes among elite groups (e.g. top 1% of the wealth distribution). We find that stratification occurs primarily in term s of quantitative differentiation (high wealth groups are more likely to use libraries and takeout more books), while there is little stratification in terms of the more fine -grained qualitative measures of literary preferences. Finally, even when stratifi cation occurs, it happens across the wealth and income distributions and is not localized particularly to elite groups. 308 The UK's Global Economic Elite: an exploratory sociological study of 'non -doms' using taxation Arun United Kingdom. 2IFS, United Kingdom. 3LSE, United Kingdom Abstract Despite the widespread recognition that contemporary capitalism is highly globalised, most empirical studies continue to conc entrate on national level elites because measurement operates at the national scale. This is particularly problematic because the 'top end' earners who have been shown to play a key role in driving inequality trends are especially likely to be mobile betwe en nations. We break new ground in studying the global economic elite using de - identified administrative microdata from the full tax returns of all non -domiciled individuals who are resident in the UK but claim that their permanent home is abroad (colloqui ally known as 'non -doms'). This status effectively provides exemption from tax on overseas income and gains. Focusing on individuals who have claimed non -dom status in any year between 1997 and 2018, we present the first analysis of this elusive group, doc umenting their international ties and relating these to their income, industrial sector, and residential geography within the UK. Using sequence analysis techniques, we examine the extent to which the global economic elite are mobile in practice, versus cl aiming a foreign affiliation while being practically rooted in the UK. We also investigate the association between international mobility and various characteristics of interest, including nationality, industry, and main source of income. 156 Taxed fairl y? How differences in perception shape attitudes towards taxation Licia Bobzien1, Fabian Kalleitner2 1Hertie School, Germany. 2University of Vienna, Austria Abstract 'How would you describe taxes for those wit h high incomes today, are taxes too high or too low?' We argue that, using such survey questions on taxation preferences, past research conflates individuals' perceptions about what different individuals actually pay in taxes with what they think individua ls should pay . We argue that not differentiating between perceptions and preferences results in an overestimation of the explanatory power of self -interest since people might overestimate their own tax contributions compared to others (egocentric bias). Th is underestimation of tax burdens of others may in turn motivate individuals to prefer lower taxes for themselves. We test this argument in a three -step approach: Firstly, using the ISSP 2016, we show that individuals tend to favour lower tax rates for inc ome levels closer to their own income position. Secondly, using survey data from Austria, we show that individuals tend to overestimate their own tax burdens compared to others. Preferred tax rates for different income levels, however, are rather similar a cross income positions. Thirdly, we test whether changes in perceptions causally affect tax attitudes. Utilizing a randomly assigned information treatment on actual progressivity levels we find that high -income individuals who initially overestimated their own tax contribution, increase their willingness to contribute to the tax system after the information treatment. This study highlights the importance of tax perceptions for the formation of tax preferences and suggests that people differ more in their perceptions about who pays how much tax than in their preferences about who should pay how much tax. Changing these perceptions can influence individual attitudes towards taxation and increase high -income individuals' willingness to pay taxes. The paper c ontributes to a broader discussion about the role of other -regarding preferences, fairness concerns and self -interest in explaining preferences for redistribution. Job Tasks, Skills and the Labour Market - Session 3 15:30 - 16:50 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 3. Alumni Theatre Session 3 23 Skill-Based Technical Change and Fertility in Germany Honorata Bogusz1, Anna Matysiak1, Michaela Kreyenfeld2 1University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. 2Hertie School of Governance, Berlin, Germany Abstract Technological change has been tremendously transforming the labor markets, inducing fears of job displacement for some and creating new career opportunities for others. And even though past research found labor force participation of women and men to be an important determinant of fertility behaviors, few studies addressed fertility effects of technological change so far. This study aims at filli ng this gap. We adopt a couple approach and study how partners' exposure to skill -based technical change and the related changes in the task content of work affect first birth risk in Germany. To this end, we construct measures of analytic and interactive task intensity at the occupation level using data from the Qualifications and Career Survey of the German Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training. We link this contextual information with employment and fertility histories of couples from t he German Socio -Economic Panel (GSOEP). Event history models are used in order to model these processes. 115 Job tasks - Is there a Motherhood Penalty? Wiebke Schulz1, Gundula Zoch2 Germany. 2University of Oldenburg , Germany Abstract The transition to motherhood remains a crucial point in women's careers as mothers tend to earn less, have lower status and fewer chances for promotion than childless women. Studies so far mostly focus on labor market outcomes, e.g. wages and status; much less is known on how motherhood impacts the content of work, i.e. mothers job tasks. Job tasks describe the frequency and intensity of performed occupational tasks. A growing body of research shows their influence on inequality outcomes, however the questi on remains as to whether (1) women' job tasks change after childbirth and (2) whether changes depend on mother's educational qualifications and occupational mobility upon return to employment? By examining job tasks at the individual level with panel data we are able to detect consequences of motherhood that previous studies focusing on occupational -level might have missed. We use data of the adult cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) including a job -tasks module in a four -year inte rval (2011/12, 2015/16 and 2019/20). Results from fixed -effects models show a reduction of high-skill job tasks (e.g. analytical and managerial tasks) due to childbirth. Penalties are larger for women with lower levels of education than for women with tert iary education. Likewise, the effect of occupational mobility varies with women's education; occupational mobility decreases high -skill task mostly for low educated mothers. For highly educated mothers mobility is even associated with premiums, e.g. they e xecute more managerial tasks. These results highlight that motherhood penalties in job tasks are strongly interlinked with educational inequalities and hence might reinforce existing inequalities between highly educated women and women with less education. From a broader perspective, highlight that mothers' disadvantages in job tasks are an important mechanism for understanding how penalties regarding wage and career chances come about. 258 Detrimental labour market conditions, wage losses and types of skills Miriam Gr\u00f8nning1, Irene Kriesi1, Stefan Sacchi2 1Swiss Federal University for Vocational Education and Training, Switzerland. 2University of Bern, Switzerland Abstract Unemployment episodes and economic recession can have detrimental effects on wages at reemployment as well as on later wage development. Previous research indicates that these wage losses may not hold for all groups of workers. However, existing findings a re inconsistent. Whereas some studies find that workers with low levels of education are affected more strongly, others find opposing effects or no differences between groups. A possible explanation is that detrimental effects of unemployment and low labou r demand may depend on the type of workers' skills - and the amount of easily transferable general skills and knowledge in particular - rather than their level of education. We therefore investigate whether unemployment and low labour demand lead to wage losses after job changes and whether this relationship is moderated by the amount of general and occupations -specific skills imparted during education and training. We combine an institutional approach with human capital and job search theory, assuming tha t differences between education programmes influence diploma holders' human capital development and reservation wages. Furthermore, we include signalling theory to explain the effects of unemployment. Our analysis is based on a sample of Swiss employees wi th upper secondary VET, which is the dominant type of post -compulsory education in Switzerland. We combined the survey data with skill measures derived from occupation -specific training curricula. We address causality issues by applying an endogenous treatment effects model. The results suggests that the detrimental effect of unemployment is mainly the result of negative signalling, which is independent of individuals actual skills. Furthermore, general education and training attenuate the negative effect o f low occupation -specific labour demand on wages. In sum, unemployment seems to impact everyone similarly, independent of their skill level, while those with more general education and training seem to be better equipped to face changing labour demand. 256 The link between computer use and job satisfaction: The mediating role of job tasks and task Berlin Social Science Center, Germany. 3Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany Abstract This study investigates (1) the relationship between computer use at work and both job tasks and task discretion as well as (2) the mediating role that job tasks and t ask discretion play in the relationship between computer use and job satisfaction. By comparing these relationships in Germany and the UK, we contribute to the long -standing debate on the upskilling/deskilling nature of the use of technology and the reperc ussions of this use on the overall quality of work. We use data from the UK Skills Surveys and the BIBB/BAuA Employment Surveys and apply structural equation modelling (SEM). In line with the literature on routine -biased technological change (RBTC), our re sults suggest that computers are complementary to the performance of less routine and more abstract cognitive tasks and that this relationship is conducive to a higher level of task discretion and job satisfaction in both countries. Moreover, after account ing for differences in job tasks performed, we find a negative direct effect of computer use on both task discretion and job satisfaction in the UK but not in Germany. Our results indicate that the ultimate effect of the use of technology on both jobs and job satisfaction depends on the institutional contexts in which this technology is introduced. These contextual differences are related to the institutional arrangements and managerial practices typical of different production and skill regimes. Non-Stand ard Work - Session 3 15:30 - 16:50 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 4. Thai Theatre Session 3 357 'Equalising or Marginalising - how platform work shapes gender Europe' Stephanie Steinmetz1, Leonie Westhoff2,3, Zachary Kilhoffer4 1University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. 2Nuffield College, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. 3Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS), Brussels, Belgium. 4University of Illinois, University of Illinois Urbana - ChampaignUrban a und Champaign, USA Abstract Automation, artificial intelligence, and other technological changes of the last decades are increasingly affecting the number and quality of jobs. While technological advances often present moments of opportunity and challeng e for societies and their labor markets, research so far has hardly addressed in more detail, for whom these changes represent an opportunity and for whom they might create or enhance disadvantages. In this context, more specifically, it remains unclear wh ether women will benefit from work -related technological changes to the same extent as men. An interesting area for an in -depth gender analysis is in that regard the rapidly expanding 'gig economy' , through which people can work for pay. Using the pooled data of the Collaborative Economy and Employment (COLLEEM) survey 2017 and 2018 covering 14 EU countries, this paper contributes to the growing literature on questions related to gender vulnerabilities in the platform economy. Most significantly, it provides a first systematic analysis of the association between gender and two types of 'old' and highly gendered labor market risks: low income and inferior working conditions, which may or may not be exacerbated by platform work. Our findings reveal sig nificant gender income differences within the population of platform workers, which can be accounted for by observed individual characteristics only to a limited extent. In contrast, gender differences in working conditions within platform work are not obs erved. 151 Robots Don't Pay Taxes: 2Bocconi University, Milan, Italy. 3University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA Abstract Deindustrialization has fundamentally reshaped the economic geography of the United States. Between 1993 and 2007 alone, increasing automation \u2014the use of industrial robots to perform tasks done by human workers \u2014led to the loss of upwards of 750,000 jobs, primarily in the industrial Midwest and Northeast. Prior research demonstrates the social consequences of manufacturing's decline extend beyond its impact on workers to undermine the health and economic prospects of entire communities. But through which mechanisms? This study examines the impact of increasing automation on local government finance. Exploiting spatial variation in the adoption of industrial robots, we find each additional robot per 1,000 workers is associated with a 10 percent relative decline in local government own - source revenues, a decline that is only partially offset by intergovernmental transfers. Moreover, we find that each robot per 1,000 workers leads to an 8 percent decline in K -12 education spendin g and a 30 percent decline in health spending. Our findings provide direct evidence of an oft -theorized but rarely examined mechanism through which place directly shapes life chances. We use our theoretical framework to motivate a Fiscal Sociology of place that centers the role of fiscal structures in the production of place -based inequalities. 257 To screen or to spare: do employers use flexible contracts differently for jobs with skill University, Maastricht, Netherlands. 3Statistics Netherlands, Den Haag, Netherlands Abstract In this paper, we investigate employer strategies for using flexible employment contracts, e.g. screening or cost reduction. Previous research has studied these motives using qualitative interviews or surveys. Since employers are often neither consistent n or conscious in their strategy, we treat these strategies as a latent variable that cannot be observed directly. In addition, since employer strategies may differ across groups of employees with different tasks, we examine whether these strategies vary acr oss groups of employees. We applied latent class analysis and used a unique register dataset of Statistics Netherlands with aggregated data for all medium and large employers in 2013. Four indicators of employer strategies were used: the share of fixed -term (FTC), the share of on -call contracts, the transition rate from fixed -term to permanent contracts and excess mobility. As a proxy for task complexity, hourly wage was used to distinguish three groups of employees: low -paid, medium - paid and high -paid. Our results indicate that different strategies are used for different types of jobs. In general, employers use flexible contracts more often for low -skilled jobs. Strategies for the use of flexible contracts differ between low, medium and high paid workers: screening is most common among medium and high paid jobs, while cost reduction most common among low -paid jobs. Specifically, we identified four clusters of employers. The first cluster includes employers whose main motive for using flexible contracts w as cost reduction for low -paid jobs and screening for medium -paid jobs. The second cluster shares the attributes of the first, while screening was also the main motive for high-paid jobs. In the third cluster, screening and adaptability to demand fluctuati ons are the main employers strategies for all three wage groups. In the fourth cluster, cost reduction is the main strategy for low -paid jobs, adaptability for medium paid jobs and screening for high paid jobs. 284 Employers' adoption of a novel employm ent practice 1991 -2018:The role of labor scarcity and ideas of work -life-balance Marlis C Buchmann , Helen Buchs, Jan S M\u00fcller University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland Abstract In the 1990s, new ideas of work -life bala nce emerged in the Western World. An abundance of work practices turned up, labeled life -friendly work practices or work -life balance practices, meant to enhance work -life balance. While research has mainly targeted the consequences of these practices for workers and organizations, little is known about their development when viewed from the employer side and what might have enticed employers to embrace these practices. This study attempts to fill these gaps for one such practice: Almost -full-time work with 80 to 95% employment level. The study investigates, for Switzerland from 1991 to 2018, the adoption patterns across different areas of the labor market and their associations with labor scarcity and support for work -life-balance ideas. Variation in adopti on patterns across submarkets is inferred from the shape of the fitted curves with accelerated speed signaling social contagion (imitation) and slow speed suggesting constant accrual (independent reaction), and with scope indicating the market potential. T he study relies on diffusion theory to frame imitation; employers' independent reaction employs resource -based theory of firms and signaling theory. Job ads data come from the representative and large -scale dataset Swiss Job Market Monitor and secondary da tasets. Including 91 occupation -region groups, methods used include Bass curves calculated with a generic algorithm (GA), k means clustering of Bass curves, and linear regression analyses (MM robust OLS with robust SE) on Bass curve parameters. Findings sh ow that the adoption patterns vary in speed and scope across submarkets. The confluence of the increase in labor scarcity and support for work -life balance ideas is associated with accelerated speed of adoption, indicating that employers imitate each other and with a larger market potential. These results demonstrate that considering more than one mechanism or pathway through which innovations spread, which is seldom done, yields insightful evidence into the adoption process. Gender Inequality, Promotion and Productivity - Session 3 15:30 - 16:50 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 5. NAB 1.07 Session 3 98 Does gender parity foster collaboration? Trends in gender homophily in scientific Prieto, I\u00f1aki \u00dacar University Carlos III of Madrid, Madrid, Spain Abstract Jobs are increasingly becoming gender neutral. But is gender parity enough to eradicate homophilic behavior and foster gender integration in the workplace? The accelerated entry of women into male -dominated occupations has led to two competing predictions for trends in gender collaboration. On the one hand, the intergroup contact hypothesis holds that \u2014under certain conditions \u2014contact between two groups can promote tolerance and acceptance. Accordingly, higher collaboration rates between men and women would emerge in gender - neutral environments. A contrary possibility is that declining inequality among groups can create competitive conflict or personnel inertia, as well as gi ve rise to exclusionary practices like homophilic behavior, homo -social reproduction or tokenism. We use data from the Web of Science to examine to what extent women's increasing presence across all research fields has fostered gender collaboration in the academia. We have collected data from all published articles from 1980 to 2019. In total, 15.642 journals and 111.980.858 authorships in over 250 research areas. Networking and collaboration are both instrumental in reducing the research productivity gende r gap and improving women's academic career advancement. Consequently, we must understand gender homophily in scientific collaborations in order to design and implement effective actions to promote labor integration between men and women. Results reveal th at, paradoxically, equity in the sex composition of research areas is related to higher levels of homophilic behavior in scientific collaborations. Findings suggest that gender parity is necessary but not sufficient to guarantee gender integration. While g ender quota systems have proven effective in fixing an imbalance of men and women in the workplace, additional policies are required to promote integration and collaboration between men and women. 205 Standardization and equal -opportunity policies: How do they impact gender differences in academic evaluations - a German Florence, Ital y. 3WZB, Germany Abstract Our study aims to contribute to the debate on discrimination in academia using a vignette experiment regarding the hiring evaluations of assistant professors in two countries, Germany and Italy (n=1266 in Italy; 4102 in Germany) , which differ in their institutionalized strategies to objectify academic hiring procedures and to reduce discrimination . These strategies are: gender equality policies and standardization of research output. The comparison of the two countries indicates that affirmative action policies may be a more successful strategy than standardization to increase the number of female assistant professors. We observe that in Germany women are favoured to men in the early - stage evaluations while no difference is found in Italy. Regarding parental leave policies that require that taking family time is considered in the evaluation of applications, in Italy, where such policy does not exist, parental leave increases the perceived qualification of these applicants but is n ot further translated into their invitation to a job interview. In Germany, on the contrary, we find a parental leave \"premium\" on both ratings irrespective of the applicants' and respondents' gender. Finally, the initial results suggested that standardiz ation may give less leeway to gauging the contribution to joint publications. A closer look at the gender of both applicants and respondents, however, suggests that standardization does give room for biases in the evaluation of publications and that this occurs along gendered lines. 371 Investigating gender bias in evaluations for job promotion: does homophily play a role? Results from a survey Society - University of Turin, Turin, Italy. 2Collegio Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy. 3Department of Economics and Statistics \"Cognetti de Martiis\" - University of Turin, Turin, Italy Abstract The existence of gender bias in hiring and job promotions is a major issue affecting real gender equality. We investigate whether this bias is the same for men and women or depends on who evaluates whom (i.e., according to a homophilic principle). The experiment proposed h ere involved about 500 people with medium - and high -level jobs. They were requested to evaluate three CVs, alternatively of three women, three men or a woman and two men. Depending on the treatment, evaluations were either global (i.e. assigned to the full CV) or analytical (i.e. separately assigned to each of four CV sections). The requested decision was to choose one of the candidates for a promotion. The results suggest the existence of homophilic bias, with women (men) evaluating better female (male) ca ndidates. However, such a result holds only when CVs are assessed analytically, indicating that evaluation protocols may play a major role in eliciting discriminatory behaviors 415 How (wo)men evaluate (wo)men. Gendered gender biases in Berlin, Germany. 2German Centre for Higher Education Research and Science Studies (DZHW), Hannover, Germany Abstract More recent studies in academic recruitment suggest that when women apply they may be advantaged. Our study aims to contribute to the debate on gender differences in assessment for professorships and examine possible explanations for the advantage of femal e applicants. Using a factorial survey experiment for full professor positions in Germany and focusing on both the gender of (fictitious) applicants and of the evaluators (professors) we analyze if professors' gender influences how they evaluate applicants of different gender and if the evaluation of specific performance and personal characteristics varies depending on the applicants' and evaluators' gender. Our results show that ceteris paribus female applicants were viewed as more qualified for the job an d more likely to be invited at the job interview compared to male applicants. For the most part, the evaluation of specific performance and personal characteristics do not vary depending on the applicants' gender. One notable exception is the share of arti cles in high ranked journals: female applicants are both penalized less (for below average) but also benefit less (for above average) than male applicants. Moreover, our results do not indicate that female applicants benefit primarily from women evaluators , as they receive (similar) higher ratings from both male and female respondents. Finally, we show that a considerable part of female applicants' advantage in invitation is due to the fact that they are perceived as more qualified than comparable male appl icants. The remaining part indicates that on average female applicants are given preferential consideration. However this is particularly the case at the lower end of qualification scale and diminishes with increasing perceived qualification (until it beco mes negligible). Neighbourhood, Space and Social Capital - Session 3 15:30 - 16:50 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 6. NAB 1.15 Session 3 93 The Effects of Voluntary Involvement on Social Capital and Network Composition in Germany Kasimir Dederichs University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. Nuffield College, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract Social capital helps individuals to instrumentally attain various goals but is notoriously unequally distributed. Previous cross -sectional research suggests a s trong link between involvement in voluntary organizations and access to social capital, but it remains unclear whether this association is driven by socialization or selection effects and how voluntary involvement affects the status composition of individu als' social capital. In this article, I address these questions by studying changes in social capital - measured with the position generator - after transitions into voluntary organizations. The fixed effects regression analyses rely on two waves of the ad ult cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study (SC6 -NEPS) covering a period of four years. The findings suggest that much of the cross -sectional association is caused by selection of individuals with abundant social capital into voluntary organi zations, but that getting involved in a voluntary organization is generally followed by substantial increases in social capital, too. Individuals with initially small stocks of social capital receive the largest returns from voluntary involvement. Moreover , joiners extend their social capital towards higher - but not towards lower status positions. This pattern is particularly pronounced among those with a low socioeconomic status, whose social capital status distribution is substantively altered by voluntar y involvement. Overall, these results highlight the importance of voluntary involvement for the formation of cross -cutting social ties, social capital acquisition, and social cohesion. 82 The Effect of Community Organizing on Landlords' Use of Eviction Filing: Evidence from U.S. Cities Andrew Ford Messamore University of Texas at Austin, Austin, USA Abstract Eviction filing rates have declined in many large cities in the United States. Existing scholarship on eviction, which focuses on discrete tenant -landlord relationships, has few explanations for why. In this article I consider whether community organizing by nonprofit organizations shapes the social organizations of communities and causes landlords to file fewer eviction filings. In cities wh ere tenant and anti -poverty organizing has become common, community -oriented nonprofit organizations advocate for disadvantaged communities and help residents avoid poverty. Community organizing has rarely been studied as a predictor of housing security am ong low -income tenants, though, despite studies of how community organizing shapes the use of property in wealthy neighborhoods. I estimate the causal effect of community organizations on eviction filing rates between 2000 and 2016 using longitudinal data and a strategy to account for the endogeneity of nonprofits and eviction. Evidence from year -to-year models in 75 large cities spanning 16 years estimate that an addition of 10 community nonprofits in a city of 100,000 residents is associated with a 10 per cent reduction in eviction filing. This effect is comparable to the effect of community organizations on murder and is roughly a third of the association between eviction and concentrated disadvantage. 172 Gambling Outlets as Agents of Local Area Disorg anization: Crime and Local Institutions, the Case of the UK Neli Demireva1, Sergio Lo Iacono2 1Essex University, Colchester, United Kingdom. 2UMEA, Sweden Abstract Drawing on two major criminological theories, routine activities theory and social disorganization theory, this study examines the association of gambling outlets in England and Wales with various crime outcomes. Using data from the ONS, the UK Census, the UK Police Street -level Crime Dataset, and the POI Ordnance Survey1, we analyse the association between gambling outlets and crime events across England and Wales, drawing on the previous literature and expanding on it in several ways. First, we consider various types of crime and distinguish between anti - social behaviour, interpersonal crimes (such as violent crimes and theft), burglaries, property damage and vehicle theft. Second, we explore the possibility of a heterogenous effect dependent upon the level of deprivation and residential stability in an area. While renters are supposed t o be relatively transient, homeowners should provide heightened levels of guardianship in a neighbourhood. Small shop owners can also act to preserve the well -being and the positive character of a local area. Gambling outlets are significantly and positive ly associated with different types of crime even when controlling for other businesses, the areas' demographic and socio -economic characteristics. Small businesses provide distinctive shielding effects - in areas of high density of small business owners, t here is no significant correlation between crime types and gambling density. 88 Deindustrialization, Place -based Community Identity and Far -right Voting in Europe Giuseppe Ciccolini European University Institute, Florence, Italy Abstract Drawbacks of the post -industrial transition are often observed to favor the radical right. Remarkable ethnographic evidence - primarily from the American context - suggests that this is most likely to occur in presence of place -based community identity, me aning a particular combination of social capital and parochialism. Yet, comparative research based on quantitative data and considering the European context is much scarcer. Our aim is to complement this scholarship by considering these two dimensions join tly. To address this gap, we exploit a unique historical shock that engendered a long -lasting place -based community identity: the experience of Italian free city -states in the Middle Ages. We study whether political reactions to deindustrialization - which we analyse in an instrumental variable setting - are more acute in these areas compared to elsewhere in the country. For the sake of simplicity, we focus on one major source of deindustrialization: exposure to international trade. Following the literature , we study local exposure to changes in Chinese trade import, based on the area -specific historical sectoral specialization. Our unit of analysis is local labour markets areas (LMA). The outcome of interest is electoral results in the 2018 Italian general election in each commune. Following the PopuList classification, we classify the Northern League and Brothers of Italy as radical right parties. Additionally, we plan to complement this analysis by enlarging its geographic scope to the whole of Europe. Thi s is meant to support the external validity of our findings. For this purpose, we intend to construct a measure of place - based community identity using EVS data. To do so, we perform Principal Component Analysis on regional -level aggregate values of the tw o dimensions underpinning our latent concept, i.e. social capital and identification with the local community. Inequality and the State - Session 3 15:30 - 16:50 Thursday, 21st April, 2022 Room 7. NAB 2.14 Session 3 38 Societal impacts on the inequalities in subjective well -being along the axis of disability: Welfare -state regimes and indices -sur-Alzette, Luxembourg. 3Sabbatical, Germany Abstract This study focuses on inequalities in subjective well -being (SWB) along the axis of disability, an under -researched area of inequality. As the social system of a country (macro level) also shapes gaps in subjective well -being, we analyse how macro characteristics such as welfare -state regime and structural disability -related inequalities shape inequalities in SWB. According to social production function theory, people with a disability do not have the same opportunities as other people to acquire resources, and achieve instrumental goals and eventually subjective well - being. Social participation and employment seem to be crucial mechanisms behind such disparities. The core of this research are multilevel analyses using European S ocial Survey data for 31 European countries. The results reveal that people with disabilities demonstrate significantly lower subjective well -being compared to people without these conditions. Welfare -state regimes have an effect on this gap, with social -democratic (and family -oriented) Nordic countries performing best in providing equal living conditions for people with and without disabilities. While the aggregated difference in social participation between people with and people without disabilities on t he country level seems to be associated with the SWB gap between both groups, labour market integration of people with disabilities (vis-\u00e0-vis people without disabilities) does not seem to make a difference. 11 The long shadow of welfare reform: Health impacts of Australia's 'emergency -Alice Doyle1, 1London School of Economics, London, United Kingdom. 2University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia Abstract Social policies have tremendous potent ial to alleviate intergenerational inequalities. At the same time, policies that are not carefully designed and implemented can have unintended consequences, holding disadvantaged children back from their potential and reinforcing existing patterns of soci al stratification. Australia's experience with welfare reform provides an example. In 2007, the Australian government introduced 'income management', a reform to the welfare system which restricts how people receiving government transfer payments could sp end their money. The new policy was introduced in remote Aboriginal communities. Its intention was to disrupt the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage by increasing parents' spending on goods that benefit children. It did this by setting aside 50 % of government transfer income to be spent on essentials like food, and ensuring those funds could not be spent on alcohol, cigarettes, pornography or gambling. Since 2007, the policy has been applied to additional disadvantaged communities across Austra lia, and the government has recently suggested rolling it out more broadly. However, very little is known about whether the policy has achieved its goals of supporting disadvantaged children's long -term health and development. In this paper, we estimate t he impact of very early life exposure to the policy introduction on children's health through to age 6. We do this using linked administrative data on all children's birth and healthcare records. We find that the introduction of this policy appears to hav e exacerbated the intergenerational disadvantage and social stratification that it sought to alleviate. Children who were exposed to the policy rollout in utero or in very early life spent more time in hospital in early childhood. This was concentrated in admissions for infections, consistent with evidence that children with worse health at birth are more susceptible to infections, perhaps due to a weaker immune system. 45 How do changes in public social care expenditure affect care use among older adults? Evidence from English local United Kingdom. 2King's College London, London, United Kingdom. 3University of Lausanne, Lausann e, Switzerland Abstract After over a decade of austerity policies in Europe, it is important to understand the effect of welfare cuts on individuals and families. In this study we examine the effect of cuts to community -based care on the receipt of formal and informal long -term care (LTC) among disabled English residents aged 65 and over, as well as on socio -economic inequalities in the receipt of care. We link panel data from 9,34 1 individuals in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) with a unique indicator of expenditure on community -based services to older adults for 149 English councils (\"local authorities\") for 2004 -2018. We exploit two features of the English LTC sys tem: the 31% real -term reduction in social care expenditure occurred after 2010; and the means -testing of benefits, which implies that only individuals with financial resources below a nationally implemented, government -set threshold are eligible for publi c LTC. We compare changes in home -care use between pre - and post -2010 between two groups based on eligibility to receive public social care, which we determine yearly for each ELSA respondent based on their income and assets. Preliminary findings from fixed -effects models show that declines in LTC expenditure within local authorities are linked with lower formal home -care use among disabled older adults. The effect is only detected for individuals who were eligible to receive public care over the period considered. These results suggest that the cuts negatively affected the use of formal care among older adults and potentially increased socio -economic inequalities access to LTC. 387 Socio -economic differences in Dutch parents' knowledge about formal c hildcare organization and childcare subsidies in the Netherlands Verena Seibel , Mara Yerkes Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands Abstract Easily accessible, affordable, high quality formal childcare is a crucial policy instrument for children and paren ts. Formal childcare is important for parents' labor market participation and can have positive effects on children's socio -emotional development. Yet large discrepancies between groups are visible in the use of formal childcare. Low -income families and f amilies with migration backgrounds make significantly less use of formal childcare, creating long -term inequalities for both children and parents. Research from predominately qualitative studies suggest that one of the biggest barriers to childcare access for low - income and migrant families is their lack of knowledge regarding the organization of formal childcare as well as the financing in terms of government subsidies. However, a substantive analysis of childcare knowledge across low - income and migrant f amilies is missing due to the lack of adequate quantitative data. By analyzing data of over 660 Dutch parents, collected in June 2021 via the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) Panel (probability -based sample), we examine the main knowledge gaps of Dutch parents regarding childcare organization and subsidies eligibility and determine to what extent education and migration background can explain these knowledge gaps. We find that lower educated parents and parents with migration background are better informed about the organization of formal childcare but lack concrete knowledge about access conditions to childcare subsidies. Cautious conclusions are drawn regarding the implications of these results for childcare behavior among disadvantaged families in the Netherlands.

A path -model of educational achievement in primary school Stefanie Sprong , Jan Skopek Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland Abstract Educ ation is key to the structural integration of immigrants and their children. While research indicates that migrant educational underachievement is a serious issue, relatively little is known about when, how and why migrant gaps develop. The current paper a dds to the literature by investigating how much of the migration -related disparities found during primary school can be attributed to inequalities that already existed before school life. To do so, it uses structural equation modelling and draws on a natio nal longitudinal study of children in Ireland. Results indicate that migration -related disparities largely find their roots in the period before formal schooling, after which they remain relatively stable or even decrease. This tentatively suggests that re searchers and policymakers may want to focus their efforts on the period proceeding primary school. 161 Intergenerational Consequences of Immigrant Selectivity: When Does Contextual 1European Univer sity Institute, Department of Political and Social Sciences, Florence, Italy. 2University of Essex, Department of Sociology, Colchester, United Kingdom Abstract The immigrant (educational) selectivity hypothesis posits that the foreign born who stem from the upper end of their sending country's educational distribution possess unobserved resources and traits, which positively influence the educational attainment of their children beyond the direct effects of their observed educational credentials. Whi le US research finds that immigrant educational selectivity helps explain the \"paradox\" of the higher educational attainment of the children of immigrants, research for Europe is more equivocal. We seek to reconcile these conflicting findings in a new cont ext - the UK. Like the US, the UK displays an \"immigrant paradox\" with higher attainment among the children of the foreign born. However, like other European countries, the British secondary school system is tracked at an early age and strongly stratified. We investigate whether immigrant educational selectivity explains an immigrant paradox in education in the UK and whether it explains variation in the educational attainment of the children of immigrants. We use the nationally representative panel study Understanding Society and focus on adults aged 25 -55. We examine an immigrant origin sample (with two foreign -born parents) and a combined sample also including third generation + individuals. We match parental information with the Barro -Lee (2013) dataset to build a measure of parental educational selectivity defined as the percentage of people of the same country of origin, sex, and age group who have a lower educational attainment. We find that, in the combined sample, parental educational selectivity is related to respondents' educational attainment and it explains immigrant advantages in attainment. However, in the immigrant origin sample, it is unrelated to respondents' attainment. This result contradicts the immigrant selectivity hypothesis and present s an empirical puzzle. We interpret this as a case of Simpson's paradox and investigate other explanations, including potential moderating and mediating effects of the selectivity - attainment association. 352 The Role of Older Siblings in the Educationa l Attainment of Children with and without Migration Background Marion Fischer -Neumann University of Duisburg -Essen, Germany Abstract Inequalities in educational outcomes between children with and without migration background is still a current empirical ph enomenon. Although three -quarters of children grow up with at least one sibling in the family, previous research explaining educational assimilation and existing ethnic disparities has focused primarily on the characteristics and resources of the parents. Siblings have thus far often been perceived as educational disadvantage through eroding parental investments of resources and time between first - and subsequent -born children. Yet, empirical results are inconclusive. Further, sibling relationships involve in contrast to parent -child relationships particular structural advantages for educational influences (e.g., horizontality, longevity, intimacy). Moreover, the sibling relationship includes relevant resources (e.g., educational competences, achievements) t hat can be transmitted for educational growth. Older siblings have a particular role as role models, which may be specifically relevant within migrant families, where they can compensate for the disadvantages of parents in host - country -specific resources ( e.g., lack of competence in the national language, inter -ethnic contacts). Hypotheses suggest a positive influence of older siblings' educational attainment on child's educational acquisition in dependence on characteristics of the sibling constellation (e .g., age spacing, gender) as well as on older siblings' social and cultural capital, both determining the between -sibling transmission context. Further, the influence of older siblings' human capital is hypothesized to be stronger for migrant than non -migrant children. Multivariate multilevel models for repeated observations of individuals nested within families in the household survey \"Socio -Economic Panel\" (SOEP) confirm that older siblings' educational attainment (years of schooling) increases younger si bling's educational acquisition (years of schooling). However, the positive effect of older siblings' human capital varies as theoretically assumed and is significantly higher the lower the birth space to older siblings, the lower the number of older sibli ngs, the higher the cultural participation of older siblings as well as, contrary to expectations, for natives. 363 Understanding Ethnic Differences in Home Learning Leda Maria Bonazzi1, Ayse Guveli2 1Catholic University of Milan, Milan, Italy. 2University of Essex, United Kingdom Abstract The Covid -19 school shutdowns had devastating impact on students' learning in primary and secondary schools. Previous research demonstrates that students from certain ethnic minority groups are hit hardest who spent least time on home learning during the school closures. This research aims to understand the drives of the home learning inequalities among primary and secondary students from the main ethnic minority group s in the UK. The Understanding Society COVID -19 dataset provides this unique possibility to rigorously analyse the reasons behind the ethnic inequalities in home learning during the COVID -19 school shutdowns. We ask: 1 ) To what extent do children from ethn ic minority background differ in their home learning time? 2) What are the factors explaining differences in home learning between children from ethnic minority backgrounds during the school shutdown in the UK? Among others, we explore family and school ch aracteristics (schools' online and offline remote teaching provisions and teachers' involvement in home learning) to explain ethnic differences in home learning. Our data demonstrate that family characteristics (parental education, possession of computer, free school meal, parental occupation, family size and composition, parental language fluency) explain a great deal of the differences between children with different ethnic group but schools' remote teaching provision provides the most important explanati on for the ethnic inequalities between primary and secondary children's home learning. Our findings demonstrate clearly the need for the governments to invest in schools', teachers' and students' digital preparedness to prepare children for likely long and short -term school shutdowns and prevent further learning loss 188 What drives public attitudes towards birthright citizenship of children born in Italy to immigrant parents? victoria donnaloja , maarten vink EUI, Italy Abstract There are currently around one million children in Italy without Italian citizenship status. This is because to become Italian, unless one of the parents acquires Italian citizenship, children born to immigrant parents have to wait until they turn 18 and must active ly register within a year. Italian citizenship is inherited through lineage, via the principle of ius sanguinis . Employing a conjoint experiment design on a nationally representative sample of Italian citizens, we investigate what drives Italian citizens' attitudes on birthright citizenship for children born in Italy to immigrant parents. We investigate to what extent support for a ius soli type reform is conditional on perceptions of loyalty, ascriptive characteristics, demographic concerns, economic conce rns and/or assumed socio -cultural integration. Our study contributes to the theoretical understanding of what drives inclusion/exclusion dynamics through public attitudes for the children of immigrant parents born in their parents' country of residence. Poverty and Social Policy - Session 4 09:00 - 10:40 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 2. Wolfson Theatre Session 4 68 Inequality Below the Poverty Line Since 1967: The Role of U.S. Welfare Policy Zachary Parolin1, Matthew Desmond2, Christopher Wimer3 1Bocconi University, Milano, Italy. 2Princeton University, USA. 3Columbia University, USA Abstract Since the War on Poverty in the 1960s, the U.S. social safety net has shifted away from direct cash assistance for the lowest -income families and toward tax -based transfers targeted at working families with children. Previous research has assessed this shift by evaluating its eff ect on the national poverty rate. Doing so, however, overlooks how it may also have led to increased inequality among low -income families. We document and explain trends in inequality below the poverty line using comprehensive income data from 1967 to 2019 . Income inequality among the poorest families has been volatile since the 1960s. Over the last fifty years, changes to the American welfare state played a decisive role in expanding or reducing inequality among families in poverty. Until the mid -1990s, po licies that most reduced poverty were also those that most reduced inequality among the poor; in recent decades, however, the opposite has been true. This counterintuitive finding challenges standard theories regarding the effectiveness of income transfers in reducing poverty by revealing that recent state -led antipoverty efforts have placed the near poor and the deeply poor on divergent paths. 266 Intergenerational transmission of social assistance receipt: identifying vulnerable groups and additional ri sk factors Outi Sirni\u00f6 , Maria Vaalavuo Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland Abstract Even though ample research shows how lack of financial resources in childhood has disadvantageous consequences to future outcomes, fewer previous st udies have detected whether these associations vary across children. By using uniquely rich longitudinal full population register data from Finland, we analyze the extent to which childhood economic hardship and its accumulation are associated with economi c hardship in early adulthood. We identify which groups are most vulnerable when it comes to the strength of the association between parental and personal receipt of social assistance. We assess differences between genders and by immigrant background, and take a closer look at timing and duration of social assistance receipt in childhood. We further assess whether the prevalence of social assistance receipt in place of residence matters. By analyzing nearly 300,000 individuals born between 1987 and 1994, ou r preliminary results show that parental social assistance receipt was strongly associated with child's probability of receiving social assistance in a simple random effects model, while the association seems to disappear when unobserved family characteris tics shared by siblings are taken into account in sibling fixed effects models. We find the association being stronger among boys than girls. By the conference, our analysis will be extended with analysis covering the aforementioned research aims. 439 Social States and Income Inequality: How Neoliberal Ideals fail Social Mobility Nate Breznau1, Florian Hertel2 1University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany. 2University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany Abstract Social states reduce social inequality through redistributive spending, progressive taxation and subsidization. Their impact is obvious when looking at post fisc income inequality. However, too much redistribution is 'unfair' in a neoliberal ideology becau se it harms meritocratic market -rewards. As in: states that are too social reduce social mobility by redistributing otherwise just market -rewards. Recent research suggests too much inequality actually harms social mobility a claim that runs counter to neol iberal arguments, known sometimes as the Great Gatsby Curve . We are skeptical and thus engage in formal modeling of this theoretical curve using multivariate analysis. The social state theoretically shapes the opportunity structures that generate or reduce mobility, in addition to directly shaping the nature of pay before and after taxes and transfers. From this we construct a formal model of the process with social mobility as an outcome. Then we fit data from several macro -comparative sources using time -series structural equation models. We measure social mobility as relative mobility using UniDiff coefficients and absolute mobility in terms of intergenerational occupational status elasticity. In the first set of models we look at the impact of social stat es on the average social mobility scores across countries across the entire period for which we have mobility data: 1987 -2010. In a second set, we regress change in mobility from the period 1987 -1992 to the period 2008 -1010 on changes to the social state w ithin each country over time. Although our research is still in progress, initial results point toward support of the Gatsby arguments. If true, the implications are that states should tax and spend more to promote not only social equality, but also libera lism's ideal outcome of meritocratic reward systems. This also suggests that neoliberalism undermines its own purported ideological goals. 368 Persistent or short -term experience? - Poverty dynamics in Switzerland - A linked tax data -based analysis of po verty flows and drivers Lukas Christian Hobi1, Oliver H\u00fcmbelin1, Rudolf Farys2 1Berner Fachhochschule, Bern, Switzerland. 2University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland Abstract It is important to understand poverty as a dynamic phenomenon and look at it in a perspective of multiple periods, since shorter, longer or recurring episodes of poverty have different implications for the persons experiencing them on the one hand, but als o in terms of the required policies needed to address them on the other. This paper contributes to the field of longitudinal poverty studies by using linked tax data to examine poverty in a large political district in Switzerland with 1 million inhabitants . Using the information in the tax data, we measure not only the evolution of income poverty over the 2012 - 2015 period for the 2012 poor cohort. But using an asset -based poverty approach we also observe income poor with insufficient financial reserves to bridge a 12 -months gap. We find an important flow from these asset -based poor directly out to the non -poor, that is bigger than the respective flow from the income poor, and which seems primarily driven by the working -age population. Overall asset -based p overty seems to be the more dynamic state, with many exits to or backflows from non -poverty over the 4 -year period. Income poverty seems to be more static, with exits to non -poverty rapidly decreasing following the 1st year. We plan to use panel -data analy sis, to see how these changes are shaped by labor market participation, asset consumption or the social benefit system. Finally, we plan to check how poverty dynamics are driven by demographic characteristics of the 2012 poor cohort. 429 Social security for all? Job loss, household income and income inequality in different welfare regimes Sel\u00e7uk Kingdom. 2Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany. 3University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom. 4VIVE, Copenhagen, Denmark. 5University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. 6University of Turku, Turku, Finland. 7University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland Abstract Life course risks such as job loss are generally considered to be the main drivers of stratification and inequality. The hypothesis is that the disadvantaged are more likely to experience such events, and once experienced, suffer more from their consequences, which then might lead to wider inequality. Alternatively, life course risks might not be a significant determinant of income inequality if the risks and penalties of such events are not socially stratified e.g. due to relevant incentives for or insurance against risks in different welfare regimes. In this paper, we empirically examine and explain the relationship between job loss and income inequality in four different European countries such as Denmark, Finland, Germany and the UK in the year s between 1991 and 2008. Our preliminary findings show that the level or change in the rate of job loss has a limited influence on overall income inequality in all countries despite the significant gradient in the risk and penalty of job loss. The main exp lanations for such null effects are the rarity and short -lived nature of the job loss event - for example, long -term unemployment has a significant influence on inequality of pre -government household incomes, although these effects also disappear in all co untries once we account for taxes and transfers. At the individual level, however, income losses following a job loss are significant even for the post -government income (i.e. after taxes and transfers), which also varies across countries in line with the specific incentives and compensation provided by relevant welfare institutions. Within -Family/Sibling Designs - Session 4 09:00 - 10:40 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 3. Alumni Theatre Session 4 37 Birth Order at the Top of the Earnings Distribution Per Engzell1, Carina Mood2, Jan O Jonsson1 1University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. 2SOFI, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden Abstract We study how birth order differentials in earnings depend on family background, using Swedish register data. Birth order effects are especially marked among those born into privilege. First sons born into the top 1% of family income are 42% more likely than their third -born brothers to rank in the top 10% as adults, and first -born daughters are 64% more likely than their third -born sisters. The same differences among those born in the bottom 90% are negligible. Education and skills explain birth order differences in mobility into the top, but not in staying there. First -borns disproportionat ely sort to industries where their same -sex parent worked, but this cannot explain the top earnings differential. A more likely explanation is social expectations about earnings as such, and the preservation of a family name. Our results illustrate how pat riarchal and kin -based institutions continue to exist in one of the world's most egalitarian welfare states. 231 Labour market trajectories of teenage mothers - and fathers - a sibling comparison study Sara Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden Abstract Teenage parenthood is thought to have long term consequences for the life trajectory of young parents. The event, falling outside of the expected social time tables of timing and ordering of education, work and famil y formation, is feared to hinder human capital acquisition and putting financial strain onto the young parents. In this study, we combine sequence analysis and sibling models, using Swedish register data. We make three main contribution to a further under standing of the consequences of teen parenthood: First, we look at long term labour market trajectories of teenage parents and their siblings, following them from ages 20 to 31. These 12 -year trajectories allows teenage parents to experience the first year s of parenthood, while still having time to \"catch up\" to their siblings, after the early childhood years. Further, using sequences of labour market states, instead of single point in time estimates, allows us to capture patterns of combination of work, st udy or unemployment, as well as the relative stability or complexity of the trajectory, giving a more nuances picture of the labour market pathway. Second, as there are substantial selection effects in who becomes a teenage parent, with overrepresentation of young people from low socio -economic backgrounds which is later reflected in their later life outcomes, we use multinomial sibling models to compare young parents to their non -teenage parent siblings. This allows us to compare labour market trajectorie s of teenage parents to those of individuals with the same familiar background, controlling for all join family characteristics. Lastly, while the teenage parenthood literature is dominated by young mothers, we look both young men and women, where teenage mothers are compared to non -parenting sisters, and teenage fathers to non -parenting brothers. 200 Can we trust null effects in within -family designs? Martin Hallsten1, Per Engzell2 1Stockholm university, Stockholm, Sweden. 2Nuffield College, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract We discuss the usefulness of family fixed effects models in stratification research, both in relation to theory and its specific methodological limitations. For sev eral applied examples in the literature, we consider in detail the variance that is used in estimation and how it connects to substantive theories about child rearing. In many of these cases, there is a disconnect between the estimand and the actual theory that is purportedly being tested. We also provide evidence on the sign and magnitude of several common biases including selection into identification, random and systematic measurement errors, endogenous parental behavior, and interference between sibling s. Ultimately, we provide researchers with a checklist and set of best practices to consider when conducting and reporting within -family analysis. Our survey recommends within -family designs not as a panacea to rid estimates of confounding, but rather one of many complementary strategies that may or may not be useful depending on the substantive theory being tested. 240 The Effect of Parental Status and Child\u00b4s Sex on Educational Outcomes, Testing Trivers - Willard Hypothesis. Janne Kalevi Salminen1, Hann u Lehti2 1Inequalities, Interventions, and New Welfare State (INVEST) -flagship Department of Social Research, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. 2Inequalities, Interventions, and New Welfare State (INVEST) -flagship Department of Social Research, University of Turku,, Turku, Finland Abstract The educational attainment of children is strongly related to the socioeconomic status of parents. However, i t has been shown that boys have more difficulties in education than girls do. Difficulties in school can increase social risk such as social exclusion. Trivers -Willard's (T -W) hypothesis states that parents with high social status invest more in sons compa red to low -status parents. Therefore, parental investments in sons and daughters display an asymmetrical relationship according to parental status. In modern societies, asymmetrical parental investments by parental social status can be expected to manifest in sons' and daughters' educational outcomes. We apply sibling fixed -effect analysis that is based on sibling comparisons within families. Therefore, this study obtains causal estimates for the effects of parental status on sons' and daughters' educationa l outcomes. We investigate sons' and daughters' educational outcomes such as school dropout, academic GPA, general secondary attainment, and tertiary enrollment. We use reliable and large Finnish full population register data and applied family fixed effec t methods (i.e. sibling comparison), which allow us to study the educational outcomes of opposite -sex siblings within a family. The preliminary results show that sons, related to daughters of the same family, with high -status parents, indeed achieve higher educational outcomes compared to sons with lower -status parents. Thus, our preliminary results support the T-W hypothesis in educational outcomes. 69 Learning By Parenting: Does Parental Education Affect Parenting Adaptability? Alicia Garcia Sierra University of Oxford - Nuffield College, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract Despite the fact that it is well -known that parents with different levels of education have distinctive ways of understanding and implementing parenting, the mechanisms driving this relationship remain mainly unexplored. This paper examines if more educated parents are more li kely to learn from their previous parenting experiences and act accordingly. Using GSOEP data, I present an innovative approach combining a Dynamic Panel Data (DPD) model with a Siblings Fixed -Effects design. Preliminary results suggest that highly educate d parents are more likely to adapt their parenting based on their previous experiences than lower educated ones. This paper contributes to our understanding of the paths through which parental levels of education condition parenting, which is a key predict or of children's long -term socioeconomic outcomes. Gendered Effects of Parenthood on Wages & Work - Session 4 09:00 - 10:40 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 4. Thai Theatre Session 4 402 Heterogeneous Effects of Childbirth on the Couple's Division of Paid Workhours: the Role of Pre -birth Breadwinner Status, Family Policies and Gender Culture Fei Bian , Luana Marx, Leen Vandecasteele University of Lausanne, Switzerland Abstract Previous research has shown that the birth of a child decreases women's paid working time, but has almost no influence on men's working time allocation. While most studies to date have focused on individual outcomes, this paper investigates couple -level re sponses to childbirth. We use a difference -in-difference approach to analyse changes in couple's division of paid workhours prior to and in the years after childbirth for three different pre -birth couple types: male main earner, equal earners and female ma in earner. Additionally, using multilevel random slopes modeling, we examine how family policies and a country's gender culture moderate the childbirth's influence on women's relative working time. Our analysis is based on micro -level data from EU Statisti cs on Income and Living Conditions (EU -SILC) covering 32 countries and macro -level data from the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) as well as the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). We find heterogenous effects of chil dbirth on the couple's division of paid workhours, as the decline in women's relative working time is stronger in couples with a male breadwinner than in those with two equal earners or a female main earner before the birth of a first child. Moreover, our results show that longer maternity leave strengthens and childcare provision weakens the negative effect of childbirth on female share of couple's working hours, and these policies have a stronger effect for pre -birth male main earner couples. The findings also suggest that living in a country with a progressive gender culture weakens the negative childbirth effect on women's relative working time regardless of couple type. 288 Do parental leave extensions for fathers increase or decrease wage penalties? Kathrin Morosow University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom Abstract The welfare state paradox argument holds that subsidized parental leave institutionalizes women's family -related employment interruptions, negatively affecting high -wage mothers in particular. This paper argues for a stronger support for the paradox if a similar pattern of negative wage effects occurs among fathers who take parental leave, and if these negative effects increase after the introduction of a \"father's month.\" A comp eting argument is that policy promotion of fathers' leave take -up should help to embed a dual -caring norm, in turn increasing the social acceptance of fathers' leave taking. In other words, the more fathers take family leave, the more accepted leave -taking becomes, and perhaps the smaller any associated penalties. Thus, if the 2003 Finnish policy reform increased acceptability of fathers' parental leave use, the reform may have lowered predicted wage penalties for all fathers as compared with before the ref orm. To test this, I use 1995 to 2011 waves of high -quality Finnish register -based data and unconditional quantile regression to estimate the impact of taking parental leave across fathers' wage distribution before and after the 2003 introduction of a \"fat her's month.\" Contrary to the paradox argument, results from fixed -effects models reveal that taking parental leave predicts a wage penalty only across the bottom half of fathers' wage distribution, and an increasing premium across the top half. The 2003 p olicy reform significantly increased leave take -up among all fathers, but the pattern of wage effects did not shift. I conclude there is little support for the paradox, but also that current Finnish leave policies widen wage inequalities among fathers. Additional analysis will include a difference -in-difference approach to causally analyse the shift in the effect of the parental leave on father's wages before and after the introduction of the father's month by educational gradient. 356 Effects of Postponing Motherhood on Wages: A Comparison of West Germany and the United Kingdom Linda Vecgaile , Juho Harkonen European University Institute, Florence, Italy Abstract Does motherhood postponement help avoid or reduce wage penalties associated with childbearing? Studies on women's age at first birth based on human capital theory suggest that it does. All previous research comes from single country studies, mostly from the US, which does not allow us to conclude whether fertility postponement can reduce childbearing penalties in other country settings, and whether cross -national variation in institutional settings moderate this effect. In this study, we ask whether fertility timing moderates the motherhood wage penalty in West Germany and the United Ki ngdom. We harmonise longitudinal data from the and apply fixed -effects models to estimate whether timing in terms of accumulated work experience moderates the wage effects of childbearing and whether any such effects differ between the diverse institutional settings. According to the obtained results, motherhood postponement in the UK leads to better wage outcomes, whereas the opposite effect is present in West Germ any. 54 Gender inequality reinforced: the impact of a child's health shock on parents' market trajectories Maria Vaalavuo1, Henri Salokangas1, Ossi Tahvonen2 1Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland. 2University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland Abstract This article employs a couple -level framework to examine how a child's severe illness affects within -family gender inequality in a Northern Eur opean context. We study the parental labor market responses to a child's cancer diagnosis by exploiting an event study methodology and individual -level administrative data on hospitalizations and labor market variables for the total population in Finland. We focus on the differences in the effects by gender, relative educational level, and breadwinner status. We find that child cancer has a negative impact on the labor income of both the mother and the father. This effect is considerably larger for women, a nd therefore leads to an increase in gender inequality on top of the well -documented motherhood penalty related to childbirth. However, mothers who are the main breadwinners in the family experience a smaller reduction in their contribution to household in come. These new insights provide evidence on gender roles when a child falls ill and show how child health affects gender inequality in two -parent households. 354 Earnings penalties to motherhood and income inequality between couples with children: how do the US and the UK differ? Susan Harkness1, Selcuk Beduk2 1University of Bristol, United Kingdom. 2University of Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract Becoming a first -time parent often triggers large changes in patterns of household employment, earnings, and income. These effects may vary widely across the income distribution, although a country's institutional context may have an important influence on whether the 'cost of children' differs by income. In this comparative study, we use harmonized panel data for the US and the UK, from 1990 to 2019, and unconditional quantile treatment effect (QTE) with fixed effects to show how the transition to parenthood influences family income across the income distribution in two countries. Our expectation is that in the UK because children have a large effect on female labor supply and earnings the impact of children on income will be greater than in the US. As a result, childbirth is expected to have a more dis -equalizing effect on the income of couples in t he UK than in the US, despite the generosity of its welfare system in supporting low -earning families with children in households. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of employment penalties to motherhood in driving inequalities in the incomes o f families with children, and the importance of the institutional context in driving change. Social Origin, Education and Occupation - Session 4 09:00 - 10:40 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 5. NAB 1.07 Session 4 374 Stratification in action: the relation between adolescent employment -Gan, Israel. 3National Insurance Institute , Jerusalem, Israel Abstract The study examines relations between adolescent employment and three aspects of higher education: beginning an undergraduate degree, completing the degree and type of institution (more prestigious university versus less prestig ious college). Our research adds a new dimension to the concept of work intensity: the contribution of the adolescent's earnings to household income. This dimension links the work intensity of the adolescent, as reflected in his/her salary, with parental s ocioeconomic status as reflected in family income. Analyzing administrative data from the Israel National Insurance Institute for the cohort of 1991, which includes information from age 12 to age 28 (2003 - 2019), we found that adolescent employment per se d oes not usually affect higher education attainment, but there is a negative relation between the adolescent's income share and higher education, even after controlling for household earnings in early adolescence. Engaging in the debate as to whether employ ment during adolescence is good or bad for later life outcomes, our study reveals that this depends on the centrality of the adolescent's contribution to family income. 392 Heterogeneous Effects of Social Origin on Educational Mismatches - The Role of Class -Specific Traits and Occupational Skills Marvin B\u00fcrmann Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany. Bielefeld Graduate School in History and Sociology (BGHS), Bielefeld, Germany Abstract It is repeatedly shown that some effect of social origin on labor market outcomes remains unexplained after controlling for educational attainment. Although this finding strongly correlates with the definition of educational mismatches, i.e. achieving a hi gher or lower position in the labor market than expected based on educational attainment, mismatches never became a central subject of social stratification research. Only recently, scholars put efford in investigating the sociological dimension of educati onal mismatches. They found that employees with a high social background often realize occupational positions beyond expectations based on educational attainment (undereducation) while those with a low social background systematically fall short of those e xpectations (overeducation). Although these studies provide additional insights into both types of mismatches separately, a simultaneous investigation of over - and undereducation is still missing with respect to the effect of social origin. My analyses bas ed on German survey data show that substantial heterogeneity in these effects can be unveiled by investigating sociologically sound assumptions derived from the debate about big class and micro -class mobility. First, it is assumed that class -specific trait s are transmitted from parents to their children and that these traits can only be used to their full advantage if employees actually work in the same social class as their parents. Second, it is assumed that occupational skills are transmitted from parent s to their children and that this is most beneficial if employees work in occupations with similar tasks as their parents. The results indicate that both, the intergenerational transmission of class -specific traits and occupational skills strongly and also separately contribute to the effects of social origin on mismatches. Finally, it is shown that only small effects of social origin on mismatches can be detected within occupations. This indicates that social origin mainly enables access to and avoidance o f certain occupations via educational mismatches. 286 When failure meets bad luck: The consequences of educational dropout differ by local economy and social origin Kerstin Ostermann1, Alexander Patzina1, Katy Morris2 1Institute for Employment Research (IAB), Nuremberg, Germany. 2University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland Abstract Labor market research provides paramount evidence for the negative impact of educational failure on individuals' careers, confirming human capital and signaling theory predictions. As research has largely overlooked the structural embeddedness of education al failure, this study analyzes the consequences of dropping out from vocational training in Germany by considering local and social embeddedness (N=476,605, T=18). In using highly reliable administrative data and geo -referenced residence information, our study also provides a new measurement for social origin based on administrative. Results show significantly negative and persistent dropout effects on future income, which increases in size for dropouts in down -turning local economies and with low socio -economic origin. Future analyses will also provide causal estimates on educational dropout and the effect of local economies on career progression. The study provides novel insights on the interplay between educational dropout, economic conditions and social origins thereby advancing sociological knowledge on how structural conditions shape individual -level outcomes. 414 Social inequalities in occupational attainment: using sibling data to estimate the total effect of family of origin and the role of educ ation Adriana Duta1, Cristina Edinburgh, United Kingdom. 2University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract While analysing the association between people's occupational attainment and that of their family of origin is valuable to investigate specific forms of mobility (e.g. class mobility), sibling correlations provide a powerful tool in answering the broader question of how much family of origin, as a whole, explains individuals' occupational attainment. This allows us to assess the importance of shared family characteristics relative to individual characteristics and to position the different family measured characteristics within the total family effect and assess their relative importance. H owever, with some exceptions, there is hardly any recent evidence on siblings' similarity in occupational outcomes in the UK context. Moreover, very few studies have analysed the role of education in explaining the within - and between -family variation in o ccupational outcomes using a sibling design. However, investigating the role of education within this framework can inform to what extent simply controlling for a few key family factors such as parental social class and parental education can lead to poten tially overestimating the role of education in the status attainment process. Using data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS), this study asks the following questions: (1) What is the overall effect of family of origin on offspring's socio -economic s tatus compared to the effect of individual and other non -shared factors? (2) Does the total family effect differ by social class of origin and by other family characteristics? (3) How much of the total variance between families is explained by parental soc ial class and other family -level characteristics and how much by respondents' own level of education? (4) How strong is the role of education in explaining the differences between - and within -family? We use random effects models to analyse the relative imp ortance of individual and family characteristics and fixed effects models to investigate differences between siblings within the same family. 383 Vocationally Qualified Alumni and the Labor Market Jessica Ordemann DZHW, Germany Abstract The proposed pap er will focus on the monetary returns on occupationally qualified higher education graduates. Using data of a combined data set of the student start cohort 5 \"Higher Education and Transition to Work\" of the National Educational Panel (NEPS) and the adminis trative data of the IAB, in short NEPS -SC5-ADIAB I analyze the differences a) between occupationally qualified with and without a university entrance exam using fixed -effects - regressions and b) additionally in contrast to non -occupationally qualified indiv iduals using random -effects regressions with entropy balanced covariates. I find that the occupationally qualified do not statistically differ for most of the observed time of six years before to 6 years after entering higher education. And - for the begin ning of the time frame - they earn more than the occupationally non -qualified, an effect that levels off over time. Those findings have two main implications for inequality research: First, inequalities in educational attainment can be minimized later in life, but second, they only have a limited range regarding reducing educational disparities based on parental resources since birth. Gender Composition, Segregation and Work - Session 4 09:00 - 10:40 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 6. NAB 1.15 Session 4 353 Tailored to women, provided to men? Occupational sex segregation and access to flexible working -School, Berlin, Germany Abstract Time autonomy is mainly promoted to reconcile work and family life and targeted towards women. However, against expectations that flexible working arrangements are predominantly available in female -dominated occupations, previous evidence indicates that working in a female -dominated occupation is associated with less access to temporal autonomy. Contributing to this puzzle, we draw on devaluation theory and hypothesize that occupations with a high share of female employees are not only devalued by lower wages but also by the availability of temporal autonomy. Using German Microcensus and panel data (GSOEP), we first assess the bivariate relationship between the share of female employees and occupational prevalence of temporal autono my across the time span from 2003 to 2019. In order to test the occupational devaluation hypothesis, we estimate occupation fixed -effects models. Initial bivariate analysis shows an inverted u -shaped between occupational gender ratios and temporal autonomy policies, yet, with an more severe lack of temporal autonomy for female -dominated occupations. 118 Trends in Gender Occupational Segregation - What Can We Learn from Computers? Efrat Herzberg -Druker Tel-Aviv University, Tel -Aviv, Israel Abstract Change s in occupational gender segregation have occurred in recent decades in many rich countries, with the greatest decline apparently between the 1970s and the 1990s. Since then, however, the level of gender occupational segregation (GOS) has remained relative ly stable, although women have entered higher education and lucrative occupations in recent decades. Contemporarily, the use of computers at work has increased dramatically. Computers have changed the labor market in the last decades and have led to change s in occupations and their characteristics. I argue that these two processes are interrelated. I suggest in this research two opposite mechanisms underlying the association between changes in gender segregation and changes in computer use in occupations. O n the one hand, in some occupations, the computerization of occupations has contributed to the increase in women's share in occupations that used to be men -dominated and the reduction in gender segregation. On the contrary, in other occupations, the increa sing use of computers has led in the opposite direction whereby the process of social closure is one of the mechanisms. Therefore fewer women enter these occupations, suggesting the stable and still prominent level of GOS. By employing OLS regression model s, lagged models, and mediation analysis on a unique dataset based on census, ACS, and O*NET data, I find that computer use and GOS are associated and that the physical aspects of the occupation and its social closure component are essential to the mechani sm of this relationship. The two mechanisms - the lessening of physical activities and the increase in social closure - act in opposite directions and result in a stable level of segregation. 144 Gender composition and the symbolic value of occupations: New evidence of a U -shaped relationship between gender and occupational prestige based on German microdata Sabine Kr\u00fcger1, Christian Ebner2, Daniela Rohrbach -Schmidt1 1Federal Bonn, Germany. 2Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany Abstract Occupational prestige is an important yet understudied factor in gender labour market inequality. This study examin es the relationship between the gender composition of occupations (i.e. the share of women) and the prestige of those occupations and investigates whether men and women differ in their evaluations. A multilevel analysis based on German microdata generated two key findings. First, occupations that are predominantly male or female tend to be rated as more prestigious than mixed -gender occupations when controlling for pay and educational requirements, suggesting a segregation premium in the symbolic valuation of work in Germany. Second, there is no evidence of a gendered in -group bias in Germany; both men and women consider gender -segregated occupations to be more prestigious, with no preference for occupations dominated by their own gender. 280 Sexual Orien tation, Workplace Authority, and Occupational Gender Composition: Probability -Based Evidence from Germany Lisa de Vries1, Stephanie Steinmetz2 1Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany. 2University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland Abstract Whereas differences in income and occupational segregation by sexual orientation are well researched, only a few studies have examined the influence of sexual orientation on the probability of having workplace authority. Against this background, we investigate the probability of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people for workplace authority and the effect of occupational gender segregation. We use the waves 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019 of the German Socio - Economic Panel (GSOEP) (N=37.288 heterosexual and N=739 LGB r espondents). Our results suggest that gay and bisexual men, in general, do not differ in their probability of supervisory workplace authority to heterosexual men, but that they have a lower probability of high -level supervisory workplace authority. Lesbian and bisexual women have a higher probability of supervisory workplace authority compared to heterosexual women. Whereas gay and bisexual men experience similar levels of disadvantages across occupations, lesbian and bisexual women have a higher advantage in female -dominated occupations. 373 Gendered Workplaces, Networks, and Labor Copenhagen, Denmark Abstract Social networks are important for labor market mobility, but women's networks convey, on average, fewer social resources than men's. This may in part be because networks are made and used in gendered organizations. Men disproportionately hold managerial au thority while predominant groups in gender -imbalanced organizations may hoard opportunities and resources. We investigate the organizational dimension of network inequalities using Danish administrative data on all job moves between 2012 and 2014 measures of ties to ex -colleagues. We develop an innovative matching strategy based on historical job flows between establishments to identify plausible counterfactual job moves for job seekers and use these matched mover -establishment combinations to estimate the marginal effects of having a contact in a destination establishment, by ego -alter gender, alter's organizational authority, and organizational gender composition. We find that ties to male managers are more useful, in general, than ties to female managers, and that the value of ties is highly dependent on the gender composition of workplaces, with ties to male managers more useful in male -dominated workplaces and vice versa. Wealth, Family and Mobility - Session 4 09:00 - 10:40 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 7. NAB 2.14 Session 4 150 Wealth Homogamy: Levels and Causes in Germany and the United Kingdom. 3DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany. 4University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany Abstract Wealth homogamy is critical for wealth inequality between households. However, little evidence exists on the level as well as causes of wealth homogamy in contemporary rich societies. Taking a life -course perspective, this study develops a theoretical framework on how wealth homogamy evolves during the partnership, and suggests three mechanisms contributing to homogamy: initial sorting on current wealth, sorting on future wealth, and integration of resources in the partnership. These mechanisms are tested using data from the German Socio -Economic Panel, British Household Panel Survey, and UK Household Longitudinal Study. We estimate cor relations between partners' personal wealth by partnership duration and further distinguish between solely and jointly owned components as we expect accumulation in these to differ depending on the mechanism at play. First findings for Germany show that th e correlation of partners' personal wealth increases over partnership duration, providing preliminary evidence for the integration of resources as a key driver of wealth homogamy. 411 The Interplay of Intergenerational Family Positions and Wealth Traject ories in Life Phases Bettina H\u00fcnteler1, Theresa zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany. 3GESIS \u2014Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Mannheim, Germany. 4Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway Abstract Both, family structur es and wealth are strongly associated with individual well -being in different areas of life, including physical and mental health, and life satisfaction. Examining the interplay of family and wealth development is particularly interesting because both are slowly evolving long -term processes throughout the life course and prior research has widely acknowledged the short -term consequences of single family transitions (e.g., childbirth, death of a parent) for individual wealth holdings. What remains unclear, i s how the timing and the ordering of various family transitions as well as the time spent in certain vertical positions within the (multigenerational) family (e.g., being a parent and a child simultaneously), are associated with individual wealth accumulat ion patterns. Integrating the family life course perspective and research on the multigenerational transmission of wealth, this study compares family - wealth -trajectories of women and men in different life phases (early, mid, and late adulthood) using Norwe gian register data and a combination of various wealth indicators. Trajectories covering 25 years (between 1993 and 2017/2018) for the birth years 1953, 1963, and 1973 are investigated using multi -channel sequence and cluster analysis. We expect to find so me family patterns to be differently associated with wealth accumulation patterns reflecting unequal access to more advantageous wealth patterns based on family structure. The current analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of wealth transmission pr ocesses within multigenerational families and how they are embedded in the life course of individuals. 35 The Concentration of Wealth within Family Lineages: Clans as Units of Analysis Doron Shiffer 2Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel Abstract Wealth in the United States is unequally distributed between families. But most research in social stratification is rooted in a narrow conception of family rel ations that assumes that resources are transmitted predominantly from parents to children. This focus on parent -child dyads potentially obscures the role wealth plays across multiple generations and between extended family members. In this paper we employ an alternative conceptualization of the family - the clan - which includes multiple generations of extended family members, such as grandparents, uncles, aunts, and their offspring. We examine the role of clans by testing their influence on children's educ ational attainment using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Specifically, we compare the ability of clan wealth to predict children's education with that of parental wealth on the one hand, and parental and grandparental wealth on the other. Preliminary a nalyses show that associations between education and clan wealth are different from associations between education and other wealth measures. Additionally, clan wealth plays a different role for White and Black respondents vis -\u00e0-vis other forms of wealth, with stronger associations between clan wealth and education for White (compared with other sources of wealth) than for Black respondents. This paper therefore argues that a revised conceptualization of families is necessary to fully understand the extent to which families reproduce inequality. 228 Decomposing wealth mobility in the US: The role of education and income Rafael Carranza INET and DSPI, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract Using long -running panel data from the United States, I estimate the association between parent's housing wealth and the net wealth of their offspring. I contrast these estimates against measures of intergenerational persistence in income and education. To better understand the relationship between th ese three measures, I decompose the rank - rank slope for wealth into the contribution of the income and education of the offspring. Over the 1994 to 2019 period the rank -rank slope for wealth remained relatively stable, around 0.25. Overall, education and i ncome account for almost two thirds of that coefficient, with income accounting for the largest part. However, the influence of both factors has decreased over time, particularly in the aftermath of the Great Recession, going from 60% to 40%. These finding s are consistent with parental wealth playing the role of a buffer for their children, allowing them to take on high-risk and high -return choices. 183 Wealth and post -secondary educational enrollment. Where is parental wealth more effective? A European c omparison Jascha Marco Albertini4 1GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Mannheim, Germany. 2University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany. 3University of Trento, Trento, Italy. 4University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy Abstract Wealth has been found to play a key role in affecting offspring's education, over and above other family's SES measures in several countries. While previous research allow s us to conclude that wealth contributes to the intergenerational reproduction of educational inequality, findings are hardly comparable and broad international comparisons are missing. Applying harmonized data from the Household Finance and Consumption Su rvey (HFCS) for 15 European countries we focus on two aims: First, we will establish the sociological phenomenon that parental wealth plays a different role in promoting children's education - measured as enrollment in post -secondary education - across dif ferent European contexts. Second, we add further complexity to this relation, and we evaluate for each country where range differences in post -secondary enrolment emerge in the distribution of wealth by using polynomial regression models. Our preliminary r esults show a substantial positive association between gross wealth and post -secondary enrollment in most countries, with two different patterns emerging: in a first cluster (DE, EE, LU, SI, SK) the probability to enroll linearly increases with gross wealt h. In a second cluster (ES, FR, GR, HU, IT, PL, PT) the relationship is strongest around median values of gross wealth and attenuates at higher levels of gross wealth. Coffee & Poster Session 2 10:40 - 11:20 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 244 Occupational returns to PhD titles in contemporary Europe Gabriele Ballarino1, Stefano Cantalini2 1University of Milan, Italy. 2Stockholm University, Sweden Abstract This paper studies the labour market returns to doctoral titles in 14 Western European countries, aiming at ascertaining a) if the title provides an occupational advantage compared to tertiary graduates not holding a PhD, b) if this occupational advantage regards both the probability to be found in a service class job within or outs ide the academia, and c) if this occupational advantage varies according to structural variables related to the country. By means of linear probability models and multinomial logit models on European Labour Force Survey data (2009 -2015), preliminary result s show an advantage of PhDs in terms of both income and occupation in all countries. Moreover, PhDs have systematically higher probability to work in a service class occupation in the academia. Mediterranean countries are the ones where this advantage is h igher, but also where a disadvantage appears concerning the probability to be found in a non -academic service class job. 245 Why are female students graded better by their teachers? The role of students' personality traits of Koblenz Landau, Germany Abstract The comparison between grades and test scores is at the core of a recent stream of research that aim to assess gender grading bias, or the extent to which teachers grade more or less generously girls than boys when they have the same level of ability. Teac hers' grades depend not only on students' ability, but they also incorporate aspects of student's performance that go beyond the actual competence, including students' non -cognitive skills, personality traits and behaviours. The aim of this paper is unders tanding whether teachers evaluate girls higher than boys, and whether students' noncognitive skills, big five personality traits, and students' behaviour account for this gender grading gap. To this aim, we make use of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) Starting Cohort 3, which provides information on about 2000 students attending 7th grade in 2012. Firstly, to estimate gender grading bias we rely on the \"grade -equation\" approach, in which teachers' grades are expressed as a function of stud ents' gender, adjusted for students' standardized test score, and additional covariates capturing students' heterogeneity in socio -demographic characteristics. We use cumulative logit models with classroom fixed -effects, to obtain within - teacher across -students estimate. Secondly, we assess the mediating role of students' personality traits, noncognitive skills and behaviour through the KHB decomposition method, that allows the assessment of the role of non -cognitive indicators in explaining gender grading gap. Results show that teachers are more likely to give higher grades to girls than to boys in Language, and this gap is partially explained by students' personality traits and behaviour, especially conscientiousness. The unexplained variance left may stem from unobserved students' characteristics or (implicit) teacher discrimination. We discuss about how grade assessment based on noncognitive skills may have changed during the covid pandemic for online -teaching, and what might be the consequences for gende r bias in education 253 Wage inequality within and between firms: macroeconomic and institutional drivers in Europe Wouter Zwysen ETUI, Brussels, Belgium. University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom Abstract Rising wage inequality is disproportionately driven by widening differences in pay between firms. This can reflect that firms' workforces are increasingly homogenous but also that the pay of similar workers increasingly differs depending on the rents created in the firm and the way they are shared with the workforce. This paper uses cross -nationally representative European data from the Structure of Earnings Survey to study the trends in earnings and wage inequality over time between and within firms, linking these to changes in mac roeconomic and institutional factors. Earnings have converged between countries within Europe, hiding increasing inequality within countries, primarily driven by differences between firms. A substantial part of increased inequality is due to variation in w orking time and contracts. The remainder reflects both more sorting of workers into firms with other similar workers and a divergence in the premium firms pay. European economies face some common trends brought about by macroeconomic changes such as global isation and digitalisation. Even in the light of these major trends, differences in wage inequality within and between firms seem mainly to reflect institutional changes, particularly the changing coverage of pay agreements and union strength which shape i nequality within and between firms differently, as well as the presence and bite of minimum wages. While digitalisation and globalisation play a role in raising differences between firms, institutional factors seem to have a more substantial impact on the evolution of inequality within and between firms. 261 Stratified early family life courses and sex education policies in the United States Hannah Zagel1,2, Zachary Van Winkle3 1Humboldt -Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany. 2WZB Berlin Social Science Center, Berlin, Germany. 3Sciences Po, Paris, France Abstract This paper investigates the links between different approaches to sex education and young adults' partnership and parenthood trajectories across the United States. Contrary to many European countries that aim to increase fertility levels, policies in the United States focus on reducing teenage childbearing, which has been closely associated with socio -economic disadvantage. Within this context, abstinence and contraception have become competing ideals for sex education. Despite little evidence on the efficacy of abstinence -based education in promoting reproductive health or reducing teenage births, it i s still widely required across the United States. This paper uses sequence analysis with data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and information on sex education policies to examine the relationship between abstinence - and contraception -based s ex education curriculums and the early family life courses of men and women from age 15 to 25 across recent US birth cohorts. We find three typical patterns of early family life courses - early non -marital union formation, early non -marital parenthood, and singlehood, which are associated with young people's social position. The patterns align with prevailing sex education policies, but not in a straightforward manner. For example, states that require educators to stress abstinence as the best option in sex education such as Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Georgia, tend to display high shares of early non - marital parenthood trajectories. States that do not require abstinence to be taught, on the other hand, show mixed outcomes, such as high sha res of early non -marital childbearing in Kansas, singlehood in Massachusetts, or early union formation and singlehood in Iowa. 289 Peer effects in postgraduates' students - Evidence from a sample of elite Economics and Political Science, LONDON, United Kingdom. 2The University of Sheffield, United Kingdom Abstract Using a sample of postgraduate students at an elite educational institution we examine whether there are compositional effects of gender and native language on students' academic outcomes. We look into three outcomes: Grades, expectations of future perform ance, and influence among peers (leadership). We conducted a field experiment in a mandatory course of the Msc in International Social and Public Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). In this experiment, we randomised studen ts into study groups, thus generating exogenous variation in the gender composition of the groups, and on the distribution of native versus non - native English speakers (as well as any other demographic characteristics of students across groups). We use a peers effects model to estimate the effect of group composition on grades, self -perceived influence and expectations of academic performance. We find that (I) Students in groups with more women feel like their voice is heard more. This effect is driven by w omen. (II) Students in groups with more native speakers feel like their voice is heard less. This effect is driven by non -native speakers. (III) Students in groups with more native speakers lower their expectations: they become more pessimistic about thei r future academic achievement. 307 Social inequalities in school track choice: The relative importance of primary, secondary and tertiary effects across Italian provinces Moris Triventi, Emanuele Fedeli University of Trento, Trento, Italy Abstract Educa tional choices in Italy are plagued by large inequalities related to social origin. The crucial point is the transition to upper secondary school, typically occurring at age 14, when children leave comprehensive education and choose various educational pro grams with different curricular content and learning targets. The current literature consistently shows that while the majority of high social origin children attend upper secondary schools in the academic track, children with low parental education or in the working class are much more likely to attend technical and vocational. In parallel, some studies report large heterogeneity in test scores and educational standards across schools and Italian regions. We develop a bridge between these research streams, and we investigate whether the association between social background and school track choice is similar or systematically varies across geographical areas in Italy for recent cohorts of students. We also study for the first time how different mechanisms a ccount for such inequalities across 103 Italian provinces, thus providing a fine -grained picture of geographical variations. This allows us to establish whether inequality of opportunity related to parents' socioeconomic resources is more or less pronounce d in different geographical contexts and whether the reproduction of inequalities works in the same way across the country. This line of research suggests that there is still low attention to the within -countries analyses of educational efficiency and equi ty, and more empirical evidence is needed to better understand not only how much different regions vary in their educational outcomes but also in the way they \"produce\" certain educational outcomes and related inequalities. 313 Knowing me, knowing you: Socio -economic status and (segregation in) students' peer networks in primary school Dieuwke Zwier , Sara Geven University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands Abstract Peer relations in school comprise social capital that contributes to educat ional success. Especially students from disadvantaged backgrounds may benefit from resourceful peers, yet this social capital will mostly accrue to advantaged students if peer networks are segregated by socio -economic status (SES). Though prior research investigated how students of different SES backgrounds are sorted into different schools, few studies address the role of SES in affecting networks in school. We examine the tendency for friendship and intergenerational networks in primary school to structur e along socio -economic lines, and the extent to which these network processes are moderated by local opportunities for primary school choice. To do so, we collected multiplex classroom network data among Dutch students in their final year of primary school (grade 6; age 11 -12). We link these sociometric data to rich background information from administrative registers. We test our hypotheses using cross -sectional exponential random graph models. 314 The influence of study program characteristics on study intentions: Evidence from a factorial survey experiment Hans Dietrich1, Alexander Patzina1, Carina Toussaint1, Tobias Germany. 2Friedrich -Alexander -University Erlangen Nuremberg (FAU), Nuremberg, Germany Abstract The paper examines which features of study programs influence study intentions of adolescents. As the Bologna reform in 1999 has led to an ongoing internationalization of the higher education system and a more competitive environment for universities it is crucial to uncover relevant institutional characteristics that affect study choices and could be influenced by social policies and universities. We use data from a factorial survey experiment with 1,205 high school students and focus on the following dimensions: support services, supervision by professors, the content of learning, and the share of elective cours es in a study program. Based on sociological rational choice theory the dimensions are assumed to affect the perception of how risky a study decision is (cf., risky choice assumption) and might influence individuals from different socio -economic background s in different ways. As social stratification research shows that enrolment decisions are still highly dependent on SES and policy makers address SES gaps with various programs, it is important to investigate the potential heterogeneous effects of study pr ogram characteristics. Results based on random intercept models reveal that the investigated dimensions of study programs show highly significant and substantially relevant effects on individuals' study intentions. However, our analyses show that the chara cteristics of study programs rarely vary across SES. Data from previous panel waves reveal that school students of low SES have less information about studying in general and that their beliefs about studying differ compared to high SES students. This coul d be a possible explanation for the rather small SES differences. Analyses so far suggest that the SES gap in the transition to higher education is less likely to be influenced by adjusting study program characteristics, while reducing the information defi cit about higher education before students' educational intentions and beliefs are formed seems to be a promising starting point. 316 On labour market mobility Viktor Decker , Thijs Bol, Hanno Kruse University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands Abstract Career research has identified labour market mobility as fundamental driving force of individual career development and life course inequalities. However, labour market mobility is often defined equivocally, and applied conceptualisati ons vary widely between studies. Here, we propose a novel conceptualisation of labour market mobility that integrates and extends existing understandings. More specifically, we differentiate three distinct components of labour market mobility - organisatio nal mobility, occupational mobility and industrial mobility. This distinction is theoretically warranted, since all three forms of mobility differently affect the revaluation of human capital. In a second step, we apply this novel conceptualisation empiric ally to examine life -course differences in labour market mobility between vocational and general graduates. Limited capacities in labour market mobility, due to more narrow skill sets obtained during vocational education are frequently assumed to cause lat e-career disadvantages in wages and employment prospects. We test this explanation by applying the previously introduced conceptualisation. For the analysis, we use random -effects linear probability models on 26 waves of data from the German Socio -Economic Panel to estimate mobility prospects between organisations, occupations or industries over age separating educational groups and birth cohorts. In a second step, we assess underlying reasons for job termination by separating voluntary and involuntary job exits. Our findings indicate that inter -organizational mobility develops in different patterns over the life courses and across birth cohorts than mobility between occupations and industries. Further, we find that vocational graduates experience higher pro babilities to be mobile during mid and late career compared to general graduates which contradicts the common assumption of skill -based immobility. The second part of the analysis reveals that mainly involuntary job exits lead to these higher mobility rate s. In sum, our findings underscore that distinguishing different forms of mobility contributes to reveal patterns which enable a deeper understanding of labour -market -related differences over the life course. 318 Employment Trajectories Following Motherh ood: Changes over time in France and Germany Andreas Pascal Achard2, Corinna Frodermann1, Dana M\u00fcller1, Sander Wagner3,4 1Institute for Employment Research, Nuremberg, Germany. 2CREST - Center for Research in Economics and Statistics, Palaiseau Cedex, France. 3Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. 4Nuffield College, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract The transit ion to motherhood continues to be a crucial juncture for women's employment, career opportunities, and wages in many industrialized countries. However, the effects of motherhood on careers vary across institutional, policy, and normative contexts. These co ntextual circumstances differ between countries, but also over time. This includes the two largest countries in the EU, France and Germany. In Germany, childcare facilities became widely available only recently, mothers typically interrupt their employment for multiple years and work part -time long after childbirth. Recent trends reveal increasing labour -market attachment among mothers following a 2007 parental leave reform. In contrast, the French context encourages fast re -entry into employment and promot es full -time employment of mothers by providing comprehensive childcare services. Nevertheless, French mothers increasingly prefer part - time employment schemes to accommodate work and care obligations. Thus, the French and German models appear to be conver ging. However, a register -based longitudinal comparison of mothers' labour market participation and careers in both countries is lacking so far. Here, we present first results from a project using longitudinal employee register data from both countries, th e German SIAB and French DADS data. This data allows us to analyse detailed employment trajectories of mothers in both countries. The large sample sizes and long observation periods help us to study both the immediate and long - term employment consequences of motherhood, as well as to elucidate changes in these employment trajectories over time. The converging patterns of the effects of motherhood on careers in France and Germany are interpreted against the backdrop of institutional and policy changes in bot h countries. 323 Career Complexity No Longer on the Rise. Comparing the 1930s thru 1980s Birth Cohorts in Sweden Johan Westerman1, Dirk Witteveen2, Roujman Shahbazian3,1, Erik Bihagen1 1SOFI, Stockholm University, Sweden. 2University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. 3LMU -Munich, Munich, Germany Abstract There is a wide -spread idea that contemporary careers continue to become ever more complex. Pioneering research of full -career complexity has shown that work lives have indeed become more complex, yet at modest increasing pace. This paper examines whether career complexity continues to increase using Swedish registry data across an exceptionally long time period, including youn ger cohorts than in previous research: up to those born in 1983. For early careers, an increasing complexity trend is evident between the 1950s and 1960s birth cohorts, yet complexity fluctuates around a stable trend for the 1970s birth cohorts and onward. For mid -careers, which are considerably more stable on average, complexity has decreased among women born between the 1930s and the early -1950s. Our analysis affirms an initial shift to more career complexity in the 20th century, yet we find no unidirecti onal trend toward more career complexity over the last decades. 335 Grandparental responses to their grandchildren's endowment at birth Francesca Zanasi , Marco Cozzani European University Institute, Firenze, Italy Abstract A large literature has explored parental response to their children's endowment at birth, e.g., low birth weight (LBW). Yet, it only considered parents and ignored the extended family environment in which individuals form their life chances. Grandparents have, in fact, a central role as care providers, and social mobility studies have spotted their contribution to the intergenerational transmission of inequality. In this article, we aim at integrating grandparents in the literature on parental response to children's LBW, studying shared time and activities. Specifically, we aim at unveiling whether grandparents respond to (reinforcing or compensating) the condition of LBW. Moreover, we will explore whether the eventual response is stratified by family socio -economic status, and ho w it relates to (complementing or substituting) parents' one. Preliminary results, on the Growing up in Ireland cohort study, confirm the presence of a grandparental response, of different nature according to grandchildren's age. When grandchildren are 9 months old, grandparents help more often with housekeeping families of LBW children. When children are 3 years old, interestingly, grandparents are more likely to help LBW grandchildren with learning the alphabet and counting, suggesting a compensatory pat tern for early life disadvantage. 338 The financial dimension of stratification: Inequality among higher education institutions in Europe Petra Sauer1,2,3, -sur-Alzette, Luxembourg. 3Research Institute Economics of Inequality, Vienna University of Economics and Business, Vienna, Austria. 4Poznan University of Economics, Poznan, Polan d Abstract Our study aims to advance the knowledge on higher education (HE) stratification in European countries. Although much has been done so far on social stratification in HE in the context of inequalities in access, little is still know about the org anisational stratification, i.e. the vertical differentiation of higher education institutions in terms of their financial resources and prestige. To this end, we conceptualise and explore financial stratification in 22 countries in Europe, investigate whe ther financial inequality had changed over time (2011 -2020), and seek patterns and sources of cross -country differences. Using a novel database, the European Tertiary Education Register (ETER), we compute Gini indices and decile ratios based on the data on total expenditure and revenues as well as their components, and conduct a decomposition analysis. Our results reveal that changes over time are marginal. However, we observe substantial cross -country differences in inequality in revenues per student. Core public budget allocation turns out to be the main driver of those inequalities while the relevance of third -party funding and student fees is relatively small. Inequality levels are largely driven by discrepancies between the top and the bottom 10% of the distribution. 339 Digital Inequalities, Social Background, and Children's Outcomes in Ireland: A Longitudinal Study Melissa Bohnert , Pablo Gracia Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland Abstract Given the rapid innovation and proliferation of digital technologies in recent decades, studying how today's children use and are affected by such digital processes has key policy and scientific implications. Despite a growing body of literature studying the effects of digital technologies on child development, how 'the digital' affects the reproduction of social inequalities remains poorly conceptualised and studied. This paper will investigate dynamics of how child digital socialisation influences social ine quality in child development from middle childhood to late adolescence. Data from the 1998 'Child Cohort' of the Growing Up in Ireland (GUI) from ages 9, 13, and 17/18 will be analysed using Growth Curve and Fixed -Effects longitudinal models. Results show that (i) only heavy levels of digital use (3+ hours daily) are associated with decreases in socio -emotional well -being; (ii) negative effects of digital use on well -being are only significant for children from low -SES backgrounds, while moderate digital us e for children from high -SES was found to be positively associated with well -being outcomes; (iii) there is no significant associations between digital use and academic performance, and SES was not found to moderate the effects of digital time use on acade mic performance. 342 Inequality Begets Inequality? Income Inequality and Socioeconomic Achievement Gradients across the United States Joseph Workman University of Missouri, Kansas City, USA Abstract Social scientists have found income inequality is associated with an array of health and social problems, however the implications of income inequality for education are the subject of debate. Across 100 different areas (individual counties or collections of small counties) of the United Sta tes, I investigated how income inequality was associated with 1) average mathematics and reading achievement and 2) socioeconomic gradients in mathematics and reading achievement. Using data from the Kindergarten to Fifth Grade waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2011 (ECLS -K 2011), I found areas of the United States with higher income inequality had lower average achievement in mathematics and a larger socioeconomic achievement gradient in reading. The larger socioeconomi c gradient in reading arose because income inequality was associated with lower achievement among low SES and middle SES students and higher achievement among high SES students. 346 Learning gaps in times of crisis: How families and schools affect students' home learning time during the COVID -19 school closures Carla J. Grindel Berlin Social Science Center, Berlin, Germany. Humboldt -Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany Abstract International school closures due to the COVID -19 pandemic impo se a great disruption in the educational development of schoolchildren. This paper investigates inequalities in students' learning time at home. Of special interest is the question whether and how schools can reduce the gap in home learning time between ch ildren from high- and low -income families. Secondary students from lower -income families spend more than 15 percent less time learning than students from higher -income families. Around 40 percent of this income gap can be explained by the schools' provisio n of distance education. Furthermore, the schools' provision of offline lessons might have the potential to equalize learning time for these children. On the contrary, there are no significant income differences for primary students. However, the amount of lessons and feedback significantly enhances the learning time of children of all ages. These possibilities of schools to counteract educational inequalities is highly relevant for policy makers, schools and parents. 348 Who's Connected? Gender, Race -Ethnicity and Network Connections in the Faculty Job Market Kimberlee A. Shauman1, Jessica Gold2 1University of California, Davis, Davis, USA. 2Northeastern University, Boston, USA Abstract This paper presents a descriptive an alysis of race and gender differences in the intellectual and professional network connections of applicants for entry -level faculty positions in STEM fields at research universities. Using a unique dataset on faculty hiring linked with bibliometric data, we examine the network connections between multiple actors in the hiring network - the applicants, their references, the members of the faculty search committee, and the faculty in the hiring department. We measure three types of individual -level network c onnections: (1) intellectual collaboration, as indicated by co -authorship relationships; (2) direct intellectual connection, as indicated by the direct citation of one actor's work by another; and (3) indirect intellectual connection, as indicated by the e xtent to which the actors co -cite the same bodies of literature. We use multivariate models to test for differences by race and gender in the presence, quantity and quality of those network connections in the context of robust controls for the applicants' scholarly achievements and the characteristics of the faculty recruitments. 351 The gender gap in wealth: how do family and work trajectories impact on wealth? A comparative approach Maike Van Damme , Diederik Boertien CED, Barcelona, Spain Abstract We aim to explain gender differences in wealth at older ages, by examining how family and work life courses impact on wealth using data from six welfare regimes of the SHARE database. This paper is innovative in that it will adopt both a life cour se approach and cross -national comparative approach to examine the gender wealth gap. By looking at older ages of households that have a single adult, we capture as much of the employment and family life course that household heads may have experienced. In addition, it is in older ages that wealth differences will become particularly visible as wealth accumulates with age. Previous (cross -national comparative) studies found particularly small (or no) gaps at the mean and median and only larger gender differ ences at top percentiles of the wealth distribution, whereas our study on 50+ singles at the time of interview shows relatively large gender gaps at each point of the wealth distribution, thus contrasting many of the papers on the gender wealth gap that ha ve looked only to younger age groups. Surprising findings are that Spain and Ireland have a gender wealth gap in favour of women instead of men. Using Oaxaca decomposition analyses, we will try to disentangle why this is the case in these countries. Could it be that the high levels of home ownership in Spain and Ireland shield women from low wealth? Most importantly, we will describe country differences in the gender gap and their explanations, thereby improving our knowledge on to what extent life course t heory holds in different contexts in explaining the gender gap in wealth. 355 How is household employment uncertainty connected to children early skills development and well -being? Patterns and mechanisms in France. Marta Facchini1,2, Lidia Panico2, Carl o Barone1 1Sciences Po, France. 2INED, France Abstract Parental work trajectories are increasingly turbulent in European households. Employment uncertainty seems to have a negative impact on the psychophysical health of the workers, their spouses, and household stability. Less is known about its role for early childhood development. We use data from the longitudinal survey ELFE carried out in France. ELFE is a nationally representative study that follows about 18.000 children from their birth in 2011. W e use the first four waves, collected about every year. First, we investigate the link between household employment uncertainty (HEU) and children's i) cognitive skills development, ii) soft skills development, and iii) well -being , using Ordinal Least Squa res and the Linear probability model. Second, in the framework of the family investment model (FMI) and the family stress model (FSM), we explore the mechanisms that mediate the association between persistent HEU and children outcomes, using structural equ ation models. The preliminary results suggest that HEU has a significative role in the intergenerational reproduction of inequality through early language and cognitive skills development. Concerning language skills in particular, maternal employment uncer tainty seems to damaging even when the father hold a permanent job. The disadvantage seems to accumulate when both parents experience employment uncertainty and when HEU is persistent over time. Preliminary results of the mediation analysis seem to confirm that HEU affects cognitive skills development through household income and parental stress. Contrary to what the literature found in the liberal welfare stare regimes, both soft skills development and child health do not seem to be associated with househo ld employment uncertainty. 361 House rich or house poor? Cash rich or cash poor? Income and housing of Milan, Milan, Italy Abstract The literature on the link between housing conditions and the accumulation of economic resources is currently underdeveloped. Previous studies have shown that homeownership is n ot only for the richest social groups. In fact, not all poor households live in rent and not all rented households are poor. This evidence suggests that homeownership does not guarantee from the risk of being in a poverty condition, defined as a resource d eficit that compromises the achievement of an acceptable standard of living, although it can be associated with a high degree of well -being and social protection. To provide a picture of the evolution of the shaping of socioeconomic inequalities in the lig ht of the decline in living and material conditions due to the great financial crisis of 2008, this contribution investigates the relationship between poverty condition and housing tenure between 1995 to 2016 in Italy. Furthermore, it considers how birth c ohort and social position may contribute to different patterns of socio -economic advantage and disadvantages. Through the Italian Survey on Household income and wealth (SHIW) data, our preliminary results show that homeownership still represents an element of protection from the risk of being poor. However, the findings suggest that the probability of being house rich -cash poor is residual in the population. Finally, there are significant differences by cohort and educational level in the probability of bei ng house rich -cash rich and house poor -cash rich. 362 Partner markets and interracial marriage: the contextual determinants of racial exogamy in Brazil Weverthon Machado Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands Abstract How do marriage market constraints shape mate choice? Which group boundaries people are willing or successful in crossing, and under which conditions? Brazil is an interesting context to study those questions, notably because of a long-standing sociological puzzle: miscegenation and frequent interracial marriage have historically coexisted with persistent racial inequalities. This has led to a variety of conclusions about the educational gradient of intermarriage and the extent of status exchange between race and education. Previ ous studies have also shown that the racial distribution of local marriage markets is key to the variation in levels of intermarriage in Brazil. But no study has investigated how subnational contexts might shape the patterns of interracial marriage in the country, a gap that the present research aims to fill. Particularly, the paper addresses three questions: (1) does the educational gradient of intermarriage persist when accounting for geographical variation in population composition? (2) does the effect o f education on intermarriage vary across geographical contexts? and (3) do contextual - and individual -level factors interact in shaping the likelihood of intermarriage? I use data from the Continuous National Household Sample Survey (PNADC), a large survey that produces results for several geographical levels in Brazil. Measures of local marriage market conditions are derived using metropolitan areas as geographical units. Multilevel models are used to investigate the effects of individual and contextual fa ctors in the odds of racial intermarriage. Preliminary results suggest that (1) relative group size is a consistent predictor of endogamy for all groups; (2) the asymmetrical effects of education (more education increases odds of interracial marriage for n on-white but decreases for white people) persist even when accounting for the geographical variation in population composition; (3) the demographic constraints of group size are slightly weaker for highly educated white people. 382 Over -time change and social stratification of teenager's time Fasang5,6 France. 2Nuffield College, Oxford, United Kingdom. 3Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, Oxford, United Kingdom. 4Department of Social Policy and Intervention, Oxford, United Kingdom. 5Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany. 6WZB Berlin Social Science Centre, Berlin, Germany Abstract The combination of activities that teenagers engage in during their everyday lives is likely to have strong implications for their wellbeing, development, and further life course. Yet there is little evidence on the patterns of everyday activities of teenagers, how they have changed over time and how they are socially structured. This study uses sequence, cluster and regression analyses to analyze unique data from teenager's time -use diaries contained in the German Time Use Data. We aim (1) to identify the principal patterns of time -use amongst teenagers aged 10 to 16 on weekdays (after school) and during weekends, (2) to show how their relative prominence has changed between the early 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, (3) to examine how common patterns of time -use differ between boys a nd girls, across different age groups and between teenagers of from different socio -economic backgrounds. We find nine common time -use patterns of teenagers during weekdays and six common time -use patterns during weekends. Over the three decades observed, it has become increasingly common for teenagers to spend most of the day in front of a screen, while being engaged in social activities for most of the day has become less common. Boys, older teenagers and children from disadvantaged socio -economic backgro unds are particularly prone to spend most of the day in front of a screen. Our study raises important questions for the consequences of over -time change and social inequality in teenager's time - use for their wellbeing and development, and for the intergen erational transmission of social disadvantage. 390 Social Mobility Across the Pacific: Japanese immigrant population in the Continental United States during the Age of Mass Migration Tate Kihara Brown University, Providence, USA Abstract Recent studies on the historical social mobility of immigrants in the United States during the 'Age of Mass Migration' (mid-19th to early -20th century) have found very weak persistence of first -generation immigrants' pre -migration family characteristics among the ir second -generation children. However, such extant studies have focused on European origin groups (e.g., Italians and Irish) and have neglected non -European population that migrated at the same historical period but were incorporated in different social, legal and cultural contexts. Using historical, linked, multigenerational survey data of Japanese immigrants (Japanese American Research Project survey), I explore the multi - and inter -generational persistence of the 'zeroth' generation (i.e., Japanese gran dparents of the second - generation) and first -generation immigrants' pre -migration socio -economic and cultural family background on second - generation socio -economic attainment in the United States. My results reveal that both grand -parental and parental pre-migration socio -economic and cultural background had strong positive association with second -generation attainment, net of post -migration first -generation. fairness of earnings evaluations Sandra Gilgen1,2, Christoph Zangger3,4 1LMU Munich, 2University of Bern, Switzerland. 3University of Zurich, Switzerland. 4LMU, Germany Abstract This contribution asks how people distribute scarce resources (money) in a work context (hospital setting) using a distributional survey experiment (DSE) included in a representative survey in Switzerland. The most important advantage of a DSE over other survey experiments is that we can take the interdepen dency of earnings allocations among the people included in a choice set into account. In addition, we are able to directly quantify their tastes for (in)equality in monetary terms. We find that people consider both merit and need in their allocation decisi ons, as well as the occupational position of the vignette person, paying a physician 3'100 Swiss Francs more per month than a cleaner in the same hospital. A higher dedication to the job is rewarded with an additional 850 Swiss Francs, while employees with children receive an additional 320 Swiss Francs. Women are paid about 230 Swiss Francs less than men, while people with an Arabic or a Slavic name receive about 280 Swiss Francs less. However, while people with no migration background choose to pay consi derably less to people with a Slavic or an Arabic name, migrants from Southern Europe and those from Slavic countries do not differentiate between the ethnic groups. Meanwhile, people who self -classify as higher class choose to pay relatively higher amount s to the physician compared to the nurse and cleaner. Moreover, these heterogenous allocation decisions affect the amount of income inequality: People in higher self -reported class position, with a higher personal income and those with a migration backgrou nd from Western Europe tend to distribute more unequally. Our findings stress the importance of in -group favoritism of people in advantaged positions: People with no migration background and those in higher position not only give less to the less privileg ed, but their distribution decisions also increase overall inequality. 443 Does Working from Home Hinder Career Progression? The Gender and Family Perspectives Agnieszka Kasperska University of Warsaw, Poland Abstract This article examines the relationship between home -based work and career prospects for employees from 29 European countries. Although home -based work is becoming increasingly prevalent, not enough is known about its impact on employee evaluation. Considering that remote workers ar e as productive as office based workers (Siha & Monroe, 2006), have higher job satisfaction (Gajendran & Harrison, 2007) and encounter fewer workplace distractions (Nardi & Whittaker, 2002), they should experience good career outcomes. However, lack of pee r and supervisor interaction, combined with a threat of being less visible at work and having poorer access to training and development programs (Martinez & Gomez, 2013) could hinder career progression. The following article attempts to explore the working conditions of home -based work and incorporates the gender and family perspectives, something that is particularly missing in the existing literature. The aspects of career development prospects included in the article pertain to perceived promotion opport unities, access to training, job visibility, rapport with supervisor and colleagues as well as job stability. Multilevel modelling was applied to cross -sectional data of the European Working Conditions Survey, which was additionally merged with country -level data of Family Policies Sub -Index in order to grasp the potential moderating effects of national contexts. The findings indicate positive associations for male home - based workers, both fathers and non -fathers, and mostly negative associations for female home -based workers, especially for mothers. Varying associations of different home -based work frequencies are observed. Family -friendly policies moderate the strength of the negative relationships between home -based work and career development opportuniti es. 444 Cuts in Social Security Allowances during Early Childhood and Future Scholastic Achievements Dana Shay1, Esther Adi -Japhne2, Yossi Shavit3 1Tel Aviv University, Israel. 2Taub Center for Social Policy Research in Israel, Israel. 3Bar Ilan University, Israel Abstract This study assesses the impact of drastic cuts in child and social security allowances on children's cognitive development, as indicated by their subsequent sch olastic achievement. We exploit a natural experiment, which allows for a comparison of scholastic achievements, in 5th grade, of subjects whose families benefited from generous social security allowances and to those who were born after dramatic cut in all owances. In 2003 child allowances and social security benefits were greatly reduced, especially, for poor families and those with three or more children. We analyze population data for persons born in Israel in the years 1999 -2000 and 2004 - 2005, their par ents and their siblings. During early childhood - a formative period in human development - the former cohorts benefitted from more generous allowances, whereas the latter cohorts suffered from drastic cuts. The data are drawn from a variety of administra tive sources, which were compiled, at our request, by the Central Bureau of Statistics. The dependent variable in the analysis is 5th grade standardized test scores in math. We test two main hypotheses: (1) The scholastic achievements (adjusted for contro ls) of cohorts born after the cuts in allowances was lower than those of cohorts who spend their early childhood under a regime of generous allowances. (2) This difference was more pronounced among subjects belonging to large and poor families, who suffere d most of cuts in child and social security allowances. Both hypotheses are corroborated in the data. 225 Equivalence Scales for Measuring In -Work Poverty in Europe Claudia Colombarolli1, Marianna Filandri2 1University of Bologna, Italy. 2University of Turin, Italy Abstract Previous studies have shown that the implementation of different equivalence scales relevantly affect poverty rates and the composition of the poor, with significant implications for who is eligible for income support measures and who is not. We intend to advance this literature by examining how changes in equivalence scales affect the measurement of in-work poverty, namely, the poverty of working households adopting a comparative perspectiv e. We expect that the OECD modified scale - which is the one generally implemented to measure in -work poverty - mostly underestimates the risk of working households since they tend to be larger, to have higher everyday expenses (e.g., transports) and less time to make economies of scale than non -working households. To test our hypotheses, we draw on 2018 EU -SILC cross -sectional data since it contains information on income, households' size and composition and assessment of required income. Results show that the application of the OECD modified scale rather than the old OECD scale (that assumes lower economies of scale) excludes the great majority of the working households from the poor population, in all countries. Also, for equal levels of income, working h ouseholds are more likely to judge their income as insufficient to make ends meet compared to non -working households. This could be linked to higher costs and lower capacity to do economies of scale. 264 Reframing active labor market policy: Experimental evidence of training vouchers for unemployed Lukas Lehner1, Anna Schwarz2 1Department of Social Policy and Intervention, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. 2Vienna University of Economics and Business, Vienna, Austria Abstract As a core element of active labor market policies, public employment services provide costless training to jobseekers aimed at increasing skills, improving matching and supporting social mobility of those worst off in the labor market. However, many unempl oyed are reluctant to participate, with training viewed as a burden or punishment. So why are unemployed reluctant to have their 'free lunch'? In our field experiment, we designed multiple different treatment arms to separate out direct effects of raising awareness, strengthening reciprocity and autonomy, and reducing asymmetric information. Treatment is assigned randomly and consists solely of different bits of information provided to jobseekers, some containing a voucher up to 15'000 Euros to be redeemed for training offers by the public employment service. We run the intervention on 11'000 jobseekers that make up the entire unemployed population with a spell of 3 to 4 and 6 to 12 months in one Austrian state. Initial results demonstrate the benefits of st rengthening reciprocity and autonomy of jobseekers towards the public employment service on their training participation. They also suggest positive effects of raising awareness though overall below the conventional significance threshold. Much to our surp rise, adding additional information on open job vacancies cancels out any gains from the voucher. Following our heterogeneity analysis and a large -scale participant survey, we infer that those jobs with many open vacancies are of ill reputation, poor quali ty and do not match jobseekers' demands. Thus, reducing asymmetric information on the labor market demotivates most jobseekers. Only jobseekers with the weakest employment prospects react with an increase in training participation - a sensitive finding in light of social policy debates on how to react to labor shortages arising in the Post -Covid -19 world. 219 Welfare State Policy and Educational Inequality: A Cross -National Multi -Cohort Study Kevin Schoenholzer , Kaspar Burger Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development, University of Zurich, Switzerland Abstract Research has shown that children's educational achievement is strongly linked to their social background. Social inequality in achievement manifests itself before children enter schoo l, indicating that non -school factors play a critical role. A lack of investment in a child's education early on has been shown to have lifelong consequences in terms of educational outcomes. Researchers have argued that welfare state policies such as publ icly funded early childhood education and care (ECEC), parental leave and family benefits spending can lessen the influence social background has on educational outcomes, providing a supplementary source of early life investment and support to the most vulnerable. Whether these welfare policies reduce social inequality in educational achievement remains unclear. We analyze whether the welfare state context in which children spend their early childhood years (ages 0 -5) predicts the association between parent al education and student achievement at age 10. We match country - and individual - level indicators to country -cohorts. We combine data from two large -scale student assessments, TIMSS assessment waves in 2011, 2015 and 2019 (Ncountries =28, Nstudents =344'5 48), and PIRLS 2016 (Ncountries =24, Nstudents =249'400), with contextual data from the OECD and World Bank. We estimate multilevel models to assess whether welfare state policies predict the strength of the link between parent al education and a child's educational achievement. Results show that in countries with longer paid parental leaves, the association between parental education and student achievement was stronger. Public ECEC spending decreased the association between par ental education and student achievement. In countries with higher levels of family benefits spending, the link between parental education and a child's educational achievement was weaker. This study provides empirical evidence for modest, yet significant i nfluence welfare state policy programs can have on social inequality in student achievement. 175 Social identity, social inclusion policies and social cohesion in European democracies. Ibrahim O Akinyemi , Martin Gross, Volker Lang Eberhard -Karls Universi ty of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany Abstract Democracies in Europe, as elsewhere, have been faced with declining trust in institutions and political processes or, more general, a decrease in vertical social cohesions (Norris and Inglehart, 2018; Pew Resear ch Center, 2019). Despite the importance of sustaining democracies and the fact that questions of identity have been prominent in public discourse, only few studies have put a focus on the development of social identity threats and its implications for soc ial cohesion. This study seeks to answer the research question \"do social inclusion policies moderate the effect of social identity on vertical social cohesion\"? The theoretical framework used here follows that recognition is scarce and competed for (Tajfe l & Turner, 1986; Rottiers, 2010) which puts people who demand equal recognition (isothymic social identity) in competition with people who want their demand for superior recognition (megalothymic social identity) to be respected (Fukuyama, 2018). It is ex pected therefore that social inclusion policies will threaten the latter (compared to the former) and consequently make them show low commitment to institutions providing such policies, and vice versa. A two -stage multilevel analysis is used with micro dat a from the European Social Survey (rounds 1 -9) and macro data from independent sources to test this hypothesis. The results indicate that increase in social inclusion policies threaten megalothymic identities, while they support the claims towards isothymi c identities. In consequence, these policies foster a polarisation of social groups with respect to vertical social cohesion. Life Course and Mobility - Session 5 11:20 - 13:00 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 1. Sheikh Zayed Theatre Session 5 437 The Intergenerational Transmission of Socioeconomic Status and Intragenerational Income Mobility Over the Early Adult Life Course of Canadian Men and Women Xavier St -Denis1, Chih -lan Canada. 2McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, Canada Abstract The objective of this paper is to provide evidence of the relationship between intergenerational income transmission and intragenerational economic mobility. More specifically, we aim to provide novel results on whether rate of income growth over age is higher among children of higher -income families in Canada, and what factors may account for eventual differences. Among those factors, we examine the role of educati on, as well as factors related to the early adult life course, post labour market entry, including childbirth and couple status. We find that although inequalities based on parental income levels are observed in the early life course, they are exacerbated by the steeper income growth experienced by children of higher income parents between 22 and 35 years old, especially among men. While these patterns seem to be associated with differences in educational attainment, we also find an important role for post-labour market entry factors such as labour force attachment. We find important gender differences in these patterns, driven in part by flatter income growth among more privileged women compared to more privileged men. This last pattern is in part driven by the negative association between childbirth and income among women. 116 A Tale of Two Cohorts: Educational Differentials in Labor Market Outcomes Cumulated over the of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA. 3University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel Abstract Young adults in the United States today face unwelcoming employment prospects. To what extent does college education guaran tee young adults today to attain a 'good' job that would enable them to be economically independent and stable? Although numerous studies have compared labor market outcomes between college -educated and non - college -educated young adults in the contexts of growing labor market uncertainty and rising economic inequality, their 'snapshot' approach is limited to show cumulative experiences of young adults over time. In this paper we examine whether educational differences in early labor market outcomes narrow o r widen over the life span and how Young Baby Boomers and Millennials differ therein. To trace young individuals' labor market outcomes over the life -course and across cohorts, we used data from NLSY -1979 cohort (born 1957 -64) and NLSY -1997 cohort (born 19 80- 84). Instead of a snapshot approach that measures a labor market outcome in one -time point, we assess cumulative outcomes over the early life course, between ages 22 and 35. First our findings show that until age 35, Young Baby Boomer men cumulated almo st $86,450 more than their Millennials counterparts. Although the overall amount is less, a similar difference between the two cohorts is also observed among women. Focusing on education we find that for both men and women the gap in cumulative income betw een Young Baby Boomers and Millennials diverges over the early life course. By age 35, Millennials cumulate significantly less amount of income compared to Young Baby Boomers who were similarly educated. Despite the cohort difference, it is notable that wi thin each cohort for both men and women, young adults with higher levels of education cumulate more income than their lower -educated counterparts. The marginal effect of a bachelor's degree seems to be greater for Young Baby Boomers than Millennials at old er ages, especially among men. 270 Origins, Expectations, and Educational Attainment: A Life Course Perspective Kaspar Burger1,2, Diego Strassmann Rocha1 1University of Zurich, Switzerland. 2University College London, United Kingdom Abstract Individuals from more advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds and those with loftier future expectations typically have higher educational attainment. The question that arises, however, is which of these is the stronger predictor \u2014 individuals' socioeconomic or igins or their expectations about their future socioeconomic status. We address this question by analyzing educational attainment as it relates to transitions in a system that offers multiple educational tracks. We focus on transitions from lower - to upper -secondary education (academic vs. vocational track), and from upper -secondary to tertiary education (university vs. other). We use data from a longitudinal study that investigated individuals' life trajectories between the ages 15 and 30 ( N = 4,986, 56% f emale, 13% immigrants). Results from nonlinear path models show that both young people's socioeconomic origins and their future expectations were significantly associated with the probability of moving along academic paths and into university, but expectat ions about the future had a significantly stronger predictive power than socioeconomic origins. We conclude that future expectations are powerful inner resources that steer educational trajectories and influence what individuals can attain in life, ultimat ely enabling intergenerational social mobility. 81 Cumulative Advantage and Disadvantage Across the Life Course for Jewish and Palestinian Women in Israel 2Humboldt University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany. 3University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel Abstract Cumulative (dis -) advantages across the life course likely amount to greater inequalities between ethno -religious groups than indicators measured at a single time point. This study uses, sequence and cluster analysis, and regression methods on new administrative data from the Israeli census and tax registers to assess cumulative advantage and disadvantage from early adulthoo d to mid -life of Jewish and Palestinian Israeli women. We identify six typical work -family life course profiles and relate them to accumulated earnings at mid -life. Israeli Jewish women accumulate multiple advantages from early to mid -adulthood, whereas, a mong Israeli Palestinians, Muslim women are most disadvantaged both in initial status and in accumulating disadvantages. Muslim Palestinian women face labor market disadvantages that are unrelated to their family lives and mainly results from their de -facto exclusion from non -precarious private sector work. Public sector careers are the only viable economically secure path for a small group of Muslim women, coupled with relatively late family formation and moderate fertility. Work -family reconciliation poli cies are promising to further enhance Jewish mother's employment and earnings, but are unlikely to benefit Palestinian women's economic standing, who rely on general labor market integration measures and their inclusion into the private sector. 31 Inter generational class mobility in the life course of several birth cohorts in West Germany (1945 -2008): A Long -term Longitudinal Analysis Identifying Age, Period, and Cohort Effects Rolf Becker1, Hans -Peter Blossfeld2, Karl Ulrich of Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany. 3Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany Abstract Initiated by the critics on recent practices in mobility research, structures and change of intergenerati onal mobility is explained from the view of life course research. First, it is developed a theoretical model linking structural change and individuals' action in terms of mobility. Second, a dynamic multi -level design taking different time dimensions (age, period, and cohort) systematically into account is suggested. Third, event history analysis is utilized for APC analysis of social mobility. First, a decreasing dynamic of social mobility across ageing is supposed when historical periods and timing of bir th is controlled for. Second, it is proposed that processes of social change across historical periods such as economic modernisation and cycles labour market conditions have an impact on social mobility at different stages in the individuals' life course. Third, cohort effects in terms of demographic metabolism and timing of labour market entry would be revealed when the mobility process is observed across life courses and periods. For the empirical demonstration, longitudinal data of German life history s tudies are used for social mobility in post -war periods in West Germany. This analysis provides for women and men in several birth cohorts that highly aggregated mobility table analysis under -estimate social fluidity as well as it is not able to reveal soc ial mechanisms and causal processes essential for understanding change in class structures. Methods and Mobility (III) - Session 5 11:20 - 13:00 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 2. Wolfson Theatre Session 5 60 Educational Transitions and Family Background Effects: A Sibling Study Kristian B Karlson University of Copenhagen, Denmark Abstract Since Mare's (1981) pioneering work, sociologists have conceptualized and modeled educational attainment as a sequential process of school continuation decisi ons. I advance this framework by bringing in siblings to study how family background shapes these decisions. I use a latent class modeling framework in which families are divided into clusters of families with distinct educational transition patterns. I su bsequently model membership of these clusters as a function of observed family characteristics. I apply this framework to the 1973 Occupational Changes in a Generation survey that Mare originally analyzed. I find that families can be grouped into six clust ers with distinct transition patterns. Membership of these clusters varies significantly with parental SES and other sociodemographic characteristics, with high -SES families being much more likely to have high educational transition rates across all transi tions. Thus school continuation decisions are heavily influenced by family background. I discuss how my framework and results compare to the conventional framework used in the literature. 179 All that glitters is not gold: addressing the effect of parental education on children's attainment. Mar Espadafor1, Alicia Garc\u00eda Sierra2 1European University Institute, Florence, Italy. 2Nuffield College, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract The association between parental education and children's educational out comes has been long studied. However, standard cross -sectional analyses often present endogeneity problems and fail to explore which parental characteristics drive these processes. In this article, we focus on the role of parental education. We explore if (1) changes in parental education are related, in the long term, to children's educational attainment and if (2) differential returns to schooling have implications for the overall transmission of educational (dis)advantages. Using data from the Labour For ce Survey (1998 -2019), we leverage the Spanish 1983 educational reform to estimate the causal effect of parental education on children's likelihood of early dropout and grade retention. We contribute to the literature by proposing educational reforms as an exogenous measure to explore inter -generational processes and by providing a new analytical example from southern Europe. Preliminary results suggest that exogeneous increases in educational attainment translate into better educational outcomes for future generations. 271 The shadow of peasant past: Seven generations of inequality persistence in Northern Sweden Martin H\u00e4llsten, Martin Kolk Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden Abstract We use administrative data linked to parish records from Northern Sweden to study multigenerational inequality in education, occupations, and wealth from historical to contemporary times. Our data cover seven generations and allows us to follow ancestors of individuals living in Sweden around the new millennium back more than 200 years, covering the mid -18th century to the 21st century. In our sample of around 75,000 traceable descendants, we analyze (a) up to 5th cousin correlations and (b) dynastic correlations over seven generations based on aggregations of ancestors' social class/status. With both approaches, we find that past generations structure life chances many generations later, even though mobility is very high. The persistence we find using cousin and dynastic correlations is much higher compared to a simple Markov model limited to sequential parent -child transfers, but we also find that direct ancestor associations are very small. This suggests that there is a weak but constant kinship influence that attenuates slowly over generations. 276 Stratified diversity? Application strategies and admission chances for medical schools in Germany Claudia Finger1, Benjamin Elbers2, Heike Solga1,3 1Berlin Social Science Center, Berlin, Germany. 2University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. 3Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany Abstract As demand for prestigious higher education options is high, good grades and test scores are often not sufficient to get admitted, but applicants need to apply strategically to secure a place at top institutions or fields. Application strategies, in turn, might differ by social background because of information asymmetries and varying support from within students' social networks and thus eventually translate in to socially unequal admission chances. Using applications to the highly prestigious medical programs in Germany as an example, we investigate social background differences in application strategies and related admission chances. Our empirical strategy is t wofold: In a first explorative step, we use application register data from 2012 to 2018 to detect different application patterns by means of a cluster analysis (K -prototypes clustering algorithm). Second, we use the resulting model to predict membership on survey data of the 2018 applicant cohort that contain detailed information on socio -economic background, preferences and motivation of applicants. 204 When analyzing intergenerational mobility, be cautious about the timing of the measurement of children 's occupational position Richard Nennstiel University of Bern, Switzerland Abstract In studies of absolute intergenerational mobility, the occupational position of the children's generation is often measured relatively early in the life course (at ages 30-35) or over a very wide time span (at ages 30 -65). The usage of these measurement time points is based on the assumption that occupational maturity is reached in the mid -30s and thus only minor changes should occur thereafter. Therefore, cohort compar isons can be made either at the same age or \u2014 since intragenerational processes should be largely completed \u2014 at different points in the life course. If this assumption about occupational maturity does not hold \u2014 e.g., because intragenerational career patt erns have changed across birth cohorts \u2014 this could lead to underestimating rates of upward mobility and overestimating rates of downward mobility in younger birth cohorts. The question to be answered in this paper is to what extent absolute occupational mobility patterns are affected by the age of measurement of occupation in the child generation? To answer this question, I use two large -scale panel data sets from Germany (N NEPS = 9,839, N GSOEP = 12,770). To determine changes in mobility patterns over tim e, I formed nine 5 -year birth cohorts; 1944 -1948, 1949 -1953, 1954 - 1958, 1959 -1963, 1964 -1968, 1969 -1973, 1974 -1978, 1979 -1983, and 1984 -1988. Occupational prestige (Magnitude Prestige Score) was measured at different points in the life course: at ages 28 -32, 33 -37, 38 -42, and 43 -47. My results suggest that if occupational prestige is measured very early in the life course, a trend toward less upward mobility emerges, as in many recently published studies. If measured later in the life course \u2014 when younger cohorts have also had a chance to reach occupational maturity \u2014 there is little change across cohorts. Hence, the timing of the measurement of occupational position has a large impact on the analysis of absolute mobility patterns. Genes, Gender and Edu cation - Session 5 11:20 - 13:00 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 3. Alumni Theatre Session 5 222 Transgressing gendered occupational boundaries: Genes, stereotypes and Germany. 2Bielefeld University, Germany. 3Center for Research in Economics and Statistics, France Abstract Recent advances in molecular genetic data generated novel insights for how genetic variation shapes social stratification and how this differs across contexts. Yet, these insights have been mostly limited to forms of vertical stratification, such as educat ional attainment or income. By contrast, we turn to a measure of horizontal stratification by analyzing occupational sex segregation and women' and men's sorting into different occupations. As skills and values have been shown to be associated with both - genetic variation and occupational choices - matching of employees' skills and occupational requirements likely induce heritability of occupational choices. Gendered occupational stereotypes might yet suppress this matching mechanism or by contrast, could open another pathway for the influence of genetics via personality attributes that support deviations from these stereotypes. Based on 290,000 participants of the UK Biobank, we first estimate the variance in gender -atypical occupations of men and women t hat can be attributed to genetic differences Results reveal a moderate SNP -heritability of 7.8 percent for the share of female employees in men's occupations and a significantly lower SNP -heritability (3.4 percent) for the share of male employees in women' s occupations. This corresponds to previous findings of cultural and institutional constraints suppressing the realization of women's genetic potential and leading to lower heritability compared to men. In a second step, the genetic correlations provide ev idence that both mechanisms - the matching of skills and occupational requirements as well as openness to deviate from stereotypes - underlie the heritability. 376 Gender differences in genetic influences on education and income Antonie Knigge1, Ineke Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands. 3RIVM, Netherlands Abstract Women are higher educated than men in many countries nowadays, but women still earn a lower income. We expect that the social constraints that women face on the labor market (e.g., discrimination, gender norms) limit their opportunities to capitalize on th eir talents, which should be reflected in a suppression of the influence of genes on the income for women. We test this expectation by applying twin methods from behavioral genetics to Dutch administrative data on the education and income of 47,290 same -sex twins and 44,519 same -sex siblings. First, we find that genes explain 63% of the variation in education for women, and only 46% for men. This is in line with our expectation that the reversal of the gender gap in education means women have more opportuni ties than men to realize their genetic potential for education. Second, genes explain 55% of income differences among men and 48% among women. While genetic influences on income that operate via education are comparable for men and women, genetic influence s on income independent of education are larger for men than women. This supports the idea that social constraints limit women's opportunities to realize their potential on the labor market. With this study, we do not only give insight in the mechanisms un derlying gender inequalities in education and income, but we also contribute to the growing literature on how genes and environments interact. 62 The Nature -Nurture of Academic Achievement at the Intersection between Gender, Family Background, and School Context Kim Stienstra1, Kristian B Karlson2 1Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands. 2University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark Abstract Although schools are key socializing contexts in children's lives, they do not appear to affect all children's academic achievement in the same way. Schools likely impact students from different family backgrounds differently, and also affect boys and girls differently. We investigate the role of gender, family SES, school SES, and their intersection in educational achievement using a twin design. Genetic potential may be more fully realized in high -SES environments, leading to larger genetic variance and smaller shared environmental variance in such environments (i.e., bioecological model, Scar -Rowe inte raction). Conversely, high -SES environments may also compensate the expression of genetic vulnerability, implying smaller genetic and larger shared environmental variance in high -SES environments (i.e., diathesis -stress model). Based on the idea that boys are more sensitive to environmental factors, we expect the gene -environment interaction to be stronger for boys. Using administrative data on 33,500 Danish twin and sibling pairs, we report three main findings. First, genetic influences play a larger role in high -SES families (but not in high -SES schools), following the diathesis -stress model. Second, this is further moderated by gender: in high - SES families, the genetic influence is considerably lower for boys. Third, the moderating effect of family SES fo r boys is almost entirely driven by children attending low -SES schools. Genetic influences play a much smaller role among high-SES boys who attend low -SES school (and common environmental influences play a comparably larger role for this group of children) . 420 Do high -SES parents compensate for genetic risk for poor educational achievement in offspring? A pre -registered genetically sensitive study Gaia Ghirardi1, Italy. 2European Commission, Seville, Spain. 3Vrije Universiteit (VU), Department of Biological Psychology, Amsterdam, Netherlands. 4Department of Sociology II at the Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia, Madrid, Spain Abstract The persistent transmission of educational (dis)advantages over generations is well -documented in social stratification research, but we know less about specific mechanisms. Drawing from rational action theories, the compensatory advantage mechanism (CAM) predicts that negative traits or events for educational achievement \u2014i.e., low birth weight or endowments \u2014are not or little consequential for advantaged children compared with disadvantaged peers. However, with mixed findings, previous evidence on compensat ory patterns for early -life unfortunate events or traits is scarce, mainly when applied to genetic endowments for educational attainment. This article tests whether high -SES families compensate for bad luck in the genetic lottery for educational achievemen t. Using data from a genotyped sample of twins and siblings from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), we build polygenic scores (PGS) for cognitive and non -cognitive skills, and we regress different educational outcomes \u2014GPA, test scores and track choice \u2014on both PGS stratifying by parental SES. We combine a between - and within -family design to account for different sources of confounding and test complementary compensatory mechanisms. We explore for the first time whether low PGS for cognitive and non -cognit ive skills are less predictive of early educational achievement for high -SES students. The study design is pre -registered and, as we have just got access to the data, findings will follow soon. 291 Educational outcome among children with a Disability: the impact of family Health,, Oslo, Norway. 2Oslo Metropolitan University, Oslo, Norway. 3Institute for Social Research, Oslo, Norway Abstract In this study, we examine the impact of child disability on educational outcomes (GPA -scores and start in upper secondary education) using four full cohorts (2000 -2003) of children in Norway (n=225,030). The registry data contains information on diagnosis and severity of the condition as well as information on educational outcome. We ask if the impact of child disability on educational outcomes varies by type and severity of diagnosis. In addition, we examine if higher SES bufferes against the negative impa ct of child disability. Finally, we examine the impact of having more than one disabled child in the same household on the child's educational outcome, and if this \"double burden\" is more detrimental for children from low SES household. For the analysis of GPA -scores we use linear regression analyses (OLS). For the analyses of start in upper secondary education, logistic regression is used. We present the results on both a relative scale (odds ratios [ORs]) and an absolute scale (average marginal effects [AME]), both with 95% confidence intervals. Preliminary results from the OLS models, show that children with disabilities have on average lower GPA scores, however the strength of the relationship varies according to diagnosis and with the severity of the co ndition. We also found positive associations between maternal education, household income, and having a mother born in Norway and the child's GPA score. Child disability remains significant and predicts poorer GPA scores even after adjusting for maternal education, marital status, household income, and mothers' country of birth. Moreover, we do not find any significant interaction between maternal education and child disability when we examined child disability in general. However, preliminary results indi cate that the impact of child disability on GPA scores vary with maternal education and income when including separately measure of diagnosis. Education and Labour Market Returns - Session 5 11:20 - 13:00 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 4. Thai Theatre Session 5 397 The Positional Value of Education in the Americas: Dynamics of Inequality in Labour Market Returns under Educational Expansion, 2000 - 2019 Francisco I. Ceron , Louis Chauvel University of Luxembourg, Esch -sur-Alzette, Luxembourg Abstract The article examines how the labour market value of education has changed in the context of the expansion of higher education. However, one drawback is to understand how it generates differences between high and low skilled labour markets, particu larly in contexts of high inequality and informality. This could be linked to specific mechanisms by which employers value educational credentials as signalled skills. Using the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS), we analyse trends over two decades in 12 (Ibero ) American countries. Our results confirm the previous results for the claim that education in the Americas has become increasingly positional, compared with the absolute model of education. However, we find that the relative gains in wages for workers wit h higher levels of education, as the pool of higher education graduates expand over time, decreased in high skilled occupations, while relative gains increased for lower -skilled occupations. This trend is present in both absolute and positional models of e ducation. These findings are consistent with processes of displacement of low skilled workers due to increasing competition for highly educated workers for low -skilled jobs. 131 Economic Returns to Reproducing Parents' Field of Study Jesper Fels Birkelu nd University of Copenhagen, Denmark Abstract An important finding in stratification research is that the level of parental education or social class has virtually no influence on the economic position of college graduates, suggesting that the labor market for the highly educated is more meritocratic than that for those with less schooling. Although broad intergenerational transmissions thus appear inconsequential among college graduates, less is known about field -specific transmissions among college graduates who choose the same educational career as one of their parents. This paper tests the hypothesis that direct intergenerational transmissions (be it via increased productivity, social networks, or direct inheritance) exist among those who reproduce their parents' field of study. Using register data covering all Danes born 1960 -1979, I estimate the influence of micro -educational reproduction on income relying on within -family variation and controlling for sibling differences in academic achievement. I utilize that, although siblings do not vary in their parents' level of education, they may vary in whether parents' field of study match their own. In accordance with the previous literature, I find no overall influence of parents' college education on i ncome among college graduates in Denmark. Nonetheless, I find that individuals whose field of study match their parents' on average have 1.5 percent higher income than their siblings with college degrees in different fields. I find the most robust income g ains of about 6 percent in the fields of medicine and law and more suggestive evidence for STEM and business fields. I find no evidence of field -specific intergenerational transmissions in social sciences or humanities, nor in semiprofessional fields of te aching, nursing, or child care. My findings indicate that while a college degree generally equalizes social inequalities, even in egalitarian Denmark field -specific resources passed down from parents to children remain important, particularly in traditiona l professions characterized by a high degree of social closure. 425 Do the most prestigious colleges confer something more (like social privilege)? Challenging the hypothesis of degree homogeneity by way of origin -destination homogamy Louis CHAUVEL , Emily Murphy University of Luxembourg, Esch/Belval, Luxembourg Abstract The expansion of higher education in society has welcomed in an age of mass higher education. This study seeks to understand how top colleges differ from other BA -granting ins titutions, conferring some sort of social privilege. Combining demographic and sociological debates on degree homogeneity and marital homogamy, we address the extent to which children of higher educated parents are privileged in their access rates to top c olleges and marriage rates among prestigious bachelor and advanced degree holders. The LSAY Longitudinal Study of American Youth (1987 -2017) N= 3,977 is used to separate out a sample of elites in -the-making: social origins (parents' education), degree, col lege prestige, and partner's degree map out the advantage alumni of prestigious colleges may benefit from, compared to alumni of less prestigious universities. Loglinear models of parents' educational homogamy and logit models of partner's degree confirm t he significant effects associated with more prestigious college attendance. Our findings illustrate the stark powers of advantage formed through parental degrees that end in social positions of privilege by marital destinations. Today's power elite are arg uably those accessing select colleges from homogamous social origins, earning prestigious degrees, and partnering in turn with those most likely to earn advanced degrees. 295 Does training beget training over the life course? On the influence of cumulat ive advantage on non -formal work -related further training participation among workers in Germany and the UK. Sascha dos Santos1, Martina Dieckhoff2, Martin Ehlert1, Germany. 2University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany. 3Berlin School of Economics and Law, Berlin, Germany Abstract Times of technological innovations require constant adaption to changing skill requirements at work. However, previous studies have shown that training participation is unequally distributed based on individual and workplace characteristics. Yet, it may be that previous training also plays a role because it facilitates and motivates further participation. So far, little is known about the dynamics of training participation over the life course. Chains of further training participation over time can be caused by two broader types of mechanisms: First, they may be the consequence of individual stable risk/su ccess factors that are also related to training participation in any given year. Second, they may be caused by previous training participation. We investigate the question, whether training begets training in Germany (NEPS) and the United Kingdom (UKHLS). By comparing Germany and the UK, we aim to explore whether countries with different educational and labor market systems differ in regard to processes of cumulative advantage in training participation. We implement dynamic random effects probit models and find that training begets training in both countries, with a higher effect size of previous training participation on later participation in the UK. Furthermore, our results show that, for workers with medium and high levels of education, prior training pa rticipation positively predicts future training participation. For less -educated workers, the effect of prior participation on subsequent participation is weaker although still positive in the UK whereas there is no effect of prior training among less -educ ated workers in Germany. These findings underscore the double disadvantage faced by workers with less -education who are often trapped in work environments that provide little opportunity for skills enhancement and continued learning. The differences betwee n the UK and Germany, however, reveal how the effect of job characteristics vs. prior training on subsequent training varies across different labor market and educational contexts. 217 Socioeconomic disparities in future orientation: who plans for the future and benefits from it? Hye Won Kwon1, turku, Finland Abstract Prior studies have shown that adolescents whose perspectives are oriented to the future than the present tend to obtain better life outcomes in adulthood. However, we know little about whether adults' future -oriented perspectives are related to the link be tween one's childhood conditions and adulthood socioeconomic status attainment and how personal education plays a role in this linkage. We used the wave 1 MIDUS data (Midlife in the United States) to address this gap in the literature. Our findings suggest that those who are from more advantaged childhood backgrounds tend to show more future -oriented perspectives than present -oriented perspectives compared to those who grew up in less stable childhood conditions. We found a positive association between futu re-oriented perspectives and socioeconomic status attainment in adulthood, and that personal education seems to play a crucial pathway for linking future orientation to adulthood socioeconomic status attainment. Our findings suggest that education may work as a potential equalizer to help those from lower socioeconomic family backgrounds get more returns to future orientation. Health and the Life Course - Session 5 11:20 - 13:00 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 5. NAB 1.07 Session 5 251 The Intergenerational Transmission of Health in Canada Foundation, Copenhagen, Denmark Abstract The study of intergenerational transmission of health is a novel research agenda in the social sciences and only a handful of papers exists. We fill part of this void by analyzing the relationship between parental longevity and self - reported health and study how much of the observed rel ationship is mediated trough socioeconomic status. We use Canadian data (GSS 2017) that add to the knowledge about intergenerational transmission of health. A common finding in the existing literature is that intergenerational transmission of health is not related to socio economic status. That points towards a more biological and less behavioral interpretation of the transmission of health across generations. However, we do find that a substantial part of the intergenerational transmission of health is in fact mediated trough socio -economic status of the respondent. That is, especially better education and higher income, decrease the amount of health transmitted across generations. We also explain why our results may deviate from previous findings. 59 Gendered Life Courses and Cognitive Functioning in Later Life: The Role of Gender Norms and Employment Biographies Ariane Anja K. Luxembourg, Esch -sur-Alzette, Luxembourg Abstract With increasing life expectancy, dementia poses an emerging epidemiological challenge. Since there is yet not cure against dementia, the investigation into the risk and preventive factors becomes pivotal. Previous findings have stressed the role of occupat ional complexity and education for the accumulation of cognitive resources. We contribute to this literature by taking a life course perspective and investigating the influence of gendered employment biographies on cognitive functioning in a comparative ma nner. Using seven waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we find that previous employment biographies affect cognitive functioning differently for men and women. Part -time employment is particularly beneficial for women's c ognitive functioning. Strong gender norms at a contextual level moderate the effect of employment biographies: longer period of previous part-time employment become more negative, for men's and more positive for women's cognitive functioning in contexts th e stronger the gender norms in a given context. 160 Subjective Social Status and Objective Health among Older People in England: A Longitudinal Approach with Biomarkers Lindsay Richards1, Asri Maharani2, Patrick Pr\u00e4g3 1University of of Manchester, United Kingdom. 3CREST, ENSAE, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France Abstract Subjective social status (SSS) has a known association with health, whereby better health outcomes are observed for those with higher perceived social status, suggesting one way in which social conditions get under the skin. However, in this article we offer new evidence, with a more rigorous methodological approach, on the status -health relationship by con sidering both observed and unobserved confounders. We use five waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), from which we derive a measure of allostatic load with biomarkers as an objective measure of health and we apply within -between models. These models reveal the expected association of subjective status and allostatic load when comparing participants of different subjective status ranks (the 'between' estimate), but no association when examining temporal subjective status variation within participants (the 'within' estimate). We explore the role of observed time -invariant confounders including personality, and non -cognitive skills. When controlling for personality traits, optimism and parental education the 'between' association between sub jective status and allostatic also load disappears, suggesting these are confounding the subjective status allostatic load relationship. These results suggest that perceived status is not a pathway to health, in and of itself, at least among older people. 252 Mental health problems as a potential mechanism to explain the persistence of social disadvantage over generations: A longitudinal investigation in Finnish register data Henrik Dobewall , Outi Sirni\u00f6, Maria Vaalavuo Finnish Institute for Health and W elfare, Helsinki, Finland Abstract Inequalities in health and social position persist over generations. Our principal research question is how different mental health problems in early life mediate intergenerational transmission of disadvantage. We investi gate whether the strength of the mediation varies for different outcomes. We compare results when looking at different psychiatric diagnoses and ages of onset. We provide evidence on how different developmental phases contribute to the health gradient of s ocial disadvantage and potential underlying mechanisms, and compare various measures of socioeconomic position and age at which they are measured. Rich register data on the full population of Finland for 1999 -2015 was exploited following 557.356 individua ls over the life course. We used records (2007 -2018) for educational attainment (drop -out, upper general vs. vocational school), annual receipt of social assistance when 20 -24 years old (more than 1000 Euro annually), and spells of unemployment (more than 12 months). The data include information on mental health diagnoses (MHD; ICD -10) from the care register. We further had access to information on various health -related and socioeconomic measures of the individuals and their parents. We fit logistic regres sion models. To better account for direct and indirect effects, we employ the g -computation procedure. Preliminary findings suggest that high parental education at age 16 and receipt of social assistance were associated with Odds Ratio (OR)=.436. Higher pa rental education lowers the risk of developing mental health problems at the age of 14 -17 across diagnoses, ORs=.733 -.578. All MHD in adolescence were associated with receipt of social assistance, ORs=3.822 -6.536. The positive effect of high parental educa tion on less social assistance needs remained significant even after accounting for MHDs, OR = .444. We will further simulate the degree to which reducing mental health inequalities in childhood could narrow the differences in later life outcomes between c hildren of different family backgrounds. 192 Perceived Social Mobility and Health in the United State Patrick Pr\u00e4g1, Alexi Gugushvili2 1CREST, Paris, France. 2University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway Abstract The question as to whether intergenerational mobility affects health and wellbeing is about as old as sociology itself, yet the answer remains elusive. While a lot of the current debate revolves around matters of statistical identification, this study takes a different approach and asks, What if people perceive their mobility trajectory differently from the way that sociologists do? Using data from the US General Social Survey 1994 -2010 linked to the National Death Index (GSS -NDI) as well as the three three -wave GSS panels 2006 -2014, we examine the association between individuals' social mobility as they perceive it and health. We look at two outcome variables, mortality and self -rated health, and take two modeling approaches, Cox regression (for mortality) and 'hybrid,' between -within panel regression models (for self -rated health). Results show a clear negative association between perceived downward mobility and health. In the between -within models for self -rated health, it is however only the between component that is associated wit h poorer health. We discuss implications of these findings. Schools and Social Inequalities - Session 5 11:20 - 13:00 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 6. NAB 1.15 Session 5 409 Education plans in kindergarten: Can they counteract social inequality? Sylvia Nienhaus University of Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany Abstract Education is relevant not only at school, but already in kindergarten. Among other aspects this development can be seen in the introduction of education plans, which are supposed to enab le targeted promotion of school -relevant competencies. Whether and to what extent the implementation of education plans in early childhood education and care (ECEC) compensates for educational inequalities (German education report, 2020; Conference of the German ministries of youth & culture, 2004) is the central question of my research project. Oriented on the model of qualitative multilevel analysis (Hummrich & Kramer, 2018), I conducted interviews with ECEC provider representatives, parents, and educato rs, and participated in parent -educator meetings. I analyze the data collected in this way in a content -analytical reconstructive way (Kuckartz & R\u00e4diker, 2020) and plan to relate them to each other with regard to (non -)fit relations of actor -specific perc eptions of education. Initial findings from interviews with ECEC provider representatives show that they do not only act professionally, but also based on prejudice. If the aspect of prejudice is considered in more detail, it becomes apparent that a wide v ariety of determinants of social inequality (Solga et al., 2009) is invoked when it comes to implementing education plans, pointing to problems in the reduction of educational inequalities. In fact, how educational inequalities can be compensated in ECEC r emains unclear, except that reference is made to compensatory support (Nienhaus, 2022 & 2021; Meyer, 2017). Contributing to critical inequality research with my paper, I would like to reconstruct divergent perceptions of education. Assuming that a focus on education can also lead to the creation or overemphasis of educational inequalities, I would like to conclude my paper with a critical discussion of the question of whether the implementation of education plans in ECEC to compensate for educational inequa lities can be meaningful at all. 53 The role of tracking procedures and criteria in SES biases in teacher track recommendations Sara Geven University of Amsterdam, Netherlands Abstract Teacher track recommendations tend to be biased in favor of students from advantaged socio -economic backgrounds, yet this bias varies across schools and teachers. This paper aims to understand these variations by studying the role of schools' and teachers' tracking procedures and criteria. Using a vignette experime nt and information on the tracking procedures and criteria of 178 teachers in 68 Dutch schools, I find that teachers in the same school vary in their interpretation of the school's tracking procedure, as well as their own tracking criteria. SES biases in t eacher track recommendations are larger among teachers who (1) perceive the school procedure to put more weight on a student's home environment, and/or (2) put more weight on a student's home environment in their own criteria. SES biases are also larger in schools in which teachers vary more in their interpretation of the school's tracking procedure. 168 Old habits die hard? School guidance interventions and the persistence of inequalities Camilla Turin, Italy. 3University of Lausanne, Switzerland Abstract In this paper, we investigate the impact of school guidance on social inequalities in track choices by analysing a specific intervention carried out in Italy, where students have substantial leeway in choice and the role of school guidance is thus potentially more salient. The intervention took place in 2018 in Turin and involved 40% of all eighth - grade stu dents, shortly before first tracking. The students attended four two -hour sessions designed to provide them with information about the educational system and related job -market opportunities, and to raise awareness of their aptitudes and inclinations. We e xpected the programme to particular benefit low socio -economic status (SES) and migrant students, thus reducing social gaps in track choices. We adopted a mixed -method research design: a quantitative assessment of the impact of the intervention, relying on a \"difference -in-differences\" approach, compared the outcomes of students from the 2017 and 2018 cohorts who were or were not exposed to the intervention; qualitative analyses based on non -participatory observation revealed the actual content and implemen tation of the programme by examining the behaviour of the key actors. Our impact evaluation shows that the program contributed to reducing indecision, but it offers no evidence of reduced inequality in students' stated preferences and actual choices. The q ualitative analysis sheds light on why the program was not effective in reducing social gaps: we identify difficulties in the implementation, such as the absence of linguistic support for students with little command of Italian and the lack of coordination between the various actors involved. More importantly, the analysis uncovered several structural problems that are probably common among other school guidance initiatives. In particular, the heavy emphasis placed on current achievement records, dropout ri sks, and (short -term) labour -market outcomes may have the perverse effect of reinforcing, rather than contrasting, the overrepresentation of low -SES and migrant students in vocational tracks. 275 Schools' role in closing social class disparities in stude nt ICT skills Renae Sze Ming Loh , Gerbert Kraaykamp, Margriet van Hek Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands Abstract Prior research shows that ICT skills vary between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. In this paper, we hone in on schools, as a key site of student learning, and study if they narrow or widen socioeconomic inequalities in ICT skills. To do so, we employ notions from social reproduction and social mobility theory. More specifically, we investigate if school ICT resources have differential impacts on students' ICT skills, depending on students' socioeconomic background. We add to existing rese arch on digital divides by focusing on a broader spectrum of student ICT skills and ICT resources of the school. We utilize data from ICILS which houses data ICT competencies and school ICT environment. Our sample consists of 46,000 grade 8 students' stude nts nested in 2,000 schools in 14 countries. 132 School Quality under Distinct Political Regimes: Do Autocracies Suppress Critical Thinking? Diana Rafailova European University Institute, Florence, Italy. European University in Saint -Petersburg, Saint -Petersburg, Russian Federation Abstract Do students perform better in democracies? Prior research on education suggests that representative and accountable democratic governments are more likely than their non -democratic counterparts to increase school enrol lment and public spending on primary and secondary education. Yet, the existing literature on education quality finds no relationship between political regimes and student achievement. This paper discusses the reasons for this surprising null finding and a rgues that the relationship between political regimes and students' learning outcomes varies by school subject. To ensure regime stability and support, autocrats might purposefully restrict the development of young minds in terms of critical thinking. In d emocratic settings, by contrast, critical reasoning and other skills that students need as democratic citizens and potential political actors can be encouraged by the school curriculum and approaches to teaching. Distinct political goals reflected in schoo ling, thus, can lead to cross -national achievement differences in international tests in those disciplines that promote critical thinking. To test the argument that autocracies avoid the cultivation of critical thinking, I employ data from the Harmonized Learning Outcomes database on student performance in mathematics, science, and reading in 164 countries from 2000 to 2017. The results of the time -series cross -section regression analysis with two -way fixed effects demonstrate that political regimes do ind eed account for differences in student achievement in some disciplines. Specifically, democracy indexes are positively and strongly associated with students' scores in reading, which is a subject that requires critical thinking, but not in mathematics and science. Unemployment, Families and Wellbeing - Session 5 11:20 - 13:00 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 7. NAB 2.14 Session 5 301 Unemployment Insurance and the Family: How effects on reemployment and economic precarity depend Hevenstone1 1Berner Fachhochschule, Berne, Switzerland. 2FORS, Lausanne, Switzerland Abstract Policy makers set unemployment insurance (UI) generosity at levels ideally offering an economic safety net while not discouraging reemployment. The balance between these two might differ depending on family circumstances. In this paper, we assess how a reduction in UI generosity differentially impacts individuals depending on their family context. Exploiting a discontinu ity in the potential benefit duration in Swiss unemployment insurance, we analyse the impact of UI generosity and household types for relative income losses, economic precarity and re -employment during the two years following unemployment. We hypothesize t hat the unemployed person's financial responsibility for the family moderates the effects of unemployment insurance generosity. Detailed information on income histories and household composition allow the distinction of single households, main earners, sec ondary earners and individuals in egalitarian couples, as well as unemployed with and without children. Results confirm earlier studies showing generous UI prevents economic precarity while inadvertently discouraging reemployment. Looking across family con texts, there are homogenous effects for re -employment, but large differences regarding income loss and economic precarity. This asymmetry suggests that reducing UI introduces inequalities depending on family context. 372 The effect of parental job -loss and unemployment on primary school children's wellbeing in Denmark Simon S Jensen1, Michael K\u00fchhirt2, Felix Weiss1 1Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark. 2University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany Abstract Parental job losses are sometimes found to affect not only themselves, but also their children. In this study we use an annual wellbeing measure in all public schools in Denmark, linked to administrative register data, in order to study if parental job losses and subsequent unemployment impairs the wellbeing of young children in the first four years of primary school. Applying a two -way fixed effects model that corrects for effects that are heterogeneous across groups and time we make use of the repeated measurements available. We find no overall ne gative effect of fathers or mothers job loss on the child's wellbeing. In particular, job losses with a re -employment that happens before the next well-being measure are not related to children's wellbeing, neither for the father nor the mother. Job losses that do not lead into re -employment on the other hand seem to have small negative effects. Results regarding the dynamic effects of unemployment reveal that long -term unemployment of the father might be most problematic. We find no effects for mother's jo b loss, even after more than a year of unemployment. For fathers, we see an initial negative effect of the job loss, which increases with time spend in unemployment. 133 \"Shelter from the storm\": Do household contexts buffer the adverse effect of unempl oyment on subjective well -being? Sebastian University of Erlangen -N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), N\u00fcrnberg, Germany Abstract While existing research has advanced knowledge on how unemployment affects unemployed individuals and their partners, less is known about whether and which household contexts moderate the effect of unemployment on subjective well -being (SWB). In this paper, we aim to make a first step towards closing this gap by investigating potential variation in the SWB of unemployed indiv iduals across different household contexts and exploring potential socio -economic mechanisms at work. We theorize that material deprivation and latent deprivation bring about the negative unemployment effect on SWB. However, the extent of each type of depr ivation and thus the consequences of unemployment for SWB likely depend on the specific household context. We expect that prevalence of gendered labor division in households amplifies the unemployment effect on SWB for men, while added workers in household s as well as social support and time structuring by other household members are expected to buffer the unemployment effect. Our analysis is based on 13 waves of the German panel study \"Labour Market and Social Security\". We use FE models for estimating dum my impact functions, which enables us to control for all time -constant unobserved characteristics at the individual level and to identify time -varying treatment effects. Moreover, we use mediation analysis techniques to assess whether material deprivation and subjective social status can explain parts of the household -specific unemployment effects. For men and for women, our findings suggest that unemployment has a strong negative impact on SWB and that SWB already drops in the year before unemployment. Fur thermore, our findings indicate household -specific patterns in the loss of SWB, which can be explained by economic losses and losses in status and identity. Especially households with an employed partner buffer economic losses due to unemployment. At the s ame time, this household type seems to buffer the subjective status loss in particular for women. 158 A longitudinal assessment of the unemployment -precariousness trade -off for health: Duration effects di Trento, Italy. 2Universit\u00e0 di Milano, Italy Abstract Workers in precarious employment earn wages and gain from the latent functions of having a job; thus they are often regarded as better off than the unemployed. Yet, precarious work is often associated with stressors, which may lead to an unemployment -precariousness trade -off fo r health disadvantage. This paper asks: is having a precarious job healthier than having no job at all? What are the long -term dynamics of the link between employment precariousness and health? Using longitudinal data from the German SOEP, we set up a plan t-closure analytical design to rule out health selection due to unobserved heterogeneity or reverse causality and explore the temporal dynamics of employment precariousness on health to uncover possible adaptation dynamics. We advance the literature by moving away from variable -based/single -indicator operationalizations of precariousness by building a typology that properly accounts for its multidimensionality and continuity considering the joint distribution and the simultaneous occurrence of different pre cariousness' dimensions.

As educational disparities are often interpreted as a cumulative consequence of class - and migration -specific educational choices, the present study uses subjective expected utility (SEU) modeling to highlight social challenges and social investm ents that occur in processes of educational upward mobility and which have not been investigated in quantitative research so far. In this way, the article broadens the perspective on educational upward mobility and significantly contributes to explaining t he relation between educational aspirations and achievement after ambitious transitions to upper secondary education. Embedded in the mechanisms of primary and secondary effects of social origin according to Boudon (1974), a learning investment model is de veloped that contributes to explaining differences in educational success between immigrant and non -immigrant youth. For this purpose, essential mechanisms of psychological motivation theory are introduced into a sociological SEU model. Combining the two s trands of research allows for a more specific examination of the relationship between educational aspirations, motivation, and performance. The institutional context (curriculum, instructional culture) in lower secondary education and family dynamics (norm ative expectations, family cohesion) form the boundary conditions of the explanans that influence any additional learning investment. In this way, it is possible to place the role of adolescents in their family environment at the centre of analysis and thu s to go beyond the usual considerations of family in quantitative educational sociology (education, income, migration background). Further, this focus allows to examine migration -specific peculiarities in processes of educational upward mobility. The resu lts show, first, that introducing motivational factors into SEU models helps to understand which conditions are responsible for young people investing in education. Second, it outlines how skill acquisition can be influenced by family dynamics that accompa ny educational upward mobility in migratory contexts. 10 Do Neighborhood and School Contexts Render Disadvantaged Children More Vulnerable to Educational Disruptions? The Case of COVID -19 in Chicago Jared N Schachner , Nicole P Marwell, Elaine Allensworth University of Chicago, Chicago, USA Abstract Educational disruptions, whatever their source, typically take the largest cognitive and socioemotional toll on the most disadvantaged children. Theories abound for why this might be the case, but most accounts highlight race - and class - based differences in household -level factors that act as crucial buffers, including: income and wealth; parental education, job security, schedule stability, and free time; the presence of multiple adults; and parents' physical and socioemotional health. These factors may play crucial compensatory roles when routines are upended, facilitating out-of-school educational enrichment, tutoring and homework help, extracurricular activities, emotional support, and technology ac cess. Despite these arguments' intuitive appeal, rigorous empirical tests of them are relatively rare and those that do exist have yielded mixed results, with most studies suggesting that household -oriented accounts do not fully explain race - and class -based differences in children's vulnerability to educational disruptions. We argue that non -household environmental contexts - namely, neighborhoods and schools - play important but underexamined roles in explaining why disadvantaged children fare worse amidst major educational upheavals. Just as well -resourced households provide crucial buffering functions, so too might high -quality schools and neighborhoods. Because disadvantaged children are often exposed to low -income neighborhoods and low - performing school s, they lack crucial neighborhood and school resources that keep affluent children afloat during hard times. If disparities in key neighborhood and school features reduced, race and class -based gaps in educational disruptions' effects may diminish too. We test these possibilities by assessing what portion of race - and class -based disparities in the degree of academic backsliding amidst the COVID -19 pandemic may be explained by school - and neighborhood -level factors, net of the oft-emphasized household diff erences in economic resources. To this end, we use longitudinal administrative data on Chicago Public Schools (CPS) 4th-8th graders, linked to Google Analytics digital engagement data, and an extensive CPS/UChicago Consortium survey of schools' stakeholder s. 18 Do teacher assessments and track recommendations discriminate against Roma minority students? - A randomized experiment among Hungarian t, Hungary. 2Institute of Economics, Centre for Economic and Regional Studies, Budapest, Hungary Abstract Research question and hypothesis: Conducting a preregistered randomized experiment, we examine whether discrimination exists in teacher assessments against Roma minority students in Hungary. We hypothesize that tests with Roma names receive lower evaluations (test scores) and track recommendations on average than tests with non -Roma names. Results: Results based on the answers of 413 teach ers show that, on average, teachers do not discriminate against the fictive Roma students in the test evaluations and grades. However, teachers are more likely to recommend the lowest secondary school track to Roma test writers compared to non -Roma test wr iters. The corresponding effect size remained substantively small, though. Our exploratory analysis revealed a sizable treatment heterogeneity that could mask the small average treatment effect. Particularly, teachers discriminated against Roma students (e .g., recommended them a lower secondary track) in schools where the share of (observed) Roma students was low. This observational finding is corroborated with the results revealed by the experimental manipulation of students' ethnic context. Teachers who r andomly received a name set with a low share of Roma students discriminated against Roma. by contrast, teachers who were randomized to name sets with a high share of Roma have not discriminated against Roma. For more details, please see the attached extend ed abstract 426 Are mixed -ability classes bad for school performance and educational choice? Socioeconomic and ethnic inequality in English and Swedish schools Jan O. Jonsson , Joan E. Madia Nuffield College, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract A longstanding question in the organisation of education has been how to handle pupil groups with differing ability. At the centre of this political discussion and academic theorizing is the question of teaching and learning in ability - homogenous groups. Pre vious research has suggested that tracking or ability grouping, attempting to make the pupil body homogeneous, does not improve learning on average, in some instances ability grouping leads to increasing inequality. However, lack of suitable data and metho dological difficulties have made results inconclusive. We contribute to the literature with a comparative study between the English school system (with institutionalized ability grouping) and Sweden (with occasional use). We study the effect of (a) homogen eity in ability in instructional groups on grade point averages (GPA), and (b) the effect of ability grouping within subjects on grades in these subjects using the harmonised CILS4EU data (around 9,000 pupils, 200 schools and 400 classrooms), containing ri ch information on students ability at individual, class and school levels. We fit school fixed effects and selection models to reduce risks of selection into schools and ability groups. We find little evidence for any efficiency gain in homogeneous instruc tion groups or ability grouping, but also little evidence that such grouping has any effects on inequality between students of different socioeconomic and immigrant backgrounds. In addition, we find few differences between England and Sweden. 125 Gender Disparities in STEM Scholastic Achievements by Ethnic Origin: Evidence from Germany Tamara Gutfleisch , Irena Kogan Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES), Mannheim, Germany Abstract Despite the increasing demand for a scientifically and technologically literate population willing to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), we know little about the reasons behind some social groups'above all women and ethnic minoritiesunderrepresentat ion in these fields. In particular, prior research failed to provide a comprehensive account of intersectional patterns in STEM competencies. Against this background, we examine students' scholastic achievements in STEM fields at the intersection of gender and ethnicity in Germany. We compare students' STEM competencies and grades at the end of the primary school (before school tracking) and at the end of the lower secondary level. Understanding intersectional patterns in both standardized tests and teacher s' assessments of STEM competencies is insofar important as both are key predictors of future STEM educational and occupational choices. Furthermore, we explicitly focus on the socialization and cultural explanations to the origin -gender gaps in STEM schol astic achievements. We draw on the nationally representative data from a number of the IQB National Assessment Studies as well as PISA data. We find little variation in gender gaps in standardized tests across ethnic origins, but significant differences in grades in STEM subjects. Girls from more traditional backgrounds seem to receive worse grades in STEM subjects, and this pattern persists even at comparable levels of performance in standardized tests. The largest gender gap is observed in Turkish student s. Social Capital/Social Interactions & Ethnicity Migration - Session 6 16:00 - 17:40 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 2. Wolfson Theatre Session 6 65 Social diversity and social cohesion in the UK Tak Wing Chan1, Juta Kawalerowicz2 1UCL, London, United Kingdom. 2Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden Abstract An influential set of scholars have argued that high level of immigration and the resulting social diversity (especially ethnic diversity) would undermine trust and social cohesion. For example, Robert \\citet{Putnam:2007} uses survey data from the US and argue that `immigration and ethnic diversity tend to reduce social solidarity and social capital'. Indeed, he suggests that `in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods resident s of all races tend to ``hunker down''. Trust (even of one's own race) is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friends fewer.' Similarly, Alberto Alesina and his colleagues argue that racial/ethnic diversity is associated with lower level of p ublic goods spending \\citep{Alesina:1999} and lower level of social involvement \\citep{Alesina:2000}. Indeed, they argue that racial fragmentation and the associated rhetoric explains why the US does not have an European -style welfare state \\citep{Alesina :2001}. In this paper, we use Understanding Society data to examine the association between social diversity and social cohesion. We measure social diversity in a number of way, including indices of ethnic and religious fractionalisation, and the percent ages of migrants and muslims in local communities. As regards social cohesion, we consider trust, two neighbourhood cohesion indices, volunteering, and donations to charity. Using multilevel models, we show that higher level of diversity is associated wi th lower level of social cohesion, thus confirming the Putnam's hunkering down hypothesis. But these negative associations disappear (some even turn positive) once neighbourhood deprivation is taken into account. Given this evidence, we argue that it is deprivation, not social diversity, that harms social cohesion. 378 Ethnic networks, ethnic boundaries and immigrants' use of social capital to circumvent labor market discrimination Benjamin Schulz WZB Berlin Social Science Center, Berlin, Germany Abst ract Being embedded in ethnic networks and communities often hampers the labor market integration of immigrants. Such relationships have been shown for various immigrant groups and receiving contexts. Explaining these patterns, the basic argument is that h aving (intra -)ethnic ties provides immigrants with access to fewer social capital than (inter - ethnic) ties with the native majority population would. Due to lacks in social capital data, however, this argument has hardly ever been tested directly. Exploiti ng the comprehensive social capital measurement implemented in the adult cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), this paper helps close that gap. Combining prospective event history analyses of the unemployment records of Ethnic Germa ns and immigrants from former recruitment countries with KHB decomposition, it reveals that the negative association between ethnic network composition and job chances can largely be traced back to immigrants' (lacks in) access to social capital. In line w ith theories of ethnic boundary making and social capital, I further show that having access to job references increases the employment chances of immigrants from former recruitment countries more strongly than those of Ethnic Germans. This finding corrobo rates the circumvent discrimination hypothesis: Since informal search strategies are more promising than formal ones, immigrant groups that face bright ethnic boundaries use social capital more often than immigrant groups that face rather blurred boundarie s. Social capital thus becomes a means to circumvent (expected) discrimination in the labor market. 427 The consolidation of socioeconomic status and race and its implication for cross -race and cross -SES friendship Benjamin Rosche Cornell University, It haca, USA Abstract Building on a long tradition of scholarship examining \"crosscutting social circles\" (Simmel), this project studies (i) the prevalence of cross -race and cross -SES friendship in US high schools and (ii) how this prevalence is affected by the consolidation of race and socioeconomic status (SES) at the school level. The results indicate that, while both cross - race and cross -SES friendships are less likely than we would expect under random selection, the degree to which crosscutti ng ties are eschewed depends on how strongly race and SES are correlated at the school level. In schools where race and SES are minimally associated, I find a relative abundance of cross -race and cross -SES friendship, while in schools where race and SES ar e highly consolidated, such friendship ties are scarce. I further show that white high -SES students, in particular, eschew cross -race and cross -SES friendships in consolidated settings, and that white low -SES students are most affected by their behavior. T he results of this research uncover SES as an important driver of friendship selection, which contrasts with other work finding weak effects of ego and alter SES on tie formation. The reason for this discrepancy - as I show - is that the effect of the dist ance between ego and alter SES must be considered and the school -level consolidation of race and SES must be taken into account to better understand the socioeconomic foundations of adolescent friendships dynamics. 435 Ethnic diversity fosters the social integration of refugee United Kingdom. 2Humboldt University, Germany Abstract Refugee migration has become a global megatrend, and many asylum seekers are school -aged. As social integration is a key to their well -being and success, it is pivotal to determine factors that promote the social integration of refugee youth within schools. Using a large, nationally representative social network dataset of 39,154 students in 1,807 classrooms across Germany, we examine the social relationships of refugee adolescents with their peers. We find that, overall, refugee adolescents are less accepted by their classmates than their peers from other minority group s and the German majority. Crucially, however, ethnic diversity is a success factor in refugee students' social integration: they have more friends and are less often rejected as desk mates in more diverse classrooms. Descriptive and multivariate methods f or social network analysis reveal that this effect results from two basic processes: 1) more opportunities to meet other ethnic minority peers, who are more accepting of refugees in general, and 2) a significantly higher acceptance of refugee adolescents b y ethnic majority peers in more diverse settings. This work provides a scientific basis for organizing future allocations of young refugees to classrooms in ways that promote their social adjustment and mitigate the negative consequences of prejudice and i ntergroup bias. 293 Do Attitudes towards Immigrants Matter? Wellbeing of Immigrants in England and Wales and Their Exposure to Non -migrants Michael edovi London School of Economics and Political Science, London, United Kingdom Abstract Research suggest s that contact with the non -migrant population can affect the wellbeing of migrants. Similarly, studies show that individuals experiencing discrimination have lower wellbeing. These two findings are plausibly driven by the nature of the non -migrant populat ion's attitudes towards immigrants (ATI) and the forms of expression it finds. Yet, the relationship between them and immigrants' wellbeing has rarely been directly studied. This paper employs non -migrants ATI as a potential under -researched driver of the effect of contact on migrants' wellbeing. I use two different levels of area -measures to aggregate ATI. This reveals various combinations of migrants' exposure to ATI produced by them living in different nested areas. I ask how immigrants' wellbeing is ass ociated with them and the mechanisms behind this association. As potential mechanisms, I test commonly used proxies of contact and exposure: ethnic composition, interethnic friendships, and social cohesion measures. Using data from the UK Understanding so ciety (wave 9) matched to data on ATI from the European Values Study (2018), I focus on attitudes aggregated to municipal (NUTS3) and regional (NUTS1) area levels in England and Wales. I estimate the relationship between ATI and self -reported life -satisfac tion and test moderating effect of potential mechanisms. The association is estimated in two series of regression models successively employing local ATI and regional ATI. This allows me to compare variation in the association for various migrant groups an d different spatial scales of migrants' lived -environments. The results show migrants' wellbeing is sensitive to the exposure to non -migrants' negative ATI on both level. The interethnic friendships moderate the association. These results contribute to di sentangling causal pathways in the relationship between migrants' wellbeing and their lived -environment. My paper has implications for implementing integration policies on the municipal level. Employment Consequences of Covid19 - Session 6 16:00 - 17:40 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 3. Alumni Theatre Session 6 25 The Heterogeneity of Precarious Work and Market Conditions: Insights from the COVID -19 Disruption in Israel Sigal Alon Tel-Aviv University, Tel -Aviv, Israel Abstract The COVID -19 jolt to the labor market provides both a compelling motivation and a unique opportunity to revisit the construct of precarious work. This study offers valuable insights into the heterogeneous labor market outcomes of employment volatility history, how they vary by market conditions, and how labor market constriction introduces biased estimates of precarious work. The investigation juxtaposes pre -COVID and COVID era data of the working - age population in Israel. Using a nuanced definition of employme nt volatility history that targets the prevalence, level, and category of prior employment volatility, the analysis scrutinizes several sources of variance in labor market outcomes. The results demonstrate that the COVID -19 recession has laid bare the soft spot of volatile careers: employment instability, employment uncertainty, and economic insecurity. Yet, during the COVID -19 recession - constricted labor market that disproportionately displaces volatile workers, the magnitude and heterogeneousness of preca rious work are underestimated. The findings inform a discussion of the effect of labor -force behavior and economic fluctuations on the magnitude, scope, and conceptualization of the precarious work construct. 56 The effects of individual and collective labor market status on employees' fortunes in times of crisis York, USA. 2Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. 3University of Haifa, Haifa, Is rael Abstract This article analyzes the effect of labor market status on employees' fortunes during the COVID -19 crisis. Labor market status spans both an individual dimension - the type of employment contract, with a distinction between a standard employm ent contract and more precarious alternatives - and a collective dimension, namely membership in a trade union or coverage by a collective agreement. Drawing on a unique longitudinal survey conducted between April 2020 and April 2021 in Israel, the study e stimates the effects of status on continuity of employment, working - time and earnings throughout the year and three pandemic waves and lockdowns. 194 Economic Outcomes in the South African (pre -post -)Covid Economy Matthew McKeever Haverford College, Haverford, USA Abstract Before moving on to understanding what post -Covid inequality and policy will look like, it's important to gain a more complete understanding of how the Covid recessions changed labor market processes in different types of societies. In this research I examine this for South Africa. Using panel data collected periodically over the course of the pandemic, I find that employment outcomes to some extent matched those elsewhere. For example, women were more likely to be unempl oyed or leave the labor force. At the same time, surprising findings regarding race point to the potential that this recession has shifted traditional inequalities. 248 Growing disparities in household joblessness in US metropolitan areas during the COV LSE, London, United Kingdom Abstract This study analyses the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on household joblessness across the metropolitan areas in the United States. We use quarterly data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) 2016 -2021 for a shift -share decomposition of the change in household joblessness in metropolitan areas. Investigating whether job loss is absorbed by or accumulated in households, we break down jobles sness variations to changes in individual joblessness, household compositions, and polarization, i.e. the unequal distribution of jobs across households. We find that household joblessness increased in US metropolitan areas. This is largely due to the larg e number of individuals losing their jobs but with the economic recovery and falling individual joblessness numbers emerges an increasing polarization in household joblessness that indicates longer lasting disparities. To explain the variance in pandemic -induced increases in household joblessness and polarization, we focus on the labor market make up of metropolitan areas as reflected in the human capital profile of the population. We measure three distinct features of it: education level, educational heter ogeneity, and the degree of educational homogamy. We find that the variation in metropolitan areas in these measures before the pandemic account for differential evolution of household joblessness and polarization throughout the pandemic. Areas with higher educational heterogeneity and higher shares of educational homogamy show distinctly higher and lasting increases in household joblessness and polarization. 178 Wage differences between essential occupations and other occupations before and during the Co vid-19 Pandemic (2006 -2021) Christoph Janietz , Herman G Van de Werfhorst University of Amsterdam, Netherlands Abstract In March 2020, the Dutch government issued a list of occupations that were designated as essential for maintaining the basic functioning of society during the Covid -19 pandemic. A central question in the current public debate on work and pay is whether workers in these essential occupations have been sufficiently remunerated for their work over the past years. We analyse wage differences be tween workers in essential occupations and other occupations using a combination of the Dutch labour force survey and register data from 2006 to 2021. We find that the wages of workers in essential occupations have on average improved over time relative to the wages of workers in other occupations, although this development has stalled in recent years and specifically during the time of the Covid -19 pandemic. At the same time, workers in crucial occupations earn less relative to comparable workers in other occupations within several industries, while they often earn more within major occupational groups. The analysis also reveals substantial heterogeneity in wage gaps and their trends across industries. Gender, Mobility and Wages - Session 6 16:00 - 17:40 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 4. Thai Theatre Session 6 418 Gender differences in Czech occupational mobility during the COVID -19 pandemic Michael L. Smith CERGE -EI, Prague, Czech Republic Abstract In this paper, I investigate how the COVID -19 pandemic has impacted the occupational mobility of workers in the Czech Republic from the beginning of the pandemic to the subsequent two years. Which occupational groups have experienced the most occupational mobility, and how does this vary by gende r and other factors? Because of the kurzarbeit policy, which has led to occupational stability (and employment) in many low service sector and sales occupations, we anticipate and find that the greatest occupational mobility is in professional occupations that receive less protection by social safety net. We find that downward occupational mobility strongly outpaces upward mobility and that professional women with children are the most likely to experience downward occupational mobility. Results are based o n the Czech \"Life After Pandemic\" panel study conducted on a sample of about 1,200 respondents with complete occupational data before and during the COVID -19 pandemic. 102 Globalization and Gender -based Labor Market Inequality Yoav Roll1, Moshe Semyonov2,3, Hadas Mandel2 1University of Oxford, United Kingdom. 2Tel Aviv University, Israel. 3University of Illinois Chicago, USA Abstract The comparative literature on female labor force participation leads to a two -fold conclusion. First, in the era o f globalization the number of women who join the economically active labor force and the range of occupations in which women find employment have steadily increased and widened in almost all countries. Second, despite this trajectory, considerable cross -country variations in both women's labor force participation and gender -linked occupational inequality still prevail. Surprisingly, however, only very few studies have examined the link between globalization and gender -linked labor market inequality. Therefo re, the major goal of the present study is to examine and estimate the extent to which globalization and its three components (economic, cultural and political) affect gender -based economic inequality. More specifically, the analysis puts to test the thesi s that globalization increases both women's labor force participation and women's attainment of high -income high -status managerial and professional occupations. The analysis utilizes micro -data from 47 countries (circa 2013), obtained from the Luxembourg Income Study, to estimate a series of logistic hierarchical models predicting female labor force participation and gender occupational inequality. The models control for both individual -level properties (e.g., education, age) and country -level variables (e.g. Globalization, GDP). We use the KOF Globalization Index as a measure of globalization, allowing us to desegregate globalization into its three components (i.e. economic, social and political) and to estimate the net impact of each component on both par ticipation and gender occupational inequality. The findings show that globalization increases women's labor force participation but decreases women's relative odds for attainment of high -income high -status occupations. Decomposing the globalization index into its three components, the analysis reveals that the impact of globalization can be mostly attributed to economic and to social globalization but less to political globalization. The findings are discussed in light of comparative literature on gender - based inequality. 201 Gender differences in job mobility and pay progression in the UK Silvia Avram1, Susan Harkness2, Daria Popova1 1University of Essex, United Kingdom. 2University of Bristol, United Kingdom Abstract We study gender differences in job and employer mobility in the UK between 2009 and 2019 using a large panel survey. We find that despite overall mobility levels being very similar, there are important differences in the types of mobility men and women experience. Mothers of young children are significantly less likely to change jobs with the same employer and to change employers for wage/career related reasons. Instead, they are more likely to switch employers for family related reasons. Distinguishing between different t ypes of mobility is important because wage returns vary significantly. Whereas within employer job changes and wage/career related employer mobility have large positive returns, changing employers for family related reasons is associated with wage losses. 324 How Fairness Perceptions of Men's and Women's Wages Vary by Firm and Workplace Characteristics Susanne Strauss1, Ole Br\u00fcggemann1, Julia Lang2 1University of Konstanz, Germany. 2Institute of Employment Research, Nuremberg, Germany Abstract Although women continue to earn less than men, previous research has repeatedly shown that wage gaps are justified by both genders. So far, attempts in explaining this paradoxical pattern have examined regional and occupational differences. What is missing however is a systematic investigation of the working environment, namely the working group and firm. Using linked data from a recent factorial survey experiment across 5,541 employees (27,650) vignette evaluations) of 540 larger firms and social security records in Germany we find that women evaluate wages of female compared to male fictitious co -workers as more unfairly too low. Further analyses on the moderating role of the working context indicate that this is more pronounced in working environments whe re women have a female supervisor or higher shares of female managers in their firm, when they exchange about their wages, and when their firm is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 405 Explaining the changing sexual orientation wage gap: a panel decomposition approach Zoltan Lippenyi University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands Abstract Sexual minorities' (gay/bisexual) wage disadvantage among male employees is well documented, but evidence and explanations come exclusively from cross -sectional studies. There is a particular lack of knowledge on how human capital, household, occupation, a nd workplace characteristics of sexual minorities and the majority change over time, and how these contribute to changes in wage gaps. This paper builds on longitudinal linked employer -employee register and labor force survey data of more than 1 million wo rkers to study the wage gap between gay/bisexual and heterosexual male employees in the Netherlands between 2010 -2018. I apply panel Kitagawa -Oaxaca -Blinder regression decompositions to yearly sexual -orientation wage gaps, as well as a decomposition of ove r-time changes, to assess the role of changing human capital, household, occupation, and workplace compositional characteristics and regression effects between sexual minority and heterosexual workers. The paper introduces a new strategy to incorporate wor kplace and occupation in wage decompositions that allows direct comparisons with human capital and household composition and effect components. The results show a diminishing sexual orientation wage gap among Dutch male employees which is mostly driven by compositional changes. Within compositional change, a substantial part can be attributed to gay/bisexual workers' increasing access to higher -resource organizations. The impact of minority and majority differences in membership to higher -resource occupatio ns, favoring the wage advantage of heterosexual workers, do not change over time. This difference points to the potential role of recently diffused organizational diversity and inclusion practices impacting workplace, but not occupational, entries. Econom ic Inequality and Subjective Wellbeing: Cross -National Perspectives - Session 6 16:00 - 17:40 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 5. NAB 1.07 Session 6 250 Intrahousehold income inequality and the gender income gap after union dissolution: a comparative study of European countries Silvia Avram, Daria Popova University of Essex, United Kingdom Abstract Union dissolution is a widespread lifecourse event that can trigger a substantial income shock to individuals experiencing it, especially if the re are dependent children in the family. The large literature shows that after separation women experience a sharper decline in income and a greater poverty risk, while men, in contrast, may even improve their standard of living. This paper is aimed at assessing the impact of intrahousehold inequality on financial consequences of union dissolution for men and women and the role of European tax- benefit systems in moderating the adverse impacts of union dissolution on gender income inequality. Our methodologi cal approach consists of using microsimulation techniques in combination with the survey data. To capture the pre -separation income situation of men and women, we construct measures of individual income assuming minimum income pooling in addition to the co nventional complete pooling and equal sharing approach. In order to assess the impact of separation on gender inequality, we create a counterfactual scenario by splitting all heterosexual couples in our data and simulating all benefits and taxes that each individual would be entitled to if they lived in separate households. We sensitivity test the results by assuming different scenarios of sharing custody of the dependent children. Our results show that the assumptions about income pooling within household have significant impacts on the assessment of gender income inequality after a union dissoultion. 404 Inequality and Income Classes in the Euro Area -12 in the Wake of the Great Recession: The Role of the State Olga Salido1, Julio Caraba\u00f1a2 Complutense de Madrid, de Madri, Madrid, Spain Abstract Analysing the extent to which socio -political institutions offset the effects of economic ones, state action should be divided into at least three p arts: contributory transfers, non -contributory transfers and direct taxes. In previous work we have analysed the impact of the economic crisis and its moderation by socio -political institutions ('markets, households and states') in terms of absolute incom es (in 2013 constant euros) at the level of the EU -15, the EA12 and various groups of countries. In this paper we put the focus on taxes and the share of public transfers that are financed by them, mainly targeted at households, such as child and housing a llowances. We examine the Euro Area - 12 as a whole and the EU15 countries separately. The main results are that household transfers, or welfare transfers, decrease inequality and the number of poor. Taxes decrease inequality and the number of rich, but increase the number of poor and middle classes. Overall, the effect of the state (in this proper or narrow sense) on income classes is dominated by the effect of taxation: the poor increase. This analysis provides some insights into the role of public transfe rs during crises, allowing us to draw some interesting conclusions that could be extrapolated to the current COVID -19 crisis and its economic impact on the most vulnerable households. 149 Income, Financial Satisfaction and Inequality among Americans, Before and During the COVID -19 Pandemic Gregory M. Eirich Columbia University, New York, USA Abstract The COVID -19 pandemic in the US has been characterized by an usually -strong governmen tal response regarding income support for citizens. But do individuals actually notice changes in their income? And do increases in income translate to higher levels of financial satisfaction for people? Surprisingly, previous research has not fully set tled these important questions. Using multiple panels of the General Social Survey, administered between 2006 and 2020, fixed effects models indicate that overall, individuals do appear to notice increases in their income, reporting greater satisfaction w ith their financial situations. Yet, there is substantial inequality in this effect. Individuals with above -average incomes experience very large increases in financial satisfaction from increased income, but individuals with below -average family incomes display much weaker (and frequently nonexistent) effects, such that poorer individuals, even when their incomes do rise, are no more satisfied than before. Preliminary analyses on the GSS panels collected during the late -2020 pandemic period show that th ese same relationships appear to continue to hold up, despite the upheavals of the pandemic. Given that previous research has shown that when individuals feel more financially satisfied, they think, plan, act and consume differently -- then the large incom e stabilization measures enacted during the pandemic will continue to affect Americans' choices and US society's overall economic direction in profound, and potentially inequitable, ways. 413 Money and Happiness in Cross -National Perspective Alair MacLea n, Cassandra Leonard Washington State University, USA Abstract Previous research and theory has evaluated how money is associated with happiness and well -being at both individual and national levels. The paper will extend this work to address the following research question: How does national context shape the relationship between income and happiness? It will assess how happiness is associated with individual -level income, as well as with national levels of both income and inequality. It will test wheth er these relationships vary within and between nations as well as whether the relationships differ according to whether the nations are high -, medium -, or low -income. Our theoretical inspiration draws on the debate surrounding the Easterlin paradox, as we ll as theories of reference groups and of inequality. Based on these sources, we argue that the factors influencing whether people are more or less happy based not just on their own objective circumstances but on their national context. We will test our hypotheses using multilevel models based on data from the World Values Survey (WVS) combined with that from the Open Budget Survey (OBS) data series. Our preliminary results indicate that individuals are more likely to say that they are very or quite happ y rather than not very or not at all happy if they themselves have higher income and if they live in countries with higher GDP per capita and with lower inequality. 27 Household non -mortgage debt and depression in older adults in 22 countries - what is t he role of social norms, institutions and macroeconomic conditions? Aapo Hiilamo Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, United Kingdom Abstract There are increasing number of adults aged 50 years and older with debts in Western countries. But debt and mental health policies and services for this population are fragmentary. We need to understand more about the relationship between debt and mental health in different contexts to inform and invigorate the policy response. Is the association between debt and depression so fundamental that it occurs across time and place? Are some countries better at mitigating the depression related to debt than others? This study addresses these questions by taking advanta ge of three harmonized longitudinal surveys, consisting of older adults in 21 European countries and the US. People with household non -mortgage debt have higher odds of depression, net of differences in other socioeconomic variables, in all countries. In m ost countries the associations are as strong as the association of education level with depression. They are particularly strong in countries with poor personal debt discharge legislation and low levels of indebtedness, both of which are indicators of stig ma related to debts. The link between debt and depression seems to be elevated within countries in poor economic times. Policy measures, such as integrated debt and mental health services, are needed to alleviate the mental health burden of the increasing number of older adults with non -mortgage debts and particularly important in times of economic hardship such as we are encountering as temporary reliefs during pandemic are removed. Old Age, Pensions and Care Giving - Session 6 16:00 - 17:40 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 6. NAB 1.15 Session 6 174 Becoming a grandparent and changes in labor market participation Therese Bay -Smidt Christensen ROCKWOOL Foundation, Copenhagen, Denmark. University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark Abstract In this study I investigate working time on the labor market and retirement timing in relation to the transition to grandparenthood. Big demographic changes have changed the composition of the oldest workers on the labor market and recent literature focus on more fluid and complex transitions between work and retirement, where not only health and personal economy, but also family and social network play a role in decisions on labor market participation. In the study I use a stag gered difference -in-difference setup on Danish population register data for persons aged +40 years becoming grandparents for the first time in the period 1996 -2007. I add to the literature on labor market effects of grandparenthood using high quality data and a method exploiting time displacement in an exogenous event timing. Furthermore, I contribute to the literature by also investigate whether the age and grandparent status of colleagues, and family specific circumstances as twin -grandchildren, number of adult children, and distance to grandchildren play a role in the decision making of the grandparents. I also show how economic position mediates the possibilities of the grandparents to adjust their labor market participation with the coming of grandchild ren. Results contribute to understand how important choices on the labor market in connection to big life transitions is further affected by social circumstances. 327 Family size and gendered loneliness in the widowhood process Nicole Kapelle , Christiaa n Monden University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract This study analyses the gendered experience of the widowhood process and its relation to loneliness in Australia. A special focus lies on the question whether the number of own children moderat es the effect of widowhood on loneliness. Children may have the potential to help men and women through the widowhood experience. Using a life course approach and relying on other relevant theories (i.e. Attachment Theory) , we expand previous research by providing more robust evidence on gendered loneliness trajectories. Prior research largely ignores the potential process nature of widowhood including anticipation effects, coping and adjustment, and long -term consequences in years after widowh ood. Finally, in light of declining fertility rates and a growing number of childless individuals, it is also relevant to explore how the presence and number of children as a potential support network can assist the bereaved through their process. For our analyses, we exploit longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey and use a fixed -effects regression framework. Preliminary analyses highlight small but for men statistically significant anticipation effects in years prior to widowhood. As expected, loneliness levels increase drastically in the year of widowhood for both men and women. However, men are more adversely affected than women. While women's loneliness levels decline in the years after widowhood, men 's loneliness levels stay elevated even after five or more years after widowhood. Assessing the moderating effect of children, preliminary results surprisingly indicate that childless women and men experience lower levels of loneliness associated with wido whood than mothers and fathers. In upcoming iterations of our manuscript, we aim to conduct further analyses to assess whether childless widow(er)s are able to rely on other support networks to deal with the widowhood experience. 391 Inheritance is som ething you need to earn: norms on intergenerational transfers and the role of inheritance Davide Gritti , Stefani Scherer University of Trento, Trento, Italy Abstract This study examines the role of inheritance (or expectancy thereof) in shaping the attitudes towards functional intergenerational solidarity, that is the bi -directional exchange of money and time between older parents and adult children. The relevance of this yet unexplored question stems from the unprecedented inheritance boom heading t he way of today's younger generation. Given that the current debate is focusing only on the immediate consequences in terms of economic inequality, other relevant implications such as family relations may be neglected. Bridging the intergenerational solida rity theory with models from household economics, we frame inheritance as a strategic prospective influence on norms about within -family inequality in the process of exchange of care and parental wealth. In particular, we hypothesize that inheritance may o ff-balance the norms about solidarity to the advantage of the older generation. The study draws on a unique cross -sectional (2014 -2015) special module on the inheritance of the GESIS Panel, a longitudinal survey conducted on a representative sample of the German population. According to the literature on transfer regimes, Germany is featured by frequent and extended downward financial transfers. The research design relies on vignettes about the allocation of parental assets between fictitious daughters and aims to disentangle differences in norms owing to the exposure of individuals to inheritance. 259 The inequality of lifetime pension Jiaxin Shi1,2,3, Martin Kolk3,4,5 1Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Germany. 2University of Oxford, United Kingdom. 3Stockholm University, Sweden. 4Institute for Future Studies, Sweden. 5\u00c5bo Akademi, Finland Abstract Research on social stratification is often focused on working -age populations. With rapidly aging populations across the rich world, inequalities at retirement ages are an increasingly important part of how contemporary societies are stratified. Here, we highlight an aspect of inequality that has been neglected in th e social stratification literature \u2014the inequality of lifetime pension. Using Swedish registration covering the retired population born 1918 -1939, this study examines how total pension income over an entire life is distributed in Sweden. The results show th at lifetime pension is much more unequal than inequalities in pre -retirement earnings and yearly pension, except for earlier female cohorts. Decomposition analyses indicate that inequality in lifespan is the most important factor for lifetime pension inequ ality. The decline of lifespan inequality across cohorts led to a decline of lifetime pension inequality, particularly for men. This demonstrates that lifetime pension inequality may change simply due to the compression process of lifespan distributions. 287 Inequalities in young adult caregivers in Germany and the UK Markus King1, Baowen Xue2, Rebecca Lacey2, Giorgio Di Gessa2, of Social Sciences, TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany. 2Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom Abstract Increased longevity gains have not been accompanied by an increasing number of years spent disability free, leading to an increased need for care for older people. European countries vary in how they have met this rising care demand, but across Europe the majority of care is provided informally by families, friends, or neighbours. S maller family sizes, partnership dissolution and women's strengthening ties to paid work may lead to a diminishing pool of informal carers in the face of increasing need. In addition, delayed childbearing means there are likely to be a growing number of yo ung adults with older parents requiring care, more carers providing care to parents and children simultaneously, as well as a growing number of adult grandchildren caring for surviving grandparents. Existing evidence suggests that caring leads to labour ma rket exits; reduced working hours, salaries and pension entitlements; loss of training opportunities and career advancement. However, existing research has largely been based on cross -sectional samples of older -adults and has focused on older spouses, or o lder working age carers, while younger carers are often overlooked in policy and research. Younger caregiving occurs at a time when young adults are seeking to complete education and establish themselves in the job market. Based on data from the UK Househo ld Longitudinal Study and the German Socio -Economic Panel we analyse the impact of care of 16 till 29 year old on their educational success and their changes to be employed and unemployed. First results show that involvement in care has a negative impact o n the likelihood to complete higher education in the UK but not in Germany. Young adult carers in the UK and Germany are less likely to be employed and more likely to be unemployed. This shows the importance of care burden in young adulthood for life long inequality. Parents and Parenting - Session 6 16:00 - 17:40 Friday, 22nd April, 2022 Room 7. NAB 2.14 Session 6 181 How mothers matter: investigating gender differences in how parents influence the social destiny of their children Cyril Jayet Sorbonne University, Paris, France Abstract Different studies have confirmed the importance of the mother's social class on the social desti ny of women and men. Those studies have however less documented and explained how the mother's influence differs from the father's. We propose to examine in France the differences between the father's and mother's influence on social class mobility of both genders by using different types of log -linear models: the Core Fluidity Model and social distance models. We use data from the French Labor Force Survey from 2003 to 2020 (425 814 respondents) and the European Socioeconomic Classification (ESeC). Data ar e analyzed so as to distinguish the effects of inheritance, hierarchy, and affinity in social class reproduction and mobility. The results show that father's social class still has a more important inheritance effect than the mother's social class for both genders. However, even though father's social class used to be more important to define the hierarchical level of the family that children attempt to attain, this father's dominance is strongly declining in the last cohorts and in particular for women. Th e mother's role is therefore more and more important to define the hierarchical level of the family. More generally, the results show that gender roles and their transformation affect social reproduction and social mobility. 381 Mechanisms of educational inequalities in secondary education: Parental practices and their impact on educational success Elif Sari , Christoph Homuth Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories, Bamberg, Germany Abstract International research shows that parental sup port and counselling practices can explain a significant part of social inequality in the education system. These practices vary according to the parental endowment with education - relevant capital and are therefore strongly connected to the social backgrou nd and habitus of the parental home. Regarding the sociology of educational inequality in Germany, researchers have focused mainly on educational decisions while little attention has been paid to the conscious and unconscious forms of parental support and counselling of their children in everyday life. Little is known about how these parental practices differ along the social background and what impact they have on educational outcomes and pathways. Building on this research gap, the research interest of the study is to explore how parents, who are endowed differently with education -relevant capital influence their children's educational success in secondary education through everyday practices. To answer the questions about the different forms of practi ces and their effects on educational performance, we analyze data of the Starting Cohort of fifth -graders (SC3) from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS). We examine parental practices from 7th to 10th grade and the impact on the average grad e of math and German in the upper secondary school. The results show significant effects of specific practices on performance in upper secondary school. Especially practices in the field of academic socialization (like talking about books) have a signific ant positive effect on the average grade. As the descriptive analyses show, especially higher educated parents often talk about books with their children. When parental practices are taken into account, the effect of social origin on the grades becomes insignificant. The findings indicate that parental practices help to explain the effect of social origin on grades and can be seen as a mechanism of social inequality. 365 The gender gap in intrinsic reading motivation: Explanations of reading socializati on in the family and school. Margriet van Hek , Gerbert Kraaykamp Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands Abstract Boys' poor reading performance is one of the drivers of their lower educational success, yet it has received little attention in previous research. In this paper we investigate if parental reading socialization and school reading resources influence girls' and boys' reading performance and whether the resources in these two socializing contexts compensate or accumulate. We combine i nsights from the literature on socialization and cultural capital with literature on school - and teacher -effects to formulate hypotheses. Multilevel analyses are performed on PISA 2018. First results indicate that girls have higher reading performance and this gap varies significantly between schools. Analyses also show that girls profit more from a better reading opportunity structure in the family home than boys. 223 Educational Differences in Parents' Time Use in Heterogeneous Child Care from 2004 to 2019 Sujung Lee , Seongsoo Choi Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of Abstract Growing disparities in parental investment in childcare have been a public concern since it has critical implications about the intergenerational transmission of social di sadvantages. Given the increasing existing tension for parents between intensive parenting norms and longer working hours over the past few decades, understanding changing patterns in gaps in time spent in childcare by parental socioeconomic status in the United States becomes a crucial sociological question. Prior studies tend to focus on developmental care, which is primarily defined by direct interactions between parents and children while ignoring other forms of childcare. For instance, parents may care for children while engaging in other activities, a practice that can be labeled as secondary childcare. This may be less intensive than developmental care, but it has significant implications for the quality of life of both parents and children. We show t hat conflicting findings from previous studies could be due to the different time -use patterns of developmental and secondary care, which are closely related to parents' time constraints. Using time -diary data from American Time Use Survey 2004 -2019 (N=33, 564) and ordinary least squares regression models, we estimate how many minutes mothers and fathers of children under age 6 spend on developmental and secondary childcare respectively. We find a converging trend in developmental childcare between high -educ ated and low -educated parents but a diverging trend in secondary care. This is especially true on weekdays and for fathers, implying that compared to high -educated parents, low -educated parents spend more time in secondary childcare than they did previousl y due to a lack of control over their own work hours. This result suggests that other forms of socioeconomic disparities in childcare still exist, despite the growing popularity of intensive parenting. 89 Parental education and children's cognitive development: A prospective approach Markus Klein1, Michael K\u00fchhirt2 1University of Strathclyde, United Kingdom. 2University of Cologne, Germany Abstract Children from higher family socioeconomic status (SES) perform better on a wide array of cogn itive outcomes in early childhood than their lower -SES peers. The literature identified parents' education as one of the most important SES dimensions influencing children's developmental outcomes. Through educational attainment, parents may gain cognitive flexibility or problem -solving skills deemed beneficial to children's cognitive development. Accordingly, highly educated parents use their time more efficiently to engage their children in cognitively stimulating activities. A central question in the li terature is whether parents' level of education is the cause of differences in children's outcomes. The association between parental education and children's cognitive development may exist due to genetic confounding. In addition, conventional analyses of child development exclude childless individuals and ignore mechanisms of family formation, possibly introducing endogenous selection bias. Following a prospective approach to estimating the causal effect of parental education on children's cognitive abilit y, we deal with these issues by adjusting for parental cognitive ability as a genetic proxy and integrating the effects of parents' education on fertility into the analysis. For this purpose, we use unique data from the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), a llowing us to exploit information on cohort members' fertility, cognitive ability, education, and their children's cognitive assessments. We use inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighting to address confounding bias and endogenous selection b ias. Findings show that after correcting for these biases, a statistically significant average causal effect of parental education on children's cognitive ability remains.

Sheikh Zayed Theatre Session 7 17 Gender inequality and the impact of the Covid -19 pandemic on psychological well -being James M Raymo , Fumiya Uchikoshi, Shiina Yuri Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA Abstract The role of disasters in magnifying and exacerbating existing inequalities suggest that gender disparities in the impact of the Covid -19 pandemic on psychological health may be particularly pronounced in gender inegalitarian countries. Building upon this relatively under -appreciated insight, we advance research on ge nder differences in the impact of the Covid -19 pandemic on psychological well -being in in three important ways. (1) We focus on Japan, arguably the world's most gender -inegalitarian wealthy country, (2) to examine gender differences in a fundamentally impo rtant and informative, but largely unstudied, dimension of psychological well -being, and (3) use decomposition tools to evaluate the extent to which observed gender differences in decline in psychological well -being during the pandemic reflect differences in pre -pandemic characteristics, differences in life changes associated with the pandemic, and differences in responses to these characteristics and experiences. We measure decline in psychological well -being as loss of ikigai (a widely used term in Japan that encompasses purpose in purpose in life, life goals, commitment, accomplishment, and sense of fulfillment). Preliminary analyses of national survey data show that loss of ikigai between March and December 2020 is significantly higher for women, that th is difference is primarily due to loss of purpose/fulfillment from social activities (rather than work or family), and that differences in compositional characteristics are far less important than gender differences in relationships between sociodemographi c characteristics and psychological well -being. 330 What Shaped Resilience and Vulnerability to the Harmful Effects of the Pandemic on Mental Health? A Study of Caregivers of School Aged Children in Ireland James Laurence , Helen Russell, Emer Smyth The Economic and Social Research Institute, Ireland Abstract The pandemic wrought acute harm to mental health across the world, especially among more vulnerable populations. We explore what factors in people's lives acted as sources of resilience to cushion the negative impacts of the pandemic on mental health. Drawing on three waves of cohort data from primary caregivers of school aged children in Ireland (98% mothers), and applying within -between (hybrid) modelling, we demonstrate that depression sp iked during the pandemic, especially among those experiencing greater stresses of school closures/childcare. However, depression increased less steeply among caregivers who, pre -pandemic, had greater 'economic resources', but especially among those with gr eater 'social resources' (e.g., local social capital, local familial ties), who were more connected to their religious community (attending church more frequently), who lived in more rural neighbourhoods, and among those who lived in neighbourhoods with be tter (perceived) quality (e.g., less anti -social behaviour) and access to services. Mediation analysis suggests these factors mitigated harm, in part, by helping caregivers better manage stresses associated with the closure of schools, along with preservin g more positive familial relations over the pandemic. Taken together, this study provides key insights for social policy into the sources of resilience that can mitigate the harm that crises can exert on mental health, and how crisis preparedness should se ek to invest in social infrastructure, alongside medical infrastructure, to protect societies from future pandemics. 360 Who feels stressed when school is closed? German and Dutch parents' stress levels before and during the Covid -19 University, Utrecht, Netherlands Abstract COVID -19 related containment measures, such as the closure of schools and day care facilities have impacted parents in Germany as elsewhere. As previous research has shown, this has led to a decrease in parental wellbeing, with larger decreases in satisfaction with family life for mothers (Huebener et al. 2020), a gendered decrease in general life satisfaction (Zoch et al. 2021), as well as a gendered impact in specific areas such as relationship satisfaction (Schmid et al. 2020) and family satisfaction (M\u00f6hring et al. 2020). These gender differences in well -being are related to the fact that women seem to suffer more than men from increased economic uncertainty (Godinic et al. 2020), increases in domestic work and childcare (Hipp & Bunning 2021), and the reduced access to social networks (Etheridge & Spantig 2020). What is however less c lear is how changes in gendered subjective wellbeing differ by socio -economic background. This is surprising since studies focusing on gender differences in the labor market effects of the COVID -19 pandemic highlight the key role played by subjects' socio -economic background, with lower -income women experiencing a higher risk of being out of work (M\u00f6hring et al. 2021). Moreover, other mechanisms, such as the gendered division of unpaid work and the reduction of social networks can also be expected to differ by socio -economic background. We use probability -based representative data from Germany (German Family Panel pairfam , using the regular panel waves 11 and 12, and its supplementary COVID -19 web -survey) and Netherlands (the online Longitudinal Internet fo r the Social Sciences (LISS) panel: wave 11, wave 12, and wave 13. We estimate random effects models, modelling changes in individuals' subjective well -being since the onset of the pandemic, including an interaction between gender and socio -economic backgr ound. 83 Back to school -back to work? School and day care opening and parents' employment in the early phase of the - Leibniz Centre for Lifelong Learning, Bonn, Germany. 3Institute for Employment Research (IAB), Nuremberg, Germany Abstract Around the globe, the corona pandemic has has triggered various reactions of governments de signed to contain the pandemic. Thus, among other things, the pandemic led to an unforeseen and unprecedented closure of schools and daycare facilities . In turn, these closures might have forced parents to stay at home to care for their kids who could not go to schools or kindergartens. From a social policy perspective, this raises the question to what extent parents' employment has been affected, as time spent on childcare might make parents reduce their working hours and such reductions of working time m ight be a major reason for loss of income during the pandemic. To answer this question, we exploit within -country variation in school and childcare policies across the federal states of Germany to analyse the effect of these effect on parents' working tim e. Using survey data in combination with linked information from social security records, we compare the working time of parents who life in different federal states and thus have to deal with different restrictions regarding childcare. Our results reveal a non -negligible positive effect of an earlier and more far -reaching reopening of schools and daycare facilities on parents' employment. Our results indicate that prolonged closure goes along with negative employment effects for parents. Hence, containment and closure policies to prevent the spread of COVID -19 have substantial economic and social side effects. 350 Crossed life trajectories meeting at the point of uncertainty: Inner - city dwellers facing Covid -19 income shock in Santiago, Chile. Isabel Brain UCL, London, United Kingdom Abstract This work studies the new residents of dense tower buildings in the centre of the city of Santiago. I analyse the data obtained from a representative survey of this population surveyed after the peak of infections in the first wave of Covid -19 to test the following hypothesis: these dense high -rises house two populations that follow crossed life trajectories but have in common a high economic uncertainty. These are Chileans that have faced upward income mobility (most of them are the first generation in their families to have higher education) but still have difficulties finding stability. The second group are economic immigrants from other countries in the region, mostly Venezuelans, who have arrived in t he country with the expectation of improving their income and achieving greater economic security. This paper analyses how vulnerable to the economic shock associated with Covid -19 were these two specific populations and whether their different trajectori es (upward and downward) and level of economic insecurity help to explain the extent of the impact experienced due to Covid -19. To do so, I first classify the residents living in these high rises according to their social class, their level of economic ins ecurity, their intergenerational social mobility (upward or downward), to then analyse their degree of vulnerability to Covid -19 income shock. Geography of Inequality: Urban/Rural - Session 7 11:20 - 13:00 Saturday, 23rd April, 2022 Room 2. Wolfson Theat re Session 7 297 The geography of educational inequalities in Finland Lotta Lintunen European University Institute, Italy. INVEST Research Flagship Centre, University of Turku, Finland Abstract Recent studies show variation in social mobility by the place of residence, thus questioning the idea of methodological nationalism. They suggest that geographically bound institutional, political, environmental, and socioeconomic factors act a major role in the reproduction of inequalities and social class. Despite this, the geographical perspective of social mobility continues to be relatively understudied in the Nordic welfare states. As the fundamental ethos of the Nordic welfare state is equality, and some areas are sparsely populated with longer distances to urban areas with higher levels of services, it is important to study whether the ethos stretches out throughout the country. This is the first study to employ high -quality Finnish register data to study in detail how the geographical ar ea of childhood residence and parental SES affect children's educational attainment. I utilize sibling correlations to study the overall circumstances beyond family that contribute to inequality, while intergenerational mobility estimates reveal the direct family background effect. Sibling correlations capture the share of total inequality attributed to factors shared by siblings and the estimates are generally substantially higher than intergenerational mobility estimates. Based on preliminary findings an d previous studies, I expect that growing up in a rural area has a negative effect on children's educational attainment, and this effect to be stronger for children from low -SES families. I further expect to find, that socioeconomic contextual factors, nam ely segregation, income, education, and family demographics moderate the effect of social origin. 136 Rich Cities, Poor Countryside? Social Structure of the Poor and Poverty Risks in Urban and Rural Parts of Switzerland Oliver H\u00fcmbelin1, Lukas Hobi1, Rudolf Farys2 1Bern University of Applied Sciences - Departement of Social Work, Bern, Switzerland. 2University of Bern - Institute of Sociology, Bern, Switzerland Abstract In many countries, it is difficult to study subnational poverty patterns, as official statistics often rely on surveys with limited ability to disaggregate regionally. To address poverty, it is however important to understand urban/rural differences. This paper contributes to the field of spatial poverty studies by using linked tax data to examine poverty in a large political district in Switzerland with 1 million inhabitants and large rural and urban parts. We measure poverty based on income and asset and examine poverty in urban and rural areas and are able to describe the social structure of the poor in detail. We then use random forest based variable importance analysis to see whether the importance of poverty risks factors differs in urban and rural parts. We can show that poor people in rural areas are more likely to be of reti rement age compared to the urban parts. Among the workforce, the share of poor is larger for those who work in agriculture compared to those working in industry or the service sector. In urban areas, the poor are more often freelancers and people of foreig n origin. Despite on where they live, people with no or little education, single parents, and people working in gastronomy/tourism are disproportionately often poor. With respect to risk factors, we find that the opportunity structure like density of workp laces or aggravated access in mountain areas seem to be of minor importance compared to risk factors that relate to the immediate social situation. Low attachment to the labor market is by far the most important characteristic predicting poverty on the hou sehold level. However, the sector of occupation is of great importance too. Since the possibilities to engage in a specific occupation is linked to the regional opportunity structure, this result fosters the argument that territorial opportunities matter. 334 Do strong and weak regions agree on which regions deserve support? A survey experiment on public attitudes towards reducing regional inequalities Jan Gniza University of Erlangen -Nuremberg, N\u00fcrnberg, Germany Abstract Although regional inequality is increasingly seen as a risk for lasting economic growth, political stability, and social cohesion, only few studies examine public attitudes towards policy measures aiming to reduce these inequalities. This study investigates experimentally t hose characteristics of a recipient region that explain public acceptance of financial transfers to eligible regions. I designed a hypothetical regional policy program and varied the characteristics of eligible recipient regions. The results show that resp ondents from weak and strong regions agree on the fundamental deservingness aspects need and responsibility for this need. Strong regions accept regional transfers also out of a motive to insure against economic decline and political dissatisfaction wherea s weak regions want to unleash perceived potentials in regions lagging behind. 395 Urban exodus in Covid times: Who moves out of the city -centre and where do they go? Louisa Athina Vogiazides, Juta Kawalerowicz Department of Human Geography, Stockholm, Sweden Abstract Since the outbreak of COVID -19 pandemic one of the potential societal consequences that attracted a lot of debate was the move to remote working for many workers (especially high skilled occupation), which allegedly could redraw the map of residential mobility and in the longer run influence existing geographical inequalities. The aim of this paper is to study the flows of residents between different types of municipalities. We are interested in checking to what extent COVID -19 accelerated a nd changed a trend already observed in previous years where metropolitan municipalities have a negative net internal migration. We use Swedish register data and housing registers taken on 31 December each year and compare the trends for 2015 -2019 (pre -COVI D) and 2020 (during COVID). We find that compared to pre -COVID period, Stockholm -centre has the largest change in internal migration flows, and that this change is mostly due to smaller share deciding to move within the centre and moving to Stockholm's sub urbs. We then study the factors associated with wide sense counterurbanization, including suburbanization, and narrow counterurbanization, that is a move from inner -city to small cities and rural municipalities. Overall, we see that counterurbanization fro m Stockholm -central has been accelerated during the year of the pandemic, although not by a large degree. Those who escape inner -city tend to relocate to the suburbs, while narrow counterurbanization remains a domain of the elderly and public service worke rs. We see a slight shift in the tendency for the knowledge workers (IT, engineers, etc) but it remains too early to tell if it will last. 233 Economic development and intergenerational mobility in rural India: a whole village under observation (1958 Italy Abstract Since the Independence (1947), India has undergone profound social, political and economic transformations driven by the ag rarian reforms (1950s), the green revolution (1970s) and the recent neoliberal turn (1990s). While these changes have undeniably contributed to the country's economic development, it is less clear to what extent better opportunities opened up to all, inclu ding those individuals and groups historically disadvantaged by their caste affiliation. Previous evidence is mixed and limited by the lack of intergenerational data and the impossibility to disaggregate caste categories into jatis (birth -ascribed endogamous groups). Using unique, individual -level data for the entire population of Palanpur, a village in Uttar Pradesh, surveyed seven times from 1958 to 2015, we verify whether social mobility has increased and whether the influence of caste, measured at the jati level, has weakened over time. The analysis draws on survey data on occupation, income and education over three generations of individuals, as well as on 102 semi -structured interviews carried out during a 6 - months fieldwork. A s the economy diversifies and the connectivity to urban markets intensifies, we find evidence of the agrarian classes increasingly moving toward the class of non -farm manual workers. Although urban non -farm jobs are economically more rewarding than farm jo bs, these movements mainly correspond to downward or horizontal mobility and salariat opportunities are scarce. The upper classes maintain an advantage for social stability, but secondary education increasingly equalizes the chances of upward mobility for all. Historically disadvantaged castes still have relatively low chances to access the salariat, but the influence of caste on the social class of destination has globally diminished over time. Poor public education, absence of formal vocational training, highly segmented recruitment networks, poor reliability of public transportation and intrahousehold work allocation also act like bonds to upward social mobility. Gender and Higher Education - Session 7 11:20 - 13:00 Saturday, 23rd April, 2022 Room 3. Alumni Theatre Session 7 296 Policy evaluation of gender affirmative action in engineering schools Valentina Contreras The London School of Economics and Political Science, LONDON, United Kingdom Abstract This paper evaluates the impact of two separate but contemporaneous efforts to increase female participation in engineering schools by two leading universities in Chile (Universidad de Chile and PUC -Chile). I use a difference in difference approach to estimate the effectiveness of the policies and a peer effects model to explore further consequences of the reform on students academic performance and drop -out rates. The paper finds that (i) both policies were successful in increasing women's enrollment and attendance at their engineering courses; (ii) they did not change the average academic ability of accepted students (as measured by their average composite application scores); (iii) The UCH policy led to lower first -year drop -out rates among women; im proved performance in collaborative projects by both men and women, and had no significant effect on other first -year educational outcomes. 337 Sorting into and within Majors: How Big and Small Choices Affect Classmate Gender Composition XunFei Li , Rach el B. Baker University of California Irvine, Irvine, USA Abstract Sorting by gender in higher education affects the classmates to whom a student is exposed and can lead to occupational segregation. This study advances our current understanding, disaggregat ing sorting between and within majors by examining how students' major choices and course choices explain overall variation in the proportion of same -gender classmates. Focusing on a selective four -year college in the American Southwest, we demonstrate tha t sorting by gender not only exists across majors but also within majors through students' course -taking. We also find that sorting by gender is more prevalent in certain groups of students, even after controlling for student's major. Although students' ma jor choices explain a large amount of variation in their proportion of same -gender classmates, students' course choices also explain a significant portion of the remaining variation. By visualizing students' same - gender classmates proportion across differe nt majors for major -required courses and non -major -required courses, we show how different kinds of courses play differential roles in determining who students' peers are. This study suggests that previous work that examines sorting only at the major level could miss important opportunities for understanding student sorting; further attention should be given to the sorting within majors and how it differs across different groups of students. 302 Are grammar school pupils over -represented at prestigious UK universities? Queralt Capsada Kingdom. 2Durham University, Durham, United Kingdom Abstract Pupils from more advantaged social class backgrounds and certain ethnic minority groups continue to be overrepresented in grammar schools in England (e.g. Bolton, 2017), and are among the highest achievers nationally at GCSE (e.g. Coe et al., 2008), but this appears to be due to the academic and social selectivity rather than to any 'school quality' effect (e.g. Gorard and Siddiqui, 2018). Similarly, the high rates at which grammar school pupils attend more prestigious UK universities is explained by prior attainment and social background characteristics, rather than being a di rect school effect (Sullivan et al., 2014, using BCS70). However, this latter evidence presenting a null effect of grammar school attendance on access to prestigious UK universities relies on data for those who came of university -age towards the end of the 1980s, immediately prior to the second wave of higher education expansion (Boliver and Swift, 2011) and the subsequent proliferation of university league tables (Boliver, 2015). We draw on data for a more recent cohort (Next Steps and NPD data) who came o f university -age in a context of a 50% higher education rate and a highly prestige -stratified university system. Recent research using HESA administrative data shows that grammar school pupils tend to participate more in higher education, but not to obtain places at more prestigious institutions (Binwei Lu, 2021). We employ a multinomial regression model to analyse the influence of attending a grammar school on access to a (prestigious) university, controlling for pupils' prior attainment, social background , sex and ethnicity. Our results do not show an advantage for grammar school pupils to attend prestigious UK universities, regardless of their social background, sex and ethnicity. Thus, our empirical evidence does not support the usual claim in policy deb ates that grammar schools provide better chances to 'high' ability pupils from all backgrounds. 19 Exam Retaking as a Source of Gender Stratification: The Case of Female Underrepresentation in Selective Colleges in Japan Fumiya Uchikoshi Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA Abstract The remaining gender pay gap net of gender differences in college majors suggests that women's underrepresentation in selective institutions may be a critical source of gender stratification. Drawing on the literatur e suggesting that women are less likely to spend an additional year to retake the entrance exam when they fail, which is especially the case for university applications characterized by the heavy emphasis on high -stakes standardized entrance exams, I exami ne how the seemingly fair meritocratic selection in transition from upper -secondary to higher education in Japan, where only one in five undergraduate students in the nation's top university are women, contributes to the persistence of women's \"leaky pipel ine\" to selective colleges by treating men and women with a similar academic aspiration and competitiveness differently. Results from longitudinal surveys of high schoolers and their parents reveal that the positive association between competitive academic aspirations and exam retaking reduced significantly for women. 358 Differences in formal adult education participation due to gendered influence of family life Heta Poylio1,2, Patricia McMullin2 1European University Institute, Florence, Italy. 2University of Turku, Turku, Finland Abstract Formal adult education is often associated with updating and upgrading of skills and knowledge, the reflection of needs of the labour market, and a provision of the welfare state. Additionally, it is a platform where individual motivation for better labour market returns and limitations of one's life situation meet. Hence, this paper examines how family life and labour market factors impact participation in formal adult education, and whether this varies by gend er. With Finnish register data and panel data from the UK, we study the influence of family life factors in formal adult education enrolment among the 1965 -1985 birth cohorts. The results of the fixed effect regression models reveal that mothers are more c onstrained than fathers to enrol in formal adult education. However, the results vary between the two countries; mothers with small children, or single mothers, in the UK have much lower likelihood to enrol than others, whereas in the Finnish adult educati on these are not strong restraining factors. Overall, the study shows variation in who takes up formal adult education depending on the family and labour market situation, stressing the institutional support from the welfare state in promoting opportunitie s for those otherwise restricted by their situations. Family Formation and Dissolution - Session 7 11:20 - 13:00 Saturday, 23rd April, 2022 Room 4. Thai Theatre Session 7 36 When does employment instability delay women's childbirth? The moderating role of family policies in 27 European Countries Chen -Hao Hsu University of Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany Abstract Why women in some countries are more likely to postpone childbirth when facing employment instability, including being unemployed or t emporarily employed compared to permanent employment, but less so in other countries? While previous studies in specific countries claimed that governments' provisions of welfare and family policies may alter people's fertility reactions to employment inst ability, such an argument is rarely tested from a comparative perspective. Moreover, discussions on how family policies moderate the relationship between employment instability and fertility usually exclude Eastern Europe, although some countries in the re gion have very advanced pronatalist policies while facing rapidly rising economic uncertainty. This study uses comparative micro -data from the 2010 -2019 longitudinal EU -SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) to estimate the impacts of unemployment and temporary employment on women's first - and second -birth transitions across 27 European countries. Drawing on multilevel analyses, it explores whether such impacts are contingent on country -level differences in the provision of childcare services, paid parental leaves, and child/family cash benefits. Results show that compared to permanent employment, unemployment and temporary employment decrease women's first - and second -birth transition probabilities in the majority of Europea n countries. Countries with higher childcare coverage rates associate with more negative effects of unemployment and temporary employment on women's first - and second -birth transitions. Countries with longer full -rate-equivalent leaves generally associate with less negative effects of employment instability on both births. However, extremely long leaves could also exacerbate the negative effects. Finally, the effects of employment instability on both births depend less on the level of child/family cash bene fits. These findings highlight the important role of family policies in eliminating or enlarging the fertility differentials across employment status groups. 95 Cohort Change in the Family Complexity of Adults and Children in the United Kingdom Carla Ro wold1, Zachary Van Winkle2,1 1University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. 2Sciences Po, Paris, France Abstract Although research on the complexity of family lives is motivated by its potential consequences for children, few studies have assessed to what extent children have been exposed to increased family complexity. We assessed how family complexity evolved over the life course of adults in the United Kingdom, ho w it varied by birth cohort, gender, and parenthood status, and most importantly, how it varied across the early life courses of children by birth cohort. We used rich retrospective partnership histories from UKHLS and BHPS to reconstruct adults' family li fe courses born across the 20th Century and calculate their complexity. We then transposed parents' family sequences to reflect what their children experienced in their first 16 years of life. Our methodological approach presents the first step in pairing techniques developed in sequence analysis with longitudinal regression -based analyses for estimating the association between life course family complexity and children's wellbeing. It provides a broader and more dynamic measure for children's family life c ompared to measurements literature on the impact of family life on children's outcomes has applied so far. We find an increasing level and growth of life course family complexity over cohorts. Mothers have the largest family life course complexity, followe d by fathers, childless women and, lastly, by childless men. These differences converge across cohorts. Changing the perspective from parents to children we reveal that children's family complexity has increased dramatically across birth cohorts - for both , mothers' and fathers' family lives. Children of the youngest cohort experience a higher number of family transitions and unpredictability already at very young ages. This sets the starting point for future research on the consequences of such increasing family complexity for children's outcomes and inequality therein. 112 Does the provision of public childcare reduce motherhood penalties in job -related training? Longitudinal evidence from Germany Gundula Zoch University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany. LIfBi Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories, Bamberg, Germany Abstract Cross -national comparative studies have shown that women remain less likely to participate in job -related training, particularly in countries with few famil y policies supporting maternal employment. By focusing on a period of major public childcare expansion in Germany, this study examines whether higher levels of state -subsidized childcare provision are positively linked to mothers' participation in job -related training. To explain how higher levels of childcare provision impact on mothers' participation in job -related training, the theoretical framework draws on economic specialisation and bargaining theories, sociological role and constructivist approaches, and discrimination theories. Together, these approaches suggest that motherhood training penalties are less pronounced in contexts with higher levels of childcare, particularly when paid leave benefits expire and for higher levels of childcare provided as fill-time slots. The study combines individual -level data from the National Educational Panel Study for Germany (NEPS -SC6 adult cohort) with annual administrative records on county -level (Kreisebene) childcare coverage for 2008 -2020. Results from linear f ixed effects models provide evidence that higher childcare levels reduce the negative impact of childbirth on mothers' job -related training participation, however mostly for West Germany, for second or higher order births and childcare provided as full -time places. Additionally, results from distributed fixed -effects models point towards smaller penalties when paid leave benefits expire. In sum, the results highlight the importance of employment -oriented family policies to reduce motherhood training penalti es and associated gender inequalities in the labour market. From a broader perspective, the results confirm that childbirth is not only associated with significant inequalities in labour supply but also carry over to job -related further training if policy support for work -family reconciliation is scarce. Future plans for this study comprise to understand the role of mothers' education and occupation as well as workplace characteristics in the association between childcare provision and mother's training par ticipation. 417 Heterogeneous effect mortality Jiaxin Shi1,2,3, Guanghui Pan2 1Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Germany. 2University of Oxford, United Kingdom. 3Stockholm University, Sweden Abstract Spouse death is known to negatively impact one's health. Such impacts may vary across individual characteristics. For instance, less expected death is associated with larger negative effects. Using the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) in 1998 -2018, we examine t he heterogeneous effects of spousal bereavement on mortality across individual propensity to experience a spousal death. We construct individual -level time -varying propensity to be bereaved mainly using spousal health -related variables (e.g., health behavi or, mental health, physical health, health conditions, health expenditure). Our findings indicate that the propensity to be bereaved is negatively associated with the hazard ratios between bereaved and not -bereaved groups: people with the lowest propensity to be bereaved and end up being bereaved have higher mortality than people with the same propensity but did not widow. As propensity increases, the hazard ratio decreases to less than one: for people with a high propensity to experience bereavement, berea vement reduces mortality. We posit that the burden of caregiving is an important mechanism to explain this counter -intuitive finding. As having an ill spouse requires much caregiving, spousal death may not necessarily be detrimental to one's own survival. 107 Repartnering and Gender: Does Sexuality Matter? Ariane Ophir , Diederik Boertien Centre for Demographic Studies (CED), Barcelona, Spain Abstract People are increasingly more likely to form multiple coresidential unions over the life course (i.e., repartner). Yet, our understanding of the likelihood and predictors of repartnering is limited to the study of heterosexual relationships and often focuses on women's repartnering outcomes. This lacuna is surprising given the increasing attention to the study of union formation and stability among sexual minorities. In this paper, we investigate the occurrence, timing, and socioeconomic predictors of repartnering by focusing on sexuality and gender. Drawing on the Understanding Society survey (N=13,8 66), our preliminary results show that heterosexual men are more likely to repartner than heterosexual women in congruence with earlier research. However, this pattern is reversed among sexual minorities. Lesbian and bisexual women are more likely to repar tner than gay and bisexual men after the dissolution of a first union. This pattern suggests that sexuality, gender and their intersection matter for understanding repartnering. Academic Achievement and Structural Determinants - Session 7 11:20 - 13:00 Sa turday, 23rd April, 2022 Room 5. NAB 1.07 Session 7 277 Can the \"New Secondary Education\" reform improve students' achievement and attainment in Triventi University of Trento, Trento, Italy Abstract This paper proposes to assess the impact of the ongoing Brazilian educational reform for secondary education - the \"New Secondary Education\" -, which is gradually increasing the school day from partial to full time and changi ng the instruction regime from a rigid thirteen disciplines curriculum to a more interdisciplinary one, along with a diversification in the type of pedagogical strategies. We evaluate the impact of the reform on two sets of outcomes: overall students' achi evement (in reading and math) and schools' attainment rates (approval, retention, and dropout rates). The identification strategy - based on a difference -in-differences multilevel design - assesses the overall causal effect of the reform and takes advantag e of a first stage particularity of the reform - in which schools that were already functioning on a full -time scheme were allowed to enter the program - to isolate the impact of the specific pedagogical component from the impact of the full reform. The re form has an overall negative impact on achievement and attainment when compared to the rest of the schools in the country that were not reformed. Nevertheless, the impact is very unevenly distributed across schools' socioeconomic status (SES), low and midd le SES schools taking more advantage of it. At the macro -level, more developed federate states benefit more from the reform in terms of achievement, creating a puzzling scenario in which the inequality gap across schools is diminishing whereas across state s is increasing.

Estimating Teacher Effects on Students' Educational Outcomes. Said AJ Hassan University of Oxford, Nuffield College, Oxford, United Kingdom. Rockwool Foundation Research, Copenhagen, Denmark Abstract Teachers play a formative role in shaping children's school experiences, and ultimately, their educational outcomes. Yet, access to effective and qualified teachers is far from random, but rather tied to other inequalities, such as children's socioeconomic background and race. While previous studies document socioeconomic disparities in access to be tter learning opportunities (i.e., \"teacher -student sorting\"), they do not directly inform about the consequences of exposure to better teachers on students' educational outcomes (i.e., \"teacher effects\") or whether these effects vary by student characteri stics. In this study, I use full population Danish administrative data to explore the consequences of uneven access to high quality teachers in three steps. First, I document a strong pattern of teacher -student sorting in Denmark, one of the world's most equal societies and generous welfare states. In short, teachers from higher socioeconomic backgrounds and with higher prior academic achievements tend to sort into schools serving high -achieving children from privileged backgrounds. Second, I facilitate c ausal estimates of teacher effects on students' test scores by exploiting plausibly exogenous shocks to teacher changes induced by teachers' parental leave spells \u2014which, I show, are unrelated to an extensive set of observed classroom variables, including s tudent well -being and measures of classroom disruption. I find that students' performance in standardized tests improves substantially with higher levels of exposure to certified teachers, teachers who specialized in the subjects they teach, and experience d teachers. Finally, I explore social differentials in exposure to high quality teachers by students' socioeconomic background. Consistent with compound disadvantage theory, I find that low -SES students benefit more from high quality teachers, while they are also less likely to be exposed to them in the first place. 191 The link between local poverty and academic achievement: Evidence from Bangladesh Mobarak Hossain Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract The effects of local poverty on learning achieve ment are not well -researched in the context of low - and middle - income countries (LMICs). This study examines the association between poverty in localities at administrative level three (sub -districts) and educational achievements at the secondary level in Bangladesh. We use school -level unbalanced panel data from over 90 percent of secondary schools in the country covering 2011 -2019. The number of schools in the sample include: 24,084 for lower -secondary or 8th grade, 24,443 for middle -secondary or 10th grade, and 5,717 for upper -secondary or 12th grade. Using multilevel models, we find that poverty in localities , in terms of the education level of the adult population, is strongly associated with achievement in three different secondary exit exams. Howe ver, when we consider poverty by economic resources or income, the association disappears. Educational poverty in local areas also explains a considerable between -locality achievement variance, compared to economic poverty. We further find that the 'effect s' of local poverty by 'adult education' are stronger in urban areas than in rural areas, especially at the lower - and middle -secondary levels. We argue that this is because urban poor localities have a higher concentration of slums, low -skilled jobs, and fewer role models from older cohorts. This may play a discouraging role for children's education in absence of any set examples. Additionally, we do not see any striking urban -rural differences in the 'effects' of local poverty by economic resources. 247 Serving their communities? The under -admission of young children with disabilities and 'special educational needs' to 'faith' schools in England Tammy Campbell LSE, London, United Kingdom Abstract 'Faith' schools are deeply embedded within mainstream state education in England, with 28% of children aged 4 -11 attending them. To an extent, they are a historical artefact and remnant of the formation of the English education system. However, recent governments have also actively championed their continuation, under agendas of 'choice,' 'competition' and the 'quasi -market.' It is well established that, as a result of this 'market' and negotiation of 'choice,' 'faith' schools have tended disproportionately to educate children from more 'advantaged ,' higher -income families (proxied by free school meals [FSM] eligibility). As West and Curry (2008) note, 'faith' '[s]chools are funded by the state for the benefit of the whole community' and should be held to account accordingly, and on 'social justice grounds.' Early empirical analyses presented here therefore explore whether 'faith' schools also under -serve children who may be conceived as 'disadvantaged' according to another key dimension: being recorded with 'special educational needs' or disabilitie s (SEND) on entry to primary school. Data scrutinised are de -identified administrative National Pupil Database census records (initially those for the 2017 -18 academic year). Early findings are as follows. Nationally, 'faith' schools are, on average, less likely to admit children recorded with SEND in the pre -school years, and less likely to admit those with statutory (higher) -level SEND provision. Controls including pupil background characteristics and local area factors do not explain this u nder-admission; nor do other aspects of school governance and admissions processes. Both low -income (FSM) and SEND are strongly, additively, associated with under -admission to 'faith' schools. Moreover, in local authorities where there are proportionally m ore 'faith' school places, under -concentration of children with SEND in these schools is greater, and children with SEND are even more likely to attend secular schools.

Maximilian Weber Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany Abstract This study examines how childhood essays can be used to predict later educational attainment. Using essays written at the age of 11 in a large British cohort study, different machine learning models are trained. The experiments reveal that by using essays higher accuracy rates can be achieved than by relying on a prediction with social origin. Both text-based and extracted features (e.g., word count, number of errors, lexical diversity) models are analyzed. The best results are obtained for a N a\u00efve Bayes model on the used words. This study shows that the style and content of children's essays about the imagined future are related to later educational success. Attitudes and Norms, Gender and Labour Markets - Session 7 11:20 - 13:00 Saturday, 2 3rd April, 2022 Room 6. NAB 1.15 Session 7 412 Gender attitudes and the cosmopolitan -communitarian divide Abstract In recent years, political scientists have observed the emergence of a new ideological divide that splits European populations into a cosmopolitan camp advocating pro -European and pro -immigrant stances and a communitarian camp linked to Eurosceptic and anti -immigrant views. Yet, we know little about how attitudes concerning gender relations feed into this divide, even though they may be a crucial element of today's politics. Using the European Values Study 2017, we compare ideological divides across European countries and different s ocial groups. We apply Latent Profile Analysis, which is particularly suited to uncover systematic patterns in individuals' attitudes. We find four distinct ideologies in Europe: cosmopolitan -gender egalitarian, cosmopolitan -gender essentialist, cosmopolit an- gender traditionalist, and communitarian -gender essentialist. Attitudes towards gender relations thus seem to fragment the cosmopolitan camp, while gender attitudes among communitarians are more homogenous though not traditional. There is no clear regio nal pattern in the prevalence of communitarian and cosmopolitan ideologies across European countries. However, egalitarian gender beliefs dominate in Northwestern Europe and Spain and traditional gender ideologies in Central and Eastern Europe. Furthermore , women, higher educated, high -income, and single people are more likely to belong to the cosmopolitan -egalitarian group than to one of the other ideological groups. The analysis shows that the cleavage perspective must widen the view toward other politic ally relevant issues and potentially overcome the notion of a single ideological divide in Europe. 227 How to explain the rise of populism? Lack of social recognition as a driving force for perceived deprivation and cultural threats. Axel Babst , Martin Gro\u00df, Volker Lang University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany Abstract To explain one of the main societal and political issues in recent times, the rise of populist attitudes , the losers of modernization thesis\" and \"cultural backlash thesis\" are currently the most widely used theoretical approaches. However, neither of these approaches can explicitly elucidate the underlying, fundamental micro -sociological processes involved. This conceptual gap can be closed by Fuk uyama's \"thesis of threatened social identities\". In this paper, we examine the extent to which the recognition of social identities influences populist attitudes and how such recognition is related to predictors for populism that have been integrated in p revious studies. Our first results show that social recognition factors not only have significant effects on populist attitudes, but that the recognition indicators foster populist attitudes also above and beyond the factors of the \"losers of modernization thesis\" and - at least partially - the factors of the \"cultural backlash thesis\". 305 Male Workers' Preference for Reduced Work Hours: The Role of the Ideal Worker Norm within Changing Occupational Working Time Arrangements Jan S M\u00fcller University of Zu rich, Zurich, Switzerland Abstract Many European countries, Switzerland in particular, witnessed a considerable rise in the share of male employees working reduced work hours (RWH) in the first two decades of this century. RWH are praised as advancing gend er equality and work -life balance, but normative pressures may hinder preferences for RWH as it is a deviation from the ideal worker norm. The role of the ideal worker norm for the great variation in workers' preferences across occupations has been mostly analyzed cross -sectionally, using vastly different operationalizations of this norm. Thus, the first aim of this study is to suggest a new conceptualization of the ideal worker norm including two core dimensions, namely, work devotion and gendered working time arrangements, and to assess the validity of this conceptualization using a multitude of indicators. To this end, we use factor analysis. The second aim is to examine the association between these dimensions and male workers' preferences for RWH across and within occupational working time arrangements , specifically modelling changes in the ideal worker norm across time. We choose occupational working time arrangements as normative context rendering RWH preferences more or less likely, as occupations exh ibit particularly great heterogeneity in their working time structures and norms. We apply mixed multi - level models with three levels (i.e., individual, occupation -time, and occupation). The study uses rich supply and demand side data from the Swiss Labor Force Survey, Swiss Household Panel, and the Swiss Job Market Monitor. The factor analysis supports our conceptualization of the ideal worker norm including multiple dimensions. The findings regarding the association of the decline in the strength of ideal worker norm within occupational contexts with individual RWH preferences firstly underscore the importance of occupational contexts , and secondly support the claim that the change in the ideal worker norm is associated with preferences for RWH. 306 The Impact of Gender Diversity and Gender Wage Inequality on Corporate and Employee Level Outcomes in the Netherlands Joey Tang1,2, Isabella Grabner3, Sofie De Broe1,4, Hans Schmeets1,2 1Maastricht University, Netherlands. 2Statistics Netherlands, Netherlands. 3Vienna University of Economics & Business, Austria. 4Sciensano, Belgium Abstract Various studies on the effect of gender diversity on corporate financial performance (CFP) and employee well -being outcomes (EWO) have produced inconsistent results. We posit that these inconsistencies are caused partially by neglecting (1) occupational ge nder segregation, i.e. the over - and underrepresentation of women in certain occupations and (2) the cultural context in the sense that positive outcomes of higher gender diversity can only come to fruition in a company that accepts gender diversity as an asset. New measures are explored to gauge occupational gender segregation by employing wage grades and information on management responsibilities. We measure gender inequality within a company as the adjusted gender wage inequality (AGWI), i.e. the wage di fference after accounting for differences in human capital. We achieve this by using large scale survey data and administrative data of Statistics Netherlands from 2010 to 2018. Preliminary results show that gender diversity has a positive impact on CFP an d this effect is stronger in companies with a lower AGWI. EWO are found to be more negative for gender diverse companies if the AGWI is high. 76 Gender -specific Attractiveness Premiums and Penalties in the German Labor Market Reinhard Schunck1, Johanna Gereke2, Emily Hellriegel1 1University of Wuppertal, Germany. 2Mannheim Centre for European Social Research, Germany Abstract How does physical attractiveness affect labor market outcomes? Research suggests that people who are perceived as being attractive are treated favorably by their environment, resulting in advantages in labor market outcomes, such as higher earnings. However, there is some evidence indicating that the effect of physical attractiveness may be moderated by other characteristic s\u2014in particular gender \u2014which could lead to attractiveness penalties. The theoretical argument behind this is based on the observation that attractiveness may invoke gender -typical stereotypes. If these stereotypes imply a mismatch between traits which are considered necessary in an occupation and those which are ascribed to a person because of their attractiveness, this can result in adverse treatment by the environment. For example, very attractive women (men) in mostly male (female) occupations may experi ence attractiveness penalties. However, findings on possible beauty penalties have been a) inconsistent, b) almost exclusively based on \"low -information\" study designs, i.e., experimental settings, in which participants are most likely to utilize cues like attractiveness when making decisions, and c) predominantly based on data from liberal welfare states, where there is more employer discretion with respect to employees' earnings than in more regulated labor markets. The present study scrutinizes possible attractiveness penalties by using representative longitudinal data from the German family panel (pairfam) and combining it with data from official statistics on the share of female employees in occupations. Based on two -way fixed effects models we find som e evidence that attractive women and men have higher earnings. However, we do not find any evidence that attractive persons have lower earnings if they are in a gender atypical occupation.

NAB 2.14 Session 7 255 Social and Genetic Stratification: The Case of Occupational Status Tobias Wolfram1,2, Evelina Akimova3,4, Xuejie Ding4, David Brazel5, 1Department Sociology, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany. 2Department of Sociology, ENSAE/CREST, Paris, France. 3Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. 4Nuffield College, University of Oxford, Oxfo rd, United Kingdom. 5Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, University of Oxford, oxford, United Kingdom. 6Department of Sociology, Paris, France. 7Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, Oxford, United Kingdom. 8Nuffield College, Oxford, United Kin gdom Abstract Both strong and persisting resemblance of socioeconomic status over dozens of generations in various cultures has led economic historians to speculate about the role of genes in status attainment processes. Here, we conduct a genetic discovery study for occupational status on 263 676 individuals from the UKBiobank, identifying 111, 69 and 61 independent genetic loci associated with CAMSIS, ISEI and SIOPS, respectively as well as 30 more if we assume a latent factor for occupation. Over all, common, measured genetic polymorphisms explain between 10 -15% of individual differences in these status measures. Genetic correlations with educational attainment and income are high (>0.80) and almost double compared to the correlation of the phenoty pic measures. Mediators of genetic effects on occupational status include cognitive performance, openness to experience, risk tolerance, neuroticism and aspirations. An independent longitudinal prediction sample from the British Birth Cohorts shows for CAM SIS that genetic effects become more important towards the end of the career trajectory. Intergenerational investigations in these data suggest that depending on the model assumptions up to 30 -40% of the intergenerational transmission of status might be co nfounded by inheritance due to common genetic variants. 349 Social stratification of men and women in Sweden 1880 -2016 Elien van Dongen Lund University, Lund, Sweden Abstract Social class differences have substantial impact on a wide range of life outcom es. Despite this, in recent decades comprehensive studies of long -term changes in social inequality have been far less prolific as studies of long -term changes in economic inequality. This paper describes changes in the class structure of the Swedish workf orce over the long term. Occupational coding from nine full count censuses from 1880 until 1990 and 2001 -2016 annual occupational registers is aligned to comprehensively map social stratification for birth cohorts born 1820 -1985. We show occupational upgra ding for women and men over the past 150 years. The male and female workforce converge to a similar 'big class' structure by the 2000s, while important 'horizontal' gender differences remain at the level of microclasses. Changes in the Swedish class struct ure were most profound during 1950 -1980, when the majority of (married) women entered the workforce, for both men and women. Before 1900 social class was intertwined with marital status for many: men transitioned from farm work to farming, and women from d omestic service to housework upon marriage. In the second half of the twentieth century marital status and social class became disentangled, as farming classes were decimated. Occupational upgrading of the workforce was limited to the higher social strata after 1960. Professional and supervisory classes grew at the cost of skilled manual classes and self -employed farmers. The size of lower social strata, increasingly composed of immigrant groups, has been constant since 1960. In contrast, immigrant groups f ormed a small elite in Sweden around 1900. 104 Later and less? New evidence on occupational maturity for Swedish women and men Roujman Shahbazian1,2, Erik Bihagen2, Sara Kjellsson3 1University of Munich (LMU), Munich, Germany. 2Swedish Institute for Social Research (SOFI), Stockholm, Sweden. 3Department of Public Health Sciences, Stockholm, Sweden Abstract A common assumption within social mobility research is that the lion's share of people reaches class/occupational maturity quite early in working life, that is they end up in an occupation/class position that they keep for the remainder of their working lives. This assumption is crucial for modern class theory as well as intergenerat ional mobility research. Surprisingly few studies who have tried to put this assumption to test. We aim to fill this research gap by using occupational biographies in the Swedish Level -of-Living Surveys , were we divide the sample into six different birth cohorts: those born between 1925 -34, 1935 -44, 1945 -54, 1955 -64, 1965 -74 and 1975 -84. We can follow individuals until year 2010, which implies that we follow our first birth cohort (1925 -1934) for 50 years, while we can only follow the last birth cohort (1 975-84) for 10 years. We compare occupational maturity in terms of occupational prestige (SIOPS) and social class (ESeC), in order to investigate variation in the processes of maturity for occupation and class, respectively. Our preliminary analyses sugg est that the careers of the older birth cohort (1925 -34), and especially those for women, are more in line with the idea of occupational maturity. For more recent cohorts there is a substantial level of occupational mobility across the life course and, als o, differences across both gender and birth cohorts. Thus, it is, generally speaking, impossible to set a specific age at which occupational/class maturity occurs that is sustainable over time and across cohorts. 24 Organizational practices and earnings inequality: Who gains from organizational flexibility? Alina Rozenfeld Kiner1, Tali Kristal2 1Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel. 2University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel Abstract The current research studies the implications of organizational management practices for wage gaps by education and class within organizations. The main argument developed in this paper is that personnel practices typical of the flexible firm relate to a higher level of wage inequality within establishments relative to the inequality generated by earlier personnel practices and employment relations, particularly those of internal labor markets and unionized workplaces. To examine our argument, we utilize matched employer -employee data from the British Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS), which uniquely includes detailed information on management practices and employment records on a sample of workers employed in the establishment. The WERS data make it possible to study how and to what extent various flexible orga nizational management practices - including high- performance, outsourcing, the use of temporary agency employees, or fixed -term contracts - relate to wage gaps within the establishment by education and class. Findings from multilevel models suggest that pe rsonnel practices characteristic of the flexible firm exacerbate wage gaps between managerial and rank -and-file workers, whereas trade unions reduce them. We also find that educational wage gaps are higher in unionized establishments and those that impleme nt internal labor market practices, relative to those that implement personnel practices typical of the flexible firm. Our findings imply that the choice between a traditional and flexible management approach does not change the overall level of inequality but rather its form. 67 Subjective social class has a bad name, but predicts life chances well Daniel Oesch, Nathalie Vigna University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland Abstract Over the last decades, the study of subjective class has been eclipsed by research on objective class. The recurrent mismatch between individuals' perception of their own class and researchers' assessment of the same individuals' class brought subjective class into disrepute. Today, it is common wisdom that self -reports of social class are poor measures of objective class. This paper questions this common wisdom. On the basis of two rounds of the International Social Survey Programme 2009 and 2019, it shows for over 30 countries that a precoded and detailed question o f subjective class accounts for more variance in life chances - economic opportunities as measured with income and wealth - than do various indicators of objective class. While subjective class performs no better than objective class in predicting personal income, it is a much better predictor of household income and household wealth. It takes the two measures of respondents' and their partners' objective class to match the variance accounted for by a single measure of subjective class, suggesting that indi viduals determine their own class based on their household's material situation.

While additional requirements may nudge migrants to invest in human capital development and thus should boost economic outcomes, they also delay or even block access to citizenship and risk leading to societal and economic exclusion. Our ana lysis draws on administrative data from the Netherlands, where civic integration requirements for citizenship were introduced by 1 April 2003. We use a difference -in- differences design to exploit exogenous variation in timing of eligibility for naturalisat ion surrounding the policy change and leverage the panel dimension of our data to compare pre - and post -eligibility naturalisation, as well as employment and income trajectories, among those migrants that became eligible to apply for Dutch citizenship six months before and after the entry -into-force date. We focus on non -EU immigrants and distinguish between immigrants by education background, given the cognitive demands of the new requirements. We find that while mandatory civic integration requirements le ad to substantial delays in naturalisation rates, especially among low and medium educated immigrants, they appear to nudge immigrants into acquiring skills that translate into higher employment as well as income gains. These gains are modest, but durable among low educated immigrants and more substantial among medium and higher educated immigrants. 213 The Effects of Intergenerational Social Mobility on Subjective Social Status. A Comparison between Immigrant and Native Families Mathieu Ichou , Louise Car on Ined, France Abstract This paper revisits a classic question in the study of social stratification: the subjective effect of intergenerational social mobility, and applies it to an original setting by analyzing how intergenerational social mobility shap es individuals' subjective social status (SSS) and whether - in a context of diversifying population - this effect varies between children of immigrants and natives. Taking advantage of the recent nationally representative French Trajectoires et Origines 2 survey (TeO2, 2019 - 2020), we jointly assess the effect of respondents' social position, that of their parents', as well as the intergenerational mobility between the two, using Diagonal Reference Models. Preliminary results indicate that downward mobilit y lowers SSS for daughters of immigrants and male natives. Somewhat surprisingly, upward mobility decreases SSS for immigrants' children from MENA, which we interpret in line with the \"integration paradox.\" We discuss these findings by building on established hypotheses in the social mobility literature and reconceptualize them to incorporate lessons drawn from research on immigrant assimilation. In doing so, we hope to contribute to the developing field of analysis positioned at the interaction of migration studies and social stratification research. 326 Ethnic and Racial Inequalities in Career Progression during Early 20th Century Industrial Change Dirk Witteveen , Mobarak Hossain University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract Did rapid mod ernization in the early 20th-century really help the career prospects of individuals from all social backgrounds, including marginalized groups? This study examines the impact of modernization on intragenerational mobility of American men by their immigrant, racial, and ethnic background (across 1900 -1940). Our analysis of unique longitudinal Census data demonstrates that while some disadvantaged groups experienced career mobility on par with US -born Whites with no recent migration background, moder nization explains very little variation. Results rather suggest that structural ethnic cleavages accounts for the social inequality in career mobility. 375 Within -Job Pay Inequality and Labor Market Sorting by Immigrant Generation in Europe and America Are Skeie Hermansen Unviersity of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden Abstract Immigrants from low -income origin countries often face considerable difficulties in the labor market, while native -born immigrant descendants in the second generation often experience progress in education and earn higher wages. Yet, little is known about the relative contribution of both differences in sorting across workplaces and jobs within workplaces and within -job inequalities in pay between immi grants and natives, and whether these processes differ among the native -born descendants of immigrants. Using recent linked employer -employee data from nine high - income countries in Western Europe and North America, this study shows that processes related to the sorting of immigrants across occupations, workplaces, and (within -workplace) jobs account for a large fraction of total immigrant -native pay inequality, although significant within -job earnings gaps remain in several countries. For countries where i mmigrant descendants are observed, both total pay inequality and labor market sorting relative to non-migrant natives are strongly reduced, and within -job gaps in earnings are often negligible.

Wolfson Theatre Session 8 103 Work -Conditional Income Support Programs and Gender at Birth: Quasi -Experimental Evidence Chiara Orsini University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom. LSE, London, United Kingdom Abstract I provide the first estimates of the impact of a work -conditional income support program for the poor on gender composition at birth, an outcome that has important implications for marriage markets, women's bargaining power, crime, and di sease prevalence later in life. Theories of biological selection highlight that gender composition at birth is a marker of fetal deaths and that males are more fragile than females in utero, so that increases (decreases) in stressors for the mother during pregnancy should increase (decrease) the fraction of female births. I focus on a particularly disadvantaged group of single women; for identification, I use a change in the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the United States that affected some gro ups of single women more than others. I find that the impact of the change in EITC on gender composition at birth differs for different demographic groups. The EITC change decreased the fraction of newborn Hispanic girls by 0.46 percentage points (1 percen t), a result comparable in absolute value to the impact of other shocks in the literature on gender composition at birth. I find no evidence of an impact of the EITC on gender composition at birth for non -Hispanic blacks and non -Hispanic whites. Because changes in dollar transfers due to the EITC expansion were comparable for non -Hispanic whites and Hispanics, my findings add a previously unstudied dimension to the \"Hispanic Paradox.\" These results point towards the importance of looking at income support p rograms for the working poor as triggers of differences in gender composition at birth. 394 Stratification, Progressivity, and Redistribution in the U.S. Tax and Transfer System Sarah K Bruch1, Joseph Van Der Naald2, Janet C. Gornick2 1University of Delaware, Newark, USA. 2Graduate Center, CUNY, New York, USA Abstract In this paper, we explore the implications of decentralization in the U.S. tax and transfer system for the degree of the system's progressivity and redistribution over time from 1996 to 2016. In prior analyses, we show that the decentralization of the U.S. tax and transfer system contributes to geographical inequalities in the generosity and inclusion of social provision, and, that the decentralized U .S. safety net produces differential levels of poverty reduction for different household types. In the present study, we focus on the consequences of decentralization for inequality reduction (redistribution) and the degree of progressivity of distributive mechanisms (federal and state transfers and taxes). We examine these consequences across two household types (working -aged households with and without children) separately for white -headed households and Black -headed households utilizing data from the Current Population Survey's Annual Social and Economic Supplement. We conduct an inequality decomposition analysis (using SGINI) to estimate the reduction in the Gini coefficient associated with each distributive mechanism, and estimate each mechanism's degre e of progressivity using measures of pro -poor targeting (concentration). We find that state transfers are both highly pro -poor yet reduce different amounts of inequality among working -age household types. Inequality reduction, we find, is further stratifie d by race. Black -headed households exhibit higher levels of both market and disposable income inequality; however, state transfers reduce as much as three times the level of lower -tail inequality for Black -headed households as compared to white -headed hous eholds despite comparable average values and levels of receipt. Nevertheless, state transfers are less generous than federal transfers, and are especially so for Black -headed households. We argue that this is evidence of the categorical nature of the U.S. tax and transfer system, both stratified and regressive, whereby the decentralized administration of social provision concretizes status differences across household types and reinforces inequality. 113 Single -Parent Poverty and Targeting or Universalism in Fiscal Policy Manuel Schechtl Humboldt University Berlin, Berlin, Germany Abstract Single -parent families are among the house holds with the highest risk of poverty. Previous research documented how universal rather than targeted welfare transfers prevent single -parent poverty. Building on this rich literature, the study at hand extends the targeting vs. universalism paradigm to fiscal policy. Is targeted or universal income tax policy more effective at reducing single -parent poverty? Drawing on harmonized microdata from 24 countries in the Luxembourg Income Study Database, findings from multilevel mixed -effects logistic regressio n models reveal that universal but not targeted fiscal policy reduces single -parent poverty. A higher average effective tax rate is associated with less single -parent poverty. Moreover, the tax rate is negatively correlated with single -parent poverty even net of the level of transfers in a country. These results on targeted vs. universal tax policy mirror earlier findings from the benefits literature and highlight the centrality of taxation for social policy. 64 How do institutional contexts affect the e ducational outcomes of youth from single -mother families? A comparative study of European countries Kristina Lindemann Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany Abstract This study examines how institutional contexts in 28 European countries moderate the effects of living in a single - mother family on the educational outcomes of young people. Previous research has largely overlooked how social policies and educational policies mitigate the effects of family structure on enrolment and attainment of tertiary education. Moreover, these policies might interact with a family's SES in moderating the effects of family structure. Thus, I focus on two types of policies that could provide single -mother families with additional resources: generos ity of social benefits to single parents and financial support to students in tertiary education. I rely on the data from the EU-SILC longitudinal and ad hoc files as well as from the German Socio -Economic Panel. Using multilevel regression models with cou ntry fixed effects, I find that more generous financial support to students and social benefits to unemployed single parents reduce the enrolment gap between youth from single -mother and two -parent families, but only among low -SES and middle -SES families a nd not among high -SES families. However, the findings show that for high-SES families, the tertiary education attainment gap is smaller in the contexts where benefits to employed single mothers who earn average wage are generous.

Alumni Theatre Session 8 432 Two Sides of the Same Market: Ethnic and Gender Discrimination of Guests and Hosts in Online Rentals Sander Wagner1, Ivaylo D. Petev2 1University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. 2ENSAE/CREST, Paris, France Abstract Do the roles individuals occupy in marketplaces, as well as stereotypes associated with those roles structure patterns of discrimination? To answer this question, we combine rental data from the online rental platform Airbnb for the city of Paris with an online experiment conducted on that platform in the same rental market. We look at discrimination against guests as well as hosts based on ethnicity and gender as well as their intersection. Results reveal significant discrimination against individuals with Arab/Muslim names as both guests and hosts. In the French population being a woman is beneficial when being a guest and negative when being a host. However in the Ar ab/Muslim population men face stronger discrimination both as guests as well as hosts. Results highlight both how discrimination is dependant on the stereotypes associated with the roles assigned to different market participants and how the interaction of gender and ethnic stereotypes can change patterns of gender discrimination in minority ethnic groups compared to the majority population. 325 Refugees' re -settlement patterns after immigration. Is there a mobility trap? Jonas Wiedner1, Merlin Schaeffer2,1, Sarah Carol3,1 1WZB, Berlin, Germany. 2University of Copenhagen, Denmark. 3University College Dublin, Ireland Abstract The neighborhood choices of newly arrived immigrants are a hotly contested topic among experts and and policy makers. Many countries initially restrict asylum seekers' location choice. We study what kind of regions and neighborhoods recent immigrants actually move to after initial immigration and ask two related questions: First, what characterizes the they leave behind? Second, what k ind of contexts attract them? Empirically, we rely on the refugee subsample of the geocoded German Socio -Economic Panel Study (GSOEP) and model the re -settlement choices of 2,684 eligible recent immigrants. Our discrete choice models consider location char acteristics both at the district and postcode -level, including (among others) local labor and rental market conditions, co -ethnic networks, distance to place of original allocation, as well as of innovative indicators of ethnic infrastructures (i.e., assoc iations, businesses, and places of worship) and far -right violence (i.e., hostile environments) in all 8208 German postcode areas. Preliminary results document three main patterns: First, only a minority (ca. 25%) of those who technically can, chooses to r elocate across district borders within our 3 -year observation period. Second, refugees tend to choose regions with larger shares of co -ethnics and avoid those with a high incidence of far -right attacks. Third, refugees both disproportionately remain in and move to mid -sized cities with high unemployment rates. As they document systematic selection into economically disadvantaged areas with high shares of co -ethnics, our analyses corroborate some of the misgivings of residence -restriction advocates. Our anal yses suggest a residential mobility trap for refugees in Germany: To accommodate their precarious economic situations and a dependence on social transfers, refugees move to areas that offer cheap housing and supportive co -ethnic networks. Thereby, however, they might forestall future labor market attainment. The pricing out of refugees from the most receptive labor markets risks long lasting consequences for their social and economic integration. 370 Environmental quality, local infrastructures, and resi dential choice: A survey experiment on ethnic differences in neighborhood preferences Jan Paul Heisig1,2, Christian K\u00f6nig1, Tobias R\u00fcttenauer3, Merlin Schaeffer4,1, Jonas Wiedner1 1WZB Berlin Social Sci ence Center, Berlin, Germany. 2Free University, Berlin, Germany. 3University of Oxford, Nuffield College, Oxford, United Kingdom. 4University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark Abstract Research shows that adults and children from immigrant -origin families tend to live in areas with lower environmental quality (e.g., higher levels of pollution) and that this can have substantial negative effects on their health and socio - economic attainment. Prior work relies on observational data and faces severe difficult ies in disentangling the processes underlying this pattern of \"environmental inequality\", which may include residential preferences, economic constraints, or other processes such as housing market discrimination. We propose a conjoint survey experiment to zero in on the potential role of residential preferences. How do people with and without immigrant origins value different housing and neighborhood characteristics? Do they attach differential importance to environmental quality? To what extent are their r esidential choices driven by preferences for ethnic infrastructures such as sites of worship, ethnic minority associations, or businesses catering to minority populations, which - due to \"legacy effects\" of where immigrant minorities first settled - are of ten located in areas with high levels of pollution? With the proposed conjoint survey experiment, we will be able to tease these entangled mechanisms apart and contribute to a clearer understanding of why some families end up in neighborhoods that are harm ful not only to their health but also to their life chances more broadly. 319 Neighbourhood Attainment of Immigrant Minorities in England: Escaping Poverty but not Air Pollution? Tobias R\u00fcttenauer Nuffield College, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract Between 2009 and 2019 immigrant (and ethnic) minorities in England have experienced improvements in relative income deprivation at the neighbourhood level, but still reside in relatively polluted areas with slight deteriorations since 2009. The project con nects individual respondents of the UKHLS panel to neighbourhood characteristics over time, and tests several theoretical mechanisms of neighbourhood attainment. Results contradict explanations based on diverging perceptions and preferences, as immigrants express similar wishes to move after quality changes in a neighbourhood. Moreover, moving substantially improves the relative neighbourhood deprivation of immigrant minorities. To test the drivers of `successful' moves, I apply regression trees and random forests to identify the most important contributors to individual neighbourhood changes. Preliminary results indicate that especially moves out of ethnic enclaves improve the neighbourhood deprivation of immigrants. However, as most of these moves still ha ppen within larger cities, immigrant minorities remain disadvantaged regarding the environmental quality of their neighbourhoods. Assortative Mating - Session 8 16:00 - 17:20 Saturday, 23rd April, 2022 Room 4. Thai Theatre Session 8 48 Decomposing Trends in Educational Assortative Mating - The Case of Ireland Julia Leesch , Jan Skopek Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland Abstract Although extensive research has examined how the structural and behavioural forces that shape the level of educational homogamy in couples have changed over time, we lack insight into the extent to which these changes have contributed to trends in educational homogamy. This study analysed trends in homogamy and heterogamy in Ireland over the past three decades. We examined how changes in three components - (a) educational attainment of men and women, (b) the educational gradient in marriage, and (c) educational matching - have contributed to these trends. Based on Irish Census microdata, covering the period from 1991 to 2016, we applied a novel counterfactual decomposition method to estimate the contribution of each component. Findings indicate rising educational homogamy and an increase in non -traditional unions in which women partner 'down' in education, both a t the expense of unions in which men are higher educated. Our findings accord with previous research in showing that the rise in educational homogamy is mainly driven by structural opportunities and constraints. Trends in educational homogamy and heterogam y are predominantly attributable to changes in the overall educational attainment of women and men. Trends in the educational marriage gradient also contributed to the observed patterns of educational homogamy and heterogamy. Changes in educational matchin g counteracted the rise in homogamy and explained only a small fraction of trends in educational heterogamy. 15 Educational assortative mating patterns in highly educated contexts: the role of the field of education Pau Baizan1,2, Clara Cortina1 1Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain. 2ICREA, Barcelona, Spain Abstract Western societies have experienced a fast and radical educational expansion that has led young birth -cohorts to massive achievement of tertiary education and has altered assortat ive mating patterns. In order to capture more accurately educational assortative mating for the highly educated we propose the use of more specific measures of education that reflect better the status of the spouses. We expect that there is a hierarchy in the partnership market value of the field of education and that we should find a high level of homogamy for each field of education, as a result of partners' preferences and partners' relative availability. We use data from the Spanish Fertility Survey 201 8 which provides detailed retrospective information of the educational and (corresidential) partnership histories of 14556 women, belonging to the birth -cohorts born between 1962 and 1999. We apply event history techniques to model the transition from bein g unpartnered to enter a partnership (married or unmarried). Our analytical strategy starts with a competing risk analysis of the women's union formation transition, according to the different levels and fields of education of their partners. In order to d etermine whether the couple is homogamous, hypergmous or hipogamous, we plan to use conditional logit models. Preliminary results indicate strong levels of educational homogamy by educational level and even stronger homogamy by field of education for women with tertiary education, especially among those with the highest prospective socio -economic status (applied sciences). 165 Social closure in Hungary: the intersection of educational immobility and assortative mating in for Social Sciences, Budapest, Hungary Abstract In our paper, we examine how intergenerational educational mobility patterns and mate selection trends contribute to societal closure, indicated by the growing percentage of immobile and simultaneously homogamous persons. Using data from the EU -SILC for Hungary and employing descriptive, regression and loglinear methods, our results confirm the prevalence of parent -child immobility and the dominance of homogamy, with gender -specific trends of closure for the lowest and the highest educated. Together, these mechanisms resulted in the growing percentage of \"closed -in\" individuals, as by the youngest cohort, more than every fourth person were immobile and partnered homogamously. 111 Is The Rising Spousal Earnings Correlation Due To Change In Marital Sorting? Yifan Shen Brown University, Providence, USA Abstract The correlation between husbands' and wives' earnings increased in the US since the late 1960s, accounting for a nontrivial portion of the surge in earnings inequality among married -couple families. Most recent studies concluded that the rising spousal earnings correlation was not driven by changes in assorta tive mating. This article makes an opposite argument. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics 1968 -2019, I reveal a new empirical pattern: the change in spouses' earnings correlation across marriage cohorts is better described as a holistic life - course process. How spouses' earnings correlation in the first year of marriage changed across marriage cohorts determines the basic pattern of how spouses' earnings correlation after marriage would change across cohorts. Both in the first year and after the first year of marriage, earnings correlation first surged from marriages formed in the late 1960s to marriages formed in the late 1980s, then plunged among marriages formed in the 1990s, but eventually recovered to its previously high level in most rec ent marriage cohorts. Drawing from Oppenheimer's theory of marital change, I propose a new explanation for the cross -cohort trends in spouses' earnings correlation. The new explanation emphasizes the important role of the changing assortative mating. It al so highlights the roles of two new factors that have been largely neglected by prior research: change in the timing of marriage and change in low -skilled men's labor market status.

We analyze social inequalities in the study trajectories of bachelor -degree seeking students in the United States and Germany using two high quality student panel datasets (BPS and NEPS). As a methodological contribution, trajectory patterns are reconstructed based on a sequence -analytical approach, allowing for th e simultaneous consideration of the duration of study, co -enrollment, degree course switches and study interruptions. Regarding the institutional context of study trajectories, we consider structural differences between higher education systems and sectors. Results indicate that study trajectory patterns are overall more complex and differ more strongly by social origin in the US compared to the German higher education system. Further, differences by higher education sector are inverse across countri es: study trajectories are overall less linear in German research -oriented universities compared to universities of applied sciences, whereas US research universities enable more linear trajectories compared to other higher education institutions. 317 Who gets permission to bypass? Second chance alternatives for higher education as an institutionalized \"compensatory advantage\" mechanism Emek Hefer, Israel. 2Ben-Gurion University, Beersheba, Israel Abstract In Israel, a high school matriculation diploma is a prerequisite for academic studies. \"Second chance\" alternatives can bypass this requirement. Although originally designed to offer disadvantaged groups greater access to higher education, the alternatives may also serve as a \"compensatory advantage\" mechanism for students from affluent backgrounds, and thus increase educational inequality. This study examines both possibilities. Based on administrative data of children born in Is rael from 1978 -1983, a logistic regression analysis was performed that predicts the odds of being accepted to higher education studies. Interactions are between students' background characteristics - parental education, their class and ethnicity - and high school matriculation. The findings consistently show that students from affluent backgrounds utilize second chance mechanisms more often than disadvantaged students. It appears that second chance options may increase the inequality of educational opportun ities and represent an example of an institutionalized system of \"compensatory advantages\" that benefits students from affluent backgrounds. 396 Cyclic educational transitions and social inequality: Re -applications after Institute for Health and Welfare, Finland Abstract Educational transitions are cyclic processes in which re -applications are an essential but understated part of access. If the number of applicants exceeds the number of available slots, part of the applicants fails the transition but may re-apply in the next round. To study cyclic transitions, we explore applications to universities in Finland, where student selection takes place at the gates of the institutions. With full population register data and discrete -time event - history models, we show how parental education, matriculation exam grades and various life -course events after the rejection, s uch as earnings and family formation, are associated with re -applications. Net of other differences, children with a parental university degree have 6 percentage points lower probability to stop applying to university after institutional rejections compare d to others. We argue that ability -based intake to educational institutions is not sufficient for reducing social inequalities if staying in the queue is socially selective. 173 Mapping the distinct logics of educational and social stratification in Euro pean countries Fiona Gogescu London School of Economics, London, United Kingdom Abstract This paper looks at the way in which the organisational structures of different educational systems across European countries shape distinct logics of social stratification and related mobility patterns. I take education systems to have a multi -stage architecture, which structures transitions between different educational stages and towards work. I capture what happens at different educational stages (primary, secondary, and tertiary), until right after graduation from either vocational or higher education. As patterns of stratification are composed of several institutional features which can reinforce and attenuate each other, I employ cluster analysis, a multi variate descriptive technique that allows researchers to base judgements of similarity on a large number of characteristics which interact. This paper contributes to the literature on educational regimes and school -to-work transitions by adding countries f rom Central and Eastern Europe and integrating multiple dimensions pertaining to the link between educational and social stratification. 40 Tracking, social school segregation and social inequalities in students' achievement in secondary education. Longi tudinal analyses on England, France, Germany, and the United of Leipzig, Germany. 2Columbia University, USA. 3University of Halle, Germany. 4University of Bristol, United Kingdom. 5INED, France Abstract There is a substantial variation in the degree of social stratification in students' achievement across countries at the end of secondary school. However, almost all research is based on cross -sectional data. In this study, we evaluate (1) the change of achievement gaps by parents' socio -economic status (SES) during secondary school using recent longitudina l microdata for England, France, Germany, and the United States, and (2) whether country differences can be attributed to different tracking systems and/or the social segregation of schools. We find that SES -gaps in math achievement grow during secondary s chool in all four countries, most strongly in Germany. For all countries, about a quarter of the growth in SES -achievement gaps can be attributed to tracking or social segregation of schools. However, in Germany, it was mostly the between -school tracking t hat drives growing SES -achievement gaps, while in France and the US it can mostly be attributed to social segregation of schools. Work and Employment Quality - Session 8 16:00 - 17:20 Saturday, 23rd April, 2022 Room 6. NAB 1.15 Session 8 278 Starting flexible always flexible? The effect of employment flexibility for young workers in the Netherlands Laura Eberlein Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands Abstract This paper examines the extent to which a flexible employment contract (e.g., fixed -term, temporary agency, and on - call work, self -employment) at labour market entry affects the early career trajectories of young workers in the Netherlands. While previous research has mainly focused on studying point -in-time events - such as the transition to permanent employment - we focus on career outcomes. Specifically, I derive a typology of early employment trajectories by applying a Mixture Hidden Markov Model using detailed register data from Statistics Netherlands for all young worke rs who entered the labour market between 2009 -2013 and follow them for 6 years. Furthermore, I advance the existing literature by distinguishing between the different types of flexible employment to examine which of these types upon labour market entry neg atively affect the early career trajectories of Dutch school -leavers, thereby creating a new underclass of deprived temporary workers or whether initial disadvantages fade over time. 310 Doubly Disadvantaged: Unemployment Scars, Young Age, and Electoral Participation in the UK Leo Azzollini University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract Does past unemployment affect electoral participation if experienced during youth? A rising stream of research has examined the scar effects of unemployment on soci o-political behaviour, but this literature has scarcely examined the role of the life -course. Furthermore, existing evidence on electoral participation has mainly relied on cross -sectional models, thus not addressing time -invariant unobserved heterogenei ty at the respondent level such as birth cohort, and not allowing to capture precisely when the unemployment spell occurred. Building on the theoretical framework of labour market disadvantage and politics and on the impressionable year hypothesis in polit ical socialization, we posit that unemployment scars electoral participation, and that this effect is exacerbated at younger ages. We test these hypotheses relying on the British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society (1991 -2019), relying on cros s- sectional models (LPM and Logistic), and on panel models with unit Fixed Effects (Linear FE, Linear FE with Individual Slopes, and Conditional Logistic). Results suggest that the scar effects of unemployment on electoral participation in the UK are aroun d 4% (10% SD in turnout) and consistently statistically significant across the cross - sectional and panel models. On the other hand, the methodological choice matters for the interaction with age: the joint impact between unemployment scars and age is not s ignificant for the cross -sectional models, but significant for the panel models with unit FE, which remove the impact of birth cohort. The scarring effect is strongest at age 20 ( - 15%, -35% SD), and ceases to be significant at age 35, in line with the impr essionable years hypothesis. These results illuminate the centrality of a life course perspective to better understand the relationship between labour market hardships and socio -political behaviour. 380 Low wage -jobs - a stepping stone , a dead end or something in between? Identifying a spectrum of trajectories of low wage -workers in Sweden Karin Kristensson Department of Sociology Uppsala University, Sweden Abstract There is an increasing share of low -wage jobs worldwide. Whether these low wage -jobs function as a stepping stone to the labour market or if they are a dead end, remains unclear. However, assessing the probability of exiting low - wage work is fundamental for our understanding of individual economic security over the life cours e. In this paper, I investigate exits from low -wage work, allowing for differences across population categories and industries. I employ longitudinal Swedish registry data and competing risk time event history analysis. I follow individuals who enter the labour market with a low -wage job 2003 until 2019. This analytical framework enables me to explore a spectrum of trajectories in which individuals experience different probabilities of exiting low -wage work. This study will contribute to the literature by exploring a new analytical example, Sweden, and by taking into account inter -industry differences. Studying the probability of exiting low -wage work has strong policy implications for the role of low wage -work. I show that women and immigrants disproporti onally often start their career in a low -wage job. Restaurants, education, cleaning and care are overrepresented among these jobs. Descriptive indicate that low -wage jobs are not exclusively jobs with low educational requirements nor working class jobs. My preliminary findings suggest a risk of persistent low wage -belonging over time, and differences in the probability to exit across industries. 152 The meaning of useful work Peter H. van der Meer1, Rudi Wielers2 1Faculty of Economic and Business, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands. 2Department of Sociology, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands Abstract We test the arguments that the extent to which work is meaningful depends strongly on the job, and that it has its own effect on the labour market. We argue that the meaningfulness of the job mainly depends on opportunities for self - realization and on the social value of the work. We test the hypotheses on EWCS 2015 and ISSP 2015. Respondents show a high level of agreement about the meaningfulness of their job. The analysis shows that the meaningfulness is strongly determined by job characteristics related to self -realization. We find that workers in non -commercial organizations find their jobs more meaningful than workers in commercial organizations. There is a trade -off between the wage and the meaningfulness of the work, when we hold constant for self -realization. We conclude that the extent to which work is meaningful strongly depends on the opportunities for self -realization, and is cause for trade -offs between wages and meaningfulness. Children and Adolescent Development - Session 8 16:00 - 17:20 Saturday, 23rd April, 2022 Room 7. NAB 2.14 Session 8. 99 Maternal Occupation -Specific Skills and Children's Cognitive Development Katherin Barg1, Markus Klein2 1University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom. 2University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom Abstract This study investigates associations betwee n maternal occupation -specific skills and 5 -year-old children's cognitive ability. Scholarship on family SES and children's cognitive development did not fully capture the dimension of parental human capital . Following the literature on job conditions and personality development, the article suggests that maternal occupation -specific skills are another human capital dimension influencing children's cognitive development over and above parents' other human, economic, and social resources. Representative dat a from the UK Millennium Cohort Study on 13,543 children born in 2000 -02 were complemented with occupation -level data (n = 79) from the British Skills Surveys on aggregate measures of the importance of job tasks. Ordinary Least Squares regression was used to analyze whether maternal occupation -specific skills (literacy, numeracy, problem -solving, verbal and physical) are uniquely associated with children's inductive reasoning, spatial awareness, and verbal ability at age five net of other parental resources . Mothers' verbal skills (e.g., presentation and teaching skills) were positively associated with children's verbal abilities over and above other parental resources. Mothers' physical skills (e.g., use of physical strength) were negatively associated wit h children's verbal abilities net of other parental resources. None of the maternal occupation -specific skills were associated with children's non -verbal ability (inductive reasoning, spatial awareness). Maternal occupation -specific skills contribute to so cial stratification in children's verbal development net of human, financial and social capital. 207 When does inequality emerge in early years of life? Gaps in cognitive skills by family background among South Korean children aged 0 to 10 Youngshin Lim1, Seongsoo Choi2 1Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of. 2Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of Abstract Early childhood is crucial to understand educational inequality. Since the 2000s, an agreement has been reached that the cognitive skill gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged children is formed around the age of 3, before kindergarten begins. This lead s to another important question: are schools an institution that perpetuates inequality while serving the interests of the elite, or promotes equality by providing broad access to education to the non -elite who have been marginalized from educational oppor tunities? The comparison of early childhood inequality trends before and after entering school provides a definitive clue to this long -standing debates. Using the Panel Study on Korean Children(PSKC), we found that the cognitive skill gaps by family socio -economic status emerged before the age of 3 years, consistent with the results in other countries. The gaps, which had already been considerable around age 3, increase significantly until age 7. However, no evidence was found that the gap increases after e ntering elementary school. We also examined the role of early childhood education and care(ECEC) in the process of widening gaps in children's cognitive developments. The types and costs of ECEC that children attend for 3 -6 years does not make any differen ces in the trends of cognitive skill gaps. As most of the research evidence for the early childhood gaps are focused on some Western countries, our study is meaningful in that it provides rare comparative examples of non -Western and East Asian countries. 110 Is more screen time bad for adolescent wellbeing? Grace Chang London School of Economics and Political Science, London, United Kingdom Abstract Whether increasing hours of screen time is bad for adolescent wellbeing is still contested because researc h show conflicting findings from varying definitions, measures, and sub -group analyses. The present article answers this question by conceptualising four screen activities - social screen time, internet/audio content, video games or watching TV/DVDs - and examine whether more screen time is bad for adolescent wellbeing, measured by self - reported happiness and self -esteem, and parent -reported behavioural problems of the child. Using time diaries of 14 - year-olds in the UK, I use multivariate linear regression s to examine this relationship by the weekend/weekday, gender, and parental education. My findings show that social screen time and internet/audio content are harmful to all domains of adolescent wellbeing, especially if performed on a weekday, but playing video games are not. Girls have lower self -reported wellbeing than boys in relation to screen time, but sex differences are not present in parent - reported scores. Adolescents with higher educated parents have lower wellbeing scores from screen time compar ed to lower educated parents. 416 The Role of Parental Support in the Formation of Personality within Families Lea K Kr\u00f6ger1, Jonas Radl2 1WZB Berlin Social Science Center, Germany. 2Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain Abstract Recent studies focusing on the sibling similarity in personality have shown that a large part of the variation in personality traits is created inside rather than across families. In view of such heterogeneity within the family, a largely unanswered question is what proc esses create differences in personality between siblings. In this article, we aim to contribute to this emerging literature by answering the question: Does intra -family variation in parental support explain differences in personality between siblings? We d efine parental support as having a quantitative and a qualitative dimension, related to the amount of investment and the style of parenting behavior of parents. We use data from the German Socio -Economic Panel Study to conduct our study. Our sample consist s of siblings that have filled out the youth questionnaire at age 17 and the personal questionnaire in adulthood. As our indicators of personality, we chose the Big Five personality traits and locus of control. Our main independent variable is parental support, based on the Supportive Parenting Scale (SPS). We first estimate multilevel models with siblings nested in families and calculate the intra -class correlation (ICC) in personality traits as a measure of sibling similarity to understand the amount of variation in personality between and within families. We then estimate simple linear regression and sibling fixed -effects models to further investigate household -specific stratification processes in personality. Our results show that the majority of the va riation in personality traits is due to processes happening inside of the family. We find that parental support is one factor that contributes to these differences in personality between siblings. Parental support has a positive effect in adolescence on fo ur of the five Big Five personality traits and on locus of control. In early adulthood, this effect is still present, albeit of a smaller size than in adolescence. "}
