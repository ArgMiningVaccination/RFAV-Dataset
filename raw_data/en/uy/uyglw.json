No matter your needs, our medical professionals offer a variety of integrated therapies that best serve you. Integrative therapy uses healing practices that work with traditional medicine to help you get back to or maintain good health. These therapies are often referred to as holistic and take into account a person's mind, body and spirit, as well as other lifestyle factors that can influence health. These methods stem from the belief that health can be improved if all aspects of a person's life are taken into consideration and addressed. There are several different types of integrative and alternative behavioral therapy techniques that people of all ages or stages of development can use to their benefit. Integrative therapies can be used in both individual and group settings. [Reiki therapy](/services/integrative-therapy/reiki) focuses on using healing energy to increase a person's well-being and support healing. According to those who practice Reiki, healing energy already exists in the body but is depleted when a person is sick or stressed. Reiki therapy helps increase your energy healing supply and sets the stage for your mind, body and spirit to heal itself. This type of therapy can adapt to the needs of each person to remove stress, awaken creativity and deepen relaxation. Reiki can be used to relieve a variety of ailments including insomnia, headaches, anxiety, fatigue and sinus problems. Reiki only requires patients to sit back and relax while a therapist uses their hands to hover about 6 inches above their body. Some have described Reiki as a \"warm, glowing radiance\" sensation. Studies show that petting a dog can improve a person's blood pressure, heart rate and release endorphins that can block pain. Banner Health's [dog therapy program](/services/integrative-therapy/dog) helps patients relax and feel calm if they're experiencing anger, fear, upset or depression. Dogs can help encourage socialization, reduce loneliness and depression, offer mental stimulation and create a break from the routine of being a hospital patient. [Music therapy](/services/integrative-therapy/music) can be used to address physical, emotional, cognitive and social needs of individuals of all ages. This type of therapy can help improve the quality of life for children or adults with disabilities or illnesses. Each music therapy session is designed for individuals and groups based on their specific needs. These sessions can include music improvisation, songwriting, receptive music listening, lyric discussion, music performance and learning through music. Music therapy has many benefits, such as enhancing memory, increasing relaxation, alleviating pain, decreasing anxiety and improving communication. Aromatherapy is the practice of using natural oils extracted from the flowers, bark, leaves, roots or other parts of a plant to enhance psychological and physical well-being. This type of therapy can complement other health options, such as prescription medications. These oils can be applied during a hand or foot massage or the aromas can be inhaled when placed on something like gauze or a cotton ball. Aromatherapy can provide relief for many conditions, including nausea, anxiety or pain. Some of the most common benefits of aromatherapy include relaxation, stress relief and minor discomfort relief as well as immune system, respiratory system and circulatory system boosts. [Acupuncture](/services/integrative-therapy/acupuncture) is a common procedure practiced within traditional Chinese medicine. Acupuncture adjusts the body's life energy by inserting fine needles into carefully selected acupuncture points to increase blood flow, speed healing and stimulate hormonal changes. Studies have shown that acupuncture is an effective treatment alone or in combination with conventional therapies that are used to treat conditions, including but not limited to, addiction, respiratory conditions, digestion conditions, emotional conditions, gynecological conditions, headaches, pain, stress, stroke, nausea or pain. Massage therapy is used to increase blood flow, relax muscles, relieve stress and revitalize the body through a calming and caring touch. Massage therapy can help relieve aches and pains caused by physical activity, illness, injury or daily life. Additionally, massage therapy can help reduce anxiety, stress, tension, pain and nausea, resulting in improved sleep, respiration, digestion and circulation. Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is designed to help people with a history of depression. This type of therapy combines concepts of cognitive behavioral therapy with the principles of mindfulness to help prevent a relapse from recurrent episodes of depression. MBCT helps patients find a new way to relate to thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations. In some cases, MBCT can be as effective as an antidepressant. It has been shown to reduce relapses of depression. Therapy and alternative behavioral therapy techniques can be combined with almost any type of psychotherapy technique. Integrative techniques can be used to treat problems and disorders including anxiety, depression and personality disorders. Integrative therapy is considered more inclusive than traditional forms of therapy as it considers the patient's needs, physical abilities, spiritual beliefs, preferences and motivation level. Therapists and patients work together to determine which integrative treatment will be most effective. Integrative therapy can be a great way for patients to find relief. Our expert staff is here to help you find the best integrative approach to meet your unique needs and circumstances. "}
