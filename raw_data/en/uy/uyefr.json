THE SOLUTIONS DIFFERENCE Dr. Ehrlich started Solutions because he was frustrated by what he saw in health care - both conventional and \"naturopathic\": Doctors were failing to address the fundamental CAUSES of a patient's illness and failing as well to develop a methodical, step-by-step plan for that individual patient to find their way back to the vital health that everyone deserves. Determined to create a medical center where people could find real answers and a clear individualized path to take them out of the despair of pain and illness Dr. Ehrlich founded Solutions, and like the name implies this is a medical center focused on solving complex health challenges getting people back to living with joy and vitality.
