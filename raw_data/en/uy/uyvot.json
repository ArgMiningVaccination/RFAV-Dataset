(In case you're not familiar \u2014 here are 1 [0 signs of a vaccine reaction](https://modernalternativemama.com/2016/03/18/10-signs-of-vaccine-reaction-and-damage/).) That's why we're sharing some important ways to detox from those vaccines today. And, if you're not sure why it matters, check out all our [vaccine education posts](https://modernalternativemama.com/vaccine-education/) to learn more. By [Danielle](https://wellyouwellness.wordpress.com/), Contributing Writer Many will tell you that vaccines save lives and without them, the world would be a terrible, disease-ridden place. If you've come to the realization that science says differently, but have been vaccinated or allowed your children to be vaccinated, there are ways to detox the body from vaccines. Why Do We Need to Detox? Vaccines contain more toxins than the majority of the population realizes. Formaldehyde, antibiotics not approved by the FDA, mercury, and other heavy metals, as well as the bacteria or virus of the vaccine and its preservatives. If you feel like you need more information and unbiased research on vaccines, we have [boatloads of information](https://modernalternativemama.com/what-to-do-about-vaccines/) to help you come to a decision. [Making a healthy decision for your child ](https://modernalternativemama.com/vaccine-education/)is one of your top priorities as a parent. [Reactions look differently for everyone](https://modernalternativemama.com/2016/03/18/10-signs-of-vaccine-reaction-and-damage/) depending on your body's current immune system and health status, as well as your genetics. You may have a rash, fever, or just feel ill, or possibly develop an autoimmune disease. Review the [vaccine's package insert ](http://www.immunize.org/packageinserts/)to see its ingredients and side effects. Look at the [VAERS database](https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/index) to see reported adverse side effects, and even see if a batch number you took had similar reactions. These reactions are a good sign that you need to detox from vaccines. Who Should Detox? If you've ever received a vaccine or taken a harmful pharmaceutical, you can detox. The good news is that detoxes can be gentle and typically produce few side effects during the detox, and improved health once the detox is complete. It's important to detox from vaccines if at all possible. Healthy adults and children over age 4 (the immune system is fully developed around the ages of 3-4) are the ideal candidates for a detox, but of course, you may be living with chronic or acute illness from the vaccines. It's best to start slow and set aside time from work and life to complete a detox. Children can also be detoxed, but it must be taken with great care, and under the supervision of a trusted physician when possible. If you are pregnant or nursing, taking prescriptions, under a doctor's supervision, or being treated for an illness, do not detox. There are numerous labs that you can take which will show the heavy metals present in the body from vaccines. Both hair follicle and blood testing are available. Possible Reactions to Detoxing It is normal to feel ill the first few days when you detox from vaccines, or a few days into the detox, if you do not normally eat whole foods and have never detoxed, this is called a \"healing crisis.\" As many toxins leave your body, you may feel nauseous, tired, or have digestive issues. When you detox, be sure to rest as much as possible, and drink at least 8 cups of water per day, if not more when possible. If you become extremely ill, or cannot keep down food or water, or have diarrhea for over 24 hours, please discontinue the detox and contact your physician immediately. Always talk with a trusted physician before beginning a detox or new supplement regimen, or if you have prescriptions. 10 Ways To Detox From Vaccines #1) Detox Baths Epsom salt, bentonite clay, and essential oil baths can all pull toxins out of the skin, your body's largest immune organ. Start with a warm bath of 1/4 cup of Epsom salts 2-3 times per week. You can also add a few drops (2-3) of lavender or coriander essential oils and 1/8 cup of bentonite clay for added detoxification. #2) Get Sweating! Sweating is another great way to rid the body of toxins. Running, jumping jacks, rebounding (see below), or even going into a sauna (be cautious with young children) are good ways to sweat the toxins out of the body, that are trapped in the lymphatic system. If you do not have a sauna near you, you can purchase a simple body sauna online. Sweating is a great way to detox from vaccines. Start slow, with 5-10 minutes a day twice a week at a low heat. If you do not sweat, your body is not ready to detox. Gradually add time (up to 15-20 minutes) and heat. Do not use a sauna at a high heat for more than three times per week. Always use a sauna under supervision. #3) Cilantro and Chlorella Juices or in Raw Form Cilantro has been shown to bind to heavy metals and pull them out of the body. This is a very effective way to detox from vaccines. You can purchase cilantro and chlorella tinctures, but the raw plant in foods or juiced is best. Silica is another mineral that has been shown to remove aluminum in the body, a grave concern for vaccines. Choose a natural (horsetail) silica supplement. Juice 1/3 bunch of cilantro and add to another juice (pineapple or orange) at least three times per week. If used for an older child or adult, you can put raw cilantro in foods. #4) Chelation and Vitamin C Therapy Chelation therapy uses high doses of detoxing mediums intravenously to pull the toxins out of the body. This must be done under the supervision of a knowledgeable physician and tailored to the patient. High dose vitamin C therapy also revs up the immune system and allows it to dispel the held up toxins. This is also available intravenously and has been shown to quickly cure many illnesses, such as whooping cough and aid in wound healing. Find a knowledgeable physician who offers chelation or vitamin C therapy. #5) Homeopathic Methods of Detox A licensed naturopath can determine a homeopathic regimen or series of homeopathic remedies to detox from specific toxins based on lab results. Talk with your naturopath and consider lab heavy metal and other toxin testing to find exactly which homeopathic remedies may help you or your child detox. #6) Elderberry Syrup As you detox, you need to be sure that your immune system is able to fight off all the latent bacteria and viruses which are flushing through the body. Elderberry is one of the best antivirals, and paired with the antibacterial properties of raw local honey, makes it a virus and bacteria double hitter. Children love the taste of elderberry syrup, and it can be added to a favorite juice or smoothie. [Make your own syrup with this simple recipe](https://wellyouwellness.wordpress.com/2015/08/31/how-to-make-elderberry-syrup-you-can-actually-stomach/), or purchase elderberry syrup online. Give one teaspoon daily (or as the product directs) before, during, and after the detox. #7) Get Your Gut Right Probiotics, prebiotics, and fermented foods with good bacteria will boost your gut health and allow your child's system to properly regulate toxins and other misplaced bacteria, viruses, and fungus. Numerous studies are coming out to show that those with autism also have serious intestinal damage, could there be a correlation? You bet. [Purchase a probiotic,](https://www.hyperbiotics.com/products/pro-kids) prebiotics, and fermented foods and add them to your or your child's normal diet. #8) Digestive Organ Detox and Reboot When detoxing, your digestive organs take the brunt of the cleanup. Your liver, in particular, pulls out and determines what is and is not a toxin, and what good vitamins and minerals your body should absorb. We need to be certain that the liver is in top shape to properly detox. We do not want to pull the toxins out of other tissues and organs in the body only to be blocked from releasing from the liver (now we have a sick liver!). It's wise to be sure you are keeping the liver clean before, during, and after your detox from vaccines. Try [dandelion root tea](http://www.dandyblend.com/). Consume a cup 1-3 times per week. If your little one doesn't like the bitter taste of dandelion root, try [milk thistle tea](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Alvita-Teas-Organic-Herbal-Tea-Bags-Milk-Thistle-24-Bags/26971305?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=1059&adid=22222222227018416233&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=52347648495&wl4=pla-79445027895&wl5=9021701&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=112354240&wl11=online&wl12=26971305&wl13=&veh=sem). Consume a cup 1-3 times per week. #9) Massage, Dry Brushing, and Rebounding Your lymphatic organs and fluids push your immune cells and fluids around your body to attack any invaders and keep things moving smoothly. Unfortunately, there is no pump for these fluids like there is for the blood system (your heart!). This leaves it up to you to move the fluids from the lower to the upper organs (thanks, gravity!). Massage, dry brushing your skin, and rebounding are three of the best ways to get those fluids moving and allow those organs to complete their detoxing process. Learn how to do a [simple lymphatic massage](http://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-perform-lymphatic-drainage-massage). Purchase a [dry brush](https://www.amazon.com/Yerba-Prima-Tampico-Skin-Brush/dp/B00016RIIA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=wellnessmama-20&linkId=9fe3317daffb0bafa392bdcb48639556) and [brush 3-4 times per week correctly.](http://wellnessmama.com/26717/dry-brushing-skin/) Find a [rebounder](https://www.walmart.com/ip/22187604?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&adid=22222222227016043361&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=40837559912&wl4=pla-78651137072&wl5=9021701&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=online&wl12=22187604&wl13=&veh=sem) (or find a small trampoline at a local garage sale) and try to jump for at least 1-3 minutes 3-4 days per week. #10) Water! Your body cannot flush out toxins if you're dehydrated. Be sure the person being detoxed has at a minimum 8 cups of filtered or alkaline water daily. Fiji water is great to have while detoxing because its silica content is high, and will aid in detoxing heavy metals. Drink 8 cups of filtered or alkaline water daily at least during a detox. We've all made decisions we wish we could change. Do not feel bad about the choices you made when you had less information. Instead, move forward with this knowledge and work to reverse the damage. Many, many people have seen their children recover fully from serious vaccine damage, including autism. "}
