He advised members that PHA staff had had an opportunity to attend a workshop at which the Chief Executive outlined key aspects of the announcement and what t his might mean. He said that changes provided an opportunity to do things differently, and for innovation, and advancing new ideas for a changing environment. He added that the PHA should not let slip any opportunities which might be seized at thi s brief window in time. The Chair said that he had met with all non-executi ve members on a 1:1 basis, and altogether, and that this had b een useful. He added that he had attended a Safe and Well event in the Down Lisburn area. The Chair informed members that he had met with Ass istant Directors Janet Little, Mary Black and Lorraine Doh erty and continued to be impressed by the range of work in w hich the PHA is involved. The Chair said that he had attended one of the cons ultation events on Lifeline and that he was planning to atte nd the next Board meeting of Public Health England. 115/15 Item 6 - Chief Executive's Business 115/15.1 The Chief Executive also made reference to the Mini sterial announcement and said that he was expecting further information from DHSSPS regarding the constitution of the expert panel and the consultation process. ~ 3 ~ 115/15.2 115/15.3 115/15.4 115/15.5 The Chief Executive said that he had attended the A GM of Resurgam in Lisburn at which Mervyn Storey attended . He said that Mr Storey had been complimentary of the work o f PHA. The Chief Executive said that as part of the next p hase of the work relating to local government and the implement ation of Making Life Better, he had attended a series of mee tings with local Councils. He made specific reference to the work undertaken by Belfast City Council on their City pl an which maps together their relationships with other regional an d statutory bodies. The Chief Executive said that he had visited three areas in Ballymena with councillors and local community repr esentatives. Alderman Porter outlined an example of how the work that PHA does in local communities is important. He said th at \u00a320k of PHA funding had helped secure \u00a3500k of future inves tment from other bodies. 116/15 Item 7 - Finance Update - PHA Financial Performance Report (PHA/01/11/15) 116/15.1 116/15.2 116/15.3 Mr Cummings presented the Finance Report and advise d that the year-to-date position showed a surplus of \u00a321k against a budget of \u00a343.8m, which is made up of a \u00a3224k defic it in non- Trust expenditure and a \u00a3245k surplus in the manage ment and administration budget. He added that the year-end position is projected to be a break even one. Mr Cummings highlighted the section in the report l ooking at non- Trust expenditure and explained that the surplus in the Lifeline budget is being offset by expenditure within both H ealth Improvement and Health Protection. He clarified th at these are not overspends, but issues regarding profiling the budget across the year. Mr Drew asked if there was a reason for the undersp end. Mr Cummings explained that this was due to a change in activity levels. Dr Harper added that the reduction has fol lowed recent meetings with Contact regarding their management of the contract. Mr Drew sought assurance that the needs of callers ~ 4 ~ 116/15.4 116/15.5 116/15.6 116/15.7 116/15.8 were continuing to be met. Dr Harper indicated thi s was at the core of PHA's work with the provider as well as mon itoring and review of the contract. Mr McClean explained that the issue was about ensuring that callers were receiving appropri ate follow-up therapies consistent with their specific needs. Dr Harper advised that demand for the follow-on cou nselling services has decreased. Mr Drew clarified that the previous level of calls being invoiced was unnecessarily high. Dr Harper said that following a clinical audit, this was noted to be the case and that PHA took action in this regard. Mr Cummings a dded that mediation had been required. Mr Drew asked whether the business case reflected the current volume of activ ity and whether going forward the contract should cost less . Dr Harper said that this should be case, but she added that a ny underspend is being reinvested into other mental health and su icide prevention work. Alderman Porter noted that this has been a major is sue for the PHA Board and it was refreshing to see this reducti on. Mr Cummings moved on to the management and administ ration budget and said that PHA should be pleased that it is achieving savings despite the reduction in this budget for 20 15/16. Mr Cummings drew members' attention to the mid-year balance sheet at the end of the Report. Members noted the Finance Report. 117/15 Item 8 - Performance Management Report - Corporate Business Plan and Commissioning Plan Directions Tar gets for Period Ending 30 September 2015 (PHA/02/10/15) 117/15.1 117/15.2 Mr McClean presented the performance management rep ort for the first six months and said that it covered both the Business Plan targets and the Commissioning Plan direction t argets. He said that at this stage two of the targets were rat ed \"red\" and 18 were rated \"amber\". He noted that many of these we re rated this way due to factors outwith PHA's control. Alderman Porter asked whether of the targets had be en carried over from previous years but Mr McClean advised tha t these ~ 5 ~ 117/15.3 117/15.4 117/15.5 117/15.6 were new targets. Mr Mahaffy asked whether the \"green\" rating for Mak ing Life Better was truly reflective of progress to date and what this was being measured against. The Chief Executive began his response by saying that a fuller update on Making L ife Better would be presented at a future meeting. He said th at the targets to date principally related to the establishment of the different forums and that these had begun to meet. Mr Mahaff y said he hoped that Making Life Better would have a greater impact than the previous Investing for Health strategies. The Chief Executive said that he also hoped that this would be the case , and said that it was critical that there was buy-in to Making Lif e Better across all sectors. Mr Mahaffy made reference to the Anti -Poverty Strategy. The Chief Executive said that it was imp ortant that all of these different strategies, including anti-pover ty be fed into the next Programme for Government. Mr Coulter made reference to the C difficile and MR SA levels and expressed concerns about the Trusts exceeding t heir targets. He suggested that this action should be r ated \"red\". Dr Harper explained that there are differences between Trusts, and that in any Trust where the target is being exceede d PHA would meet with Trusts and local GPs. She said that with regard to anti-microbial resistance, PHA has limited resource s to take forward work in this area, but that this area is se en as a priority over the coming years. She said that with regard t o C difficile and MRSA, Trusts have made significant progress in recent years and that Trusts in Northern Ireland are holdi ng their own in comparison to Trusts across the rest of the UK. Mr Coulter said he understood PHA's role to be an a dvisory one. Dr Harper agreed that DHSSPS sets the policy and PH A has to monitor this and, in response to a question from th e Chair, she advised that there is an Escalation Policy. She po inted out that the number of cases is quite small in relative term s. Mr Drew said it was pleasing to see so many targets rated as \"green\". He asked that, given the proposed changes , was there any indication as to which delivery areas would be affected. The Chief Executive said that it would depend on which functions were transferred. ~ 6 ~ 117/15.7 117/15.8 117/15.9 117/15.10 Mr Mahaffy asked about the commissioned report rela ting to PPI. Mrs Hinds agreed to send Mr Mahaffy a copy of this report. Mrs Erskine said that she hoped that the new HRPTS system would allow PHA to monitor the registration of nurs es and midwives. Mrs Hinds said that PHA is looking at al ternative solutions. Mr Coulter asked about the Diabetic Retinopathy Scr eening Programme. He noted the absence of a key member of staff and asked about the impact of this on the programme. D r Harper acknowledged that there are backlog issues, but the programme is getting back on track. The Chair asked if there was any evidence of a lower take-up on this programme from those of lower socio-economic classes. Dr Harper said that there is an extensive action plan, and as part of this there ar e videos on the PHA website from patients who have previously used the programme and want to encourage others to come forw ard. The Chair congratulated staff on their achievements to date. Members noted the performance management report. 118/15 Item 9 - Unscheduled Care 118/15.1 118/15.2 118/15.3 118/15.4 The Chief Executive reminded members that at the la st meeting he had announced that new arrangements were being p ut in place to take forward work in unscheduled care. He said that the Regional Unscheduled Care Group had held its first meeting and that the Strategic Accountability Group, which woul d be jointly chaired by himself and Valerie Watts, Chief Executi ve of HSCB, was holding its first meeting on 7 December. The Chief Executive noted that this is a significan t additional workload for both HSCB and PHA with a lot of resour ces being consumed and no backfill. The Chair asked if there was a timeline for the com pletion of this work. The Chief Executive said work is being under taken every day, but this was a long term project and the meeti ng of 7 December would be used an opportunity to evaluate p rogress to date. Members noted the update on unscheduled care. ~ 7 ~ 119/15 Item 10 - Lifeline Consultation 119/15.1 119/15.2 119/15.3 119/15.4 119/15.5 119/15.6 Dr Harper gave members an update on the Lifeline co nsultation process. She said that there have been a number of consultation events, and that in general the questions raised at these events related to the separation of the telephone from the follow on services, and the skillset of those handing the cal ls. She said that all of the main themes from the consultation w ould be collated and fully considered. Dr Harper outlined the proposed next steps. She sa id that there would be a workshop for PHA Board members on 17 Dec ember to look at a draft of the paper summarising the mai n issues emerging through the consultation process which wou ld be formally brought to the PHA Board in January 2016. She said that to date 157 responses had been received to the consultation. Alderman Porter asked whether specific groups were targeted as part of the consultation, and when responses are re ceived, are any major concerns or issues raised dealt with imme diately. Dr Harper said that she would check this, and in terms of responses the summary report will show the numbers of respons es made by individuals, organisations, staff etc. Mrs Erskine and Mr Drew both stated that they had a ttended one of the consultation events and commented on the professionalism of the PHA staff participating. Mr McClean said that PHA Board members would receiv e a copy of each of the submissions. Members noted the update on the Lifeline consultati on. 120/15 Item 11 - Media Monitoring on Suicide 120/15.1 120/15.2 Mr McClean welcomed Mr Stephen Wilson and Ms Roisin McManus to the meeting and invited them to deliver the presentation on media monitoring on suicide. Mr Wilson explained that the area of media monitori ng on suicide has been well researched and the way that the press pick up and ~ 8 ~ 120/15.3 120/15.4 120/15.5 120/15.6 120/15.7 120/15.8 120/15.9 120/15.10 report on suicide has raised major concerns, and th is was highlighted in the Protect Life Strategy. Ms McManus gave an overview of the media monitoring and explained that in her role she would analyse each r eference to suicide in the press and if necessary, follow this up with the appropriate organisation if it is deemed that the c overage is inappropriate. She added that PHA had begun to wor k with the universities, offering courses in communications, a nd the National Union of Journalists. Mr Wilson said that PHA has begun to work with the Western Trust as part of its Community Response Plan. He s aid that there is a need to be more responsive in terms of c losing down sites on social media. Alderman Porter asked whether an article that has b een shared on social media can be taken down. Ms McManus expl ained that if there is a link to an article and the article ha s been amended then the link will direct people to the updated art icle. Mr Drew suggested that PHA could work with other or ganisations in this e.g. PSNI and Translink. Mr Coulter welcomed this work but added that with t he advent of social media, the scale of the problem is huge and it is important to come up with ways of addressing these issues. Mrs McKissick asked who was delivering the training . Ms McManus advised that it was herself and a colleague from Samaritans. Mrs McKissick asked what would happen in a situation where an organisation does not comply wit h the guidelines set. Mr Wilson said that the guidelines developed by Samaritans have a lot of credibility and are genera lly followed. The Chair asked if editors are responsive when issu es are raised. Ms McManus said that in approximately two- thirds of cases PHA would receive a response. She added that the training is not targeted solely at journalists but also editors. Members noted the presentation on media monitoring on suicide and thanked Ms McManus and Mr Wilson for an insight into this important area of PHA work. ~ 9 ~ 121/15 Item 12 - 10,000 Voices Phase 2: Regional Report Re lating to Care in Your Own Home (October 2015) (PHA/03/10/15) Item 13 - 10,000 Voices: Regional Report on Experie nce of Nursing and Midwifery two reports which were comp iled following responses to the 10,000 Voices initiative . She said that she and Mr Cummings chair the steering group. To g ather the responses for the initiative she said that staff ha d garnered stories from people in shopping centres as well as in their own home. In general, she said that the stories were p ositive, but that there is more learning from stories which are negat ive. In terms of the first report, \"Care in Your Own Hom e\", Mrs Hinds said that the main issues are isolation and lonelin ess; timing of calls and call allocation; care of clients with dem entia; and communication. She said that the issue of isolatio n and loneliness is a major one and one that the HSC cann ot resolve on its own, and that there should be joined-up work ing with organisations like church groups and voluntary grou ps. She added that a workshop will be planned as this is pa rt of the Making Life Better strategy. Mr Cummings said that there are workforce issues fo r HSC and that the current economic climate and the introduct ion of a new living wage will see the situation worsen. Mr Mahaffy asked if there was a breakdown available by provider so that comparisons could be made. He also noted t hat there was a disproportionate number of responses from Tru sts. Mrs Hinds said that people volunteered their stories an d that Trust employees would tend to ask people in Trust setting s for their stories, but she said that there were efforts to ca pture as many stories as possible from as many different settings as possible. Councillor Ashe asked whether it was more productiv e for agencies to carry out a large number of short visit s, or a shorter number of longer visits to patients in their own ho mes. Mr Cummings said that it was more likely that Trusts w ould allocate more time to with the more difficult calls. Mr Dre w said that there would be issues in terms of the quality of the care provided in ~ 10 ~ 121/15.6 121/15.7 121/15.8 121/15.9 121/15.10 121/15.11 121/15.12 short calls. The Chair asked about the number of providers and i f comparisons were possible, but Mr Cummings explaine d that one Trust has 37 providers. Mrs Erskine asked about an action plan. Mrs Hinds said that PHA would wish to take time to review what can be d one based on the findings in order to have the biggest impact . Alderman Porter asked if the inputs are confidentia l. Mrs Hinds confirmed that each story is confidential, but any concerns raised are immediately escalated. Alderman Porter said th at every story is vital and Mrs Hinds agreed adding that per haps in a setting like a shopping centre people may be inclin ed to say more about their experiences. Mrs McKissick said that in the main, the report sup ported findings from work undertaken by PCC, namely that care visit s are rushed and that there are feelings of isolation and that t here is a need to have a workshop which would involve people and care rs. She went on to say that the issue of isolation should b e looked at by Councils as part of their remit. Mrs Hinds noted t hat this is where Making Life Better will become important. Mrs McKissick said that the recent Domiciliary Care Review is quite technical and asked whether there were other ways of using the information from 10,000 Voices to better inform future direction. Mrs Hinds said that this report will be shared with Trusts and they will be held to account to deliver on the recommendations. Mr Coulter welcomed the report and said it contribu ted to the understanding of issues around domiciliary care. H e said that one of the biggest concerns for him is about domici liary care which is delivered by patient's own families and va riances around the quality of this. He expressed concern about th e variability across Trusts with regard to sheltered housing. Fi nally, he asked about the rigour of this exercise and if there woul d be any external evaluation of the 10,000 Voices project. Mrs Hinds said that the project is held in high reg ard and there was a presentation about the programme delivered to the Kings ~ 11 ~ 121/15.13 121/15.14 121/15.15 121/15.16 121/15.17 Fund in London. She said that the Sensemaker tool which is used to collate the stories can show highlight area s that staff can focus on to resolve issues. Mr Coulter said that t he tool is not used for evidence-based commissioning. Mr Cummings said that the findings have forced commissioners to look at fresh ideas, but he added that the majority of this type of care is not carried out by the Trusts, where there could be up to 50 providers that we have limited control over. He we nt on to say that the issue of social isolation is not one that the health service alone can solve. He said that report has highlight ed that a situation cannot continue whereby the tendering pro cess leads to procuring the cheapest, and therefore, lowest quali ty of service. The Chief Executive said that the use of Sensemaker has allowed PHA to analyse information better, and this added value is allowing concerns to be picked up and dealt with immediately. Mr Drew said that in terms of procurement, there wa s a need to be smarter and build in criteria requirements. Dr Harper outlined to members the example of a model being used in Hol land. Mrs Hinds moved onto the second report which relate d to Nursing and Midwifery Key Performance Indicators. She said that there are good examples of care, but there are issues with regard to staffing levels and that there are effort s being made to increase the number of nurses with discussions taki ng place with heads of nursing regarding this. Mrs McKissick said that its findings concur with th ose of a recent piece of work by PCC. She noted that there are iss ues of expectant mothers feeling that they are not being l istened to and not being taken seriously. Overall, she welcomed t he report and its recommendations. Members approved the two 10,000 Voices Reports. 122/15 Item 14 - Any Other Business 122/15.1 There was no other business. ~ 12 ~ 123/15 Item 15 - Date and Time of Next Meeting Date: Time: Venue: Thursday 17 December 2015 1:30pm Conference 2nd Floor 12/22 ________________ Public Health Agency Finance Report 2015-16 Month 7 - October 2015 663 570 1,233 - 637 314 49,225 - 21,944 - Administration - - 22,402 - (1,572) 290 (1,282) The year to date financial position for the PHA sho ws an overspend against profiled budget of \u00a31.3m. This is the result of non-trust expenditure ahead o f profile by \u00a31.6m, offset by a year-to-date underspend on Ma nagement & Administration of \u00a30.3m. The detail beh ind these variances is set out on pages 3 and 4 of this report. It is currently anticipated that the PHA will breakeven on its full year budget.

Non-Trust Programme Expenditure The financial position to date shows expenditure is \u00a31.6m ah ead of the budget profile. This is primarily due to a number of Health Improvement payments being made earlier than antici pated due to faster processing by Shared Services, with the expenditure expected to come back into line with profile over the next few months. An underspen d against the Lifeline contract is expected to continue. The Programme position is being closely managed and a plan has been developed to manage the variances and ensure a breakeven position for the financial year. A significant portion of the budget is currentlyprofiled in the last quarter which Budget managers have confirmed will b e utilised in 2015-16. Budget managers have been asked to rev iewthese figures closelyand liaise with the Financial Management team if amendments to prof iles are required. -2,000 - 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 for Connected Health Nursing & AHP Campaigns Research & Development Service Development & Screening Health Protection Health Improvement Total Non-Trust Budget Page 3October 2015 Nursing & AHP Operations Public Health PHA Board Centre for Connected Total \u00a3'000 318 475 17,587 Goods & Services 227 1,421 556 (120) 82 442 profiled Salaries 1,641 2,029 5,869 156 182 302 10,179 Goods & Services 123 788 300 (70) 49 96 1,285 Total 1,763 2,817 6,169 86 231 Salaries 1,658 2,026 5,824 141 188 302 10,139 Goods & Services 68 701 181 (29) 12 102 1,035 Total 1,727 2,726 6,005 112 200 403 11,174 Surplus/(Deficit) to date Salaries (18) 3 45 15 (6) (0) 39 Goods & Services 54 87 119 (41) 36 (6) 250 Surplus/(Deficit) 37 90 164 (26) 30 (6) 290 PHA Administration 2015-16 Directorate Budgets The Management & Administration (M&A) budget for th e PHA was reduced by the DHSSPS in 2015-16 by 15%, or \u00a32.8m. However, after discussion and liaison wi th the DHSSPS, it was agreed that, for the current year only, a total of \u00a31.3m will be generated from withi n M&A budgets and the balance of \u00a31.5m will be mana ged across the total PHA budget. This process will allow a more strategic review to be completed in o rder to deliver a recurrent 15% reduction in future years. Total recurrent budgets allocated to Directorates have bee n reduced bythe actual 2014-15 surplus and a 20% travel savin g, totalling \u00a31.149m. This leaves a balance of \u00a30.151m again st the \u00a31.3m savings target, and this is currentlyheld in the PHA Board cost centre being mana ged centrallythrough Scrutinyand other measures. The over all M&A budget has increased by\u00a30.2m from month 6 as a result o f additional allocations for Dementia Strategy (\u00a328k), EITP (\u00a316k), Vaccines (\u00a36 0k) and the SBNI PHA received a ringfenced allo cation of \u00a32.2m to fund a Voluntary Exit Scheme in 2015-16. This funding is currently held in the PHA Board cost centre, profiled at the end of the year so as not to impact year to date figures. These funds will be m onitored and reported on separately, with greater d etail provided in this report as the year progresse s.While cumulatively to date a surplus of \u00a30.290m is shown, (including a \u00a36k overspend in SBNI which is expected to breakeven for the year), this has large ly been generated from Goods & Services budgets wit hin Operations, which may be required later in the year . PHA must therefore continue to manage discretion ary expenditure and savings plans to ensure a break even position at the end of the financial year.

A service framework is a document which contains ex plicit standards, underpinned by evidence and legislative requirements. Service fram eworks set targets, timeframes and expected outcomes for specific services, and are de signed to: improve the health and social wellbeing of the popu lation of Northern Ireland, reduce inequalities and promote social inclusion, improve the quality and safety of care, safeguard vulnerable individuals and groups, improve partnership working with other agencies and sectors. Each Service Framework follows an individual's jour ney from prevention through to end-of- life care taking into account the different health and social care needs of children and adults. Service frameworks links the key policies and strat egies already developed, and draw on evidence from established sources, including the Na tional Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE). The revised Respiratory Service Framework was launc hed by the Health Minster on 10th September for implementation across Northern Irelan d. On 8th October 2015, DHSSPS wrote to the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) an d the Public Health Agency (PHA) requesting an Implementation Plan to be submitted b y 18th December 2015. This document set out the phased implementation plan for all thre e years of the framework (2015-2018). 2.2 SERVICE FRAMEWORK FOR RESPIRATORY HEALTH AND WELLBEING The RSFW sets standards in relation to the preventi on, assessment, diagnosis, treatment, care, rehabilitation and palliative care of the ind ividuals and communities who currently have or are at greater risk of developing respirato ry diseases. 2.2.1 Initial Service Framework The initial Service Framework for Respiratory Health and Wellbe ing was formally launched by the Minister for Health Social Services and Publ ic Safety in 2009, recognising that it was, and continues to be, one of the most significant ca uses of ill health and disability in Northern Ireland. 2.2.2 The Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (R QIA) Review The initial Respiratory Service Framework finished its three years implementation cycle in 2012. The RQIA then completed an independent review of the implementation of the original Framework in 2013 and gave a positive repo rt on progress achieved. The Review Service Framework for Respiratory Health and Wellbe ing - Detailed Implementation Plan 5 | P a g e Report is available using the following link: http://www.rqia.org.uk/publications/rqia_reviews/rq ia_reviews_2013.cfm RQIA found widespread support among stakeholders fo r the service framework approach. There was a clear consensus that the framework had established a vehicle to realise the goals and objectives of the Northern Ireland Strate gic Framework for Respiratory Conditions ('A Healthier Future': March 2006). The RQIA was co mplementary regarding the partnership approach adopted during development of the framewor k that created a positive platform and a strong foundation for the implementation proc ess. The review team also found that collaboration with service users, stakeholders and the public was well planned, and to the forefront of bo th the development and the implementation of the Respiratory Service Framework . The stakeholders' feedback was that the implementation process has been a success that shaped the way services are being taken forward, and the framework contributed signif icantly to improvements in respiratory services. 2.2.3 Revision of initial RSFW The Original Framework, upon reaching the end of it s 3-year cycle, underwent a fundamental review in 2014, conducted by the Region al Respiratory Forum. Following this process, the revised version of the Framework was i ssued for public consultation. The final version of the revised 'Service Framework for Respiratory Health and Wellb eing' , was published by DHSSPS on 10 th September 2015. Both documents may be accessed on the Department's website: http://www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/index/phealth/sqs/sqsd-s tandards-service-frameworks/sqsd- service_frameworks_respiratory.htm 2.2.4 The Service Framework and We llbeing 2015-2018 The revised RSFW recognises that several diseases c an co-exist, share common risk factors and can adversely impact on prognosis; therefore th e revised service framework included both standards for specific respiratory conditions, as well as standards relating to all respiratory conditions, and also generic standards relating to a range of conditions. The revised framework sets out standards for the whole care pat hway for respiratory diseases from prevention through diagnosis, treatme nt, ongoing care, rehabilitation to palliative and end of life care. Each standard is s upported by key performance indicators, which set levels of performance to be achieved over the three-year period 2015/16 - 2017/18. The revised RSFW includes 46 standards, each of whi ch is supported by Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) with target levels of performance to be achieved over 3 years. The revised Framework will continue to be subject to regular re view and refinement, to ensure it provides a sound basis for continued improvement in the quality of health and social services. Service Framework for Respiratory Health and Wellbe ing - Detailed Implementation Plan 6 | P a g e Standards for specific respiratory conditions: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Adult Oxygen Asthma in Adults Asthma in Children and Young People Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) in Adults Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) in Children and Young People Obstructive Sleep Apnoea / Hypopnoea Syndrome in Ad ults (OSAHS) Obstructive Sleep Apnoea / Hypopnoea Syndrome in Ch ildren and Young People (OSAHS) Long Term Ventilation in Adults (LTV) Long Term Ventilation in Children and Young People (LTV) Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Bronchiectasis Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) Standards relating to all respiratory conditions: Pulmonary Rehabilitation Transitional Care for Adolescents with Chronic Resp iratory Disease Acute Oxygen Therapy Social and Emotional Support Information Training Medicines Management Palliative Care 2.2.5 Generic Standards Generic standards on Communication and Involvement, Health Improvement and Protection and Palliative and End of Life Care are also included in the RSFW. These standards are common to all Service Frameworks and are intended to apply to all the population, or all HSC professionals or all service users, regardless of their health condition or social grouping. Implementation of the generic standards is not dealt with in this document as these standards will be monitored separ ately. Service Framework for Respiratory Health and Wellbe ing - Detailed Implementation Plan 7 | P a g e 3 IMPLEMENTATION STRUCTURE & PROCESS 3.1 IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS The development of a detailed implementation plan i s the DHSSPS requirement for the implementation process. The HSCB and PHA will adopt a phased approach to the implementation process over the three years of Fram ework (2015-2018).as outlined below: 1. Identify a lead professional to take forward the im plementation of the revised Respiratory Service Framework. 2. Establish a Respiratory Health and Wellbeing Servic e Framework Stakeholder Group, with the role of monitoring implementation progress . 3. Submit an implementation plan to the department by 18 th December 2015. 4. All standards for which there was already a data so urce in place to be fully implemented by March 2016. 5. By March 2016, for the remaining standards, appropr iate steps to be taken to establish data sources and baselines. Performance l evels for these standards to be determined once baselines had been established. 3.2 REGIONAL RESPIRATORY FORUM Implementation of the revised RSFW will be overseen by the Regional Respiratory Forum. This group will work jointly with the HSCB and the PHA, in relation to the development of strategies and plans to improve the respiratory hea lth of the population. The membership of the Regional Respiratory Forum and the terms of reference have both been revised to meet the need of the implementation of the revised Respiratory Framework (Appendix A): This group will: Act as champions and advocates for continuous respi ratory health and wellbeing service quality improvements. Consider all aspects of respiratory health and well being: ranging from primary prevention through secondary and tertiary care, to rehabilitation and end of life care. In conjunction with subgroup leads, identify commis sioning priorities and develop plans in relation to respiratory services and healt h improvement for the HSCB, PHA and other stakeholders. Develop and maintain close links and partnership wo rking with other parts of the HSC commissioning structure. Establish systems to routinely collect, collate, an alyse and report data to monitor implementation of the RSFW progress on performance targets. Continually review and monitor Respiratory Framewor k quality indicators to ensure compliance with emerging evidence based best practi ce. Via subgroup leads, engage with and represent views of all stakeholders including service users, carers, the public and voluntary org anisations. Facilitate collaborative working between the variou s subgroups in the RSFW. Service Framework for Respiratory Health and Wellbe ing - Detailed Implementation Plan 8 | P a g e Link into the HSCB / PHA Performance Management arr angements. The group will be chaired by Dr. Muhammad Sartaj (P HA) and will be multi-disciplinary and multi-agency, with representation from PHA, HSCB, H SC Trusts, General Practice, Queen's University Belfast, together with relevant Voluntar y Organisations, service users, patients, clients and careers. 3.3 SUB -GROUP LEADS The Subgroup Leads are fundamental in taking forwar d the work involved in implementing the RSFW, both via their links with clinical Networ ks and groups, and as members of the Regional Respiratory Forum. There are 13 subgroup leads within the Framework, each with oversight of their own section. Each Trust has a l ocal respiratory forum, which will have a key role at Trust level to ensure that plans are ma de to meet standards and performance indicators. Sub-Groups for the Respiratory Service Framework Subgroup Subgroup lead Role BHSCT Respir atory F orum R espiratory F orum Catriona respiratory, SHSCT WHSCT espiratory F orum Mary Respiratory F orum Linda Patton Assistant director, NHSCT SET Respiratory F orum Janet Sinnerton Respiratory Nurse specialist, NHSCT Paeds Asthma, Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network Prof. Mike Shields Paediatric Respiratory Consultant, BHSCT Spirometry subgroup Rose McHugh Nurse consultant, PHA Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Dr Martin Kelly Respiratory Consultant, BHSCT Cystic Fibrosis Dr Muhammad Sartaj Public Health consultant, PHA Medicines Management Deirdre Quinn Pharmaceutical Services lead, HSCB Regional Respiratory Commissioning Sophie Lusby Assistant director, Commissioning Informati on Dr Muhammad Sartaj Public Health consultant, PHA Adult and Paediatric Asthma (to be established) To be agreed * Other subgroups / task and finish groups will be established as and when required as part of the imp lementation process. Subgroup leads will work through existing and as ne cessary, bespoke structures: Implementation of the RSFW will be the responsibili ty of these structures, linking with HSC Service Framework for Respiratory Health and Wellbe ing - Detailed Implementation Plan 9 | P a g e staff in Primary and Secondary care, as appropriate . The overall reporting structures for implementation of the Framework are outlined in App endix B. 3.3.1 Sub-Group Lead Updates Each subgroup lead will provide an update report on all relevant KPIs annually to the Regional Respiratory Forum, with exception reportin g at other meetings as required. It is planned that this group will meet four times per ye ar. Subgroup lead updates to the Regional Respiratory F orum will incorporate the following, as appropriate: An overview of the current status of each standard and associated KPIs, Details of how KPIs are measured, any issues which have arisen and any proposed changes to KPIs, Details on target performance levels progress and timeframe for establishing any outstanding baseline performance levels, Progress against KPIs and in particular, details of any KPIs where target performance levels are not being met, Timeframes for reporting and processes to inform an d feedback to clinical groups, Overview of Personal and Public Involvement (PPI), including reflections on how effective PPI has been and any challenges encounter ed, Any other pertinent section-specific information. 3.4 CORE -SUPPORT The Director of Public Health is the nominated Lead Professional for implementation of the RSFW on behalf of PHA and HSCB. A Public Health Co nsultant, a HSCB Regional Respiratory Commissioning lead, a PHA nurse and AHP consultant and a Project Manager support the work of the subgroup leads and the Regional Respira tory Forum. 3.4.1 Information Officer An Information Officer from the Performance Managem ent Service Improvement (PMSI) Directorate, HSCB, has been identified to provide s upport. The Information Officer will liaise with subgroup leads and Trusts with regards to info rmation requirements and data sources. Whilst much of the information can be collected fro m existing data sources, in some instances new data sources must be established, and clinical audit may be required. Arrangements for data collection will be agreed and confirmed with subgroup leads and with Trusts, where appropriate, in advance of comme ncement of data collection. As with many other services, information is not ava ilable in a suitable format. Work is currently undertaken to allow information to be sta ndardized and collected from existing systems across the region and to establish new info rmation systems where needed. Further work will be undertaken to standardised cod ing for existing systems. The development and implementation of new information s ystems will be required to report on the new KPIs in the revised framework. As the devel opment of new information systems will require time and resources, it is therefore likely that dates for reporting on some KPIs may Service Framework for Respiratory Health and Wellbe ing - Detailed Implementation Plan 10 | P a g e need to be moved or reported through alternate data sources e.g. audits. The potential for any delay will be continually assessed and reported as required. Within PMSI, individual staff members have responsi bility for assimilating data for each section of the Framework. The Information Officer will play a key role in facilitating and co- ordinating data collection and analysis for the ove rall RSFW, and in providing returns for progress/annual reports. 4 REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS 4.1 MONITORING ARRANGEMENTS It is recognised that measuring health outcomes dir ectly related to the service framework is difficult in chronic respiratory diseases. These ca n relate to a wide range of interconnected processes, assessments and treatments. However, Tr usts will be asked to complete self- assessment proformas which will be used in conjunct ion with benchmarking information on service provision, standardized usage data and audi t to ensure that standards are being met. To facilitate monitoring of progress of implementat ion of the framework, a reporting template, colour-key template has been developed (s ee appendix C). This is completed at least annually and is supported by a service specif ication breakdown. 4.2 REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS Data collection will commence for some of the KPIs in 2016. A Reporting Schedule has been developed to monitor commencement of data collectio n and timeframes for reporting for each KPI (Appendix C). Because of the nature of som e of the data sources, data will not be available for reporting until three to four months following the end of each data collection timeframe. For example, for the period up to and in cluding March 2016, a report will be available in July 2016. A progress report will then follow for the period April 2016- September 2016, which will be available in January 2017. Progress reporting will continue on a six-monthly basis for the duration of the Fram ework. Standardised Reporting Templates will be used to en sure consistency across the sections for progress and annual reports (Appendix D). A standa rdised Colour Key System will be used to denote achievement/status (Appendix E). Completi on of these templates will be overseen by the Information Officer, as above. Completed re ports will be shared with Section Leads, before being forwarded to the Steering Group. Twice per year, the Regional Respiratory Forum will provide a progress report to the Senior Management Team of the HSCB and the Agency Manageme nt Team of the PHA for approval. An annual report will be submitted to the DHSSPS Se rvice Framework Programme Board. To allow clinicians to monitor performance against KPIs, subgroup leads will share section specific reports on progress with clinical groups / Networks. This regular feedback will allow action to be taken in a timely manner, to address a ny issues which may be impeding Service Framework for Respiratory Health and Wellbe ing - Detailed Implementation Plan 11 | P a g e performance, or which should be brought to the atte ntion of the Regional Respiratory Forum. 5 COMMISSIONING It is anticipated that the respiratory commissionin g lead, with the support of the nominated public health consultant and the project manager, w ill take forward all commissioning issues, channeling these through the relevant commissioning structures, i.e. Respiratory Commissioning Subgroup, Local Commissioning Groups, Specialist Services Commissioning Team, or any other relevant Commissioning Teams. The Regional Respiratory Forum will have the capaci ty to identify priorities and make recommendations to the relevant commissioning group . These arrangements will need to be reconsidered in light of the Minister's announcement on the outcome of the DHSSPS Review of Commissionin g and the Donaldson Report. 6 STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT Stakeholder involvement, particularly service users , carers and public involvement, was a key principle underpinning development of the revis ed RSFW, and will continue to be of key importance in its implementation. As has been acknowledged in the structures, impleme ntation of the Framework will require working closely in partnership with a number of est ablished projects, networks, groups and organisations. In addition, existing arrangements to secure PPI and to gather and reflect on patient, client and carer experience will be used t o support implementation of the Framework. Collaboration with these stakeholders, a nd others, will also be particularly important in addressing those performance indicator s relating to quality improvement in the relevant sections of the Framework and this wil l be facilitated by the subgroup leads. It is essential that HSC works in partnership with other government departments, both statutory and non-statutory to seek to influence an d improve health and social wellbeing. Accordingly, representatives from Asthma UK, NI Che st, Heart & Stroke and the British Lung Foundation are members of the Regional Respiratory Forum. The Framework covers many disease areas which may h ave linked risk factors but are very different in terms of patient or client experience. In addition, many of the established Networks and groups have existing service user invo lvement, or are developing PPI Processes. Considering the wide range of diseases covered by the Framework and the existing PPI / Service User systems, Service User i nvolvement will also be embedded at subgroup level with wider stakeholder events as req uired. Service Framework for Respiratory Health and Wellbe ing - Detailed Implementation Plan 12 | P a g e 7 RESOURCES AND FUNDING The experience to date indicates, while there have been many service improvements with the original Respiratory Service Framework, to achi eve full implementation and compliance with standards in the revised Respiratory Service F ramework will require additional funding. Any resource implications associated with RSFW impl ementation will be handled through normal commissioning processes with bids made for s ervice developments through the relevant commissioning team to the HSCB Senior Mana gement Team or the PHA Management Team as appropriate. They will be consid ered against available funds along with service development bids from other services. Key investments will be reflected, as appropriate, in the relevant annual Commissioning P lan. It is anticipated that some additional infrastructu re is required to support monitoring of RSFW implementation. That infrastructure will provi de and/or support collation of information from existing data sources, establishme nt and running of new data sources, data analysis and reporting. Some KPIs cannot be re ported through existing information systems and, subject to stakeholder views, may requ ire new clinical audits to be designed, tested, and then established across Northern Irelan d. The scale and nature of the resources required to support these audits will depend on the methodologies agreed through subgroup leads with stakeholders. Bids for funding to develop that infrastructure will be made through usual processes in due course. 8 PROGRESS TO DATE A public health consultant has been nominated as th e lead for the implementation of the Respiratory Service Framework. An Information Officer has been nominated and will be essential in co-ordinating data collection for all sections within the RSFW. HSCB have identified a regional commissioning lead, along with dedicated commissioning support for the respiratory framework implementation process. A series of meetings are being planned with subgrou p leads and the Information Officer to discuss the stakeholder engagement proce ss to define data sources, the methodology of data collection and reporting, antic ipated performance levels and timescales for data collection and reporting. In ce rtain instances, baseline performance levels and timeframes for clinical audi t or other bespoke data collection methods are yet to be determined. This w ill occur during on-going engagement with stakeholders, subgroup leads and th e Regional Respiratory Forum. Service Framework for Respiratory Health and Wellbe ing - Detailed Implementation Plan 13 | P a g e A standardised Reporting Schedule has been develope d, identifying the action associated with each KPI and the associated timefra me. Initiation of data collection and frequency of progress reports will also be capt ured in the Reporting Schedule. A standardised Colour Key System and standardised R eporting Templates have also been developed and will form the basis of all futur e progress reports, capturing data on progress against targets. The terms of reference for the Regional Respiratory Forum have been revised to reflect the needs of the RSFW. Commissioning issues in relation to wider respirato ry services have recently been discussed with relevant commissioning leads and sig nificant progress has been made. An information subgroup has been established to sup port the respiratory framework implementation process. Discussions have ben progressed with GAIN in relati on to the audit requirements of the respiratory framework. 9 KEY PRIORITIES FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS To complete a baseline assessment exercise to ident ify gaps in current services and information systems.

PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY BOARD PAPER Date of Meeting 17 December 2015 Title of Paper Personal and Public Involvement (PPI) Update Report Agenda Item 10 Reference PHA/04/12/15 Summary As part of our Governance & Reporting arrangements, an update Report on PPI is produced and tabled for the PHA Board to consider, on a twice yearly basis. Attached is the PPI Update Report for the period fr om June 2015 to November 2015. Also attached for consideration is a Research paper on PPI (Executive Summary), jointly commissioned by the PHA and PCC from a team led by Queens University and the Ulster University. In keeping with the previously agreed format, it is proposed that the Board will be updated on the formal report and also on this occas ion, research paper, by way of delivery of a short presentation. The focus of the presentation will be the PPI Training programme and the research findings. Equality Screening / Equality Impact Assessment N/A Audit Trail This update was approved by AMT on 8 December. Recommendation / Resolution For Noting Director's Signature Title Director of Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health Professions Date 9 December 2015 DRAFT Personal and Public Involvement (PPI) PHA Board Update December 2015 1 | P a g e Personal & Public Involvement (PPI) Personal and Public Involvement - What is it? PPI is the active and effective involvement of serv ices users, carers and the public in health and social care services. Involvement can range fr om one to one clinical or social care interactions with service users and carers, through to larger engagements to assess needs, partnership working to co-design services and influ ence commissioning priorities and policy development. The rationale for PPI - Why do it? People have a right to be involved in and consulted with on decisions that affect their health and social care. There is an increasing body of ev idence which demonstrates that meaningful Involvement also helps to: Effectively identify need Increases efficiency through tailoring services and setting agreed priorities Improve quality, safety and patient experience Reduce complaints and SAIs Encourage self-responsibility for health and social well being Statutory duty Under the HSC (Reform) Act (NI) 2009, PPI is a legi slative requirement. The PHA and other HSC organisations now have a Statutory Duty to Invo lve & Consult service users, carers and the public on: 1. The planning and provision of care; 2. The development and consideration of proposals f or change in the way that care is provided; 3. Decisions that affect the provision of care. 2 | P a g e The PHA's role In the 2012 PPI Policy Circular, the DHSSPS confirm ed and assigned to the PHA, responsibility for the leadership of the implementa tion of this key policy area across the HSC system. It requires the PHA to provide the DHSSPS with assurances that HSC bodies and in particular Trusts, meet their PPI Statutory and pol icy responsibilities. Additional responsibilities confirmed / assigned also included : Ensuring consistency and co-ordination in approach to PPI; The identification and sharing of best PPI practic e across HSC; Communication and awareness raising about PPI; Capacity building and training; Development of the Engage website; Monitoring of and reporting on PPI. PPI up-date The following table outlines areas of work undertak en and agreed future action required. The actions set out in this report have emerged from a variety of sources inclu ding: The legislative duty of Involvement, The PHA's leadership responsibilities as set out i n the last PPI Circular, The PPI Standards that the PHA led on and which we re launched in March 2015, The work plan of the Regional HSC PPI Forum and The internal PHA PPI Monitoring report, conducted earlier this year. 3 | P a g e Standard What have we achieved? What do we need to do? 1. Leadership PPI Standards The PHA led the development of a set of PPI Standar ds for HSC, which were co-designed with service users and carer s. The Standards set out what is expected of HSC organisat ions and staff in terms of PPI. They will help standardise PPI pr actice and support the drive towards a truly person centred service. The PHA has put a programme in place to raise awareness of the Standa rds, which has included the distribution of some 12,000 leaflets a cross HSC, promoting them through twitter, Facebook, Connect e tc. Advice and Guidance The PHA PPI Team provides professional leadership a dvice, guidance and support within the PHA and across the HSC system on PPI. In the last year, circa 50 such requests were received, which have involved input to significant HSC areas of work including Lifeline, Unscheduled Care, Podiatric Sur gery, Cancer, Community Pharmacy, Nursing for Older People, TYC C are Pathways etc. 1. The PHA should appoint a Non- Executive PPI Lead at Board level. 2. In line with the internal audit report findings the PHA should consider how it can resource the implementation of the PPI Strategy / Action Plan moving forward. 3. The PHA needs to ensure that there are clear, accessible and transparent arrangements for involvement across each Directorate and Division. 4 | P a g e Standard What have we achieved? What do we need to do? Leadership Structures / Arrangements At the Executive/Board level the PHA has a named ex ecutive Director who carries responsibility for PPI. An internal PPI Leads Forum was established to help embed Involvement into the culture and practice of the or ganisation. Each Division of the PHA is represented by a named deleg ate and deputy at this Forum. Staffing The PHA invested in a second PPI band 7 post utilis ing Stakeholder Involvement funding allocated from the DHSSPS. Thi s was due in part to a recommendation from an internal audit rep ort on PPI. It was also because of the expansion in demand for lea dership, advice and guidance on Involvement within the PHA and acro ss the HSC system as awareness and understanding of our respon sibilities in respect of the Statutory Duty of Involvement increa se. Regional HSC PPI Forum The PHA in its strategic leadership role, continues to Chair and 5 | P a g e Standard What have we achieved? What do we need to do? facilitate the work of the Regional HSC PPI Forum. The Forum recently established a strategic tier to give overs ight and direction to PPI in HSC, involving the Directors / Assistant Dir ectors with PPI responsibility from all HSC organisations. The Forum itself comprises representatives from all HSC organisations and of service users, carers and advo cates. The Forum is the primary vehicle through which the PHA exercises its leadership function in PPI. It does this through: The sharing of Best Practice. Joint working on areas of common interest through established sub groups. Active participation of and partnership with servi ce users and carers. 2. Governance Strategies and plans The Corporate Plan has committed to PPI as a key ap proach to how the PHA does its business and this is reflected in our Annual Business Plan. The PHA's PPI Strategy, \"Valuing People, Valuing Pa rticipation\" 1. The PHA needs to ensure through its commissioning/planning arrangements and investments, that PPI is an active consideration in the decision making process. 6 | P a g e Standard What have we achieved? What do we need to do? guides and directs the work of the organisation and its staff to embed PPI. An annual Action Plan is also developed for the Reg ional Forum and this alongside the PPI Strategy, covers all the str ategic roles and responsibilities that the PHA carries in this area across HSC. Specific PPI Action Plans have been developed by so me PHA Divisions including, Research & Development, the Sa fety Forum and Health Protection. Other work areas, AHPs for examp le, have PPI actions built in as an integral element of their st rategy/work plan. Reporting A range of corporate governance reporting is undert aken against the PPI Strategy and Action Plan including quarterly Di rectorate Update Reports, bi-annual Board & Departmental update repo rts. An external facing Annual PPI Report is submitted t o the DHSSPS reflecting on the work undertaken to progress PPI a cross the HSC on a partnership basis. 2. The PHA needs to update its PPI Strategy/ Action Plan for the period up to 2018. This should be undertaken in partnership with internal PPI Leads, service users, carers, voluntary / advocacy organisations and the public. 3. The PHA needs to review and update its Consultation Scheme, to provide clarity to staff and the public alike, (a requirement under the legislation on PPI) and ensure that it is meaningful and effective. 7 | P a g e Standard What have we achieved? What do we need to do? Inclusion as part of business processes PPI is now an integral element of business cases, p rocurement / tendering processes and contract monitoring arrange ments. 3. Opportuniti es and support for involvement Established variety of opportunities for involvement There are a range of opportunities and ways in whic h service users, carers, voluntary / advocacy organisations and the public can become involved with the work of the PHA, helping t o inform, shape and develop plans and priorities. Employed diversity in Involvement methodologies Each Division has evidenced the involvement of serv ice users, carers, voluntary sector partners and the public, u sing a variety of approaches including: Use of Social media such as Facebook and Twitter One off responses to surveys / questionnaires Public consultations Attendance at and contributions to Public meetings Attendance at and contribution to Workshops & Focu s Groups 1. The PHA should develop a central register of opportunities for involvement which is updated across all Divisions (where appropriate) and readily accessible by the public. 2. The PHA needs to consider the development of a PR / Marketing campaign, utilising social media etc. to evidence that the PHA is a listening organisation which effectively encourages involvement, debate and discussion and which brings the commitment to Involvement to the fore. 3. The PHA should finalise its set of guidance materials on essential support 8 | P a g e Standard What have we achieved? What do we need to do? Development of case studies Membership of task & finish groups Membership of Steering Groups Reference Groups Support materials The PHA has developed support materials to facilita te the involvement of service users/carers including: Use of the Out of Pocket Re-imbursement Guide for Service Users & Carers. Practical Guides to different aspects of involveme nt. Research The PPI team working with Research & Development co lleagues and the Patient Client Council commissioned a team led by Queen's University and Ulster University to examine various aspects of involvement including how it currently operates, ho w to assess progress and the barriers to involvement including looking at ways in which these might be addressed. The report has bee n completed that should be made available for the involvement of service users and carers. 4. Feedback must be embedded as standard practice at all levels across the organisation and compliance with this, needs to be monitored. 5. The findings from the Research Report need to be disseminated and utilised to ensure further progress is made in the field of involvement in the HSC system. 9 | P a g e Standard What have we achieved? What do we need to do? and the latest draft accompanies this report. 4. Knowledge and Skills Awareness raising training The PHA has led the development of a generic region al PPI training programme for HSC. This has been co-designed with s ervice users/carers alongside HSC partners and will be for mally launched in February 2016. The programme includes: Taught modules PPI Coaching PPI Team Briefing PPI e-learning programme 100+ staff across HSC participated in piloting a nu mber of aspects of the programme during its development. PHA staff continue to deliver awareness raising and training sessions on PPI across the HSC. Examples of formal tailored PPI training sessions undertaken in the last reporting period include: MSc in Public Health QUB MSc Social Sciences, QUB To inform and equip staff with the understanding, knowledge and skills to effectively involve and engage with service users, carers and the public, it is recommended that the PHA takes steps to: Internal 1. Build PPI into all future Job Descriptions and any review of existing Job Descriptions. 2. Ensure PPI is a part of individual job induction processes 3. Ensure PPI is factored into staff development plans and appraisals. External 1. Guide and support the roll out of the 10 | P a g e Standard What have we achieved? What do we need to do? Involving People, HSCB BSc in Pharmacy, UU PPI training programme across the HSC system. 2. Deliver the proposed 'Engage' website (within NI Direct / Knowledge Exchange) as a one stop resource for Involvement. 3. Measuring Outcomes Monitoring arrangements The PHA working with service users, carers and HSC partners, designed and implemented the regionally agreed and Department endorsed PPI Monitoring process and arrangements wi thin HSC. Monitoring was undertaken with five HSC Trusts, the RQIA and internally within the PHA with the findings and cor responding recommendations set out against the five PPI Standa rds. PHA reports were shared with the DHSSPS as part of agreed arrangements for accountability and are now on our website. Internal 1. There is a need to devise and operationalise effective and efficient mechanisms to record and capture evidence of PPI in practice at Divisional level across the PHA on an on-going basis. 2. Senior Management need to ensure that PPI (where appropriate) has been factored into plans, proposals etc which are presented for consideration. 11 | P a g e Standard What have we achieved?

This is about how ser vice users, carers and patients engage with staff, management and directors of statutory h ealth and social care organisations. Most statutory health and social care organisations must , under legislation, meet the requirements of PPI. PPI has been part of health and social care policy in Northern Ireland since 2007 and became law two years later with the introduction of the Health and Social Care Reform Act (2009). It is, therefore, timely that PPI is now as sessed in this systematic way in order to both examine the aspects which are working well and to highlight those areas where improvements need to be made. As far as possible, t his Summary Report is written in an accessible way, avoiding jargon and explaining key research terms, so as to ensure it is widely understood. This is in keeping with establis hed good practice in service user involvement research. This summary, therefore, give s a picture of PPI in Northern Ireland currently. There is also a fuller report which give s a lot more details about the research and findings. Information on this is available from the Public Health Agency and/or the Patient Client Council. Background The Public Health Agency (PHA) promotes and aims to improve health and wellbeing and has a lead responsibility for PPI. The PHA is also responsible for health protection and provides professional input to the commissioning pr ocess (how funding is used to provide services). The Patient Client Council is often seen as the voice of the service user, carer and patient and, as a result, also has a very keen inte rest in PPI and related issues. Aims and Objectives The research commissioners (the Public Health Agenc y and the Patient Client Council) stipulated the following key aims and objectives fo r this study: 1. To identify best practice in PPI 2. To identify any barriers to effective involvemen t 3. To identify possible ways to overcome these barr iers within the context of an integrated health and social care system 4. To identify valid and reliable ways of measuring and evaluating the impact of PPI activity. 4 5. To ensure that service users and carers are at t he heart of this project in a significant and meaningful way. Methodology (How we did the Research) A group made up of academic staff from Queens Unive rsity and Ulster University, Health Trust staff who have a particular interest in PPI a nd a number of service users and carers came together to carry out this research. This has been seen as an unusual approach to research involving people from different background s, but it was hoped that this would lead to better engagement and involvement, using a wide range of skills and not just pure academic tools. Central to all of this work was a strong service us er and carer spirit, with service users and carers at the heart of all this work. It was agreed initially that the research would involve four key stages: Literature Review (using a Rapid Eviden ce Assessment (REA) approach) 1, On- line Survey, Focus Groups and, if required, follow- up telephone interviews. As sufficient information was gathered from the first three stage s, the research team decided not to have the fourth stage. 2 In addressing the previously stated research object ives, the team applied a mixed methods approach (different ways of gathering research info rmation) using both quantitative (information expressed through statistics) and qualitative (information expressed as thoughts, opinions and ideas) methods to gather data (information) from key participants across Northern Ireland's health and social care se ctor alongside service users and carers. The specific stages of the Methodology are as follo ws: 1. Stage one - Rapid Evidence Assessment As the first stage of the project, the research tea m conducted a Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) to search the international, national, region al and local literature on the following four key aspects of this project: Best practice in PPI internationally, nationally and in NI Barriers to effective involvement Possible ways to overcome these barriers 1 The literature review for the fuller report was un dertaken using an approach described as a Rapid Evi dence Assessment (REA). This process uses technical terms which must be used in the report to demonstrate th e rigour with which this part of the research was und ertaken. 2 The research team decided not to conduct telephon e interviews as sufficient depth was provided in th e focus groups and on-line survey 5 Valid and reliable ways of measuring and evaluati ng the impact of PPI activity Rapid Evidence Assessments (REAs) provide an establ ished methodology for using systematic review methods (structured ways of finding out what is already wr itten on a topic) to identify and critically analyse the available li terature and research evidence on legal, policy and practice issues. They are a rigorous, op en and effective means of evaluating what is known and facilitating consideration of future d evelopments and are particularly suited to projects which have a limited timescale such as in this instance. 2. Stage two - On-line Survey with Service Provider s Information on PPI activities and the impact of the se was collected through an on-line questionnaire administered to statutory/public sect or, third sector (organisations that are neither public sector nor private sector such as vo luntary and community based) and private organisations (see Appendix Item 3 in Main Report). The on-line questionnaire was pilo ted (tested out) in one Health and Social Care Trust ar ea and the sample (those who would be taking part) for this stage of the study was guided by advice from the Personal and Public Involvement lead staff in each of the Health and So cial Care Trusts. In total, one hundred and thirty eight ( n3=138 ) respondents completed the on-line survey. 3. Stage three - Focus groups (number = 10) The research team conducted ten focus groups across Northern Ireland aimed at establishing current experiences in PPI from the he alth and social care service user/carer and service provider perspectives in each of the fi ve Health and Social Care Trust areas. Two focus groups were therefore conducted in each T rust area, incorporating these 'user' and 'provider' perspectives on PPI in separate focu s groups. Each focus group took place in areas and community settings which we felt were geo graphically central and accessible to as many people as possible. The focus group questio ns were designed to reflect the research Objectives and were also shaped by the fin dings from both the literature review and on-line survey. Purposive sampling 4 was used to ensure that the focus group in each Trust area contained representation from service pr oviders across statutory, private, third sectors and service users with experience of PPI in health and social care contexts. We also developed a Screening Tool to assist us in ensuring we had as broad a cross-section of the service user perspective as possible. Trust lead st aff had a key role in publicising the 3 n = number 4 Purposive sampling is where the decisions about wh o is to be involved in the focus groups is taken by the researcher because of the person's experience or kn owledge in a particular area to do with the researc h 6 research through Trust and other relevant networks. In total eighty nine ( n = 89 ) people participated in the focus groups (36 staff and 53 s ervice users). 4. Stage four- follow-up telephone interviews If the focus groups identified specific issues that were not explored in sufficient depth in the group, we agreed that these issues would be further investigated through follow-up interviews, with permission from the individual foc us group participants who identified the issue. It was however not necessary to conduct any interviews such was the depth and quality of data the team was able to obtain through the focus groups. Project Management A Research Advisory Group was established to advise the research team on key aspects of the project. This was made up of staff representati ves from across Trusts, Service User and Carer Organisations and individual service users/ca rers with research interests and experience in PPI. Membership of this Advisory Grou p was informed by key contacts recommended by and already known to members of the Research Team. This Group met on two occasions over the six month duration of the re search and was updated appropriately at key stages of the research process. Ethical Review This research was ethically reviewed by the followi ng organisations: 1. The School of Sociology, Social Policy and Socia l Work Research Ethics Committee, Queen's University. 2. The Office of Research Ethics Committee, Norther n Ireland. 3. The Research Governance Committees in Northern I reland's five Health and Social Care (HSC) Trusts. The research project was also registered in the Que en's University Human Subjects Research Database. 7 Meeting the Research Objectives As mentioned already, the research was based around five Objectives. Each of these objectives is now summarised with reference to the main findings from this research. Objective 1: To identify best practice in PPI The focus groups for service users and staff includ ed a specific question aimed at highlighting examples of positive practice and inde ed best practice in regard to PPI in Northern Ireland. This was also addressed in the on -line survey. Importantly, the range of responses to this particular question leads the res earch team to conclude that there is much to be proud of in regard to what has been achieved to date in Northern Ireland. The picture is therefore quite encouraging with a host of examples provided which evidence meaningful change and impact across a range of service user an d carer groups. This report also has a section dedicated to highlighting examples of best practice in PPI from across Northern Ireland's HSC Trusts. From the perspective of servi ce users and carers, what contributed to positive PPI were factors such as: Information, sta ff attitudes, training and preparation, good communication skills, getting feedback, a sense of trust, enthusiasm and genuineness on the part of staff, being listened to and attention to detail in regard to practicalities. From the perspective of staff, the things that were importan t in achieving good PPI were: Being skilled, having the right attitude, having a commitment to P PI 'from the top', the values of the organisation and having resources in place, (partic ularly around administration, practical support and training). The following is one example of good practice in PP I from our research. Resettlement from Learning Disability Hospitals in Northern Ireland: Ensuring Betterment, Parity and Learning Following a decision by the Department of Health, S ocial Services and Public Safety to resettle all long-stay patients from the three lear ning disability hospitals in Northern Ireland to accommodation offering a better life for the patien t, the Trusts involved in partnership with the Health and Social Care Board and Disability Act ion developed a \"Betterment Document\" to ensure that a person-centred approach was used t hroughout the process, there was accessible and appropriate information available, d iscussions were informal and that sufficient time was provided for people to consider their options and articulate their views. Resettlement was to offer \"betterment\" for the pati ent by being clinically appropriate, meeting the patient's needs, and offering the potential to better the life of the patient. A range of engagement methods were used depending on the needs or preference of the individuals 8 involved. The nature of the engagement often devel oped from an individual's or family's desire for privacy around what they identified as v ery sensitiveand emotional issues. While this required a great deal of 1-1 work it allowed f or individualised information to be imparted in a safe, non-judgemental environment. As a resul t of this transparent and inclusive, person-centered process Resettlement was completed ahead of schedule and almost 2 years on everyone remains in placement. An evaluation of the project from an Independent Ad vocacy perspective concluded that the Betterment Documentation: helped prioritise individ ual and family views and increased ownership of services, increased levels of accounta bility, helped to reduce the perceived power imbalance between the service user / families and 'the bosses', helped to reduce complaints and deal more effectively with concerns at a local level and in a way that empowers rather than dis-empowers the service user and keeps the clear human rights of the individual to the forefront. Objective 2: To identify any barriers to effective involvement The on-line survey, focus groups and literature rev iew specifically addressed the question of barriers in the context of the types of things whic h could prevent PPI from being effective and meaningful. The findings from the staff on-line survey clearly indicate that inadequate funding is one of the most significant barriers to PPI. Not having sufficient resources was evident in staff not having enough time to give to PPI work as well as not having sufficient staff in place to also do this type of work. Furthe r barriers noted related to staff not feeling knowledgeable and skilled in PPI work. The latter p oint also links with the finding that only half of the staff surveyed knew who was responsible for PPI in their organisations and that half of those surveyed regarded PPI as part of ever yday work. There was also a perception that PPI was not the responsibility of senior manag ers. Training on PPI was identified as being patchy and uneven, but it was recognised that attempts were being made to address this by the PHA. Service users and carers in the focus groups observ ed ongoing problems with the language of PPI, staff not giving sufficient attention to th e practicalities that go along with PPI, staff having poor communication skills, the absence of re spect and empathy, instances of tokenistic involvement, procedural barriers in gett ing expenses paid and not being told about the impact of their involvement. Staff in their foc us groups noted barriers such as: The working culture not being committed to PPI, staff n ot realising they were doing PPI work, not enough support from senior staff, the fact that goo d PPI takes time but without sufficient resource is very challenging, geographical unevenne ss in terms of PPI leading to a perception that some Trusts were better supported t han others and the need for staff to be 9 skilled in person centred working. These barriers a re also consistent with the findings from the literature review. Objective 3: To identify possible ways to overcome these barriers within the context of an integrated health and social care system The following are key points identified from the re view of the literature in addressing barriers that can prevent effective PPI: The need for training for everybody involved The need to have a commitment to achieving change on the part of those seeking involvement and for the public The need to recognise and promote diversity so as to involve a breadth of people's lived experiences The importance of relationship building skills The need for careful planning of involvement activ ities and to see these as integral to care planning and service development The need to have an ethic of care approach governing involvement which openly recognises power differences and the various roles and responsibilities of all parties involved in PPI work The need to have a staff member employed to have l ead responsibility for involvement work and a dedicated team to provide pr actical support and develop resources to embed PPI as a way of working across t he organisation, and finally, The need to provide feedback and evidence of impac t following involvement. The on-line survey highlighted the importance of PP I work needing to be better funded to deal with the feeling that staff expressed about be ing overburdened. The importance of training was also recognised as having a key contri bution to make in ensuring that barriers to effective PPI can be minimised. Findings from the s taff focus groups also echoed these sentiments, especially around the need to have PPI better resourced given this was a statutory duty, as distinct from Patient Client Exp erience, and also the need for improved training with a focus on skills. The resource issue was also related to needing to have service user and carer time remunerated for involve ment work and the need to have staff time recognised as an important part of resource th at good PPI demanded. Staff also expressed the view that PPI needed to be better sup ported and championed at senior management level in organisations. 10 The service user focus groups also made the followi ng types of suggestions in regard to overcoming these types of barriers: The need to recognise and respect the service user and carer experience The need to make the language of PPI more accessib le The need to be involved at a level that is chosen by the service user/carer (the on- line survey noted limited examples of involvement a t strategic level) Being made aware that a difference has been made Staff needing to be consistent in showing respect and having a positive attitude, attending to the practicalities of Involvement The need for service users to be offered training The need to avoid tokenism in PPI work. Objective 4: To Identify valid and reliable ways of measuring and evaluating the impact of PPI activity. The literature review includes examples of ways in which the impact of PPI activity has been measured and evaluated. One of the important findin gs in the literature is that the impact of PPI is under researched. It is also noted that ther e is a need to measure and evaluate PPI across the broad spectrum of health and social care . The literature does refer to more examples of where PPI has been evaluated in regard to its impact on research, but less so in the domain of health and social care. The challe nges in this area are also recognised, particularly in regard to introducing more quantita tive based approaches where statistical evidence can be used to evaluate impact. Whilst the literature recognises that this type of approach is complex, it is also noted that there ha s tended to be an overreliance on using descriptive and retrospective accounts of involveme nt which are more qualitative based. The literature review concludes with a very relevant ar ticle for this project in reference to the work of Staniszewska et al. (2011a). 5 These authors argue in favour of thinking towards measurement approaches to involvement being co-desi gned with service users which can build on the more established methods of doing so u sing qualitative methods such as focus groups. The on-line survey also included questions to addre ss this objective. Highlighting the scale of the challenge in developing evaluation methods, only 17% of respondents (n=7) said their organisation always evaluated PPI activity with a f urther 41% (n=22) stating evaluation is 5 Staniszewska, S., Adebajo, A., Barber, R., Beresfo rd, P., Brady, L., Brett, J., et al. (2011a). Devel oping the evidence base of patient and public involvement in health and social care research: The case for measu ring impact. International Journal of Consumer Studies , 35(6), 628-632. 11 undertaken sometimes. Thirty-seven per cent of par ticipants were unsure if evaluation was undertaken and 6% (n=3) of respondents said PPI act ivities are not evaluated. Reported methods for collecting PPI evaluation data were wid e and varied with the most common being surveys of PPI participants. Focus groups wer e the next most frequently used evaluation method. A wide range of organisational o utcomes and impacts from PPI activities are included in evaluations with the most commonly cited being the effect of PPI involvement on services (56%) and the least common being a chan ge in the budget allocation process (4%). Evaluation of PPI activity is therefore an area for further development given the on-line survey's conclusion that thirty nine per cent of re spondents noted the production of an evaluation report and twenty-nine per cent stating that no such report is produced. The cited perceived reasons for not producing an evaluation r eport related to a lack of resources particularly in regard to: lack of staff time (52%) , lack of staffing resources (45%) and lack of funding (34%). The focus groups also included specific questions i n this area. From the perspective of staff, it was recognised that progress in the right direct ion was starting in regard to monitoring and evaluating PPI with the initiatives led on by the P ublic Health Agency. There were also examples of how methods such as Survey Monkey were being used to evaluate particular projects. What was absent however was a sense of co nsistency and coherency in regard to how monitoring and evaluating were being approached . Staff also expressed the view that senior managers needed to accept and own responsibility for PPI, including accountability for monitoring it s effectiveness and overall implementation. The need for service users and carers to be made aw are of the outcomes and impact of their involvement activities was also recognised as being central to monitoring and evaluation processes. The point was also made that sometimes i t was only the highly publicised PPI projects which were monitored and evaluated to the exclusion of other on-going 'part of the job' PPI activity. Having one overall action plan w as also recognised by staff as being potentially helpful as a tool in coordinating the m onitoring and evaluation of PPI at Trust level. The staff focus group analysis concluded wit h the view that monitoring and evaluation needed to be systematically captured. From the service user and carer perspective, the fo cus groups underscored the importance of PPI being evaluated so as impact following servi ce user involvement in PPI work could be evidenced. Generally, the service users and carers in these focus groups evidenced limited awareness of evaluation and monitoring of PPI. Howe ver, there were some examples of 12 where it had gone well and also room for improvemen t as evaluation and monitoring was considered to be ad hoc. Some PPI members pushed ha rd to get effective evaluation and monitoring in place. In concluding this objective it is also worth highl ighting the impact of an existing challenging and demanding environment within which PPI occurs. In the development and refinement of monitoring and evaluation tools, these would need c learly defined parameters and agreed priorities for recording, monitoring and evaluation . As noted in one of the service user focus groups, this does not have to be overly complex but having a standard template across Health and Social Care (HSC) or standard columns to add to mainstream action plans and progress reports would ensure the process is not ti me consuming for recording, collection and analysis. Objective 5: To ensure that service users and carers are at the heart of this project i n a significant and meaningful way. The research team was committed to collaboration an d participation in regard to all aspects of design. The team involved two peer researchers f rom a service user background who have been fully involved in all aspects of the rese arch from writing the original application for funding to contributing to this final report. In ad dition, the research was supported by a Research Advisory Group (RAG) with representation f rom a diverse range of service user and carer groups and individuals from across Northe rn Ireland. All of the research tools (on- line survey questions and focus group questions) we re designed in close collaboration with the full research team and the members of the RAG. An accessible version of the research report has also been written by a research team mem ber from a user background. Service user organisations in the community also helped acc ommodate the focus groups and assisted with the design and dissemination of the f ocus group flyers for service users. 13 Recommendations Below are the ten key recommendations coming from t his research. Each of the three methods of enquiry that we have used has been given a symbol and these are explained below. Many of the recommendations came from more t han one of the methods used. Also we have highlighted what we feel is the key agency, or agencies that could address each recommendation. Key to Methods of Enquiry Focus Groups Focus Groups are symbolized by: On Line Survey On Line Survey is symbolized by: Literature Review Literature Review is symbolized by: Research Recommendations The Recommendations below are based collectively on the findings from the different but interlocking strands of our research: Focus groups, on-line survey and the systematic overview of the literature. Delivery responsibility for each recommendation has implications at a number of levels across HSC. The Department of Health Social Services and Public Safety (through its Safety, Quality and Standards Directorate) has responsibility for polic y on PPI, including reviewing, developing and refining the policy. It is responsible for rev iewing and issuing appropriate guidance as necessary, and for setting regional priorities and standards in this area. The Department is also be responsible for providing assurance to the Minister that HSC organisations are meeting the requirements placed upon them by the st atutory duty of involvement as laid down in the Health and Social Care Reform Act (2009 ), including the requirement to develop consultation schemes. The Public Health Agency (PHA) has responsibility f or leading the implementation of policy on PPI across the HSC. This responsibility is take n forward through the Regional PPI Forum, which is chaired and serviced by the PHA. It includes representation from all HSC 14 organisations as well as community and voluntary se ctor representatives, service users and carers. The Forum is a key vehicle by which the PH A, working with other organisations, ensures the effective implementation of PPI policy across the HSC. The Patient Client Council (PCC) responsibilities i n respect of PPI, include representing the public interest, promoting/supporting the involveme nt of the public, and undertaking research into best methods/practices for involving and consu lting the public in regard to HSC matters. HSC Trusts are responsible for establishing appropr iate organisational governance arrangements to meet their statutory duty of involv ement, and for maintaining and building on progress already made in relation to embedding i n line with the requirements contained in the 2007 PPI guidance circular 6. If the HSC can begin to address these recommendatio ns, this will go a long way to overcome the identified barriers to involvement and help the HSC, move forward to fully realise the benefits to embed PPI into its culture and practice at all levels bringing a wide range of benefits. 6 Department of Health, Social Services and Public S afety. (2007). Guidance on strengthening personal and public involvement in health and social care . Belfast: DHSSPS. 15 Recommendation 1 . For the development of effective PPI, adequate and dedicated resources are essential . Context : This recommendation is even more pertinent in times of austerity when there are increasing demands on existing resources. It is cri tical to properly fund PPI with structured and ring-fenced funding. Time, as well as finance, is an important resource and this is as relevant to staff and their time as to service user s and carers. Paying service users and carers for their time in structured involvement wit h the HSC should also be considered. Implementation Guidance : This recommendation is directed at the DHSSPS. Ou r research clearly shows that the delivery of PPI activity at ground level is in need of additional resources to fully realise the benefits of involvem ent to deliver effective person centred care. The availability of ring-fenced funding for each Tr ust will therefore build on the positive achievements that have been possible to date and as sist in overcoming the barriers identified through the research. Recommendation 2 . There should be an ongoing process of raising aware ness of what PPI is and what it means for staff, service users and carers. Context : This recommendation will help promote the wider b enefits of PPI for the organisations and staff and will also help to embed PPI in the culture of HSC organisations. Innovative ways should be explored of making such a wareness more meaningful and effective. Raising the profile of PPI should also a ddress the need to get a better balance of professionals and service users/carers at meetings, particularly seldom heard groups and individuals in addition to service user and carer i nvolvement in the development and implementation of individual care and treatment pla ns. Implementation Guidance : The PHA, working closely with the Trusts, should mo re proactively showcase examples of PPI which have bee n beneficial to key aspects of the service and also to the service users, carers and o ther stakeholders with whom effective engagement has taken place. The PCC also has a spec ific role in raising awareness of PPI with service users, carers and the public and provi ding wraparound support and training to encourage and enable service users, carers and the public to become meaningfully and effectively involved at all levels of PPI across HS C organisations. 16 Recommendation 3 . PPI needs to be defined in a way that is explicit a nd meaningful to service users, carers, providers and the wider public. Context : The language of PPI needs to be re-visited so it is distinct from other terms in current usage which may be confusingly similar to b oth staff and service users. If there is a way of coming up with a different term to PPI, then this should be explored (the term PPI is part of DHSSPS policy language but is not used in t he legislation). Other terms such as: citizen involvement/user/client involvement could b e considered. Implementation Guidance : Consideration should therefore be given to replac ing this term or explaining this better so as everybody involved is clear on meaning. This is the responsibility of the DHSSPS, the PHA and the PCC t o coordinate and for Trusts and other HSC organisations to implement. Recommendation 4 . Each Trust should develop a PPI Champion staff role with a small team whose jobs will be entirely and specifically related to PPI at Trust level. Context: Currently all Trusts have Director and operational PPI Leads, however none of these staff focus exclusively on PPI. As awareness of PPI is raised and staff understand their obligations and those of the Trust, there is an increasing demand for practical support which is both time consuming and resource intensive . In addition to this support, there is also a Departmental requirement to collate, analyse and report on the impact of PPI activity. For PPI to have a common purpose and the capacity t o meet support and reporting needs will, therefore, require the designation of PPI Cha mpions with a small team whose jobs will be entirely and specifically related to PPI at Trus t level. Implementation Guidance: This recommendation is for the DHSSPS to consider a llocating additional resources to enable relevant HSC organis ations to have a designated PPI Champion supported by full time dedicated professio nal PPI staff with knowledge, expertise and skills to enable the organisation to deliver on its statutory duty in regards to involvement. HSC Trusts will have responsibility to implement an d PHA should monitor this. 17 Recommendation 5. Social Media and Technology should be effectively u tilized to promote PPI across HSC. This should include a one-stop website for in formation, guidance, support, resources, templates and good practice examples. Context : In considering the impact of this recommendation, each Trust should review and monitor how currently their websites are promoting examples of PPI activity. The use of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter should continue to be maximised to further embed and raise awareness of PPI activity. The development of a mobile application on PPI could also be considered as part of this. Th ere is also a need for a one-stop-shop website where all PPI information (links to local P PI leads, etc.) could be housed. This needs to be resourced so that the information remains cur rent and relevant. Implementation Guidance : The PHA should lead on this recommendation in partn ership with the HSC Trusts and the PCC. Recommendation 6. Structured evaluation must be built into PPI as a w ay to measure its effectiveness . Context : The review of literature for this research indica ted there is a gap in evaluation using quantitative approaches. Person-centered eval uation methods should be piloted, which become part of the job and non-onerous on sta ff time. In regard to the measurement of PPI impact, standardised quantitative measures s hould also be piloted with service users to evaluate their experiences of involvement and en gagement following the service (for example, exit surveys, questionnaires, use of techn ology, etc.). Implementation Guidance: Lead responsibility for progressing this recommenda tion rests with the PHA. Recommendation 7. Feedback on the impact of involvement should be standard practice. Context : Providing feedback in regard to the outcomes of i nvolvement was quite sporadic and inconsistent in our research findings. This mus t be mainstreamed into all PPI practice as standard activity so as participants feel they are valued and are made aware of the impact of their PPI activities. Implementation Guidance: The PHA should develop guidance on this. 18 Recommendation 8 . Appropriate and dedicated PPI training should be ma de available for HSC staff. Context : PPI awareness training should be a standard aspect of induction for all new employees. This could be made available as an on-li ne activity but all staff would have to show that they had completed this as a necessary fe ature of their introduction to the HSC organisation or for existing staff as part of their PDP (Personal Development Plan). All staff should then have to complete appropriate PPI traini ng at a designated point in the early stages of their employment and refresher courses sh ould also be made available and mandatory. Implementation Guidance: The PHA should have lead responsibility for develop ing a consistent PPI training programme resourced by DHSS PS. HSC organisations have also individual responsibility for ensuring that staff u ndertake relevant PPI training. The PCC also has a specific role in raising awareness of PPI wit h service users, carers and the public and providing wraparound support and training to enable service users, carers and the public to become meaningfully and effectively involved at all levels of PPI across HSC organisations. Recommendation 9. PPI should be a core feature of all Trust recruitme nt and performance/appraisal processes. Context : This recommendation is aimed at embedding PPI int o the mindset of those applying for HSC Trust positions and at also ensuri ng that this is kept very much to the forefront for staff at all levels in their ongoing work. Therefore, questions about reviewing PPI activity in appraisal and supervision meetings woul d concretely elevate its importance for staff at all levels. Having a basic range of questi ons around involvement, engagement and partnership working at interviews and having the pe rspective of service users and carers in staff selection would also be a firm way of assessi ng prospective employees' understanding of issues related to involvement. Implementation Guidance : The PHA should lead on developing guidance on this matter. Trusts and other HSC organisations should implement this guidance. 19 Recommendation 10. PPI needs to be built into accountability structure s and decision making processes at senior manager/director level. Context : Our research consistently highlighted the importa nce of PPI being hinged on support from the top of the organisation. When this is in place, the likelihood of having meaningful PPI is increased. Senior managers shoul d therefore be reporting to Trust Board level in regard to PPI oversight issues at a strate gic level. Implementation Guidance: The PHA should offer guidance to Trusts in regard t o the format of such reporting which will include monitoring PPI in decision making such as investment and service development plans. HSC organisations wi ll be responsible for implementation of this approach. 20 Implementing the Recommendations Recommendation Responsible Organisation Role/Action Recommendation 1 For the development of effective Personal and Public Involvement (PPI), adequate and dedicated resources are essential .

PHA HSC Trusts Guidance development Implementation 22 Conclusion Although PPI in Northern Ireland still faces a numb er of challenges, this research has evidenced that there has been a great deal of work undertaken and a marked improvement, particularly in coordination, over the years since its first introduction as policy in 2007. The leadership role of the Public Health Agency in prov iding a positive basis for PPI developments should therefore be recognised. The research recommendations are designed to build upon the progress that has been achieved and are focused on the leadership and impl ementation aspects of PPI and service development in this particular area. This research has found that progress has been slower than anyone would have liked but the picture is sti ll overall quite positive. Much of this has been achieved within existing resources and it is e vident that there is a passion from within Health and Social Care and from those who use the s ervices to further embed effective PPI and develop the structures and mechanisms required to do this and to monitor the impact. PPI in Northern Ireland is still, therefore, very m uch a developing process which can be improved upon further in light of the recommendatio ns from this research. To continue embedding PPI and making it a reality f or more service users and carers will, however, require strong leadership, coordination, p artnership working and resources. These elements will help ensure that PPI becomes more of an integral part of the way the Health and Social Care system does its business, not becau se it is a statutory requirement, but because it is the right thing to do in terms of tar geting services to need, increasing efficiency, improving quality, safety and cost effectiveness. T o build on the progress and achievements to date, and to recognise the efforts of everyone i nvolved, the DHSSPS should identify ring- fenced funding to support HSC organisations to furt her develop their PPI structures and enable them to employ a small dedicated team to pro vide support to staff so that they can incorporate PPI in their day-to-day work. This will contribute significantly to the development of PPI by positively impacting on the service user and carer experience and ensuring the continued delivery of high quality, safe and effect ive HSC services that meet the needs of the people who use them. The leadership provided b y the PHA remains essential in progressing PPI across the HSC system. There is also room for improvement in other key asp ects of PPI, such as ensuring the public is clear about its meaning as well as having a stru ctured way to evaluate the outcome and impact of PPI activity. The in-depth nature of this research project has provided the opportunity to explore meaningful ways in which PPI can become further improved, embedded and more part of the mainstream in Norther n Ireland. The Recommendations in this Report therefore present an opportunity to ass ist in a process of continuing improvement 23 in regard to PPI in order to achieve truly person-c entred services. Linked to this last point, it is therefore apt to conclude with the following quo te from a carer in one of the focus groups remarking on the profoundly positive impact PPI had on one service user's life: \".. It just changed his life and even his quality o f health and everything increased and he just feels people are listening. I suppose it is kind of ironic because he actually feels he has a voice in every "}
