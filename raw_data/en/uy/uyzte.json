These oils harness the powerful properties of some botanical herbs and spices. Some of these properties can work to kill bacteria, relax muscles, relieve pain, improve digestion, and cure nausea. Because they carry few side effects and little risk, essential oils are becoming popular home remedies for all sorts of medical conditions. Essential oils are not meant to be ingested and some can be toxic. Essential oils are meant to be infused into the air in an inhaler or mixed with a carrier oil and applied to the skin. If you experience frequent [nausea](/symptom/nausea) due to pregnancy, stomach irritation, [ vertigo](/health/vertigo), gastro-intestinal reflux, or other common conditions, essential oils might be a helpful treatment. Lavender essential oil is perhaps best known [for its relaxing properties](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ptr.1103/abstract) If your nausea is caused by anxiety or physical pain, [lavender's power](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ptr.1103/abstract) For nausea caused by pregnancy, a virus, or post-operative pain, you might want to try some of the other oils on this list. Ginger essential oil [has been studied](https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2010.0862) as a remedy for nausea and motion sickness. People swear by it, and the research agrees that it works. Ginger oil can be diffused into the air with an oil diffuser, rubbed onto pressure points at your forehead and wrists, or even rubbed directly on your stomach to improve nausea. [One clinical trial](https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2015.0328) revealed that this remedy is particularly effective for people that experience nausea while recovering from surgical anesthesia. Ginger is also generally considered safe for pregnant women experiencing nausea. Peppermint tea is often suggested as a remedy for nausea, but the essential oil can have the same soothing effect. Peppermint oil, some researchers believe, relaxes the gastric muscles and keeps them from cramping up or over-contracting. [One scientific review](https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2010.0862) concluded that inhaling peppermint oil when you feel nauseous will improve your symptoms and have you feeling better quickly. Though more research is needed into peppermint oil's effects on different kinds of nausea, try peppermint oil in a diffuser the next time you're feeling sick. Though not as well-known as a nausea treatment, peppermint's purer-bred relative [spearmint is also effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3953654/) Cardamom is a spice in the same family as ginger, with its own unique properties and scent. The essential oil of cardamom was used in a blend of other essential oils in a clinical trial for post-operative nausea. [The study found](https://doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0b013e31824a0b1c) cardamom to be a promising anti-nausea agent when mixed with other essential oils. To use cardamom in a mix, or try it on its own, put a few drops into an essential oil diffuser. The rich, spicy scent of the cardamom may also help you to relax, which could decrease nausea and anxiety due to illness. Fennel [is frequently used](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4137549/) Using essential oils for nausea is a generally low-risk home remedy. But there are some people that shouldn't use this treatment as a way to get rid of nausea. In very rare cases, over-exposure from the menthol contained in peppermint and spearmint can hurt your skin. A more commonly reported side effect is [dermatitis](/symptom/dermatitis) from [lavender oil](https://doi.org/10.3233/JRS-2012-0568). Use a gentle carrier oil, like jojoba oil or coconut oil, to mix with more potent oils before applying to your skin. This will help you avoid burning or irritating your skin's surface when you use essential oils topically. Three to five drops of essential oil in an ounce of carrier oil is the usual recipe. Never directly inhale the vapor from an oil diffuser or steam dispenser, as it can irritate your mucous membrane. If your nausea persists over 48 hours, or if you begin to show signs of dehydration, stop using essential oils and contact your health provider. This home remedy is meant to help mild nausea. It won't cure the source of your nausea if you have a bacterial or viral infection. And if you're pregnant or breastfeeding and looking for help with morning sickness, you should consult with your midwife or doctor before using alternative treatments. It's important to remember that essential oils are not a miracle cure. They are still being researched, and their limits as remedies aren't yet fully understood. Keeping that in mind, there's not much to lose by grabbing your favorite essential oil to treat your next bout of nausea. By taking a deep breath and calming your body, you might be able to ward off the nausea and keep it from becoming worse. The FDA does not monitor the use or manufacture of essential oils. To ensure a pure, safe product, research company quality before purchasing a specific brand. A certified aromatherapist can make recommendations. Keep an eye out for emergency symptoms regardless of whether you're feeling better, and never try to treat dehydration, severe headaches, or severe bleeding that come along with nausea yourself. Remember that your healthcare provider is the best person to ask about the causes and potential cures for any nausea that you experience. "}
