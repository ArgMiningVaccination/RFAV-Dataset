Shelly Wu - Licensed Chiropractor and Certified Acupuncturist - Over 20 years of experience in Acupuncture - Licensed in the state of Illinois - 3 years continuing education spent in Beijing, China - Proud member of the Asian American Acupuncture Association Dr. Shelly Wu started to practice Chiropractic and Acupuncture in the year 2000. Combining both Chiropractic and Traditional Chinese Medicine in her practice. Acupuncture is not the first choice for most people. Many of her patients come to see her when conventional treatments do not work, or when less effective conventional methods create more side effects. She grew up in a family of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Both of her parents are Acupuncturists. Dr. Wu's mother is a NCCAOM certified Herbalist. Growing up in China, she benefited a lot from Traditional Chinese Medicine. She has always had passion for Traditional Chinese Medicine. After getting her D.C. Degree from National College of Chiropractic, she went back to China to study Traditional Chinese Medicine. In her studies in China, she learned from many Acupuncture specialists and professionals in Traditional Chinese Medicine. She gained a lot of knowledge and learned many new techniques from her studies. During her 10 plus years' experience in treating patients with a variety of conditions, she established her own unique style of treatment systems. Combining Acupuncture and other Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques, she gives the patients a different and drugless concept of health. Many disease processes begin with the body's inability to adapt to its environments. Instead of looking for the cure in drugs or chemicals, she tries to locate an area or the body which was not functioning properly, and cure the problems from the source. She will assist you to get healthy, and stay healthy.

However, sometimes you may be required to remove certain articles of clothing so that the Acupuncturist has access to certain points. You will be properly draped so that only small portions of skin are exposed. You will be asked to show your tongue, have your pulse taken, and may have your abdomen palpated. Acupuncturists are interested in the state of your internal organs, and by utilizing these methods we can determine the best treatment for you. Just like reflexology on hands and feet, different areas of the tongue, radial pulses, and abdomen correspond to different organ systems of the body. Don't receive treatment on an empty stomach. You should eat within a few hours of treatment. Receiving treatment on an empty stomach can sometimes lead to light headedness. Expect to receive questions that appear to be unrelated to your condition. Acupuncturist will question you about various topics regarding your health and lifestyle. These things become patterns and help the Acupuncturist formulate the Chinese Medicine diagnosis and thus the treatment protocol. Acupuncture needles are much thinner than hypodermic needles you see in doctors offices. Acupuncturists don't reuse needles. The needles are sterile, one use and disposable. Hear from our patients on how Acupuncture helped them. \"I was NOT ok with my 12 year old child starting birth control to help with menstrual cramps, I'm so thankful I found Dr Wu to help calm down my daughter's bad cramps and help regulate it. My daughter started coming twice a week for 6 weeks and now she comes once every other month to keep it under control.\" \"My son had bad acne breakouts. He is a sophomore in highschool and feeling very self conscious about his skin. I thought I would try ACU before starting him on a medication that I see often prescribed. After two visits his skin cleared up dramatically. Dr Wu informed us that she was going to use a quick bleeding technique to release the heat in his body which is why he was breaking out. It only took 15 minutes. With the rest of his appointment time we focused on stress reduction and anxiety. Since we have started care here his skin has improved and I have noticed he is able to focus more in school which is helping his grades. This was a great surprise and it is what convinced me it was my turn to try ACU. Thank you Dr Wu!\" Why doesn't Dr. Hart perform Acupuncture? \"I wont settle for anything less than the absolute best possible care for my patients. True traditional Chinese acupuncture takes years to master. This is not a skill I can quickly learn in a few weekend seminars. I chose to hire two highly qualified Acupuncturists who have dedicated many years to learning and practicing true traditional Chinese acupuncture.\" Dr. Hart "}
