They have dreams and aspirations that change every moment. Getting a toy or a chocolate, running on the beach, visiting fairyland to landing on the moon and going to the stars is what a child dreams of every day. A child does not need to slumber to dream but s/he can build castles in the air, open eyed and wide awake, even sitting in the class or playing on the field. What instigates a dream is a wish, and the fulfilment of that wish is the content of the dream. A growing child's dreams and ideals are shaped by their families and friends, teachers and the society in which they grow up. We as teachers carry the onus to nurture a child's dream. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) as one of the Boards of education in India has introduced various reforms to help children dream and nurture these dreams. At CBSE we take care of all the academic needs of the students and help them excel in not just school based assessment but also develop strong foundation to be able to face real life challenges. The Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) through its Formative Assessment has paved a way for the students to identify their latent talents and interests. Teachers form an important resource pool and facilitate students to build on their strengths and overcome weaknesses. A child centric approach towards teaching is the call of the day. I believe it is also important for us to question whether our homes, communities and society as a whole can contribute to creativity and imagination. As parents, we should be asking ourselves - what was the last creative activity we engaged our children in? Have we nurtured their passion for the arts or sports? How many times have we told our children to stop asking questions? And are our communities supportive of children who possess non-academic talents? Or is everything focused on getting good grades in class? There can be a lot of things that can be done to nurture children's creativity. However, one critical thing to remember is that creativity cannot happen when we are denied the freedom to be who we are, the freedom of thought, the freedom to make mistakes and to learn from them, the freedom to decide who we want to become, and the freedom to nurture our aspirations. Children should not always think of what is 'right' - of the things they think their teachers, parents and society will want them to do or say or think. The introduction of Values Education, Life Skills, reading skills, health and wellbeing and other Co-Scholastic activities are a step in this direction. In today's world where national and international boundaries merge seamlessly, English language has acquired the role of an important medium of communication. It has become the language for knowledge seeking as we move towards a knowledge- based economy. 4 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenCBSE envisages that all language skills need to be integrated into the English language curriculum at schools. Speaking and listening should be fostered in children to equip them with better communication skills. At the onset it proposes to strengthen formal testing of speaking and listening skills in the form of Formative Assessments (FAs) in English at Secondary and Senior Secondary levels from the academic session 2012-13. For this purpose CBSE plans to develop a 'Cohort of Oral Examiners' to be involved in testing of speaking and listening skills in English at the aforesaid levels. Good reading habits are a source of wonder and joy for children and adults alike. No wonder, inculcating good reading and learning habits in children has always been a concern for all stakeholders. Reading does not mean reading for leisure only but also for information, analysis and synthesis of knowledge. A conscious attempt to encourage reading habits among school children had been taken up by CBSE way back in 2003 (vide circular no. 17 dated 16 July, 2003) with continuous follow-ups at regular intervals. Now under Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) and grading in Secondary education right from the primary classes, the importance of fostering interest for reading among children of all ages has increased. As part of the Formative Assessment in CCE, Reading Projects are also being taken up in CBSE schools in a systematic manner. Various modes of assessment such as conducting reviews, scripts reading, discussion, open houses, interact with the authors are considered. CBSE recognizes that in the next few years the country will have the advantage of having young people wanting to learn, especially with the introduction of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. With the changing demographics, there will be an increase in young population, and thus innovation may have the biggest payoffs. There will be a need to reach out to children and nurture them to become a part of the nation building. CBSE, being a premier organization in spearheading changes in educational opportunities invited representations from schools regarding innovation and best practices and the response was overwhelming. This approach encourages project or enquiry based learning, making student voice more meaningful and encouraging peer to peer teaching, learning and mentoring thereby exhibiting a positive learning experience and environment. The Board also has a commitment to preserve and protect heritage monuments in the country. CBSE and History TV18 have agreed to a partnership in their campaigns to preserve and protect heritage monuments and promote education in the country.January-March 2012 5 The first Optional Proficiency Test in the subject of English, Hindi, Mathematics, Science and Social Science for class X was conducted in July 2011 as a part of examination reforms. The overwhelming response from the students and the affiliated schools has made the Board take the decision to conduct a similar optional test for class X students appearing in March 2012 Examination. We all know that the education system is passing through the funnel of change and technology is playing a pivotal role in this change. In addition the different ideologies of the stakeholders, religious institutions and the prevailing culture also influence education systems and impact it. These determine the kind of learners churned out of the system. CBSE is attempting to develop a synergetic relationship to look into all aspects of students' growth and development. I urge the teaching fraternity to help the children to dream and at the same time nurture these dreams by providing resources and guidance at every step to ensure that the children never lose sight of their dreams and are able to realize them. VINEET JOSHI Chairman CBSE \"Seven Deadly Sins\" 1. Wealth without work 2. Pleasure without conscience3. Science without humanity4. Knowledge without character5. Politics without principle6. Commerce without morality7. Worship without sacrifice. \u2014 Mahatma Gandhi6 Nurturing the Dreams Feedback Forum Dear Sir, It was a great pleasure and honour for me to take part at the 18th National Conference of Sahodaya School Complexes held at Chennai and once again thank you for inviting me to deliver speech as lead speaker to address the Principals. It will be my privilege and pleasure to take part in any of CBSE functions and I assure you that our association with the CBSE will continue at all times. Kris Srikkanth Director Sun Online Learning India Private Limited, Chennai Former Indian Cricket Captain & Selector BCCI Respected Sir, Presidency School Bangalore South is a nascent premier institution following the CBSE curriculum. In the past five years since its inception, we have been following with all the latest development in the Board and implementing the same. It gives me immense pleasure to share the feedback on the CBSE Curriculum. First and foremost I would like to say that working in the Presidency group for over a decade has given me ample time to closely monitor both ICSE and CBSE pattern of education. The revamp in the CBSE Board and the fine tuning in the work especially with regard to revised CCE pattern of assessment has really made a large difference to general moral of the students. The stress level amongst the student community is now manageable and they seem to be well equipped to handle the load of academics. The syllabus is easy to tackle as there is no rank system. Even the Grade X students are less pressurized here. It would be of great interest to note that unlike other schools, the students preparing for the Board exams go home at regular timings with the rest of the school. There is proper guidance for the slow learners and the measures are practical. In fact the candid report of some of the external observers who have visited our school have shared that students in our school are happy, have a positive approach and are less stressed. In general happiness quotient of the school is high. With regard to CCA, it has helped us in having a structured planning for the non scholastic areas. We run 15 hobby clubs weekly for grades I-IX. We have a group of resource personnel who conduct a range of indoor and outdoor activities. This entire programme has been extremely successful with our students. Students also have good measure of lessons and exposure in Life skills, an essential tool for progressive development. Overall the students have been found to be well versed with their communication skills. In its 10 Nurturing the Dreams of Children present form CBSE gives ample scope for further development, many innovative measures could be introduced and the students are better equipped to handle change in any form. In the years to come we are extremely hopeful that under your able guidance the system will flourish and will be fine tuned further. The students will once again thoroughly enjoy coming to school and exchange of knowledge then will become a pleasurable experience. J. Bhuvaneswari Principal Presidency School, Bangalore South Respected Sir, I am delighted to inform you that the induction programme on CCE for the Principals of newly affiliated school, conducted at CBSE Regional Office, Panchkula on 16th December 2011, was really very informative and interesting. I represented Cygnus High World School, Ambala as the Principal. This school is a newly affiliated school to CBSE for secondary level, and will be due for applying for Senior Secondary level next year. Cygnus High World School is equipped with the best of infrastructure and required qualified academic and administrative staff. The school though now going through its third year of inception, is progressing well with a marked degree of satisfaction through its various academic and co-scholastic activities. Dr. (Col-Retd) Rohtas Singh Principal Cygnus High World School, Ambala Respected Sir, I cannot thank you enough for coming to Muscat and attending our conferences on Education held jointly with the Ministry of Education, Oman. As a school affiliated to CBSE it was a matter of great pride for us that you were present on this occasion. Your presence, being the Chairman of the largest Education Board in India, added a lot of prestige to our conference on Education. A lot of interest has been generated amongst the delegates about CBSE and CBSEi here in Muscat. On behalf of the entire Indian School Al Ghubra family I would like to thank you very sincerely for coming to Muscat to attend the conference despite your very busy schedule. Papri Ghosh Principal Indian School Al GhubraJanuary-March 2012 11 Respected Sir It is my privilege to thank you for appreciating and motivating the students as the first batch under the new Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) Scheme. This step will definitely encourage the students. Bhai Joga Singh Principal Khalsa Girls Sr. Sec. School Respected Sir, Thanks for your kind support and guidance for implementing C.C.E. and in developing our school website, for facilitating the parents and the students. Sir, we are glad to inform you that our website is working successfully on the address www.sjisjwr.in and many stakeholders i.e. parents, students and teachers are accessing it frequently. Sir, your blessings are valued. Suggestions and guidance are always welcomed by us in future too, to serve the society in a better way. Sapna Sharma Principal St. Joseph's International School, Jhalawar Respected Sir, Summer Fields School, Kailash Colony was founded in the year 1953 with the Principal objective of imparting value based quality education which is preparing students to be responsible citizens of a global world village. The school endeavors to live by its moto of 'LOVE-LIFE-LIGHT'. It is a part of the prestigious K.R. Mangalam Group of World Schools. Summer Fields School has developed on the pillars of initiative and challenge and I am proud to say that it stands today as a constructive and effective learning medium with high professional standards, thereby enabling each child to reach his/her optimum potential. However, a school is not merely a place of formal learning. Co-curricular activities are essential for instilling confidence, self-esteem and team spirit in a child and form an integral part of growth and development. Our endeavor is to provide avenues to the students to discover their talents, abilities and to create awareness among the students in terms of respect, values and better understanding of the culture of our country. Rema Alex Daniel Principal Summer Fields School, Kailash Colony, New Delhi12 Nurturing the Dreams of Children Respected Sir, I had the privilege of participating in the 13th Management Development Program on \"Leadership in Educational Administration for Principal of Secondary Schools affiliated to C.B.S.E\" organized by the department of Educational Administration (NUEPA)from 30th of January to 3rd February 2012. This opportunity polished my capability to lead the institution and its team towards its goals. A revealing lecture by Najma Akhtar, Y.N.Kaushal's deliberation on feedback and sharing, Preetam Khandelwaal's lecture on 'Participative Decision Making in School' had the potential to accelerate the pace of improvisation. The 'performance appraisal' and 'time management' were unbeatable tools suggested, and are worth implementing. Veera Gupta's lecture about 'Significance of Counseling and Guidance at School Level' was so convincing that our school will benefit from this facility in the coming session itself. The visit to D.P .S International School gave a clear perspective of the harmonic balance of the various aspects of school. Interactions with participants were enlightening. Dr. Ananti Jebasingh from Jasola and Dr. D.Manjunath from K.V. Ojhar left an everlasting impression on my mind. The whole program was very impressive which impregnated innovative idea that can successfully contribute to the smooth functioning of an institution under an able guidance. Dr. Manohar Lal Principal Guru Nanak Higher Secondary School, Ranchi Respected sir, I put forth my heartfelt gratification to you to signal the Annual Sahodaya meeting held at Chennai from 27th to 29th December 2011. It was indeed a rich experience for all the Principals and stakeholders to stand in unison. This kind of connectivism is required for the constructivism. We have been sharing those experiences with our students, teachers parents and community as well keeping the flag of CBSE high for its strong and powerful vision. With regards Dr. (Mrs.) Neeru Joshi Principal BBPS Kadrabad, Modinagr (U.P .)January-March 2012 13 Respected Sir, It was such a pleasure to have you with us and also of course it was an honour for the Daly College to host you. Your address to the students, parents and teachers was very well received and I was paid a lot of compliments on your behalf. Kr. Sumer Singh Principal The Daly College, Indore Respected Sir CENBOSEC brings about all important educational contents, happenings and basic need based reporting pertaining to streamlining of education. It is indeed a great educational and valuable treasure trove for all educators and students. Hope this literary venture keeps on creating new milestones and benchmarks to bring greater effulgence in the future. Dr. Dharam Veer Singh Principal Sri Guru Harkrishan Sr. Sec. Public School Bitter are the tears of a child: Sweeten them. Deep are the thoughts of a child: Quiet them. Sharp is the grief of a child: Take it from him. Soft is the heart of a child: Do not harden it. \u2014 Pamela Glenconner14 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenNurturing the Dreams of Children Mrs. Neera Sharma* Nurturing a child is an excellent yet daunting challenge. Unfortunately this challenge has no set rules, procedure or steps to follow. One with a sensitive heart and overflowing emotions of love and affection can win their attention necessary for their inherent development. Discovering the varied interests in children is the first step in nurturing their dream. Here parents have a very important role to play as they are their first teachers. One needs to develop the qualities of patience, tenderness and persistence to nurture their creativity, and channelize their overflowing energies. \"We have given no greater gift or responsibility than our children\". Those early first years of nurturing and teaching are very crucial for the rest of their lives as we can never turn back the hands of time. Thus spending quality time with them, sharing and listening to them, visualizing their dreams and encouraging them to follow them is very important. We cannot fashion our children after our desires. We must have them and love them as God has given them to us. I think we need to direct them to what amuses their mind so that we are able to discover accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius in them. \"Water their dreams with optimism & cultivate success\". As we face the future in these changing times, our mission as educators is to yield upright and satisfied human beings with an intellect to foresee, should not waver. We must understand that children do need adult supervision; they need our love, care, faith and trust. Most importantly we must act the way we want our children to act. Without a steady bond, a child is at a risk for becoming hostile and hard to manage. A positive social support system is also a must to develop confidence in a child. Abuse of any kind will have devastating effect on a child's growth. We must refrain from this. \"Help your children develop their own version of success, Just nurture their dreams\". * Principal, DAV Public School, AmritsarJanuary-March 2012 15 Nurturing the Dreams of Children Mrs. Sajitha Thambi* Dream, Dream, Dream......... are the words often quoted by Honourable Ex-President of India Shri A.P .J. Abdul Kalam for the younger generation of the country. The message he wanted to give is: 'What you want to do & what you can do is limited only by what you can dream'. Dreams & wishes are weak until and unless they are supported by faith. As said by Mahatma Gandhi- \"Nothing great in this world was ever accomplished without a living faith\". To dream rightly- Students often take decisions according to the peer group. Often they are misled by wrong information by their friends. Their wishes and dreams mostly depend on their group rather than on their personal capability or interest. Teachers have an important role to play here. Teachers must take the pain to find out the hidden talents and capabilities of the students and motivate the child to work in the direction in which he can progress. The right direction to be chosen must be shown by the teachers. Nurturing the dream rightly- Nurturing the dreams means to bring up the dreams; to nourish so that them can be attained. Do train the child to consistently work to be successful. The dream of a child blossom and grows into reality when along with the child, the school, parents and teachers nurtures it. An important role for a teacher here is to be a motivator. Motivation is the turbo engine that keeps determination high. Determination to succeed should be deep rooted in the child to stop diverting from his/her aim. Excellent teachers are those who can make the students plan short term or long term, but the deadlines must be fixed to keep up the spirit to achieve success by that time period. Benefits of the latest changes- The latest changes brought in the school education with grading system and assessment of the Co-Scholastic areas has provided a favorable atmosphere for the students to bring their dreams into reality. The pressure on the students to work equally hard for every subject to maintain the aggregate percentage is no more there. A child up to high school level now has ample time to learn in depth about his subject of interest. Also students with talents in other fields like art, craft, sports, dance and music have got better opportunity to develop and grow as grades are allotted for Co-Scholastic areas as well. Schools have now grown up into institutions that provide an environment for the child to grow and dream for life and work for it. Here I would quote- 'Let not thy winged days be spent in vain. When once gone no good can buy them back again'. * Principal, Maitri Vidya Niketan, Bhilai16 Nurturing of Children' Preeti Swami* \"If we nurture the dreams of children, the world will be blessed. If we destroy them, the world will be doomed.\" - Dr. Wess Stafford We all know that each child is unique. Each child learns a little differently from the next, and has different interests. As parents, we have the responsibility to look for the hidden potential of our children and encourage and equip them to achieve it. One of the greatest attributes a child can possess is the belief that they have the capacity. But a child will only believe, what his/her parent believes about him/her. As John Maxwell said, \"A child has no clear picture of himself. He sees himself only in the mirror of his parents' evaluation of himself.\" Untapping a childs potential starts with the parent. No matter what happens in any given day, if we think our child has the potential, we are more likely to work towards developing that hidden potential. Whatever is your child's hidden talent, by having faith and patience it will surface. As parents, pray not only for your children, but for yourself. With faith and patience you will accurately discern and nurture the precious potential God has placed in your care. Teach them love, trust and believe me, it can make a difference, if we nurture our children's dreams with these. When I was a child I had many teachers who believed in me. I was inspired to teach. Today I teach with love and devotion. Inspire your child to his/her imagination to give shape to the new ideas and to have self belief. Imaginations help people to think outside of the box as there are no limits to thinking big and achieving it. Inspire your child to nurture dreams by saying \"You Can Do\". Ask him/her the following questions:- 1. Would you like to climb mountain or rocket to stars? (It will encourage your child to reach the height) 2. Would you like to care for lost dogs or cats ? (This will instill the value of compassion and love) 3. Would you like to draw, dance, sing, play the musical instrument , write wonderful stories or like to be actor, doctor, teacher or nurse ? (This will help them to dream what he/she wants to be and will soon discover their hidden talent). 4. Would you like to make people laugh? (It will instill the right values in your child and he/she would make his/her and others life happy). 5. Would you like to have special friends? (It will help the child to love, be friendly, and honest). 6. Would you like to be strong, jump high, run fast? (This will help the child to set his/her goal of being strong and powerful). Then tell your child it may not be easy or happen as quickly. Say to him that you believe in him/her to find a way if s/he truly want something saying \"YOU CAN DO IT\". * TGT (Mathematics), Carmel Convent School, Sector- 9B, ChandigarhJanuary-March 2012 17 Nurturing the Dreams of Children Aji V arghese* Human beings dream to attain many things in life, such as coveted positions, valuables, healthy environment, and friendship of great people, wealth, popularity and many more. Dreams indeed inspire us to work hard to materialize our goals. Dreams makes a person creative, focused, attentive and innovative. H.F. Hedge aptly said \"Dreaming is an art of pure imagination, attesting in all men a creative power, which if it were available in waking, would make every man a Dante or Shakespeare.\" Men of dreams and determination had proved that there are strategies to materialize dreams. Kalpana Chawla, A.P .J. Abdul Kalam, Abraham Lincoln and many more renowned people achieved what they had dreamed. To achieve one's dreams one needs to nourish dreams, as we take care of a sapling by pouring water, giving manure, trimming and so on. There are scores of people without dreams. Good people can present dreams to people who have no aim in life. The school teacher of Hafez Contractor asked him to become an architect, and today he is one of the well known architect in the world. So parents and teachers should teach children to dream good goals in life, and they need to teach them to nurture it by working for it through right path. The society including parents, teachers, classmates, family members, village community etc.... have to appreciate the people who achieve something in their life. In my opinion appreciation is one of the best ways to nurture dreams. Secondly, if someone approaches us to help them to materialize their dreams we can show them ways to achieve it. Thirdly we need to create platforms to expose one's dreams. Moreover, one can also ask one to deviate from one goal to another. For example someone asked Kapil Dev to take up in cricket instead of playing football. He excelled in cricket and won the World Cup for our county and thus he created a niche in every cricket loving Indian. We need to appreciate the parents of Sachin Tendulkar because after seeing his talent in cricket they admitted him in a cricket academy to purse his passion. Some people change their dream on their own, for example Amitab Bachchan bid adieu to his executive job to become an actor and he reached the pinnacle of acting through his hardwork. Schools plays a pivotal role in nurturing dreams of young children, so every school must conduct innumerable Co-Scholastic activities along with pedagogic activities. Healthy competitions too nourish dreams; prizes, medals, monetary rewards, popularity, comfortable and secure life can also nurture one's dream. The concerned persons have to provide children with all resources to foster their dreams. \"All men of action dreams\" so \"The end of wisdom is to dream high enough to lose the dream in seeking of it.\" A dreamer needs to hope and toil to achieve it; well wishers need to nurture dear one's dreams by motivating them to achieve their targets. And appreciate the people as they achieve their dreams. It is a divine deed. Do it generously to foster other's dream. * Principal, Sundaram Central School, Palghar (dist) Thane District, Maharashtra.18 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenNurturing the Dreams of Children Mamta Banerjee* 'I dream the dreams of other people, So I can help them live their lives.' Chitra Devakaruni Once a child is born he /she treads on the tapestry of dream. Gradually the child moves away from the world of innocence and make-believe environment into the world of reality. The Utopian world or the pseudo world starts taking the shape of a reality. Here the elders' role starts as facilitators and guiding light for the dreams of the children. The responsibility is not as easy as it appears. The lines of Pablo Neruda rings clear here: \"Perhaps the Earth can teach us And when everything seems dead And later proves to be alive.\" The parents or teachers or trained professionals need to draw lessons from the Earth. The Earth that appears to be so silent during autumn nurtures so much life on it. The dreams of the children must be nurtured very tenderly. Like a tender sapling that grows into resplendent sprawling trees, they must allow the young to dream a different kind of future. The children must be empowered to realize those dreams and to become what they want to be. Alas! Children cease to dream in our society. Seldom do the ones who have taken charge as the moral heads pay attention to the little voices in the children's hearts. This is sad. We find the children living the dreams of their parents. Some reach the destination and others burn out before their time. Ask a student of the senior school. What does he/she desire to study? Prompt comes the answer, Medicine, Engineering etc., etc. \"My father knows what is best for me.\" There was a candid answer from girl once who said, \"I am not doing well because I don't like these Science subjects, if I fail my parents will automatically shift me to another stream.\" But how many have a chance like this lucky girl. I have seen hell breaking loose when a child under performs. Isn't this pathetic? Is life all about big jobs and big cars? Do we ask our children to study to outshine our neighbour's child? The entire mind set needs to undergo a sea change. Leave the child alone, allow the children to think. This leave alone system will make our children into wholesome human beings, and also help us, those who * Coordinator & PGT (English), D.A.V . Public School. Unit-8, Bhubaneswar.January-March 2012 19 work along with them, to work off the course of adulthood. Parents just need to lay the rutted path; children will pave a way on their own. The children will automatically begin their journey from the gross to the subtle. At this juncture instead of holding symposiums and diplomatic parleys on the development of children, we have to have implicit faith and trust on the abilities of our children. Children must be given a chance to test their potentials. Creativity of the children must be put to test. Let us try and open up ourselves to their potentials. As quoted \"The mind is like a parachute...\" So are our little ones, once they are given a chance they will grow and grow into resplendent future generations. We must allow the memory of the good-old- days of childhood to linger in their minds. They need to enjoy that segment of the life where the colour of things are different, their depths greater, their magnitude greater, a most balanced and joyous condition of life. Our way of nurturing at home and at school should not put blinkers on them, which might ruin their vision and force the little ones to take wrong turns in life. We as elders must recognize the emotional quotient of the teaching -learning process. In the words of Daniel Goleman we need to understand the 'emotional intelligence' (El). The whole process of learning is about emotions. Learners need to have independent thought and individual reasoning. The work of the stakeholders is to channelize the interest of each learner and see that their love for the subject is upheld. The institutions of learning should not make a blunder of losing another Einstein just because he refused to learn facts of History by-heart at school. Trust and faith on children have always worked wonders. My school has a distinctive way of conducting the school assembly. Every day a different section puts up the performance. The assembly is theme based. I do marvel at the ways students put up the assembly. The assembly of Std. XI Commerce, once just surprised me. The theme was on Reading and the section presented the assembly, with those students who had always shirked from speaking in the class. The students were able to draw out those nuances where even teachers had failed. Thus, words of encouragement and the ability to tap the potentials of each child is the need of the hour. A parent teacher interaction is necessary. Parents must give time to their wards and help the teachers to bring up their children. They should not hold back any facts because the cause behind the relationship is very sanguine. A lot of exposure to the students must be in the offing. Children must have the opportunity to cull and choose from the subjects. Instead of using clich\u00e9d terms like academics with co-curricular activities; vocational subjects should be offered. Right from the commencement students must grow up finding charm in their process of learning. Often, we find that children lose interest in the subjects as all they know is examinations and marks. This notion that learning is not only about examination must be explained to them. In short the entire attitude must undergo a sea change. Positive attitude towards life must be taught to them. Children must start preparing 20 Nurturing the Dreams of Childrenfor life; and answers to life from the beginning. They should be given a feeling how significant they are to the society and how important their dream is. They must be taught to feel what they think; see what they believe; mold their imaginations appropriately. The think- tanks, the policy- makers and the educationist should be ready to lend a foundation to the little one's ever growing dreams. Children should be able to make a space of their own in this ever growing gyre of events, despite of great odds in life. No budding talent should be crushed before its time. Every little life should be given a breather of life. Little ones should not be snuffed out in their crib; before their time' just because of the formulation of some defective education system; made by somebody in a huff in order to bring about a change. We are the custodian of a generation that is extraordinary, so who are we to push them into slots and make the mistake of branding them into different categories: good, average and poor. Let them put on their thinking caps, Let them dream the realm, Let them view their own world, Through, bubbles of their dream. Life is precious.So are our gems.Tap their capabilities before phase,Before our children wither on their way. Knowledge is inherent in man; no knowledge comes from outside; it is all inside. ... We say Newton discovered gravitation. Was it sitting anywhere in a corner waiting for him? It was in his own mind; the time came and he found it out. \u2014 Swami VivekanandJanuary-March 2012 21 Tips to Nurture the Dreams of Children Meenakshi Madhusudanan* Children have many dreams from the time they are born. Some dreams are like the dreams which we get when we sleep. As we wake up, they are forgotten. Each child get desires in life as they grow. Some are influenced by many things they come across. At home, in school, by media, the scene on the roads etc. Some dreams and desires fix firmly in their minds as seeds in the fertile soil.Wait patiently for the seed to mature and sprout on its own. We teachers must keep observing and assessing without distorting the dreams. In the name of assessing we should never discourage. It should never be judgemental.Sometimes our interference will make a wrong impression. A misinterpretation in the child's mind and the desire is erased or forgotten. A few do's and don'ts for nurturing the dreams of children are: Do's Observe from distance without meddling in the dream process. Keep track of the dreams if the link is continuous and proper. Check if the intensity of the dream is with yearning which indicates the passion of the dreamer or its only momentary. Believe in the dreamer and his dreams. Give enough time for strengthening the dreams. Show the ways to realise their dreams if you are clear about them. Don'ts Don't enforce your dreams and expect them to dream the same. Do not criticize whatever may be their dreams. Do not judge the validity or measure the passion in terms of earning money and so on. Do not mislead. Lead towards the goal if not leave them to achieve by themleves * Principal, Sri Vidhya Academy, Chennai22 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenNurturing the Dreams of Children Swami V edatitananda* In this article, we will not be entering into an analysis of the hopes and aspirations of students. What is more important for us is to unravel the most beneficial mind set in ourselves that can bring fulfilment to the dreams of our children. We believe that we need to have two qualities in ourselves so that our kids' dreams may see the light of day in the future. Mother-heart in teachers First of all, we, as teachers, need to develop a mother's-heart. What does this mean? One need not be a physical mother in order to develop a mothers-heart. Neither is this ability confined to women alone; men too can, and have, manifested it. We need to place ourselves at that point of perception, where we are able to accept the child as he or she is. Every child has infinite possibilities. Living with the kids, however, seems to force our attention on their mistakes, on their failed attempts at learning, rather than concentrate on their possibilities. A person whose mothers-heart has opened is able to see in the child the actualisation of what it can become years later. It is not an imagination; it is a vision. Imagine the beauty of a relationship between the teacher and the student, where the student receives unconditional love and acceptance from the teacher! Does this mean the teacher will never shout or get angry? Far from it; but, chastisement must always be preceded by a rock-solid foundation of strong emotional bonding. Love and acceptance are generally seen to be highly conditional in most of us. We tend to like children who are academically brilliant, physically healthy and well-informed, emotionally well adjusted, vivacious and sweet. Again, our love gets conditioned by parochial feelings quite often. Are we able to break free from all such considerations and shower our love on all the children in our care? That is a sure sign of the mothers-heart functioning in us. Subjectively, the opening of the mother's-heart brings some palpable changes in ourselves. One such change is the ability to instinctively stand in the shoes of the child before us, to be able to almost see through his eyes, as it were. Every thought and feeling arising in the child will strike a similar chord within us. Another observable change, subjectively, is the ability to see the child as an integral whole, our vision not confined to any one aspect of the child's personality. We develop our ability to view any single aspect of the child's personality against the background of the child's entire personality. This is the stage where we become capable of truly seeing good in any child. Yet another subjective indication of the opening of the mother's-heart is that all our thoughts, feelings and emotions, even our entire personality, get suffused with the bright quality of light. This may sound a bit mystical * Principal, Ramakrishna Mission School, Along, W est Siang District, Arunachal Pradesh January-March 2012 23 to many, but there is really no other analogy in our language to express this change. A unique alertness comes over us. When this happens, it is impossible to see anything related to the child as trivial. These changes bring about an uncommon fearlessness in our actions. All the people around us may object to our seemingly unconventional methods of teaching and dealing with the child, but we get the feeling of being backed by a very superior certainty in the correctness of our own methods. There is a world of difference between this quality that we are speaking of and ordinary stubbornness. How to develop the mother's heart in ourselves The mother's-heart that lies dormant in each one of us can be awakened by various processes. Most of those time-tested processes are part of spiritual lore. What is relevant for us in our present context as teachers is the possibility of awakening this dormant faculty through the means of our teaching vocation itself. Ours shall be the attitude of the mother-hen that incubates its eggs. The only contribution of the hen is the protective heat it gives to the eggs. Under that protective warmth, the egg matures on its own. Similarly, our kids have everything necessary for their intellectual, emotional and moral maturing built into them by Nature. As teachers, all that we need to provide is the warmth of our emotional and intellectual support. Children try out various means of learning and look up to us for approval. If we take the time and effort to delve a little deeper into the effort per s\u00e9 that the child has put in, rather than perfunctorily pass our judgment on the end-result of its effort, we would be removing yet another nail that has coffined our mother-heart. Another essential habit we need to develop for opening our mother's-heart is that of seeing every child as a bundle of infinite possibilities. The moment we try to beat the child into a strait-jacket of behaviour and activity, we atrophy. To express all this in the simplest terms - we can develop the mother's-heart in ourselves by falling in love with our job of teaching. Do we hear some people objecting that we are over-simplifying the issue here? We invite such people to just look around. Even around us, we shall come across some teachers who are as we have described above. We can develop our mother's-heart by consciously growing the awareness in ourselves that the children whom we are teaching have all the requisite capabilities to be better persons than we are. It has taken us only one small line to express this sentiment. But it takes a lot of effort to actualize it. It is a job of a lifetime. A teacher should have a dream How do we sustain ourselves during such a prolonged effort? This brings us to the second quality that we spoke of earlier. A teacher must himself have a dream. His own life must be fired by that dream. His own life must be the actualization of that dream. The details of the dream may vary, but its crux must be 'constant self-improvement'. Such a teacher aims to understand himself through teaching his students. It is the intensity of our dream that lights the fire in our students. For as Swami Vivekananda famously said, \"Be and make\". Let us all therefore prepare ourselves accordingly.24 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenNurturing the Dreams of Children Rajlakshmi R.* We understand that each child is unique. The learning needs of each child are different from others; they have their own interests and learn at a different pace. Children learn best when they feel secure, are well nourished and are having fun. Their dreams are committed to ensure that each child is provided individual nurturing and teaching by professional and loving staff and to make sure that each child develops self confidence and develops his/her own ability. According to Dr. Vicki Panaccione the world's expert in parenting and an internationally acclaimed \"child physiologist\", \"dreams of children is sweet and fair which reminds the parents of their innocent days which they spent during their childhood. The dream of children brings the happiness in parents when they really try their best to fulfill their children's dreams. As parents they should have the responsibility to look for the potential inside each of their children and encourage and equip them to achieve it. There are many other in which we can make our children's dream come true. The first and foremost thing is to motivate your child. Parenting children involves much more than just helping them grow up. As a parent you must encourage your child to face the challenges in life positively and grow to be a successful person and a good human being. After all life is not a bed of roses, sometimes it is good and sometimes bad. As a parent it's our responsibility to nurture their dreams which will help them to achieve their goals. Parents should also share good thoughts and inspirational quotes which can make children to always think positively and can keep him/her motivated. Parents should always spend time with their children. Some parents are busy in their lives juggling work pressures but they should remember that their family comes first thus, they should be always interactive with their children which can make the parent child relationship firm. Showing the parental love and concern towards the children can increase their level of confidence. Every child needs that nurturing, love and support which can secure their dreams. One important fact should also be always kept in mind is that the importance of winning and losing should be explained to the children. For instance if your child hasn't got any position in the class don't criticize him/her. Instead tell your child that it's okay to lose sometimes and motivate him/her to think what he/she can do differently next time to be better. No one can nurture children if they are struggling alone without support, thus fathers and mothers are both equally important in children's lives. Both need to spend time with the children and help guide their development. Even when parents live apart, it's important to find a way to work together to nurture the children. Grandparents also play a big role in children's lives. the Dreams of Children C.J. Dhar* Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere where individual differences are appreciated, mistakes are tolerated, communication is open, and rules are flexible - the kind of atmosphere that is found in a nurturing family. Virginia Satir\u2014an American psychologist First of all it is very important to understand the dreams of a child which the researches have shown that the interests and learning skills start developing right from the inception of the child in the womb of mother. Cheerful habits, happy family environment, reading good books and keeping the family environment happy and normal will affect the newborn emotionally. Good and nutrious food will affect the baby physically and mentally. After the birth we need to physically nurture the child before exposing him/her to this wonderful world next the child learns walking, talking from the parents and other family members. At this stage of life the child also learns a bit of motoring different parts of body and likes to feel the objects surrounding him so he needs to be provided toys which will be mind linked playing objects to make his brain to think and act. This is almost the pre-nursery stage of a child. Reading from books develops imagination of the child as this is the more curious and carefree stage of the child. The interests shown or observed may also change after the child starts asking why, what, how etc. As the child starts to develop a sense of logic, the real schooling starts. He starts to interact with other people and reacts accordingly. The parents, teachers need to be highly careful and keen observers to help the child to develop pleasant manners and suitable interests. The parents as well as teachers need to be extra careful and control their unwanted emotions at least in front of the child but help the child to develop the pleasant and appropriate interests which will be the reflection of all the people surrounding the child. The parents should never impose their interests on their child. Once the child acquires the age of 12-14 serious handling and care needs to be taken as the child enters the adolescence age. Due to hormonal and physical changes in body the child starts behaving in different way. The parents should provide what the child likes as hobbies or interest to help him to come out of this crucial stage of life. He has tremendous energy which needs to be channelized appropriately. By this time the child acquires enough habits of studies and understands its importance. In general, the nurturing of child is a process and needs to be taken at least up to the age of 16-18 years. Then parents can think of giving freedom to the child to take independent decisions of life for his or her future. The values that have been inculcated in the child will be reflected which may modify due to existing society at that time. * Principal, Sunflag School Bhandara26 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenNurturing the Dreams of Children Dr. Dharam V eer Singh* Every child is an extremely impressionable human being begging to understand why they exist. Everything they see and hear will in some way impact them when they grow up. Every child needs to know that they have got what it takes to make a difference in this world now and even later on in their lives. Many a times we, as parents and educators, dismiss children because they \"might not understand the real world\" or \"they don't have enough experience to know what real life is about.\" The experiences in our lives can get in the way of a child expressing their dreams to us. But the stark reality is that the world would be devoid of its problems if every child understood the necessity of their existence. Any parent or person working with children knows that each child, when nurtured and encouraged, develops according to his or her unique temperament and abilities. As adults we have the duty to listen to and act on children's needs. Numerous organizations like UNICEF, CRY, AVANI and PRAYAS are working with Government organisations to provide comprehensive support and income generation opportunities to empower families to care better for their children and to provide quality education to them. Nurturing children in a secure and innovative learning environment is the need of the hour. The schools of today should have teachers that are best suited for the needs of the children because that will make the whole journey of nurturing, children beautiful. They must be the ones who love to nurture children, possess a positive attitude, maintain high moral values, think creatively and are knowledgeable about helping children to develop and learn. Faculty needs to be selected judiciously and should be conducive for professional and personal development of children. A child should not be trained to learn by force or harshness; but directed to it by what amuses his/her mind. State of the art facilities combined with excellent curriculum and incredible staff is what will nurture the seeds of today into the blooming plants of tomorrow. As responsible educators, we must look forward to the opportunity to help the children grow, develop and dream. As parents, we are entrusted with the responsibility of providing opportunities for the kids to grow and develop. We seek out ways to encourage the children to follow their dreams. Children are the keepers of their dreams and the parents are their guiding light. Child development is like climbing a staircase, with each step representing a series of tasks to work on and master before going on to the next step. All children climb the stairs, in their own way and in their own time. On the first step, newborns and infants must develop the belief that their needs will be taken care of and that their * Principal/Director, Sri Guru Harkrishan Sr. Sec. Public School, G.T . Road, Amritsar.January-March 2012 27 world is a safe and secure environment. Once they begin to trust, toddlers move on to the next step, beginning to break away, venture out in the world, and assert themselves as individuals. Having established some independence, the next step involves initiation and risk. The 4-6 year olds begin to try new things, risking attempts at new situations in preparation for the tasks of later life. It is important to allow these children to try new things, and reinforce their effort, regardless of outcome. Now that they can risk, school-aged children 6-12 move onto the next step, where they are working hard to master and achieve in many areas: academic success, self image, social interaction (negotiating relationships with peers), beginning to find out who they are (what do I like, what am I good at, etc.), moral development and impulse control. They need to feel a sense of achievement in all these areas to go on to the next step, where their identity and independence begins to solidify. Adolescents are bringing together all the tasks mastered thus far to begin the very import task of establishing their identity. Adolescents work hard on deciding and developing social identity, vocational and role choices, judgment and independence. The early adolescent experiences rapid physical changes, unstable emotional periods and a very self-centered view of the world. As they engage in the necessary breaking-away from parents, peers become more and more important. Peer groups also help adolescents find a way to belong and fit in, to off-set the myriad of fears and the self-doubts they are experiencing. At very young ages, kids really begin to show their personalities, talents and traits. Our job as parents and teachers is to discover and then nurture these abilities and provide opportunities to the children to continue developing. We may not know if a child will end up in the field of arts, singing, dancing or playing music. But what we know is that the child deserves the right to kindle his/her interest and to express himself/herself through that medium. Along with innumerable moral values and ethics, teaching the children that gratitude is an attitude is also an equally important attribute to nurture their dreams. In today's times, it seems that there is always more to have, more to do and more to ask for. The pace of our lives is so hectic that we literally don't take time to stop and smell the roses, or watch a sunset, or listen to the gentle breathing of the sleeping child. Parents and educators must work hard to raise the aspirations and progression of the children to scale great heights. It is a key vehicle in ensuring that when it comes to the goals, targets and dreams and aspirations of the gifted and talented student, nothing should be taken for granted. We should keep a focus on children's well being and their ability to adequately survive in today's society without assistance in the future. Providing the stepping stones for new beginnings and breaking the cycle of abuse, is what educators are for. Citing the words of Professor Joan Freeman, \"We cannot expect that talented children will simply float to the top of the milk like cream\". We ought to realize and implement the support structures and our efforts that promote and nurture the dreams of children are not the end of the race, rather every day and every single hour is a new beginning of a great endeavour.28 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenNurturing the Dreams of Children Shiju P .S.* \"I have spread my dreams under your feet Tread softly, because you tread on my dreams\" These are the words of Irish poet and playwright William Butler Yeats. As Yeats wishes his dreams to be treated so softly by others, it is the responsibility of the present generation to nurture the dreams of future generation. We should develop a friendly atmosphere in the all realms of a child's life so that they can have a healthy mind to dream a better future. It is the responsibility of the teachers and parents to find out children's aptitude and aspirations at the early stage of their life and also to nourish it properly. It can be understood by getting closer to them and by discussing with them about their wishes and aspirations. Children's dreams have no ceiling. They may not have accurate idea of what they would like to be in future. It is our responsibility to inculcate positive thinking in them, so that they may be able to think positively and creatively in any adverse situations of life. We should make them capable to imbibe the nectar of knowledge. Elders should try to bring their inherent potential by supporting them at the right time. We can find out their various tastes by observing them keenly. Even a naughty child may be a good reservoir of various talents. There may be a great painter hiding behind the scribbling of a child. A great footballer may be hiding behind the kicking and screaming of a child. The predominant consideration should be given to foster these instincts into various talents. We should try to get them involved in things that interest them. Let them participate in different competitions and we can find them getting motivated towards pursuing their goals with more dedication and sincerity. There is an old Chinese adage 'When planning for a year, plant a corn, when planning for a decade, plant trees, when planning for life, educate people', from this adage we can understand the significance of education in moulding good citizens. Children should be moulded to be the pride of their parents, the honour and glory of the school and an asset to the motherland by nurturing them with proper education. Motivational poems and stories enable a child to think positively in life; Science subjects enable them to think constructively. Teachers have a pivotal role to play in identifying the various tastes of their children. They should motivate the children by narrating the stories of exemplary national heroes and scientists. A good teacher should be able to asses the student's subject level, numeric and literary skills to make it more perfect. Our society should create an atmosphere to promote the various life skills of our children. Personal initiative of the teacher and his or her style of maintaining human relationship with the children will be helpful to find the young talents at their early stage of life and also to nourish them properly. The future of a country depends upon the dreams of its children. * PGT (English), Pathfinder Global School, Kosli, Rewari.January-March 2012 29 Nurture Y our Child's Dreams K. Uma* Nurture means to help grow, provide sustenance and can be applied to knowledge as well as a person. To nurture someone is to provide for all the needs, not just food, so that one would grow up to be a meaningful part of a community. Even small dreams are seeds of greatness. They don't have to die out simply because other people think that your dreams are ridiculous or impossible. Before airplanes were built, the idea of a flying machine was ridiculous. Those small dreams are grand schemes of thought that need to be nurtured to grow big enough to compel one to act. Every great thing starts with one small idea. One of the most powerful things we can do for ourselves is to make a conscious effort to nurture our goals and dreams. Following are the six ways to keep our dreams alive and even better - make them thrive! Provide a Fertile Foundation If you begin planting your dreams in a heart and mind that is polluted with negativity or scattered with doubts, they will not be able to thrive properly. Before beginning the planting process, sweep away all unnecessary weeds that could stunt the growth of your dreams. Feed Them The most important sustenance you can feed to your dreams is love. Treat your dreams like your most precious creation. Hold them close to your heart and continue to breathe life into them. Hold them in a place of prominence in your mind and continue to believe in them. Dreams and goals must be fed with positive thoughts at least daily, preferably several times a day. Give them nourishing snacks of happy encouragement and watch them grow fat and happy. W ater Them Water is the bearer of emotion and feeling. Lend as much emotional feeling to your dreams as you can, because emotion is what gives your dreams energy and animation. Visualize the outcome of your dreams and goals, and infuse this vision with emotion. Feel the joy and satisfaction of realizing your dreams. Embrace them and shed happy tears for their beauty. Feel your heart lift with awe and thanksgiving, and allow those feelings to infuse your dreams with the power to become real. * Principal, Nalanda International Public School, Krishnagiri, T .N.30 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenGive Them Light Let the light shine upon your dreams, in the form of inspiration and optimism. Guard your dreams from negativity like a mother bear guards her cubs from danger. Prune Them Our dreams and goals will often change over time, just as we do. The older and wiser we get, we might realize that the dreams of our youth might not suit us as we are today. Give Them Room to Grow Part of the pruning process described above is what will create more room for your dreams to grow bigger and better. But you can also take a look at whether your original dreams were self-limiting in any way. Perhaps you held back out of fear or hesitation, and now you feel you are capable of more. If your child loves scribbling on the wall or dabbing paint, encourage your child to express the thoughts on paper and hang up the nice drawings on the walls of his/her room. Get your child enrolled in some part time art classes or participate in some painting competitions just for fun and you will find the young one getting motivated towards pursuing art with more dedication and sincerity. The point is to help your child dream of greatness and providing all the necessary tools, opportunities and support to help your child achieve those dreams. If your children can dream big, it can become real. Tell your child to believe in himself/herself and everything is possible. You can show motivational videos with lovely images and messages to your children that profoundly convey the importance of dreaming. So encourage your children to dream and never lose hope. You can create something from nothing, all with the wonderful power of your dreams. Help your children discover their passions. Cultivate their sense of hope. Believe in their dreams, and they will believe in them. Let their dreams create purpose, and let purpose fashion their goals. Challenge your children to reach for those goals and help them navigate the barriers asking about their ideas and opinions regularly. Show them that you are really interested in what they think and feel, and they will become comfortable about expressing their thoughts to you. Set realistic goals but expect hard work and discipline. Make sure your children attend school. Ask them about homework, and verify that assignments are completed. Encourage them to take challenging courses. Help them overcome discouragement when they aren't able to reach a goal. Celebrate their accomplishments.January-March 2012 31 Dreams of the Heart Dr. Aditya Kumar Sharma* \"The sun illuminates only the eye of man, but shines into the eye and the heart of the child.\" - Ralph Waldo Emerson The dreams of a child are many and varied. Many times they are born of a fleeting fancy that is silly, funny or impossible. Often, these childish dreams are quickly forgotten. Other times a dream arises from within. It begins as a fleck of light in the heart, and grows until it is a consuming desire. This dream is not an idea for that mysterious time 'when I grow up.' It is a dream for now. It is something the child wants to pursue today. It is something the child will fight for, work for and save for. These are the dreams a parent and a teacher need to get behind and help to grow. When a dream is born in the heart, I believe it should be nurtured, explored and expounded on by parent, teacher and child. Without exploration, the dream cannot be known or realized. A child who has a dream may not have the ability to explore the dream, or even the full capacity to express their desire, that is why an adult must be involved. Dreams of the heart involve doing. They must be done, and done by the child. These dreams involve the body, mind and soul. Nurturing children in a secure and innovative learning environment Nurturing messages are those, which convey to the child that he is worthy and valued for just being alive. The message doesn't increase his value in our eyes because, hopefully, he is already precious beyond belief. However, it does increase his value in his own eyes. We need to understand that each child is unique. Each child learns a little differently from the other, has different interests, and will learn at a different pace. Children learn best when they feel secure, are well-nourished, and are having fun. Every educational institution should be committed to ensuring that each child is provided individual nurturing and teaching by professional and loving staff and to make sure that each child develops self-confidence, and develops skills in the way that is best for him/her. Our Children's Dreams When our children express their interest in something, we watch and wait. There is no telling whether the interest will grow into a dream or fade into obscurity. We watch for signs that it has grown, in their play, their speech and in their actions. When we see them working towards an interest, investing their time and energy to learn, we step up beside them and offer assistance when needed. It is their dream to dream, but our job to provide information. It is our job to teach skills, or find teachers for them. Encouraging them, even when we don't understand their passion, is one of the greatest gifts we can give them. It is a gift all children need. * Principal, SYNA International School, Katni (MP)32 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenWhat are we should do to nurture dreams of our children ? 1. Help them become Problem-Solvers We as teachers, should help the children to become problem-solvers. We should first do the job of a good listener. Disappointed children often need to talk, we should not interrupt or put words in their mouth. It is their problem; we should show confidence in their ability to solve it. At the appropriate time, we should tell them, \"We have confidence in you. You have a good mind and soul. You will find a solution. If you need assistance, we are here.\" Our role is to offer support and guide, not to lead, them to a solution. 2. Help Children to be Optimistic about the Future We should teach them esteem building skills - having the honesty to apologize when they're wrong, courtesy in asking for what they want, setting boundaries on how they're treated. We should develop resilient skills and strategies so that children know that disappointments and setbacks are temporary. 3. Teaching Children Responsibility Assuming personal responsibility is a cornerstone of confidence. Knowing that you are a capable independent individual is empowering. One does by trying. One succeeds by doing. Once you succeed at something which at first may have seemed hard or insurmountable you feel confident about attempting other tasks. The emotional feedback or \"buzz\" that comes from achieving something will then remind you how good it felt. When those feelings are reinforced by encouraging words from others, the impact is felt on a cellular level and imprinted in the subconscious. We should just tell them \"You do not become responsible when you are mature, but rather you become mature when you are responsible\". 4. Criticism is Punitive Our children judge themselves based on their perceptions of the opinions we have of them. When we use harsh words, demeaning adjectives, or a sarcastic tone of voice, we literally strip a child's core of self-confidence and reduce the likelihood that they will try to please us. It becomes easier to just quit trying, especially if they perceive they are a disappointment to us. \"The power to build or destroy lies in the power of the tongue. Be careful what you say to others\". 5. Encouragement is Uplifting We should focus on children's assets and strengths in order to build their self-confidence and feelings of worth. Using nurturing messages we can show them that we believe in their ability and capacity to grow, learn, and change. We should convey through words and gestures that we appreciate a child's efforts and recognize improvement, not just accomplishments. We should make sure that the child understands that our love and acceptance is not dependent on behavior or winning a prize in soccer.January-March 2012 33 6. Build Confidence, Not Fear Zig Ziglar, an internationally known motivational speaker says, \"When we have positive input, we have positive output, and when we have negative input, we have negative output.\" We need to be very careful of the words we choose to motivate our children? The word encourage can be broken down to read \"en+courage\". The prefix \"en\" means to give the gift of courage, the courage to keep trying, to keep up the good work, to focus on next time, and not give up. This type of \"en\" couragement helps the child realize that they can make mistakes and will still be loved and valued. Concluding lines: The children are all ordinary people with big dreams. As teachers, we are entrusted with the responsibility of providing opportunities for our kids to grow and develop on their path. We are mandated to seek out ways to encourage them to follow their dreams. We help them to realize that they are purposeful, intelligent, creative, feeling, social persons who are in the life-long process of learning. Children are the keepers of their dreams. And we, their teachers, are their guiding light. We need to just say to each child -\"Y.M.T.M.\"- \"You Matter To Me!\" Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.You may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their own thoughts.You may house their bodies but not their souls,For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.You may strive to be like them,but seek not to make them like you.For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. \u2014 Kahlil Gibran on Children34 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenPlease Come A Step Forward Swami Supradiptananda * Present Scenario of Our Nation. Children hold the future of our nation in their delicate hands, and they need us to enable them to shape that future, to inspire them to imagine and dream of a new world order, of hope, peace and love, and to empower them with the concepts, values and attitudes, skills, morality and practices to make their dream come true. Teachers, Parents, Society, Media are all responsible for influencing and conditioning the minds of the young children. Children today live in a society where numerous problems plague the nation and instant gratification is the order of the day. Influence of the western culture under the pretext of modernization is very high and morality is at the lowest ebb. Core human values like morality, humanity, honesty have been adversely affected. I would like to highlight how Morality is very important and how at ease, it will help children realize their dreams. Signif icance of Morality. Children should be taught at a very young age the importance of 3 P's viz Purity, Patience, and Perseverance. What is lacking in new generation is these three P's. One should understand the significance of it. If child is taught to be pure i.e. sincere towards its immediate goal, it will accomplish them in a quick and successive manner. Such a habit will help child to attain successive goals in his future life. Naturally some failures may be encountered. Patience gives child strength to stick to its guns. To have patience it has to be taught the importance of perseverance. Constant persevering habit brings patience. It improves purity or sincerity, undoubting commitment towards its goals. All these 3 P's can only be upheld if and only if, child conducts itself morally. Factors Affecting Moral Growth. Society around child is the prime factor affecting their moral growth. Society mainly comprises of parents, family members, neighbours, teachers and most important media. Society should encourage children to imbibe strong personalities who lived their lives in the past, devoted for the respective causes. They should put forth as an ideal to follow instead of following mad trends set by celebrities for instant enjoyments. Personal integrity of ideals to be followed, must be accounted for. Swami Vivekananda says, \"Know your past. Out of the past is built the future.

Look back, therefore, as far as you can, drink deep of the eternal fountains that are behind, and after that look forward, march forward and make Bharat brighter, much higher than she ever was.\" Our education system should be influenced more with human values rather than bookish knowledge. More and more students are required to direct their vital energies towards the future of India, the common goal. We can mould out of this fresh blood, the future visionaries needed for nation building. Whatever is good in the western civilization must be accepted. At the same time whatever is good in our traditional national lives i.e. cultural values must not be thrown away under the pretext of modernization. Catch them young. The problem lies here. We give least thought to the good values, which are already in our blood, during young age of the children. In recent past, our parents gave least thought to it, because their parents somehow overlooked it. Those who gave importance to it called out dated, resulting into finding it difficult to decide which way to proceed. Society became chaotic on thought level. To have rational solutions about this confusion, Swami Vivekananda advices to look in the past and get inspiration. By the time child grow into a strong youth, he becomes a mass of confusion unable to decide which way to go. He does mistakes and find himself hopeless to proceed on the path of righteousness. For him life becomes a series of compromises. One should not stop with the mistakes. Swamiji says, \"Go on! Do not look back if you think you have done something that is not right. Now, Do you believe you could be what you are to-day, had you not made those mistakes before? Bless your mistakes, then. They have been angels unawares. Blessed be torture! Blessed be happiness! Do not care what be your lot. Hold on to the ideal. March on!\" Teach to Resist the Temptations. Temptations are unsolved misery for modern youth. Character helps us to resist temptations. Character comes through manliness. Swamiji says, \"The older I grow, the more everything seems to me to lie in manliness. This is my new gospel.\" Through manliness temptations can easily be tackled. Signif icance of Swami Vivekananda's teaching. Thus, Swami Vivekananda is a living example of Morality. Morality brought him success, name and fame, money, strength to escape lots of temptations. Swamiji says, \"Stand up and fight! Not one step back, that is the idea. Fight it out, whatever comes. Let the stars move from the sphere! Let the whole world stand against us! Death means only a change of garment. What of it? Thus fight! you gain nothing by becoming cowards. Taking a step backward, you do not avoid any misfortune. You have cried to all the gods in the world. Has misery ceased?...The gods come to help you when you have succeeded. So what is the use? Die game....You are infinite, deathless, birth less. Because you are infinite spirit, it does not befit you to be a slave. Arise! Awake! Stand up and fight!\"36 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenConcept of rebirth. The concept of rebirth is another wonder for most of the parents. Nobody is assured about its either dimensions. We have to explore the truth behind it. Our ancient books throw light upon it. It is said, 'as we change our torn clothes, we change our body.' If this is the truth, then there are ample births to rectify our mistakes. It gives peace of mind in spite of series of failures to keep on trying again and again without any hurry. Unhurried try always assures great success. Conclusion: Let us think upon. These ideas should be highlighted in a very systematic way in front of the children in their budding age. In every nook and corner of the country. The media of our country will be blessed if they help India on this line of thought. Let us begin with our family. Everybody must 'come a step forward' and try to influence their children, very patiently, untiringly and in spite of ridicule and criticism by neighbours. That is the need of hour. Swami Vivekananda's 150 birth anniversary is very significant. Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission is going to celebrate it world-wide, by invoking this thought process, through its 150 branch centres throughout India and 70 centres world-wide from 2010 to 2014 on a large scale. Every monk is ready to sacrifice himself for this idea. If it is so, then it is the national duty of every house holder to help monks in this unselfish, noble endeavour to rejuvenate India. I think it is a divine providence. Government is encouraging to serve the nation on this line. Let us use this opportunity and sort out the things of national importance. Rest assure, success is ours through patient and untiring efforts. Let \"Vivekananda Study Circles\" be established in every colony of the country to provide a platform to youths for brainstorming. The kids in our classroom are infinitely more significant than the subject matter we teach. \u2014 Meladee McCartyJanuary-March 2012 37 Nurturing the Dreams of Children S.C. Joshi* Introduction: Teaching is one of the splendid professions where you have the opportunity and responsibility to help in shaping one's personality and character. It is a great challenge of shaping the future of growing young minds in the present scenario. Most of them possess one or the other own imagined dreams with amateur (may be mature) action plans with them and many may have not. But the problem is how to reach at the inner core of their heart to know whether they have the dreams or not, if yes, what's that, if no, why not? Building the curiosity to know about one's dream and wish to nurture it by giving it a deep edge, maybe by means of becoming the most approachable mentor meant for an individual, is the basic requirement for a successful mentor. Some fundamental points need to be addressed thoroughly which are the vital nutrients for the healthy growth of children's dreams. Winning the faith of a child: Taking a child into the confidence by structuring a candid bridge with him is the pioneer step of nurturing course of action. Before becoming his teacher mentor you will have to be his reliable 'buddy' so that he can be open for sharing his views with you. Once the child starts discussing his strengths and weaknesses, ups and downs related to his studies and begins trying to connect himself with you, it is the first achievement for a teacher. Talk to him on different issues, take his suggestions, give him the responsibilities and show faith in him. But be alert and non-sentimental. You must draw a thin transparent line of dignity which would act as a boundary during every piece of sharing. Teacher is a facilitator who is going deep into the heart of a child to identify his dream and to show him the right path to achieve it successfully. You will have to train him to live with his dreams. You can nurture only what you get. So it is up to your willing and concerned endeavours that how much you can explore and inspire the child. Connect yourself with his dream: Second essential step after exploring the child up to an optimum level, by igniting his mind, is connecting yourself with the child's dream. We must learn to connect with children, get to know how they see the world around them, what it is they want from life, what their goal is, and then we should equip them to fulfill their aspirations and desires. If the child does not want to do something, there is nothing in the universe that can force him to do it, and still give desirable results in the long run. The inner desire to do well and be good is something we need to develop in children, it is perhaps even more important than normal lessons. After all, how many people use more than ten percent of the factual knowledge taught in schools when they grow up? Think with them - not for them : There is a phase in every child's life when his moral is low, we need to support him and also to make the child know that failures and bad times are inevitable, obviously he or she * Head, Learning Resource Center and HOD Physics, Ahlcon International School, Mayur Vihar, Phase - 1, Delhi38 Nurturing the Dreams of Childrenwill encounter trouble when he or she grows up. This can be done if we think with the child, not for the child. You have to come down at the level of the child and match your frequency with him so that he would be able to connect himself with you. Once he is fully confident that you are his co-thinker not a supreme-thinker, his mind would be in comfortable state in your presence. Both of you must be thinking on the similar issue at the identical time and moreover coming to the matching conclusions. This is called perfect match of the frequency between a teacher and taught. We have so many live examples of the similar frequency coordination connecting a mentor and a scholar giving outstanding results. Sri Ramakrishna Mirza and so many other examples are there in which a perfect harmony between a mentor and scholar, resulted in great success for scholar. Helping them to focus their dreams : In today's world children are incredibly self reliant. As such they do not require any help once their thinking process starts soaring, but decisions taken by them needs to be screened, seconded and supported by us. Listen to their thoughts as an active listener, show your responses with positive attitude and make minor corrections by giving suggestions not by being an authoritarian but by being a friend. At the growing age their dreams may not be clear and their action plans may not be sharp ended but they are strong-minded to do something 'big' in their life. How much big and how this 'big' is going to be achieved, this they may not know but still they are determined. Use this spurt of determination to identify their dream and inspire them to step in towards its attainment. A teacher can do this with his vast experience and expertise, alongwith willingness to make children realize their dreams and fulfill them. Sharpening their aspirations by playing a catalyzing role as a teacher, you can set the examples as it was done in the past by many great mentors. 'Inspiring without expecting credit' is the key mantra which would help you to devote yourself for this divine cause. Prepare them for setting and achieving goals : It is not possible to prepare someone for any task without knowing about his likes, dislikes and whereabouts. There is a strong need to discuss about his approach towards different situations. Conversation with the child in an open environment leads to the best results towards analysis of his capabilities. Talking to him for a long time in different segments will help in recognizing his talents. Give him the exposure for various things by involving him in different responsibilities. You need to spend maximum time with the child. This will help in strengthening scholar - mentor relation on hand and will make him feel sheltered and channelized on the other hand. Your gracious, experienced and concerned presence will shoot his many unstated, unseen and unexpected troubles. Taking part with him in different activities or making him participate and developing learning zeal is the key aspect of 'setting and achieving goals'. It develops a competitive spirit in the child which helps him at each and every moment of his life. Tell him about his merits, demerits, strengths and weaknesses time to time so that he will take remedial measures for the next course of action. Such rectification process will convert his endeavours into success playing vital role in boosting his confidence manifold.January-March 2012 39 Be supportive during their demoralization phase: Life is an extensive sequence of opportunities, efforts, cheers and becoming role models. It is a stretched process of happenings. Nothing is there to lose. As a friendly mentor you have to make a child confident. Use anecdotes in support of your arguments given as confidence boosting capsule. Help him in regaining his confidence if he loses it repeatedly. Give examples of distinguished people who have gone through ups and downs of their life and come out from extreme situations with the flying colours. During your conversations try to find out the causes which are demoralizing him. Bring him into the positive frame of mind. Encourage him to make another enthusiastic effort. Give him small targets with redefined pathways to achieve previously identified goal. Be his friend, cheerleader, well-wisher and guide. Stay away and monitor: Now this is the time to monitor the child from a distance, and give direction only when you feel it is needed. After all, in the end, all we can do is show them the right path, it is they who have to progress on it. But in this process of shaping and nurturing a child's dream, his privacy and self-esteem should not be ignored. Sometimes, showing the right path to follow is enough. \"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.\" Swami Vivekananda once said that the experience of teaching is ruined if the teacher believes that he or she is teaching. No one can force a child to learn or go on the right path. We can tell a child what to do, we can either coax the child or give him or her an incentive to do what we wish him to do. Wish him luck and celebrate his success: Living with the child's dream and nurturing it with intensive care leading to a great success, is itself wishing him luck. Equipping him with all skills which he learnt under your kind, caring and promotional guidance and leaving no scope for his failures was your firm duty which you must have completed, if you really believe in great mentorship. Exercise all your expertise once again before wishing him luck for his future endeavours. Since both of you are sailing on the same boat so you wouldn't stay away from celebrations of his success and of course cannot go away from your accountabilities of his failures. Keep in mind you are not the creator, it is someone else. Your role is only channelizing the appropriate talent to the precise path. Rest is up to the coincidence of planning, execution at the right time, consistent effort in the right direction, best wishes, blessings and unquestionably the final note - destiny. Can we make an education system which will retain the smiles on the faces of our children? \u2014 A P J Abdul Kalam40 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenNurturing the Dreams of our Children Usha Sharma* \"I dream of floating away on a cloud I dream of catching falling stars I dream of exploring the sea I dream of playing at Mars\" The dreams of childhood are many and varied. Many times they are born of a fleeting fancy that is silly, funny or impossible. Often, these childish dreams are quickly forgotten. Other times a dream arises from within. It begins as a fleck of light in the heart, and grows until it is a consuming desire. This dream is not an idea for that mysterious time 'when I grow up.' It is a dream for now. It is something the child wants to pursue today. It is something the child will fight for, work for and save for. These are the dreams a parent needs to get behind and help to grow. We have to understand that each child is special and unique. A child has unlimited and creative potential because they dream and believe outrageous things. Only a few parents understand that each child has tremendous creative potential within and which is to be developed from early childhood. Children have an enormous capacity for learning new skills. It is during childhood that a primary language is learned. One of the reasons the potential of a child is so great is because they learn rapidly. Children learn faster because they don't over-analyze, they learn instinctively. A child approaches the task of learning a new skill by jumping straight in and trying to learn the whole thing in one big chunk. They make mistakes but they don't care because they have all the time in the world. Children continue to calibrate and make improvements until they have learned the skill. It is during childhood that muscle fibre predominance is determined. Children are a blank canvas; they can be moulded and taught if they are allowed to dream. A proper training and exposure are prerequisites for the development of this potential. More than anyone else parents are primarily responsible for the development of creativity development in children. Sadly most parents do not know how to recognize and cultivate the talents their children have. There is this massive trend now a days to put the kids in structured learning environments at the age of two or three. This is not the optimal learning environment for a child. A child learns best when they are not thinking about it. They also learn better and pay more attention when they are having fun. * Principal, SRN International School, Ramnagaria, JaipurJanuary-March 2012 41 As parents, you are entrusted with the responsibility of providing opportunities for your kids to grow and develop on their path. You are mandated to seek out ways to encourage them to follow their dreams. We have the responsibility to look for the potential inside each of our children and encourage and equip them to achieve it. One of the greatest attributes a child can possess is the belief that they have potential. But a child will only believe about himself, what his parent believes about him. As John Maxwell said, \"A child has no clear picture of himself. He sees himself only in the mirror of his parents' evaluation of himself.\" No matter what happens in any given day, if we think our child has potential, we are more likely to work to develop that potential with them. Discovering your child's potential, though hereditary determines the potential a child possess, but environmental factors, which can be controlled by parents, determine to what extent that potential could be developed. So it is very important that parents take control of their children's environment. Every parent has to be very vigilant and observant and must keep track of the child's interests. By equipping themselves with right kind of knowledge parents can help children achieve their goals. It is the responsibility of the parents to create a right environment which is crucial for both physical and cultural development of the child which includes the behavior, intellect; attitude etc.A proper guidance given to children in the right environment will do wonders and will reap the benefits later in life. They should be passionate and determined to make necessary changes so as to bring maximum in the child. Pressure from narcissistic parents can undermine talented students. Putting pressure on their children to accomplish the dreams which they have failed to achieve may give birth to a rebellion. It is not necessary that the dream of the parents should always be the dream of their children. By harnessing their children's lives with their dreams often leads to crippling the ability of their children. Excessive pressure dims instead of heightening the potential of the child. Always listen to what your child wants to talk about. Listen to what your child has to say, it boosts their self esteem. They need your active attention. They are more likely listen to you if you listen to them. Take an active interest in their lives. Your attentive listening, empathy and understanding will encourage them to confide in you. Our children are happiest when they suddenly discover that the scope of their potential is higher and wider than they had realized. To see that light switch on is priceless. But to know your worth and reaching your potential is enough. Unfortunately, for every diamond we dig up, another falls back into the muddy mire. The lives of these young people are far more complex than we can imagine, and their innate ability can be stunted by: their peers, local community, family or even their ability itself. So many young people have forgotten how to dream and to aspire, or worse, never known how to dream. The best investment parents can make for their children is to help children achieve their full potential. Parents should start this process as soon as the child is born. There is no short cut and at the same time it should not be complicated. It has been proved that children with greater chances of success and triumph are those who at home had a culturally rich and congenial environment. 42 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenThus developing talent is like growing trees. The right environment and nurturing will help the tree to grow to the fullest extent as programmed to grow in the seed. I would like to keep a focus on children's well being and their ability to adequately survive in today's society without assistance in the future. Provide the stepping stones for new beginnings and break the cycle of any limitation. So my appeal to all the children who are fostering a dream in themselves is: Dream reality, Dream with dignity, Dream for humanity, Dream for prosperity.... Dream to inspire, Be your own empire, Be the master of your dreams, Dream a dream you can claim Whenever we pass judgment on a child, we fail to see him as a whole person. True, he may be nervous, shy, stubborn, moody, or violent; we may know his siblings or his background, or think we recognize family traits. But to focus on any one aspect of a child, especially a negative one, is to put him in a box whose sides may not really be determined by reality, but only by our own expectations. \u2014 Johann Christoph ArnoldJanuary-March 2012 43 Nurturing the Dreams of Children Babita Mahajan* It is human nature to protect and provide for those we hold most precious, and that's especially true when it comes to children. They are a bundle of joy and should be nurtured with utmost care, love and affection. Their dreams are more precious than pearls. \"I dream therefore I live\" \u2014 AUGUST STRINDBERG Dreams form an integral part of a child's life. Children should always be loved unconditionally for who they are, and not for what they do. But our lives are so full of hurry, worry and activity; we often stress the importance of spending quality time with our children. But we often push our kids to the bottom of the list. Yes, we assure them, I'll spend some time with you, but only after I finish this and that. Spending time with our kids becomes another item on our \"thing to do\" list. Spending time doesn't mean you have to do anything special. Just play with them or share some jokes with them- in a way connect to them. The best way to reach career success is to map out a strategy and set goals. Without the proper education, our kids will never accomplish their dreams. Education with a holistic perspective is concerned with the development of child's personal, intellectual and emotional development. Education starts with listening to children. When we provide our undivided attention while speaking with a child, it sends a very strong message to the child and that is, \"I value you and what you have to say is important to me.\" We need to appreciate the uniqueness of each child rather then imposing our unfilled dreams on them. No comparison should be made with any other child in class or home. We should focus on things that they like, including hobbies, talents, and interests and determine a career goal. Once they have an idea of what they would like to do, they need to create a plan or strategy to reach those goals. In this respect I would appreciate CBSE for implementing CCE Pattern in education system for two reasons.First that marks have been converted to grades to remove that cut throat competition of rank holders and second now the child is given credits for his co scholastic activities also. Thereby allowing them to explore their passion and hidden potentials. * PGT (Informatics Practices), V eda Vyasa DAV Public School, Vikaspuri44 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenIf we want to ignite their thought process then they should be provided with fearless environment to experiment and grow. I am reminded of the famous lines \"Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high...'' \u2014Rabindranath Tagore Students should be let free to judge their skills and talents and then motivated to pursue their dreams without hindrances. Parents and teachers can do a lot to encourage higher order thinking, even when they are answering childrens' questions. Encourage brainstorming or consideration of alternative explanations rather than simply rejecting their queries of Why, Where and How of everything. Nurture them like a gardener with the best soil of positive thinking. Make sure what your child's sees in your eyes is positive. Our life is what our thoughts make it. Children should be encouraged to believe in themselves-self confidence. They should not only dream but act also. For most of the walls that hold us back exists only in our minds. Don't forget that the first step towards solving a problem is to begin.I agree that the first step is the most difficult one, but then future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. Times are changing we see children glued to electronic gazettes like iPods, internet, TV and mobile though I cannot deny their uses but at the same time it has disastrous implications. There are rising cases of depression and anxiety, frustration increased isolation, increase of violence, greed, and health problems among children Kids have their role models from virtual world. Values are fast eroding from all spheres of life. Youngsters wants to be millionaire through short cuts, corruption is eating Indian roots. As elders we have to bring our children closer to good values like faith, mutual respect, appreciation, kindness, courtesy and spirituality to balance the on-rush of modern western influences. There is a great need to equip children with values of life in order to make them good human beings. So that they aspire to become responsible and honest adults of nation. With our showers of blessings they are sure to blossom and fulfill their dreams Man becomes great exactly in the degree in which he works for the welfare of his fellow-men. \u2014 Mahatma GandhiJanuary-March 2012 ChildrenRooma Pathak* The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up Our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand. Childhood symbolizes spring time which is the season of bloom, growth, rejuvenation, hope and new life. In human lives it symbolizes time of learning growing, happiness and joy. The blooming of children can contribute a lot to the society. In fact child is the father of man. They are the backbone of the society and country and ought to play a constructive role in the progress and development of their motherland. One should not forget that every child has a dream in his eye. Dreams have the power to come true. Dreams can turn into reality if they get right direction and definition from the very beginning. Children unlike adults have dreams with no ceiling If their dreams are nurtured from their childhood they will blossom into blooming flowers spreading fragrance of love and warmth. We tend to assume that children don't have dreams, this is a myth. Children do have dreams which to grownups may seem insignificant or childish. Small and trivial dreams can become big reality. Children need great encouragement and motivation to realize their dreams. Dreams if nurtured with manure of love and affection can harvest good and golden future. Parents and teachers at the juncture of children's life should encourage them to think positive inorder to propel them to realize their roles. Parents and teachers together are great souls They may not forget that they have to play constructive roles. If we discuss with children what they would like to become when they grow up, they may not have clear idea of what they would like to be but at least they can be guided towards a direction which inspires them to dream and work towards it. A child should be asked what he/she wants to be. If child talks about the dream to be a scientist, encourage the little one to know more about the lives of great scientists such as Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton and others, introduce him or her to some interesting books on science and facts and go on a few outings to science museums. Observe the child and try to notice if the child is enjoying the new activities. If the child loves scribbling on the wall or dabbing paint, encourage the child to express the thoughts on paper and hang up the nice drawings on the walls of his/her room. Get the child enrolled in some part time art classes Nurturing the Dreams of Children * Principal, M.M. Public School, Pitam Pura, New DelhiJanuary-March 2012 47 or participate in some painting competitions just for fun and it will be found that the young one gets motivated towards pursuing art with more dedication and sincerity. The point is to help the child dream of greatness and providing all the necessary tools, opportunities and support to help the child achieve those dreams. If the children can dream big, it can become real. Tell the child to believe in himself/herself and the everything is possible. Lovely images and messages to children that profoundly convey the importance of dreaming will help them to nurture. Those who cherish a beautiful vision, a lofty ideal in their hearts, will one day realize it. - James Allen When they dream big, think positive and work hard, nothing can stop them from achieving what they want. If children learn to control thoughts from slipping into negative and get into a habit of thinking positive and thinking good, their confidence level will soar and they will become stronger and inspire others as well. It is an attitude that will help them when they grow up and face life's challenges. It is rightly said, Ultimately, it is attitude and not your aptitude that decides your altitude in life It is inspiring to listen to their goals and ideas. Children start dreaming at an early age. They think about their future career, their wealth, their education, and so on. And their dreams can be huge. As far as careers go, some will choose the typical police officer, fire fighter, or doctor. Others will choose Astronaut, Olympian, or President. Some will aspire to simply \"have money\". Others will seek a business empire as parents; we have more control over whether our children achieve their dreams than we might think. For kids, parents are inspiration, motivation, and leadership. We can support the children by not denying their dreams. As far as kids are concerned, anything is possible. And that's how it should be. If the children's dreams are denied then their chances of achievements are less. You are undermining their chances of achievement. Probability has to be thrown completely out of the window. If children are going to realize their dream of being the first astronaut to land on Mars, the last thing they need is screwing things up. Parents should not preach negative view of life. They should try to provide qualitative education and teach them life skills which are the best way to nurture their dreams. The goal as a parent is to meet parental obligations and provide a path towards success for their children to follow. If children are cut off from love before they even get started, it won't just crush them right now, it will negatively impact them in their adult life. There is a saying that children \"learn what they live and live out what they learn\". As parents, children are always looking up to them. They are proud of what their parents do and they use their accomplishments as a standard. Success and wealth are products of a process; anyone can achieve them. A child who grows up in a successful family will live around that process and adopt it in their own lives later on. 48 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenConsequently, a child who grows up in a successful family will likely to be able to realize his dreams. As children grow and develop they'll begin to show interest in many different things. They'll start to give more attention to certain things that really interest them, some of which will turn into dreams. Dreams can be nurtured if parents and teachers show them the way. They have to become leaders to lead them to right direction. Penning down the dream allows them to see the idea in the first steps of fabrication and helps them stay accountable to their goal. The more they learn about their dream, the more realistic it becomes. Research will also give them important information on what they'll need in order to turn the dream into reality. Setting a date for achievement of a goal helps to keep them focused. How do they plan on achieving their goal? What steps are they going to take? What education or special skill do they need to accomplish their goal? The first step is to make the children focused, intense and full of perseverance. Focused intensity is the fuel that drives young children to achieve dreams. Perseverance is the extra push they need to be able to give themselves when things start to slow down. Development of games or challenges allows the children to make small achievements. Achieving dream on a large scale is possible if motivation, organization, intensity, and determination are fruitfully nurtured in them. Children have their own internal motivation but they need emotional support to get green light to their dreams. One has to be super mom and super duper teacher to nurture the seeds of dreams. Be a haven of positive thoughts and outlooks, provide support without offering unsolicited advice, and help them persevere when they're looking down. If we do these things, our children can do or be whatever they dream...The children should therefore notice; Be careful what you water your dreams with. W ater them with worry and fear and you will produce weeds that choke the life from your dream. Water them with optimism and solutions and you will cultivate success. Always be on the lookout for ways to turn a problem into an opportunity for success. Always be on the lookout for ways to nurture your dream. - Lao Tzu Real education is that which enables one to stand on his own legs. \u2014 Swami Vivekanand January-March 2012 49 Nita Khan * Wisely Investing in Human Potential Helping our Children Learn Nurturing their Dreams Strengthening our Communities In my years of teaching, I've learned that young children are full of imagination and courage. In their world, the sky is the limit. I understand that each child is unique. Each child learns a little differently from the other, has different interests, and will learn at a different pace. Children learn best when they feel secure, are well-nourished, and are having fun. It is no more true as was rightly said that a child is clean like a slate and the teachers help him write on it. A child's mind is updated, full of dreams, desire and many more.... All of us dream. Children do even more as their imaginary world is a fascinating place created by their own minds. It is best to take charge of the thoughts and dreams from a tender age so as to guide your child towards nurturing constructive thoughts, positive aspirations and great imaginations. Living life with a positive attitude makes all the difference in turning ideas into reality. And creating an atmosphere of positive thinking in the school, teaches the children the power of believing in themselves. Believe it, and you can achieve it. Don't believe it; it will always only be a disappointing dream. Dreams have the power to come true. You may think that dreams are... well, just imagination. But the truth is, dreams can turn into reality. Especially, this is one of the most important life wisdom lessons teachers can impart to their students - helping them to realize the wonderful power of dreams and their inherent potential of coming true. Field of Dreams is committed to ensuring that each child is provided individual nurturing and teaching by professional and loving staff and to make sure that each child develops self-confidence, and develops skills in the way that is best for him/her. Typically we tend to assume that children don't have any worries. This is a myth. Children do have worries, which to grownups may seem insignificant or childish but they are worries nevertheless. Have you noticed your child's worries hidden in the endless questions, \"Can I take my doll out to play with my friends? You won't get angry if someone breaks it?\" or \"If I don't get A-grade, will you still buy me the new bicycle?\" These are big worries for the little minds and an opportunity for teachers to turn the doubts and questions into positive dreams and thoughts. To overcome the stress and worries why not plan our teaching strategies in such a way that it enhances the creativity, imaginative, confidence and decision-making skills. I believe this is true in all aspects of life, including the health, wealth and the future of my students. Hoping and wishing won't do it. Neither will the belief that what I want is impossible. Reaching for the dreams of my Nurturing the Minds and the Heart * PRT, Kendriya Vidyalaya No. 2, Ajmer50 Nurturing the Dreams of Childrenstudents is what life is all about. And believing that I am capable of making the dreams happen is the first step in accomplishing my goals. If I believe I can't do it; I am right. If you believe you can do it; you are right again. Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them. I value my vocation because it gives me the power to nurture the dreams. Making a difference, to me, is not just about equipping the children with skills and knowledge. Making a difference, to me, is about believing in the children's dreams and empowering them to realize those dreams and becoming who they want to be. I want to make a difference by teaching with love and laughter and paying attention to the little voices in the hearts. I want to make a difference in the lives of the children that cross the path - the way my teachers made a difference in me. Wordsworth has rightly expressed the same views when he says; \"Child is the father of man\". Childhood is the formative period of a person's life. The habits developed at this time cast a shadow throughout the life. This makes it all the more important that the negative traits exhibited by a child should not at all be ignored, otherwise they may become a habit and incorrigible later on. The positive attitudes are absorbed in the later life which will contribute in making him the best future citizen of our country. If children live with criticism, they learn to condemn.If children live with hostility, they learn to fight.If children live with fear, they learn to be apprehensive.If children live with pity, they learn to feel sorry for themselves. If children live with ridicule, they learn to feel shy. If children live with jealousy, they learn to feel envy. If children live with shame, they learn to feel guilty. If children live with encouragement, they learn confidence. If children live with tolerance, they learn patience.If children live with praise, they learn appreciation.If children live with acceptance, they learn to love.If children live with approval, they learn to like themselves. If children live with recognition, they learn it is good to have a goal. If children live with sharing, they learn generosity. If children live with honesty, they learn truthfulness. If children live with fairness, they learn justice. If children live with kindness and consideration, they learn respect.If children live with security, they learn to have faith in themselves and in those about them.If children live with friendliness, they learn the world is a nice place in which to live. \u2014 Children Learn What They Live By Dorothy Law Nolte, Ph.D.January-March 2012 51 Dr. Alok Agrawal * Everybody has some dreams in this mortal world, and not all dreams of an individual are always fulfilled. Our aim should be to endeavour constantly for the achievement of our goals or dreams. Members of any society, by and large, affect much to each other, but children are affected very much by their parents, teachers, peer groups and other society persons. This is because their brain is in developmental stage and all cognitive abilities, thought processes, control of emotions and finally shaping their personality occurs by virtue of their sweet and sour experiences from day to day life events. Role of parents in nurturing the dreams of children A child webs his dreams for the future when he is young adolescent and closest to his heart are his parents. Parents have a pivotal role in shaping a child's personality and traits, as he grows seeing their behaviour, conflicts, response to stress, attitude towards moral values and concept towards health etc. And his personality automatically starts taking shape of his role model. So the parents have to be extra cautious regarding their behaviour and morals in front of the child. Moreover, they should make the children their friends and not simply their obedient wards. Only then the child will be able to open up his mind before his parents. Most important is at the time of taking decisions regarding one's career. For most of the children, the decision is very perplexing, as it is influenced by the vision of the parents, suggestions from the teachers, peer groups and their own interests and ambitions. And this is the time when they need unbiased guidance. In our country most of the parents want their children to become what they had thought for them. In western countries, the parents hardly guide their children for their future, as they are influenced more by their peer groups. In my opinion, it has to be a balance of both. Parents must always remember that expecting their children to become what the parents had thought is like nurturing their own dreams rather than nurturing their children's dreams. Parents and children should sit together and discuss about children's future in detail considering all pros and cons. Once a goal has been determined, focused efforts should be made to achieve it. Parents of course, do help their children financially, but an emotional support throughout the journey is needed utmost. Dreams have the power to come true. Probably the most important lesson to the children is to make them realize this power and to urge them to see dreams. The parents should spare time to discover, analyse and support their children's dreams. This is a well studied fact that the children who see dreams are more Nurturing the Dreams of children * M.B.B.S., M.D., Chairman, School Managing Committee, The Renaissance Academy, Tilhar, Distt. Shahjahanpur, (U.P .)52 Nurturing the Dreams of Childrenlikely to think positive. The parents should be ready for some of the unusual dreams of their children also. They should encourage the children to adopt new roles in life, and to face and overcome challenges. The parents should not fit children as heroes in their world, but should be prepared to see the children in the role of heroes in the latter's own world. Role of teachers in nurturing the dreams of the children Teachers can sow the seeds of future dreams in the young minds. By virtue of being able in some special field or subject, they can also behave like a role model for their students. It is very essential for a teacher to read minds of students, knowing their abilities and interests and to become their counsellor, and not merely their subject teacher. Then only he earns deep respect of the students. Teachers should analyse the dreams of the students, should discuss these with their parents and try his best to give emotional support and academic knowledge to nurture their dreams. The role of teacher in the technology enabled world has also changed. With the vast reservoir of information now easily available in technology enabled solutions, a teacher is only 'one', and not 'the only' source of knowledge. He now is a facilitator of knowledge - helping learners ways to explore, discover and create knowledge, and not merely imparting a collection of facts. Role of schools in nurturing the dreams of the children The student of 21st century lives in an increasingly diverse and globalized community. To become successful in this competitive world, he needs to develop a new set of requisite skills. Basic literacy skills of reading and writing are no longer sufficient. Our children need to master those basic skills as well as read critically, write persuasively, think and reason logically, and solve complex problems quickly. A successful student must be adept at information finding, evaluating and applying new content. In order to thrive in the digital world, students will need digital age proficiencies. And this is where contemporary role of a school begins. Schools should also focus on all round development of children through extracurricular activities like games and sports, debates, seminars, projects and cultural activities etc. Practical lessons to develop life skills like self awareness, interpersonal relationship, empathy, effective communication, critical thinking, creative thinking, decision making, problem solving, coping with emotions and coping with stress should be undertaken in the school. Deliberations of selected speakers, successful professionals, achievers in different fields and noted social workers etc. give an impetus to the students to see dreams and to set their goals high. Counsellors by virtue of defining attitude and aptitude of the students counsel them regarding different aspects of their career, and this has become an important activity in good schools nowadays. Schools should ensure that the students should show exemplary balance in academics and co curricular January-March 2012 53 activities with good moral values like discipline, dedication, helpfulness, honesty, modesty, love for justice, sincerity, magnanimity and love for human being as an integral part of their personality. When the students will be equipped with these qualities, their dreams will also be just and productive to the society. Role of friends to nurture the dreams of the children Good friends are a real treasure and a lifelong companion. So, who can be better than a friend to preserve and strengthen a friend's dream? A friend can be the first person to know the secrets of a friend's heart. So sharing the dreams of the future with a friend is a wise step to do, and a friend should go a long way to support a friend to nurture his dreams in all possible ways. Role of society to nurture the dreams of the children By and large, society does affect the origin of dreams of children. A child is very much influenced by the society which surrounds him. For example, a child living in a criminal background is bound to develop negative traits and an antisocial personality. Nowadays, there are so many platforms for the children to take early decisions about their career, like many TV shows related to dance and music, reality shows, quiz shows etc. Since every child dreams differently, special efforts will have to be made to nurture his dreams. For Example, if the child wants to be a sportsperson, educationist, medical professional, wildlife lover, social activist, lawyer or so on, special attention and paraphernalia has to be developed. Pablo Picasso said \"There is an artist in every child, and we have to explore his art to make his talent most productive to the society and to himself.\" Dreams of underprivileged children can be quite different, like for child labour. And we should never forget our responsibility for this section of the society and few similar ones like the destitute, children of AIDS affected parents, or AIDS affected children, handicapped children etc. Dreams of a child labourer may be only to get good food and some money. But by way of imparting knowledge through education, we can encourage him to see bigger dreams. AIDS affected children may only dream of love and affection, destitute and handicapped may only dream of rehabilitation, and enabling them to earn with self esteem and not charity should be a healthy attitude of the society towards them. Thereby we see that it is the responsibility of the parents, teachers and the schools, friends and peer groups, and the different people of society by and large, to ensure that the children, being the future citizens, should be considered the most privileged section of the society. They should be provided proper environment and upbringing, so that they see bigger and appropriate dreams and should be supported in all possible ways to have their dreams nurtured.54 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenHelp Me Realise My Dream - A Child's Perspective Do I have any dream? Am I allowed to dream? Sorry, I wasn't allowed and you had an agenda of your own to force it through me. Allow me to dream and help me realise it, Let me explore and set me on course to realise myself. It is your dream that you have dreamt for me What you couldn't be yourself, you want me to be, Let me open my eyes and see the world around me,And then weave a dream for myself to make it come true. I am inquisitive and questions pop up in my mind very frequently, But I remain like a tamed tiger at the sight of a whip in the trainer's hands. Let me ask my questions and let me have my answers,Else admit that you don't have answers and wonder along with me. I'd like to socialise, I'd love to have all the fun and frolic And would like to work along with my friends, if needed.Don't you dare to make each one of us an island without bridges. To kill the collective spirit in us which comes naturally to us. I'd like to play, play till my every bone and muscle aches Enjoy the company of friends and the games that we play Let us not be shackled by chains and bounds of restrictions We don't want to be mechanical dolls that move around only when keyed in. I'm restless and out for mischief, for it's in my nature, But can be serious and forget my mischief if the situation so demands, Make a world for me to retain my natural instincts And engage myself in worthwhile tasks that interest me. Pray don't insult me, don't call me names, I have a name given by my parents, I have an identity. Be a friend, I can be friendlier than thouI take pats on my back but not the slaps. I want teachers whom I can adore and worship, I want adult friends to confide and trust, But not an insensitive and intemperate sickly soul,Masquerading and camouflaged in the garb of a teacher. The classrooms stifle us; the walls close us in and crowd us,The blackboard stares at us and teachers come in between for a while,Let's have classrooms without walls, and only windows if possible Think of open classrooms or virtual classrooms to suit the needs. Make me a self-learner, make me independent Equip me with all the mental, social, emotional, media skills Extend a helping hand and guide me to the world I shall bloom like a flower with myriad shades. K.L. are the most creative being on the earth. If only we could provide channels for that creativity to blossom\"................. Today's child faces major challenges and the greatest challenge of all is competition, whether it is in academics, in sports, in arts or in any other field. Each one of us, whether it be the parent or the teacher, is responsible for helping the child to face this situation and carve a niche for himself in his own individual mould with a spirit of healthy sportsmanship. Our mission is to empower the students to be in constant pursuit of knowledge by strengthening their intellectual capacities and seeking better ways to assimilate knowledge. Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation CCE is a very challenging step taken by CBSE. It is a step forward in improving the interest of students towards their school hours, marking an increase in their confidence due to the knowledge that they are being heard and that their co-curricular skills are also being appreciated. \"Continuous\" means marked by un-interrupted extension in space or time. Growing is a continuous process. If one starts observing a child, one can notice some or the other changes occurring regularly in a child. This continuous growth requires a continuous monitoring and observation and providing the required stimuli to sustain and flourish the same. And this is what the CCE targets to achieve as compared to the old system which judges a child on the basis of a three hour examination. With the introduction of the CCE system, we try to provide a platform to each and every child to showcase his/her overall personality and hidden talents. If a child finds difficulty in proving himself/herself in academics that does not mean it is a full stop. He/ she may have other talents and to bring out the same is the main objective of the CCE scheme. The entire school calendar has been revamped to aid students to adapt to the changes occuring due to the introduction of the CCE pattern. The general feeling of some students, parents and teachers with regards to the CCE pattern being a burden and adding to the workload is negated through the school calendar wherein CCA has been merged with the academic activities of the school. Various activities in the form of intra class, inter class, inter house competitions are held. In these we perform many of the activities as part of FA (Formative Assessment). The changes in the Parent Teacher Meeting pattern also aid in enhancing the implementation of the CCE. This major landmark development has been through inclusion of cultural programmes, subject wise exhibitions, work exhibition, co-curricular activities, stage What other Principals say...56 Nurturing the Dreams of Childrenperformances like plays, debate, musical presentation on every monthly P .T.M equipping all students to be self directed learners and over come stage fear. Parents are very often a part of the assessment routine also. Each and every child gets an opportunity to participate since the activities are spread out over the span of the entire academic session. Participation of students, which otherwise was restricted to the Annual Day celebration occurring only once in a year, has provided even the shy and reticent students to be transformed. Mrs. Jasmeet Kaur Principal Guru Harkrishan Public School, New Delhi Seating in the staff room with some of my colleagues during the recess gave birth to the discussion about a student of tenth class with a remark from one of the colleagues, \"Sir, what to do with Master M? He doesn't know anything. He is not passing in any of the subjects. Learning is not taking place in his case.\" The other echoed, \"kuchh bhi kar lo woh nahin sudhrega.\" These remarks gave me ample food for my thought. Being a senior faculty I tried to explain them what they meant to say was not coming out after their serious contemplation on the issue with the tried and tested remediation. But unfortunately the bell rang and all went to take their respective classes with the same routine way of delivering their best knowledge to the children lost in their classes. I, too, got up and called my class into the computer room to present them a lesson with power point. I wanted to talk to my friends on the topics but due to unexplained reasons I couldn't. Here I would like to discuss the first remark, \"Sir, what to do with Master M?\" This statement is an obvious indication of the frustration and the helplessness on the part of the teacher who is ignorant of the malady and the remedy. When one doesn't know how to deal with the students in his / her academic matters; there arise many significant questions- you are in the job but do you know your job? Y ou are a qualified subject teacher but do you know how to teach your subject? Y ou are a professional but are you a progressive professional? Y ou have learnt a lot to be the master but do you have still a burning desire to learn? Y ou wish the students to excel in the subject you teach but do you really put your wish to action? Y ou want your students to understand what you think but have you ever tried to think what they think and desire? The list of the questions is endless which we as teachers have to think and answer ourselves before relieving such hopeless remark. The second comment, \"He doesn't know anything\" is a very humdrum remark having serious implication. In a casual way we make such remarks without knowing the degrading effect on the performance and psyche of the students. Is it not the assessment of the personal performance of the teacher in particular? The teacher as an individual himself / herself makes self - assessment rather unknowingly. Is it really possible that the child doesn't know anything in general and anything in particular subject? The modern CCE (Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation) has the academic subjects as one aspect - including oral test, project, assignment/assessment giving the students many opportunities to secure marks and grades. Can Zero be the assessment marking of a student or an individual? If not, this remark seems funny in all its character. January-March 2012 57 \"He is not passing in any of the subjects. Learning is not taking place in his case.\" Here what my friend meant was just the content material of the subject taught which the student does not understand or more blatantly, the other way round, we are not able to make him/her understand. Here I remember one statement of the teacher who taught me during my B.Ed., \"... go well prepared in the classroom and before coming out ensure that your students understood what you have taught.\" At that time I took it as gurumantra and am still following his one liner giving me a satisfaction as a teacher who is successful in delivering straight to the mind and heart of the students what I want. The difference is what you wanted to become and what you are - teacher by choice, by chance or a forced one. The attitude and expectation of the teacher with zeal in your profession may show you the light in such situation. A professional must be a progressive professional with some action research and lo! you got the password to make your student understand and learn what you want. \"Kuchh bhi kar lo woh nahin sudhrega.\" This is not only a deprecating remark for the student enough to demotivate and deactivate the child but also your way to push him/her into a state where he/she will develop tension, frustration, and stress with other psychosomatic disorders requiring immediate counseling without which you must be ready to have a defiant student with juvenile delinquency. Does this statement not show the lament of a loser who has lost the battle without fighting? It seems we have majority of the soldiers who surrender without fighting the foe. The reasons may be many but the important one is that we are not well equipped, well trained and well - motivated. The school management, the employer and the teacher trainers have the tough challenge to equip, train, motivate and provide an ambiance to the teachers to change their outlook to be the real teachers to nurture the dream of the children... Kumar Thakur Principal KV Rangapahar Cantt, Dimapur, Nagaland The aim of education is the knowledge not of facts but of values. No lesson seem to be so deeply inculcated by the experience of life as that you never should trust experts. If you believe the doctors, nothing is wholesome: if you believe the theologians, nothing is innocent: if you believe the soldiers, nothing is safe. The dreams of the children are much simpler than we think.We make them complex and end up stating that they can't come true. Nothing is too wonderful to be true , if it is consistent with the law of nature. The child must be taught to experiment and know the consequences by doing. It is better to have fought and lost than never to have fought at all. They must be taught to dream with their eyes wide open and realize their dreams in reality. A child without a dream is just like a bird without wings. Dreams teach them to explore the unseen world. We shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started. There is no land inhabitable nor sea unnavigable, so why should a child be restricted to limit his vision ? We should tell them to have faith in themselves.58 Nurturing the Dreams of Children\"And I said to the man who stood at the gate of the year : 'give me a light that I tread safely into unknown,' and he replied \"Go out into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of God. That shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way.\" Even if in doing so they fail to realize their dreams, they will come up winners as they would have realized their potentials. They just won't fail, they find another way that doesn't work. They must be told the success mantra -\"NEVER QUIT'. The following lines will definitely be encouraging : When things go wrong as they sometimes will, When road you are trudging seems all uphill, When the fund are low and the debts are high , And you want to smile but you have to sigh When care is pressing you down a bit, Rest if you must, but don't you quit. Anurag Mathur Principal The Renaissance Academy, Tihar ( UP) Our kids are expected to be nurtured in such a way that when they grow, they should be able to apply their knowledge, skill, aptitude and art in the interest of the society. They must have sense of responsibility towards aged people, society and ultimately towards the nation. Parents and teachers together can put the best quality of the software in the minds of young scholars. We need to acquire knowledge in area of diversity as per the personal attitude and aptitude. Advances in technology should be used as a tool in the learning system to enhance the quality of learning. Dr. Anand Kumar Principal, Atomic Energy Central School, DAE Township, Kalpallam - 603 102 (T.N) 'He who finds diamonds must grapple in the mud and mire because diamonds are not polished stones, they are made.' - Henry B Wilson Working with young people is about finding diamonds. The work of a teacher is essentially about discovering potential and developing system and support to enable young people to shine. The mud and mire bit is self-January-March 2012 59 explanatory in the above quote that the task isn't easy. We cannot expect that gifted children will simply 'float to the top of the milk like cream'. High-Achieving Learning Environments involve students in a variety of learning activities that are challenging and aligned with learning goals, promote engaged learning, and draw on the culture, life experiences, and knowledge of all students. They allow students to discus, argue, and analyze issues and concepts. Students explore, solve problems, and construct knowledge rather than just memorizing it. Their work is authentic, engaging, and important, and it builds understanding from in-depth investigation. It helps children to see themselves as the engineers of their own dreams. It is a key vehicle in ensuring that when it comes to the goals, targets and dreams and aspirations of the student, nothing is taken for granted. Today many students lose interest in schools because it doesn't speak to their really lived experiences, it doesn't speak to their being the issues, their voices, it doesn't really answer questions that they have, and it doesn't really motivate them to learn. A person's imagination is one of their greatest gifts. Perhaps our young people are encouraged to feel that imagination and dreams are things you put in a toy box and send off to jumble sale. Dreaming is difficult when someone faces disappointments in life. The lives of young people are far more complex that we can imagine, and their innate can be stunted by their peers, local community, family or even their ability itself. So many young people have forgotten how to dream and to aspire, or worse, never known how to dream. John Dewey has rightly said, \"you cannot become a great teacher unless you are able to illustrate from the experiences of your students what it is you want them to understand exactly'. Consequently we need to speak the language of students. We have to know something about their history. We've got to be able to illustrate it in a way that they understand.\" As Teachers, we are entrusted with the responsibility of providing opportunities for our children to grow and develop on their path. We are mandated to seek out ways to encourage them to follow their dreams. It's the time to understand that each child is unique. Each child learns a little differently from the next, has different interests, and will learn at a different pace. Children learn best when they feel secure, are well- nourished, and are having fun. Keeping in mind that \"the focus of learning is in the learner and the goal of learning is the construction of meeting by the student\" teachers instruction should emphasize on depth of learning rather than breadth of learning. Alice Rajan Vice Principal Ashoka Hall School, Jabalpur It's not what is poured into a student, but what is planted. \u2014 Linda Conway60 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenDreams are today's answers to tomorrow's questions!!!! In my years of teaching I have seen the joy and delight on face of young kids who are enchanted by life full of imagination and courage, open and trusting and dare to dream. Yet many children of today ceased to dream in society which values practicality. This saddens me..... Dreams are fuels that spirit craves. It is important to dream for each one of us because dreams permit each and everyone of us to be quietly and safely insane. As an educator it is pertinent to make a difference in the life of children. Making a difference to me is not just equipping the young minds with information and skills but making a difference to me is about believing in the dreams of children and empowering them to realise their dreams. The role of a teacher is significant because a child who has a dream may not have the ability to explore the dream or the full capacity to express that is why an adult must be involved. It is vital to nurture them and encourage them to grow and thrive else they will perish. Wendy Betterni has suggested some ways to keep the dreams alive and make them thrive. The most important is to feed the dreams of children with love and support them in treating their dreams like a precious creation. Kids must be given a healthy snack of happy encouragement by persuading them to visualise the outcome of their dreams and infuse the vision with emotion. Kids must be informed to guard their dreams from negativity. If others put the dreams down, the absolute worst thing is to agree with them. It is important to honour our dreams because our dreams can come true, if we have courage to pursue them. Children must be cautioned to prune their dreams so as to re-evaluate the dreams and goals because they do change with time. Time has proven to be an instrumental tool in knocking out the hesitation, inhibition and fear and provided opportunity to feel capable. Once we are successful in making the dream begin to grow in a young soul, it will gradually take shape; it will expand and fill the space provided. Last but not the least, it is kids dream to dream and it is our duty to encourage and nurture their dream. Amita Tripathi PGT, Life Sciences Rukmini Devi Public School, Pitampura A child is like a sapling in the hands of a teacher, whose sole duty is to nurture and foster it with utmost love and care, always keeping in mind that the same child is going to look at her as a role-model. A teacher not only passes on the subject knowledge to a student, but also a set of values and ethics which would help in shaping that child's personality and further, his destiny.What other teachers say...January-March 2012 61 The toil put in by a teacher is a gigantic and continuous process, wherein the seeds sown in a day bear fruits over a period of years. Embarking on a journey from the fairy tales to the lectures, the guide and the guided need to bond in such a way that they both reach the pinnacles of success in their respective endeavour. In order to achieve that, the understanding of the learner's need and moulding oneself accordingly takes precedence over everything else for the teacher. There are various roles played by a teacher, some of which are learning about the students' interests, planning and organizing classroom activities, assessing the students' performance, encouraging them to improve, but above all respecting them for what they are. Special care should be taken to let the young minds under one's guidance explore, learn, unlearn and re-learn. Poonam Vohra PGT English Rukmini Devi Public School, Pitampura Every child is born with an inborn talent often with multiple abilities. As he/she grows, these talents manifest themselves in various forms which often go unnoticed. As the child grows and is exposed more and more to his surroundings he/she develops interest towards certain fields. But if the child finds the environment not at all conducive for the realization of his/her dreams, the child's dreams are shattered and the child is forced to pursue something to fulfill the dreams of his/her parents. As a result the child grows into an unhappy creature throughout his /her life doing some work to make a living without deriving any joy or contentment. The parents have a role to play in enabling the children to realize their dreams. They should not set their preconceived goals before their children but they should see that the child sets goals for himself and the parents should make every effort, in consultation with the teachers, to enable the child to realize his/her dreams. The onus is on the teacher to enable the child to dream big and also to help them realize their dreams. The teacher should make every effort to identify the talents of the children. Students exhibit these talents only when variety of curricular and co-curricular activities are effectively organized. Once the talents are identified teacher has to provide the students the expert guidance and carefully nurture their talents. The revised Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation gives ample scope for the children to come out with their talents. Teacher should provide necessary help to hone the skills by providing all the resources available in the school. The friendly demeanor of the teachers, review and reorganization of teaching practices and adopting innovative practices will go a long way in enabling the children not only to dream big but also to realize their dreams. of ChildrenMy curiosity to know what stream students would take up after passing class X, was slightly raised when my daughter herself was faced with this dilemma of making a choice of subjects. I kept instilling in her that this was an important decision which would map out her future and where she wanted to see herself. The constant obsession, like all parents, made me share my anxiety with other students of my class. In the varied responses, I discovered that apart from some , who with conviction knew what they wanted to do,there were some in whom the conviction stemmed from an underlying dream which they had been so endearingly nurturing. In my queries was a revelation of sorts - a learning for me and a window to life. A student, after informing that she wished to take up science with biology as she wished to pursue a career in medicine and wanted to become a neurosurgeon, spontaneously began telling that she intended to work in the villages and remote areas. In a single breath, she said that the sight of polio stricken children and others suffering from different ailments had impacted her to an extent that she wanted to take up this undaunting task of working for their betterment and, of course, gaining wider experience at the same time. This left me somewhat baffled! We sometimes feel that values, specially in today's generation,are fading away, feelings and sentiments giving way to materialism and selfishness -- allured by the glamourous and glitzy world where money spells magic! Such thoughts came as a gleam of light in a dark dungeon. I listened with amazement at her passionate dream, full of noble thoughts and my appraisal of her led to a few others sharing their dreams and aspirations which touched me in different ways. It dawned upon me that such dreams have to be treasured and nurtured. My diminishing faith also got a fresh lease of life and I felt that these children with lofty dreams need to be supported and motivated so that they do not waver or give up in the middle of the long road which would be strewn with both joy and bitterness. After all, we as teachers, are also facilitators to help them realise their dreams-- at least through palpable words of encouragement and appreciation of the very fact that they have dreams to dream...... Neeta Mathur TGT English Apeejay School, Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi What is a dream? By definition it is a series of images or ideas occurring involuntary in the mind during certain stages of sleep. But what I feel is that we don't have to be asleep to Dream. According to me by just imagining something happening is a kind of Dream.January-March 2012 63 We normally think that Dreams are- just imagination but the truth is, Dream can be turned into reality. Let them think, let them imagine, let them plan, let them channelize their thoughts.One of the most important lesson parents can impart to their children is helping them to realize the wonderful power of Dreams and their inherent potential of coming true. We can make a conscious effort to nurture their goals and Dream. We have to encourage the children to use phrases such as 'I Can', 'I Will' instead of 'I Can't' so that they can set their goal and then help them to break their goal down into manageable and achievable steps, celebrate successes and milestones along the way, help them to learn from mistakes, convey to them that you have every confidence that they will achieve everything they set themselves to achieving. The idea is to make the child think and speak positive. We have to help the children to nurture positive thoughts and Dreams, Dreams that will propel him/ her to reach for goals. As a Teacher I always encourage a child to think positive.Positive thinking will encourage the children to achieve goals. Always encourage kids by telling them that everything is possible if they are determined and focused. Shruti Verma TGT, Computer Science Kathuria Public School, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi In my years of teaching, I've learned that young children are full of imagination and courage. In their world, the sky is the limit. Yet, many children of today ceased to dream in our society, which values practicality. This saddens me. When a dream is born in the heart, I believe it should be nurtured, explored and expounded on by both elders and the child. Without exploration, the dream cannot be known or realized. A child who has a dream may not have the ability to explore the dream, or even the full capacity to express their desire, that is why an adult must be involved. When our children express and interest in something we watch and wait. When we see them working towards a goal, investing their time and energy to learn, we step beside them and offer assistance when needed. It is their dream, but our job is to provide support. It is our job to teach skills, or find teachers, for them. I value the dreams of my children. I value my vocation because it gives me the power to nurture these dreams.64 Nurturing the Dreams of ChildrenMaking a difference, to me, is not just about equipping the children with skills and knowledge. Making a difference, to me, is about believing in the children's dreams and empowering them to realize those dreams and becoming who they want to be. I want to make a difference by teaching with love and laughter and paying attention to the little voices in the hearts. I want to make a difference in the lives of the children that cross the path - the way my teachers made a difference in me. Our children are the keepers of their dreams. And we, their teachers, are their guiding light. Encouraging me, even when they didn't understand my passion, was one of the greatest gifts my teachers gave me. It is a gift all children need. Ranjeeta Rani TGT Science Gyan Mandir Public School, Naraina Vihar \"The Path from Dream to Success does Exist. May You Have the Vision to Find it, The Courage to Get Onto it\" -Kalpana Chawla Creating nurturing environment for our children means meeting their physical, psychological and emotional survival needs. Creating environment in which children can thrive means consciously creating warm, loving, sensory rich environments where their physical, emotional and spiritual needs are recognized, honored and met by their family and their community. It is true that children \"live what they learn\". Children absorb and imitate what they experience in their environment. Their exterior environment molds their interior environment. Just as area is a product of length times width, human beings are a product of nature times nurture. The potential children are born with will be limited by or nurtured by their environment. A nurturing environment is one that gives children the security and opportunity to discover themselves and their world. Rahul Singh Meharu Asst. Teacher Seth Nand Lal Dhanuka, Harsh Convent School, Suratgarh (Raj) There are times when young minds answer our hypocrises in a delightful manner and we are stunned by the magic of childhood. The most common query on your first acquaintance with a child- what do you want to be? A Rockstar - sufficient to bring 1000 watt shock to most of the parents. Children are internally fascinated by their dreams, weaving a tangled web, away from the reality of practical world which is not touching their wonderlands. Here the parents and teachers play a vital role by peeping into the heart of children what they want to be. Therefore for a dream to transform into reality, the child's ability should be January-March 2012 65 judged at a right age and due focus should be given to the capability on the path of education manifesto to install, \"hot on the heels of promising career-earning with dignity and to weed out dead wood at an early stage\". The state of art in education which is a basic right and food for future should be such that you can count on your child. So gone are the days of becoming bookworms. Nowadays, if you want your kids to feel rejuvenated, engaged and at their creative best. A clear aim and direction according to the ability of child should be judged. The role of teachers and parents should be blend in such a way where an effective way for rapid learning can be done by best practices, new concepts and curriculum ( to achieve future challenges). Nothing is impossible, love them, care them, prepare them for the defeats they will meet on the path - fill them with a greater sense of euphoria and confidence. Never stop dreaming ................... Anuradha Gupta Maharaja Agarsain Public School, Ashok Vihar As an educator or parents our work is to discover potential and develop systems and support to enable children to shine. Recognizing children's unique personality styles can help adults to better understand children and to plan activities that children can learn from and enjoy. As an educator ,our challenge is to identify a childs intelligence and help each to build upon those. Following steps have to be followed to identify childs strength and abilities and nurture. 1. Observation -Identify the interest, intelligences, and abilities of the child by considering the theories of multiple intelligences. \"Gardner\" says that there are various intelligences like- Verbal linguistic intelligence Logical intelligence Musical intelligence Visual -spatial Intrapersonal InterpersonalEach child has a mix of these intelligences. To nurture child's talent effectively ,carefully watch how they react to various learning opportunies. It brings into focus what they want to achieve.66 Nurturing the Dreams of Children Performing exceptionally well or asking Questions of a subject or activity ,indicates that child has a inherent quality to out perform others. What ever be the talent of the child, an eye to identify and and interest to develop must be there. 2. Motivation - We need to inspire the child towards greatness, goodness, and encourage him/her to nurture dreams and achieve goals. Instill a feeling of competence in the child by acknowledging small successes. Share good thoughts and inspirational quotes. Stimulate self confidence and help release their latent talent. 3. Environment - Creating a nurturing and secure environment encourages intuitive abilities in a child. A child who feels threatened by their environment cannot pay attention to his own inner reality. The climate of the school and home must be adaptive enough to deal with the needs in a quite distinct way. Gentle, non-invasion coaching is a must, from the earlist age possible. 4. Stimulate creativity - Persons's imagination is one of the greatest gifts. To see the tremendous potential behind their somewhat spiked and icy veneer, provide them the atmosphere where creativity is recognized and respected. The diamond industry we need to create must be multi faced. We need to pick up our tools in a collaborative way and involve skills and expertise of a number of key players from teachers to mentors who should form a series of nets between the polished phase and the muddy mire. This is perhaps the only way that we ensure that diamonds we unearth really are forever. Anju Daksh DAV Public School, Sahibabad. As a teacher one has to reach out to the child. We need to remember that every child who comes to us has tremendous potential and it is entirely on a teacher how he taps it out and guides it on the right path. Here the word of caution is, that we do not need to do anything but just guide him and let him grow in his own natural way. It is similar to what a gardener does. He does not help the plant to grow but only ensures, that, during the process of growth, it faces no hindrances and so he puts a protective fence around it and, that it gets its nutrition at the right time. The plant grows by itself. Exactly what a teacher has to do. Ensure that no negativity breeds in the child during the learning process, and, let the child learn and grow on his own, and it is then, that one realizes, that teaching is not an easy task. As a teacher, one affects eternity. It is not a time bound job. He has to be available to his children whenever they need him. Its in fact 24x7x365 job, and all the time the teacher has to be sensitive, caring and understanding to the needs of those young minds who turn to him at odd hours for his guidance. This role of the teacher can never be measured in terms of money. January-March 2012 67 Besides, the school too, needs to realize this role of a teacher and give the required space to work with his kids. Its only then that the education would be effective and teaching learning process, fruitful. Teaching does not confine to mere books, but stretches far beyond it, to encompass, the child and his surroundings. It is, infact, relating it to his real life situations. Unless a teacher has the capability to enable the child to relate the subject matter to his surroundings and show him the practical utility of the topic, teaching would remain a drab routine. We need to remember that teaching is an extremely complicated art, where, the teacher deals with sensitive subtle minds. So caution needs to be taken during the selection of teachers. A teacher should not be selected merely on basis of his qualification, but on basis of his attitude towards his profession and his approach and sensitivity towards the children. It is absolutely essential that a teacher comes down to the level of the child during his interactions and not cram him up with his idealistic and high flying thoughts which a child is unable to grasp or comprehend. This induction of thoughts should be a slow but gradual process in which the sensitive minds are carefully moulded. Vivekananda rightly observed, \"Education is not the amount of information that is put into your brains and runs riot there, undigested all your life. Real education is that which enables one to stand on one's own legs\". The education which does not help the common mass of people to equip themselves for the struggle of life is it worth its name? Remember- No one was ever really taught by another; each of us has to teach himself. The external teacher offers only the suggestion which rouses the internal teacher to work to understand things. So let all of us, who are a part of this noble profession, be sensitive, creative and understanding to the needs of the children and that, is the only way, to gather shine on \"the rolling stone.\" Amit Ghosh Parvati Radhakishen Fomra School (Birla School), Marthura The system of schooling cannot remain static anymore. The school endeavor to prepare children for a world which is becoming more and more complex by the day. The emphasis should be on all round development through a process of probing, questioning and analyzing. The schools should prepare the students to maintain the zeal and continue to serve the people of the community with the knowledge they have acquired. Children should be moulded into confident and compassionate individuals, giving them the edge to span the horizon into a flair and confidence. The students should recognize that this is a family oriented school community where parents and faculty work together for their benefit. Learning amidst fun and frolic is the mantra of Pre-school education today. The Kindergarten is the stepping stone into the world of What, When, Where, Who, Why... Recover Soto Asst. Teacher Tojo Little Flower Girl School, Basar, dgkor gS & If we read, we forget ! If we see, we remember and if we do, we understand ! child is like a ball of clay, which needs to be moulded and shaped; and we teachers at school and parents at home, play the role of a sculptor, who according to his/her own way will mould the ball of clay to give it a shape as per his/her ideas. Here lies the problem; we never think that even a child has an inherent potential, own way of thinking, own ideas, and own imaginations. Every now and then, we try to overburden them with our ideas and our wishes. Do we really give them time to \"Nurture their own dreams?\", \"Have we ever thought of giving wings to their dreams, so that they can fly in their dreamland?\". It's high time that we teachers should start doing it. A child may not excel in all fields, but s/he may excel in a particular field-be it sports, music, drawing, etc. So, why not arrange such activities for them where they will themselves act as sculptors and give shape to their own imaginations? Arranging co-curricular activities in schools is one of the best ways to give a chance to the future generations of our country to show their caliber, in their own fields of excellence. Various competitions, exhibitions, sports events, quizzes are some of the opportunities which we can give to our children, just to bring out their talents, or better to say, to nurture their dreams. When a child is at school, s/he never misses his/her mother, because the teachers are around them, who care for them, who scold them and also love them. Apart from this motherly touch, if we can arrange activities keeping their talents in mind, then our tiny tots at school will get a chance to work upon constructive thoughts, positive aspirations and great dreams, and one day they will bloom into colourful flowers, and spread their sweet fragrance in each and every corner of the world. The care a sapling needs, the same care a child needs. When the tender sapling grows up, it gives us the fruits of our endeavor, in the same way our students will also give us the fruits of our hard work, our trust in them, our faith and belief in them.

Rain Water Harvesting System EMM AAR International School, Jalandhar Water, the Hub of Life. Water is its mater and matrix, mother and medium.Water is the most extraordinary substance!Practically all its properties are anomalous, which enabled life to use it as building material for its machinery.Life is water dancing to the tune of solids. - Albert Szent-Gyorgyi (1972) Many people in authority are of the opinion that in case the world sees another world war, it would be for the scarce and most important resource called WATER. Water is a very precious resource and it needs to be understood by us all, especially the children as they are actually going to face this serious issue by the time they grow up.January-March 2012 119 In case the entire world does not take action to meet this challenge head on, there are going to be severe water shortage related problems worldwide. \"Water water everywhere - not a drop to drink\" is likely to become a reality if we continue to waste this precious resource. We sincerely believe recycling of water and preservation of water resources needs to be taught from school level. At school level our belief that a student best remembers what he/ she has done with his/ her hands prompted us to start Rain Water Harvesting within the school. Thinkers all over the world suggest this is as one of the best methods in order to solve the problem. Students attend a class on the Rain Water harvesting project in the school. The school has two wells within the school premises which are well covered and have proper windows and filters for water to flow into the bore wells. The layout of these has been planned by qualified engineers taking into account the flow of rain water within the school grounds. The water is now being retained rather than being allowed to flow away into a drain, as happened earlier.All students have been exposed to this methodology and the school received excellent coverage in the local press as well. Parents are impressed with this sudden concern in their children to conserve water even at their homes. We would have done our job if the entire strength of the school grows up to make even one such project within their homes/ organisations that they will serve in, in the future.

It also increases bone density and is considered to be the best aerobic exercise for physical conditioning of the heart and lungs. The students during one of the sessions of physical education Health run is followed by Meditation with 'OM' gunjan which helps them to improve in three fields, i.e., Pratyahara or withdrawal of the mind from the outer objects or attention to their memory, Dharana - patience and Dhyana, i.e., concentration.

Unkeep of Heritage Monument New Millennium School, DPS Bahrain Today, in India and many countries there are many tourists attraction. In these past 2 decades, all the tourists attraction have become worst. The tourists who come to visit these attractions are not so disciplined. They visit and scrible all the attractions by writing their names use to write the place on. The Heritage Monument Taj Mahal is one such example. Over the past 2 decades, India's most famous tourist attraction Taj Mahal located in Agra has become a matter of concern. Experts have warned that pollutants in air are discolouring its white mouble. So, it is not only living organisms that get affected by polluted air but non-living things liks buildings, monuments 146 Nurturing the Dreams of Childrenand statues also get affected. The industries located in and around Agra like rubber processing, automobile, chemicals and especially the Mathura oil refinery have been responsible for producing pollutants like sulphur dioxide and nitogen dioxide. These gases react with the water vapour present in the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid and nifecic acid. The acids drop down with rain, making the rain acidic. This is called as acid rain. Acid rain corrodes the marble of the monument. The phenomenon is also called \"Marble Cancer\". Suspended portiwlate matter, such as the soot partides enitted by mathura oil refinery, has contributed towards the yellowing of the marble. The Supreme Court has taken several steps to save the Taj. It has ordered inovestiaries to switch to cleaner fuels like CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) and LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas). Moreover, the automobile should switch over to unleaded petrol in the Taj Zone. So, we people and other tourists stop scriiling the heritage monuments located in all India.

With the Prime Minister... An unforgettable experience... Indian School-Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania The value of being at home is realized only when you are away from home. For us Indians here in Tanzania on the eastern coast of Africa, any moment to cherish and feel Indian is like being back to our motherland. It was one such experience we cherished when our beloved Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh Came to Tanzania on a three day state visit. It was a moment of pride and joy for all of us Indians here in Tanzania. More particularly, for the students of Indian School-Dar es Salaam who had the rare privilege of welcoming and meeting the Prime Minister of India at the Kilimanjaro Hotel here in Dar es Salaam. Indian School-Dar es Salaam is a pioneer institute and the only school in Tanzania affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Delhi, India. The school has a history of more than three decades to its credit. The school was established to provide quality education to the wards of the Indian expatriates. The School is under a Board of Trustees headed by His Excellency, the High Commissioner of India to Tanzania, as the Chairman. indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh at indian School-Dar es Salaam - a proud moment for school The Prime Minister of India and the President of the Republic of Tanzania, along with their spouses and other dignitaries and delegates, were welcomed by Principal, Vice-Principal, staff and students of Indian School. The dignitaries were welcomed waving the Indian Tricolour on one side and the Tanzanian National Flag on the other and singing 'Sare Jahan se Achha'. It indeed was a moment of pride and patriotism. The Prime Minister was taken by surprise by the warm and patriotic welcome accorded to him and the other dignitaries at the hotel by us, as he was given an official welcome by the Government of Tanzania at the airport on his arrival. He really cherished every word of the patriotic song sung by the students in a foreign land. So much so, Dr. Manmohan Singh desired to meet the students of Indian School and to listen again to the song 'Sare Jahan se Achha' before his departure. The message was conveyed to us on the previous day of his January-March 2012 165 departure, by His Excellency, the High Commissioner of India to Tanzania, Sri. K. V. Bhagirat. Our joy found no bounds. The children spent a sleepless night, dreaming of meeting the Prime Minister again the next morning. The next morning, when we met Dr. Manmohan Singh, he greeted the children with a soft smile and shook hands with them. His gestures of love, affection and appreciation brought much joy and contentment to our children. So much so that some children in their innocence said, \"we will not wash our hands now, we've touched the Prime Minister.\" How else could they have expressed their joy? This day goes down in the annals of the history of Indian School-Dar es Salaam, and in the life history of all the staffs and students who were able to meet the Prime Minister, in golden letters. Nurturing the dreams of children Indira Ideal Sr. Sec. School, Janakpuri 'Indira Ideal Sr.Sec. School, Janakpuri' believes strongly in providing its students a platform to express their creativity and helps in 'Nurturing the dreams of children' through multifarious activities and multi pronged approach towards academics which aids our students to bloom like flowers and spread their fragrance in the society. Keeping in line with the guidelines formulated by CBSE, we have incorporated and implemented various Quality Initiatives in our school which are multidimensional and inspire the students to make them more dynamic, vibrant and energetic in their performances. First and foremost, we motivate all our students to appear for the 'Students Global Aptitude Index' - SGAI' 2012: an activity promoted by CBSE to provide the students an insight into their aptitude and interest at the grassroot level; prepare them to decide their choice of subjects and thus encourage and inspire them on their career plan in a realistic and effective manner. Students participating in the chess competition We also conducted various indoor games during our 'Sports Week' which brought forth interesting facts. Even the students who are usually not interested in mathematics showed immense enthusiasm in solving 'Sudoku Quiz' and 'Logical Reasoning Skills' which were a part of the 'Mathematics Quiz'. Students who were hesitant to play and exercise were passionate in playing indoor games like Chess and Carrom. Our school is also an active member of the 'GLOBE Program'. Our GLOBE students take the Atmosphere readings pertaining to Clouds, Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature and Current Temperature and post them on the GLOBE site regularly which provides new insights to strengthen education and is a lasting contribution towards the study of environment. This Program has enabled the students to engage in a collaborative and a scientific enquiry into the world around them.166 Nurturing the Dreams of Children The students undergoing nature study under the GLoBe programme \"You only learn By Doing\" St. Mark's Sr. Sec. Public School, Janakpuri Science is a fascinating subject. It integrates all spheres of life and ignites the young generation's capacity to transform their vast intellect potential into productive ventures. In school, teaching and learning science can be fun and interesting when topics are taught in an interactive and innovative manner. In its endeavor to bring the best ideas across St. Mark's Sr. Sec. Public School, Janakpuri hosted a hands-on Electronics and Technology Program powered by FPS that introduced the teachers who in turn will familiarize the students to \"The World of Electrons\". In this workshop the participants were exposed to an innovative tool which could be utilized in classroom teaching. With this new tool the students can understand difficult concepts e.g. Electrostatics and Semi Conductors in physics in the class with ease. Going by the mantra of 'You Only Learn By Doing', the students were also able to test scientific concepts practically through implementation on hardware by using high-quality, content-rich DIY (Do It Yourself ) hardware kits. Teachers attending the electronic and Technology Programme at St. Mark's Sr. Sec. Public School The workshop was aptly inaugurated by presenting of electronic bouquet to Mr. Suraj Prakash. Mr. Gurpawan Mand, CEO, Cool Junk Technology was the Resource Person. He with his team conducted this introductory workshop in an effective manner. The initiative to host this workshop for physicists was taken by Ms. Alka Kher, Vice Principal, as she feels that by introducing such a wonderful tool, science students would no longer have Physics phobia and would be able to imagine, explore and experiment scientific concepts with ease. ''Each One Teach One\", Rukmini Devi Public School Rukmini Devi Public School believes in the motto that the young generation today has the power that can bring about large scale positive change in the world. Teaching less privileged children is one such powerful act which can go a long way in removing illiteracy and solving many other problems in India. The Street Play, ''Each One Teach One, Let's Score an A+ in India's Report Card\" organized by the school at Dilli Haat, INA, was an initiative that brought January-March 2012 167 together children in need of education and people who can contribute a little time towards teaching them. It was based on one simple principle: \"If you have the desire to teach, we will put you in touch with children who are willing to learn\". Highlighting the importance of 'Right To Education', the play was an attempt to sensitize all to do something special for the thousands of innocent hearts living on the streets twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week with no parental or adult care or supervision. The young Rukminians strongly conveyed the message that we all should shoulder the responsibility to educate the poor and deprived children to help them improve their lives and become self-sufficient citizens of India. It was indeed a great effort by these students to step forward and motivate people to join hands together and make them realize the importance of education.

Dear Principal,Happy New Year Greetings for 2012! As we step into 2012, we look back at the past year with some satisfaction and look forward to the current year with hope, enthusiasm and zest to achieve the unfinished work and move forward to support ongoing projects. We need to strengthen the implementation of School Based Assessment and CCE scheme and consolidate the mentoring work. We have received huge support from schools and massive participation whether in the promotion of Indian Heritage Education, celebration of Heritage Day or National Education Day or introduction of Integrity Clubs. The schools have done the CBSE proud. Students have participated in huge numbers in the School Global Aptitude Index (SGAI) and the Proficiency test. The following are some of the areas that we need to focus on. 1. Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation The Teacher's Manual for Classes VI - VIII and Revised Teacher's Manual for Classes IX and X are available in the CBSE store as well as at all Eight Regional Offices. The Teacher's Manual for Classes I - V will also be available for the next session. In interactions with teachers, an effort has been made by the Board to provide the Teacher's Manuals along with Formative Assessment Manuals at the venue at which CBSE CircularsJanuary-March 2012 171 the workshop is being held. Schools are once again advised that teachers should use these Manuals and familiarise themselves with the guidelines provided in them. 2. Monitoring and Mentoring The Board has increased the number of mentors to 3000 and currently they are involved in the exercise of mentoring 3 to 4 schools in the neighbourhood. The Board has also decided to institutionalize the Mentor Awards from this session onwards. 3. Empowerment Programmes for Principals In its efforts to create excellence and enhance the quality of Heads of institutes, the Board has been carrying on with its Leadership Programmes in Effective School Management in collaboration with prestigious management schools as well as institutes which have expertise in the area. In this connection, the Board has also extended these programmes to organizations from overseas so that Principals in India can have wider exposure. 4. Capacity Building of Teachers The Board has empanelled a number of agencies after due process for creating awareness and orienting teachers in CCE. This programme is being done in the interactive as well as online mode. The trainings in the areas of CCE, Life Skills, Health and Wellness, Formative Assessment and Physical Education Cards (PEC) will continue in 2012 as well. 5. Role of Teacher It is requested that the Heads continuously interact with the teachers and discuss with them about changed role of teachers in view of the implementation of CCE. The established notion that teachers have to do everything in terms of teacher talk, asking questions and often times answering them before students can think, needs to be reviewed. This mindset is also responsible for some teachers feeling over-burdened with introduction of reforms. The teacher has to appreciate that her role is now more as collaborator and facilitator rather than instructor. 6. National School Sanitation Initiative The CBSE in collaboration with the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) and GIZ (formerly known as GTZ) has introduced the 'National School Sanitation Initiative' with the aim to inculcate good sanitation habits among the school children in order to inspire, acquaint and celebrate excellence towards School Sanitation at the National Level. In order to create awareness about the 'National School Sanitation Initiative', training programmes are proposed to be conducted pan India. 7. Health and Wellness Clubs For promotion of holistic development, the Board advised schools to set up Health and Wellness Clubs in 172 Nurturing the Dreams of Children 2005 and four Health Manuals were prepared. The Revised Health Manuals which are priced documents are available from the Publication Store, Regional Office, Delhi, PS 1-2, Institutional Area, I.P . Extension, Patparganj, Delhi - 110092 and all other Regional Offices of the Board. It is in this context that the schools should set aside at least two periods in a fortnight for participation of students in Health and Wellness Clubs, Eco Clubs, Science Clubs, Dramatics Clubs etc. 8. Inclusion of Child Rights Issues Further to the CBSE's Circular Nos. 16, 18 and 24 in 2009, the Board would like to once again request schools to remember that schools are ideological institutions and not factories. They must treat children as sensitive individuals who need to be protected at any cost. The schools need to be aware of the impressionable nature of minds of school children and must ensure that all students, irrespective of their differences in physical, social, economic status or by their being differently abled are dealt with in a dignified manner. Adolescents are vulnerable to many influences and must be empowered to take informed decisions. No school under the guise of enforcing discipline should mistreat any student or parent. Moreover schools should desist from exploiting parents by opening book shops or uniform centers which prescribe branded accessories, shoes etc. at inflated costs. This also amounts to discrimination between children. Schools are again advised to comply with bus security norms prescribed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, as well as other norms prescribed by the local authorities. 9. 18th National Annual Sahodaya Conference The 18th National Annual Sahodaya Conference was held at Chennai on the theme \"Quality Improvements in Schools\" and the resolution of the conference was : 'Quality Improvements in Schools' can be achieved through focusing on child centered education and personalized learning based on the needs, interests and aptitudes of the learner. Implementation of reforms and Right to Free and Compulsory Education must be done in a mission mode. Teacher quality is central to excellence in schools and continuous development of teachers must continue including in house development and collaboration. Quality in schools can be greatly enhanced through the process of self reflection and external validation and accreditation. Vocational education need to be strengthened across all states. Mentoring networks need to be Board based with a wider ambit. One of the recommendations of the conference was that schools should continue to network through the agency of communities of practice and the Sahodaya movement provides an excellent platform. The project of networking of Sahodaya school complexes must continue. Schools and Sahodaya need to continue to use the logo - slogan and song on CCE in all their correspondence with parents and other stakeholders as well as on their website. 10. Introduction of new subjects Mass Media Studies and Mass Media Production is one of the subjects which has been piloted in schools in Delhi, Mumbai and Pune in the Academic as well as in the Vocational areas. It will now be open to all schools from the session 2012 - 2013 for Class XI.January-March 2012 173 This is to also inform schools that the Board has replaced the hands on practical component in Physics, Chemistry and Biology for Classes XI and XII for visually impaired students with Multiple Choice Questions based on these Practicals. This will come into effect in the current session for Class XI and 2012 - 2013 for Class XII. 11. Innovation in Schools - CBSE Project The Board will encourage innovation by bringing together the best practices in education within schools affiliated to CBSE. A circular to this effect will soon be uploaded and schools and organizations are encouraged to respond in the relevant area. 12. Ensuring Quality Parameters The recent educational reforms have been implemented with the objective of providing holistic development of students. Besides academics, this includes acquisition of life skills, positive attitude and sound value system through active participation of students in variety of learning experiences organized by the schools. However, special care may be taken by schools that every student be helped to maximize his/her potential for academic brilliance. The aspiration of excellence in academic pursuits and active participation in creative contours should go hand-in-hand. All parents may also be sensitized towards this vision of the Board. 13. Involvement of Parents Heads are well aware about need and benefits of involvement of Parents in the affairs of the schools. Purposeful involvement of Parents has now been made more feasible after introduction of CCE, wherein each and every parent irrespective of socio-economic status can find an area of his / her interest for contributing to the school, Heads of schools are advised to have continuous interaction with the Parents and utilize the vast resource of parent interactions for quality enhancement of schools. 14. Call Centre for Schools In view of demand received from the stakeholders about frequent two way communication with the Board, it has been decided to establish a call centre at the Board. This is likely to be made operational from 15th February, 2012. Please keep on referring to the CBSE's website about call centre numbers. 15. Other instructions The Board is involved in multiple programmes in Academic as well as in Vocational Areas. It has also conducted the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET) last year and the second CTET will be held on 29th January, 2012. We are in constant touch with all our stake holders and receive regular feed back both in formal and informal ways. The `Interact with Chairman' facility is currently updated with all queries which have been responded to promptly. My request to all of you is to find time to visit the CBSE website as frequently as possible but definitely within a fortnight to provide yourself with the latest information that we would like to share with you. I 174 Nurturing the Dreams of Children take this opportunity to seek your collaboration in all our endeavours so that we mutually bring together a better world of education synergised with energy and positive learning for the children. Wishing you the very best in the year ahead so that we can take up fresh challenges and learn from our previous experience to march ahead with even greater wisdom.

Harmony with nature forms the root of our social and cultural values and attitudes. The rapid speed at which species are becoming extinct, due to human activities, emphasizes the need for continuous focus on Environment to ensure that the 'future global children' inherit a healthy Earth. In order to develop awareness, sensitivity and a positive proactive attitude about environment, many curricular and co curricular activities are being taken up by schools to connect the students to their environment, in school and outside. More such activities can be built around locations students are familiar with such as classrooms, play ground, toilets, canteens, corridors, library, etc. The schools should have one Assembly weekly on Environment to continuously reinforce the thinking. Some regular rewards or merit marks for Houses can be considered to motivate the students. The Board also has uploaded a short and simple film which has been screened by UNESCO, titled 'Our Earth Our Home' by Dr Anita Bhatnagar Jain on its website which could be useful for students, parents and school teachers on what they can do in their daily lives. The schools may like to show this to their students as part of their ongoing environmental awareness generation programmes and formulate specific projects / activities. The range of activities could vary according to the age of the participants. 190 Nurturing the Dreams of Children PRIMARY CLASSES For primary classes, the activities could be a mix of class room and some outdoor locations within the school. In the class room, lunch boxes could be inspected by teachers followed by general easy small tips on nutrition. Adequate disposal of waste could be introduced at this time. Students could be sensitized to safer/re-usable options for wrapping, use of waste basket etc. They could be taught to understand the importance of trees as oxygen givers, without which we cannot be alive and be encouraged to give plants as gifts and return gifts on birthdays. Teachers/school has to ensure that children are introduced to sustainable Indian practices of including and integrating insect/bird and animal life into day to day life of individuals and such attitudes and practices are re- enforced. Cultural skills must be included in conversations and practices as well as experience sharing sessions. These sessions could be a weekly event. This would inculcate skills like confidence building, articulating thoughts and skills and learning to observe small but significant details of surroundings. In the class room simple tips on Energy conservation could be introduced such as, switching off the lights and fans etc. on leaving the class-room. Begin with small things of everyday life such as hand washing and other hygiene issues in school could be taken up. The children could be asked to keep all faucets in school /home bathrooms etc. tightly closed and report the leakages to the school office or teacher. They should be encouraged to turn off water while brushing etc. and thereby avoiding wastage. Some outdoor activities, such as learning to observe the surroundings could be taken up. Trees, creepers, types of plants around the school, which can be first counted, then catalogued, then connected to insect / bird life etc. Depending on the involvement and the information range of the teachers involved, different departments within the school could be involved to sensitize students to various dimensions of such activities. The children can be sensitized about reasonable sound levels for hearing music or listening to TV, to safeguard their own hearing and also to think about others This can be taken up for all ages. UPPER PRIMARY CLASSES In Upper primary classes, range of activities could extend to product use. Create awareness about battery use and disposal, energy labeling and its benefits. Compare the energy efficiency of appliances used in schools and families on a fair and equitable basis. Teachers could also use energy saving tips by referring to the website, http://www. powermin.nic.in/consumers/safety_instructions.htm#9 . Extend the range of activities to use around the school, in garden etc. Going to gardens & parks to familiarizing them with plants, flowers and environment. Asking children to collect roots of plants, flowers, etc and asking them to germinate seed or grow plants in the house.January-March 2012 191 Making them observe the growth of the plants and also finding out what all birds and insects come to their gardens and surroundings. Going to zoo, to watch animals, and noting down the activities and specific names of the species. Doing gardening and farming in school on a small scale - the vegetables can be of local or alien species. Terrace gardening is also possible. Making them write stories and poems on environment and enact them. Bringing out newspapers and documentaries on environment issues. Helping them learn about rain, and other seasons that are closely linked with their social and physical environment. Students could also be familiarized with rain water harvesting in and around school and home, and the water resources of the city/town and individual/ household responsibility to protect them from pollution. Poster painting competitions could also be undertaken. Skills like fixing fuses, water leakages could also be taught from this level onwards. Raising awareness about cultural /sustainable practices for water conservation should be introduced at the awareness level. If there is a river in the city / town, a visit should be organized. SENIOR CLASSESFor older children, the range of activities goes beyond to the community / locality/city. Students could be sensitized to the street lights and other areas where electricity is used/wasted. The students must be provided with opportunities for learning to complain to proper authorities. Schools must undertake sensitization programmes for family members on water and energy conservation issues etc. Mails can be sent to parents too. Activities extended to locality and city could include raising awareness about water sources and their upkeep. Create awareness of chemical use in the household activities and school activities; the impact of these chemicals on soil and underground water; setting up of water harvesting in locality parks, individual households etc. Clearing of river or lake banks can be done. Discuss with them the complaints and redress mechanisms available for general public. Help them connecting to media, organizing campaigns, walks, writing letters to editors and connecting to ongoing movements.. Encourage them to contribute well researched articles on such issues for school magazines. Like the earlier campaigns for plastic free schools, ( which also needs to be continued), schools could also start an awareness programme for Radiation Free Schools with special reference to the use of cell phones by children. Data and details can be gathered from the Internet. Give this task to the children of higher classes and give them the responsibility of gathering data and raising awareness amongst the younger students.. Activities around Gardens / Parks could include soil conservation through organic methods, use of organic manure, training in composting and vermiculture as a part of cultural activity, recycling and minimizing waste etc. Planting and taking care of the biodiversity around school and localities could also be discussed.192 Nurturing the Dreams of Children Exhibitions, displays, projects can also be designed to involve students and create interest. In such activities each child should be given a choice to select the activity that most interests him or her.In school office or library minimizing and re-use paper use and re-cycling waste etc. should be part of awareness activities. Magazines on environmental issues should be subscribed to. In canteen, focus should be on packaging and the waste it generates. Students should themselves inspect quality of food, hygienic issues in cooking and packing, cleanliness etc. Similar pro-active, participatory activities can be built around all human activities. Awareness of inclusivity about life choices should also be part of student activity. 'Best Out Of Waste' is a creative activity where re-use of so called waste matter can be taught. Social awareness should be generated about inclusion of various economic classes in everyday community life. There could/should be, especially included for urban students an awareness of lifestyle options, over dependence on markets, sustainable culturally available alternatives. The sustainability awareness needs to be re-enforced in both boys and girls. For these parents, especially mothers can play a participatory role. The school alumni could be from any region of the country. Each region has its own sustainable practices integrated into everyday practices. These are passed down from parents to children. These could be talked about in the experience sharing sessions, in the class room or club activity. I am sure the schools would try to integrate these simple and yet effective energy and water saving activities in their every day school programmes and activities.

The first Summative Assessment (SA-I) for this academic session for Classes IX and X has been conducted in the second half of September, 2011. 3. Under the School Based Summative Assessment-II, the students will be tested internally based on the following criteria:- a) The Syllabus and the design of the Examination Question Paper in different subjects for Classes IX and X Summative Assessment will be the same as communicated earlier through different circulars circulated by the Board. January-March 2012 197 b) As was done earlier, the Summative Assessment-II will be in the form of a pen-paper test conducted by the schools themselves. c) In order to ensure standards, the Question Papers Bank in different subjects would be sent by the Board so as to reach the schools well in time. d) Evaluation of answer scripts will be done by the school teachers themselves on the basis of the Marking Scheme provided by the Board. The schools may use the Sahodaya School Cluster for spot evaluation so that teachers from other schools are also involved, if they so wish. e) There will be random verification of the assessment procedures carried out by schools through the Board officials/nominees appointed by the Board. 4. It has been decided to provide Question Papers Bank in the following eight subjects: English Communicative and English Language & Literature, Hindi-A and Hindi-B, Mathematics, Science, Social Science and Communicative Sanskrit.

However, in case the school prepares its own question papers, the question papers and marking scheme so prepared should be emailed to the Board (email id : summative@ hotmail.co.in) for verification within a week of conduct of the respective paper. 6.

It was explained in the said circular that the students' grades in scholastic areas may be upgraded to the next higher grade in one or two subjects depending upon the range of grade points obtained by him/her in co-scholastic areas/ activities. The schools were asked to assess the students in 5 point scale in the domain of life skills and 3 point scale in all other domains of co-scholastic areas/ activities included in the performance profile. According to the earlier scheme, a student could get a maximum of 42 grade points in co-scholastic areas/activities as explained in the above circular. You may be aware that according to the revised manual for teachers on CCE for classes IX and X effective from session 2011-12 for class IX and subsequent session 2012-13 for class-X, assessment in all co-scholastic areas/activities is to be done on 5 point scale.

There is tremendous evidence that life skills, school health and wellbeing are valuable indicators of progressive schooling across the globe. In retrospect the committee on school health in India (popularly known as the Renuka Ray committee), set up in 1960, highlighted that \"Health education should be included as part of general education in the primary, middle and secondary school\". The report of the committee provided guidelines and recommendations for both content and appropriate inclusion of health education and services at various stages of schooling.

CBSE has taken a leadership role in spearheading the cause of health and wellbeing learning in schools since the formulation of the CSHP programme and manuals. The NCF 2005 has articulated the health and physical education component in the overall development of school going children. January-March 2012 207 With higher school enrollments and the Right to Education in place, schools have become nodal centers for heath based programmes. It has also been noted that schools are the key forums for acquisition of health related knowledge, attitudes and life skills. They are indeed the wealth of the nation, empowering the children towards being responsible citizens.

The CBSE seeks your collaboration in its initiative to promote innovation in schools affiliated to it. 1. Background There has been an increase in debate about innovation in education since 2008. Researchers and practitioners in innovation are engaged in a discourse about how to design public resources that deliver different and better outcomes at a lower cost. The primary target of innovation in education is to derive maximum outcome using fewer resources. 'Radical Efficiency' requires looking at these challenges and new perspectives in solutions. There has been an increasing need to think about how to grow and foster conducive conditions for innovation in education systems. Critical to this is creating opportunities for ideas to develop. Ideas develop in a network of collaboration, firing new ways to create alternate pathways. There is a need to motivate the larger population to come out of the traditional treatment of education and become more productive and innovative. 212 Nurturing the Dreams of Children 2. Need CBSE recognizes that in the next few years the country will swarm with young people wanting to learn, especially with the introduction of Right to free and compulsory education. With the changing demographics, there will be an increase in young population, and thus innovation may have the biggest payoffs. There will be a need to reach out to children from disconnected and poorest parts of the country. CBSE, being a premier organization in spearheading changes in educational opportunities invites representations from schools regarding innovation and best practices. This approach encourages project or enquiry based learning, making student voice more meaningful and encouraging peer to peer teaching, learning and mentoring thereby exhibiting a positive learning experience and environment. All schools affiliated to CBSE are encouraged to upload their innovative practices with evidence, on the link https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dHNpTENtSDZIaW9jUG5jdUd 3UkNzOEE6MQ . They can upload website links and links of photographs and videos. Please note that photographs and videos cannot be uploaded directly on CBSE website. Only links can be uploaded. The details are provided in Annexure-1. Kindly bring this to the notice of teachers and students to encourage them also to participate in this venture.

Getting children involved in sports helps them make exercise a part of their lifestyle and increases their chance of a being a healthier adult. Participation in sports builds self-esteem. Children gain confidence and have a more positive view of themselves. Participation in sports gives child a practical way to learn about goal setting. Sports teach children about teamwork and how their actions affect other people. It is our moral responsibility to help children formulate a plan which enables them to efficiently handle their responsibilities while still leaving time for sports practices and competitions. In sports children learn how to deal with adversity & errors, chances are, they'll be able to translate that skill to real life and effectively minimize mistakes as well as competently recover from set backs. Sports provide numerous opportunities for positive experiences both for child as an individual, and for family as a whole. So as to inculcate the above, every year the Board organises the Inter School Sports & Games Competitions in 17 disciplines in various age groups for Girls' & Boys' at nearly 160 venues for its Independent Category of Schools (Private Schools) affiliated to it.

You are aware that class X & XII examinations are to begin from 1st March,2012 Through this letter, I want to invite your attention to some of the critical issues that have a bearing on people's trust in our examination system. It is our bounden duty to sustain this trust. 2. Firstly, it is essential that the conduct of examination does not appear to be fair only but should enjoy the complete confidence and trust of the public at large. This is an onerous task. It would demand whole hearted dedication of functionaries at various levels involved in the examination. I hope, we will discharge our responsibilities in a team spirit no matter wherever we happen to be placed. 3. Linked with the conduct of examinations are the perceptions & reactions about the question papers administered in different subjects. These reactions are received from the diversified groups spread all over the country and also from abroad. Intere;st groups, more so the schools and the students have every right to air their views on the quality of question papers administered. But this right puts an added responsibility on them to see that the observations.\u00b7 and comment are not made to gain cheap popularity. Rather these should be made to strengthen the system. We should also keep in mind that during examinations, examinees are under heavy stress and anxiety and our adverse views on the question papers through different media, often upset them in their preparations of future examinations. It would, therefore, be advisable that schools should send their reactions and perceptions direct to the Board instead of expressing them to the media. January-March 2012 227 4. To give a fair deal to the comments on the question papers and redress the genuine grievances of students, CBSE has developed an Observation Schedule, .a copy of which is enclosed in case you have your observations about a question paper, these may please be recorded and forwarded as per directions contained therein within twenty four hours of the conduct of examination of the subject concerned so that these observations could be considered by the expert group while preparing the marking scheme. You are aware that with the introduction of Continous and Comprehensive Evaluation .w.e.f 2009-2011 session, the first batch of Class X student has appeared for the 2011 Examination and second batch will be appeanng for 2012 Examination. The Board will be having two sets of students appearing for the Summative Assessment II-one set appearing for Board conducted and the second set appearing for school conducted Summative Assessment II. The observations on the question papers administered for Board conducted Summative Assessment II should only be sent to the Board within twenty four hours of the conduct of the examination of the subject concerned 5. Careful marking of script and timely declaration of results in our paramount concern. To ensure this we need quality examiners in adequates numbers. It has been observed in the past that some Schools under one pretext or the other do not relieve the teachers for evaluation work and the Board has to remind them in the midst of the evaluation work. This is an undesirable practice . I would, therefore, appeal to you to relieve your teachers for evaluation work instead of complaining about the quality of marking subsequently. Teachers selected for evaluation work must report on the appointed date and time. This is essential because on the first day, marking schemes are studied, dicussed and clarified to the examiners. Non-release of teachers may compel the board to delay the declaration of result of the defaulting institution and also initiate disaffiliation proceedings. 6. I request you to participate willingly and not reluctantly. Rather advise your teachers to be regular and very serious in marking as it amount to professional judgement on 10 to 12 years of hard work put in by the examinees If you happen to be the Head Examiner/Additional Head Examiner please ensure that the sample checking of answer book of each evaluator is just not routine. It should conform to the marking scheme so that it provides academis guidance to the evaluators for objective and uniform evaluation 7. In order to preserve sanctity of the system and avoid criticism, I request the principals appointed as Chief Nodal Supervisors to provide logistic and administrative support to the Head Examiners and also to ensure that the answer books are evaluated as per the instructions/marking scheme(s) provided by the Board. 8. As per orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the candidates would now be permitted to obtain photocopy of the Answer Book on request on payment of the prescribed fee. All examiners/Head Examiners are once again reminded that they must ensure that evaluation is carried out strictly as per value points for each answer as given in the Marking Scheme. 9. For 2012 examinations, some new instructions have been provided in the Guidelines for the Spot Evaluation. You are requested to kindly read these instructions carefully, I am enclosing a compiled list of these instructions as annexure 'A' for your ready reference. 228 Nurturing the Dreams of Children In the end, I once again request you to please extend your willing co-operation to the Board in the smooth and fair conduct of examinations. I am sure, with your active support we shall be able to preserve the sanctity of the system and avoid criticism. Needless to mention that we all are custodian of examinees faith and we have to preserve it at all cost. With warm regards To, Yours Sincerely, Principals of all the Schools affiliatedto the Board.

Vaccinations (like the OPV vaccine) are given as a series of shots, not just one single dose. Some students may have missed getting all the required shots. Not getting a full course of a vaccine leaves a child unprotected and still at risk for getting a disease. Other vaccinations require a booster shot every few years to ensure that the level of immunity remains high. Therefore a strict schedule of vaccination ought to be followed for adequate protection and high level of immunity. Unprotected children may spread the disease especially in schools where large numbers of students are together in close quarters. The successes of government plans like the Universal Immunization Programme also depend on the level of awareness that can be generated through various measures. In view of the above facts the CBSE has incorporated a format for verifying the record of immunization that a child has been subjected at the time of admission in school in the Health Manual Volume-I Page No-78-79(Annexure January-March 2012 233 'A'). CBSE has published Health Manuals in four volumes which have been revised in 2010 to include issues regarding sanitation, hygiene, environmental protection, safety, emergency medical services, CCE in context of Health and Physical Education, Eco Clubs, Health and Wellness Clubs, Scientific Skills, CCE School based assessment certificate and PEC cards. There are two formats also given in the same manual regarding format of Health Cards. The first one is in the form of a child's Health History which the school may take at the time of admission so that Central Board of Secondary Education February 24,2012 the School has a record of the child's Health status. The second format 80-81- Annexure 'B') is more general and needs to be periodically updated to keep a record of the continuous Health status of the child through school. It is also categorically mentioned in the Manual that a external Examination or referral without taking the parents into confidence. Establishing good health practices is essential but keeping the parents aware and informed and taking their consent and approval at every step is even more so. For each parent the health support will be assured. The CBSE's Affiliation Bye duties of the Heads of the school, they must also be concerned with promoting the ph the pupil ensuring high standard of cleanliness and health habits and arranging periodical medical examinations of the students and sending Medical reports to parents or guardian. It is once again requested that schools must encourage utmost sincerity in verifying the Immunization Record of each student admitted in the school. Schools must also discuss the immunization records of students with parents for a timely remediation, if needed. This will help the country in controlling and even eradicating infectious diseases Y ours Sincerely, (Dr Sadhana Parashar) Director (Training) Copy to: 1.

It has become the language for knowledge seeking as we move towards knowledge-based economy. CBSE envisages that all language skills need to be integrated into the English language curriculum at schools. Speaking and listening should be fostered in children to equip them with better communication skills. At the onset it proposes to introduce formal testing of speaking and listening skills in the form of Formative Assessments (FAs) in English at Secondary and Senior Secondary levels from the academic session 2012-13. For this purpose CBSE plans to develop a `cohort of oral examiners' to be involved in testing of speaking and listening skills in English at the aforesaid levels. It is looking for suitably qualified and experienced individuals to join the team of Oral Examiners. The candidate should have a graduate/postgraduate degree or a qualification which can be equivalent to a graduate degree in English language. Diploma or post graduate qualifications acquired from IFLU Hyderabad are acceptable. The experience of being an oral examiner in any of the examination conducted by British Council will be an added qualification. The person should be above 30 years of age and fluent in spoken and written English.276 Nurturing the Dreams of Children It is desirable that the person should have excellent conversation skills with an ability to act as an interlocutor and/or assessor over examination periods. S/he should be competent to observe the instructions for oral examiners and to follow oral examiners guidelines. It is mandatory to be IT literate and to have a high level of language competence in order to deliver the training course for English teachers and to attend refresher sessions/ workshops. The ability to work well under pressure, meet timelines and a passion for teaching English and involvement in academic activities beyond classroom teaching will be an added qualification.
