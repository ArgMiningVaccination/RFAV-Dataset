Abstract Title of Dissertation: HIV envelope glycoprotein-Fc fusion proteins target Fc gamma receptors and elicit effector antibody responses in rhesus macaques Zhanna Shubin, Doctor of Philosophy, 2016 Dissertation Directed by: Dr. David Pauza, Professor, Department of Medicine A goal for HIV prevention programs is to develop safe and effective vaccines that elicit durable and broadly protective antibodies against both sexual and blood-borne HIV transmission. Many vaccine programs focus on the immune responses to critical epitopes in the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) and seek to improve the quality and quantity of antibodies by altering the conformation, oligomerization or glycosylation of Env gp120. As a complementary strategy, we envisioned that attaching an Fc moiety from IgG to immunogens would Fc receptor (FcRn) for FcRn-mediated mucosal delivery. We reasoned that Fc fusion protein immunogens may also mimic immune complexes by binding Fc gamma receptors (FcR) on immune cells and would increase the potency of antibody responses. We developed Fc fusion immunogens consisting of either HIVBaL gp120 (Env-Fc) or critical epitopes in the V1V2 region of Env expressed within a carrier protein that provides highly multivalent epitope display (Gag-V1V2-Fc). Fc fusion proteins were attached at their carboxyl terminus to a Gly/Ser linker that is in turn fused to each half of the dimeric Fc domain from rhesus macaque IgG1 (Env-Fc). Env-Fc retained capacity to bind both cell surface CD4 and FcRs, which led to protein internalization and accumulation in cytoplasmic vesicles. In a rhesus macaque immunization study, Env-Fc was more potent compared to Env (gp120 monomer) in several ways. Env-Fc elicited higher gp120 binding antibody titers with increased breadth, including the capacity for recognizing CD4-induced epitopes, neutralizing activity against Tier 1A produced durability compared to Env monomer immunization. A Gag-V1V2-Fc fusion protein was constructed to test whether a self-assembling macromolecular structure was a more effective method for directing antibody responses to specific V1V2 regions of the Envelope glycoprotein. This immunogen crossed nasal epithelium barriers more efficiently than HIV Gag (p24 monomer), and elicited V1V2-specific IgG responses. Our work suggests IgG1 Fc to engineered monomeric or oligomeric Env-based immunogens may improve the protective serum antibody response and contribute to the development of a protective HIV vaccine.

Due to the many immune evasion strategies of HIV, the development of an effective prophylactic HIV vaccine remains an unmet goal since its discovery 30 years ago. Development of a successful vaccine necessitates a definition of the type of immune response that gives rise to protection against infection. Once the correlates of protection have been established, the next challenge is to create a vaccine that elicits that type of response. In the HIV vaccine field, the current thinking is that humoral responses make an important contribution to protection, but the type of antibody response, whether it is neutralizing or non-neutralizing, remains controversial. Numerous types of immunogens (virus like particles, viral vectors expressing recombinant antigens, subunit antigens including well-ordered Env trimers, mosaic viruses, etc.) have been designed and tested in combinations with various adjuvants, delivery routes, and immunization schedules. The RV144 HIV vaccine trial conducted in Thailand gave the most promise for creating an effective vaccine. The trial consisted of 16,000 volunteers (HIV negative individuals at low, medium, or high risk), half of whom received four intramuscular (IM) priming injections of a recombinant canarypox vector, ALVAC-HIV, plus two IM booster injections of recombinant (Env) gp120 subunit, AIDSVAX B/E, and 2009). It induced primarily a humoral immune response with binding antibodies to gp120 and antibodies that carry out antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Importantly, IgG antibodies against the V1V2 2 loop of gp120 were elicited and correlated with a decreased risk of infection (IgA in serum was a correlate of increased infection). However, antibody titers decreased in vaccinees after 24 weeks (Yates et al. 2014). The vaccine produced little protection, having no effect on viral load or CD4 T cell count once vaccinees became infected, and imparted only 31% efficacy overall (Rerks-Ngarm et al. 2009; Haynes et al. 2012). This vaccine strategy showed that improvements were needed to increase the quantity, quality, and durability of immune responses. Though the results showed a marginal benefit, they offered hope for a way forward. Significant efforts were invested into understanding the nature of protective epitopes on Env glycoprotein. Because of this work, we have an understanding about regions of Env that do or do not trigger protective antibodies, we know that neutralization is a key but not the only component of antibody function, and we know that Env monomers bind poorly to germ-line antibodies (Xiao et al. 2009; Mascola et al. 2013; Burton et al. 2016). Current research on HIV vaccines focuses on improving immunogenicity of Env to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb) and other antibody effector activities capable of protecting against multiple strains of HIV. Strategies include modifying the conformation or glycosylation patterns of Env to expose conserved sites, or multimerizing critical epitopes using scaffold proteins in order to improve binding to low affinity germ-line na\u00efve B cell receptors (BCR) and to focus the response (Sliepen et al. 2016). The different types of Env immunogens developed thus far are reviewed in Figure 1.1. One approach that has not been fully explored is the use of HIV Fc fusion proteins that would target Fc gamma receptors, including the neonatal Fc 3 receptor, to enhance immunogenicity and potentially support needle-free, vector independent delivery to mucosal sites. 4 Figure 1.1 Overview of the different [HIV Env] immunogens.

As a result,MPER epitope-scaffolds probably induce Abs that areable to bind the exposed MPER, but are not able toaccess the same epitope on the native Env spike.In conclusion, no HIV-1 Env epitope-scaffold has yetbeen able to mount an effective neutralizing responsein animals, but the success of an epitope-scaffold in RSVvaccine research has provided a proof-of-concept.[66]To be successful against HIV-1, the restricted angles ofapproach to bNAb epitopes on the virion surface needto be considered. Epitope-scaffolds can be manipu-lated, for example by adding glycans to prevent Abswith the wrong approach angles from binding.[72]Alternatively, one could also design scaffolds thatcarry epitopes that have less-restricted approach angleson the trimer, such as the variable regions 1 and 2(V1V2) [39](Figure 1). However, the amino acidsequence of V1V2 is highly variable, and the only effec-tive V1V2 bNAbs bind to complex quaternary epitopes Figure 2.Overview of the different immunogens that are discussed in this review.

SANDERS 5 1.2 Fc gamma Receptors There are three classes of classical Fc gamma receptors (FcRs) described in humans - FcRI, FcRIIA, FcRIIB, FcRIIC, FcRIIIA, and FcRIIIB - that are expressed in innate immune effector cells (DiLillo et al. 2015). FcRs belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and can be classified into two categories, inhibitory activating. Inhibitory FcRIIB activation signals through the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (Figure 1.2). FcRs bind to IgG antibodies with different affinities (Guilliams et al. 2014). FcRI are high affinity receptors that can bind to monomeric IgG; the other FcRs are low affinity and require aggregation to bind IgG and transduce signals. Though FcRI can bind monomeric IgG, it also requires aggregation for cell activation to ensue (Metzger 1992). IgG coated targets (antigens or cells) make up immune complexes (IC) that are able to effectively aggregate the FcRs. Most effector cells express both activating and inhibitory receptors and the combined affinities of these receptors makes up the overall activating to inhibitory ratio that determines the outcome of the signal (DiLillo et al. 2015). To add to the complexity, polymorphisms in human FcRs have been found that alter the affinity with which they bind to IgG (Figure 1.2) (Salmon et al. 1992). In humans, IgG antibodies have four subclasses, IgG1-IgG4, that bind with differing affinities to FcRs. IgG1 is the highest affinity subclass, capable of binding all FcRs; IgG2 and IgG4 have the lowest affinities (Bruhns et al. 2009). 6 Figure 1.2 Human Fc receptors *Gene polymorphisms identified either by the position in the protein and the amino acid substitutions (for example, His131 or Arg131), or by the name of the allele SH).

Also, glycosylations on Fc can be altered to affect binding (Lund et al. 1992; Lund et al. 1996; Krapp et al. 2003). FcRs are expressed in several different innate immune effector cells (Figure 1.3) and thus regulate many innate and adaptive immune responses (Nimmerjahn et al. 2008) including antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and modulation of adaptive immune responses (described in further detail in section 1.4). Macrophages carry out ADCC of IgG-coated target cells in an FcRIIIA-mediated fashion (DiLillo et al. 2015). The Fc portion of IgG binds FcRIIIA and sends an activating signal to the macrophage to kill the IgG-coated target cell (Guilliams et al. 2014). Activating FcR on DC internalize IC which are then processed for antigen presentation and cross presentation (de Jong et al. 2006; Baker et al. 2011; van Montfoort et al. 2012). An intracellular FcR, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), directs the IC to antigen presentation compartments (Qiao et al. 2008; Baker et al. 2011) or recycling endosomes (described further in section 1.3) (Weflen et al. 2013). Another FcR, TRIM21, has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and might route IC - as it does with antibody coated virus particles - to the proteasome for eventual MHC I loading and presentation (Figure 1.4) (Mallery et al. 2010). The FcR through which IC was internalized might influence the degradative pathway through which it is processed and the repertoire of epitopes generated (Guilliams et al. 2014). Such a systematic analysis for each FcR remains to be conducted. 8 Figure 1.3 Type I FcRs in humans Human type I FcR family members and expression patterns. *, inducible upon cytokine stimulation; **, inducible upon cytokine stimulation in immature DCs; ***, functional FcRIIC is expressed by 10% of individuals.

Moreover, signalling through the activating FcRs via spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) activates moDCs and facilitates endosomal maturation, increased lysosomal fusion and efficiently facilitates the delivery of processed antigens to the MHC class II compartment (MIIC) for enhanced MHC class II presentation to CD4+ T cells. In addition, antigens coupled to antibodies are more efficiently cross-presented than unbound antigens. This is thought to be the result of two independent mechanisms: first, neonatal FcRn (FcRn)-mediated protection from degradation and efficient delivery of the antigen to the cytosol; and second, tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21)-mediated increased delivery to the proteasome. Note that TRIM21-mediated delivery to the proteasome has been shown to occur for opsonized particles (including viruses), but not directly for antigen-containing immune complexes (question mark). TRIM21 also functions in the absence of activating FcRs54 (dashed arrows). However, uptake of antibody-coated viruses via FcRs may help target them to TRIM21. In addition, all of these experiments were carried out in moDCs and it is currently unknown whether these observations also apply to conventional DCs. 2m, 2-microglobulin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.

As its name suggests, an important role for FcRn is to mediate the passive transport of IgG from mother to fetus. Simister and Mostov cloned FcRn from epithelial cells in the small intestine of an 11-day old suckling rat. These studies established FcRn as the mechanism for neonatal acquisition of IgG from mother's milk (Brambell 1966; Simister et al. 1989). Later, it was shown that FcRn transports IgG across the placenta (Leach et al. 1996; Simister et al. 1996; Antohe et al. 2001). In addition to mediating passive immunity from mother to fetus, FcRn has several important functions. FcRn is expressed in endocytic vesicles in endothelial cells and epithelium of gut, kidney, lung, and skin (Kuo et al. 2010). It is also expressed in immune cells such as DC, macrophages, B cells, and neutrophils (Zhu et al. 2001). FcRn binds IgG and albumin at pH less than 6.5 and releases them at neutral pH. In so doing, it increases the half-life of these molecules by temporarily taking them up into endothelial FcRn-containing vesicles (through pinocytosis), and protecting them from the harsh circulatory environment (Dickinson et al. 1999; Chaudhury et al. 2003; Claypool 2004; Yoshida et al. 2004). Crystallography showed FcRn-IgG binding occurs in a 2:1 ratio, where 2 FcRn bind 1 IgG molecule at its CH2-CH3 junction in a manner distinct from conventional Fc gamma receptors (FcR) (Martin et al. 2001). Specifically, two histidine residues at the 3 domain of FcRn, H250 and H251, bind the Fc domain of H310, H430, I253 (Kuo et al. 2011). FcRn has the capacity for non-degradative bidirectional transport of IgG or IgG 11 immune complexes (IC) across epithelial layers, endowing this receptor with mucosal immune surveillance functions (Dickinson et al. 1999; Claypool et al. 2004; Yoshida et al. 2004). It was shown in mice that FcRn protects against luminal bacteria by shuttling antigen-bound IgG IC across epithelia and delivering them to underlying lamina propria DC for subsequent presentation to CD4+ T cells. Bacterial colonization and pathogenesis was significantly higher in FcRn-/- mice, identifying FcRn as an important player in regulating immune responses to mucosal pathogens (Ben Suleiman et al. 2012). The transcytosis of IC by FcRn also poises this receptor for safe, intact delivery of Fc-containing subunit vaccine antigens (or drugs) to underlying mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). As described below, we aim to develop an effective subunit mucosal vaccine by taking advantage of FcRn to efficiently deliver our subunit Fc fusion antigen to immune cells within mucosal tissues. In immune cells, FcRn has been shown to enhance antigen presentation. Although FcRn has MHC I-like structure, its peptide-binding groove is occluded, preventing FcRn from being a conventional antigen-presenting molecule. In APC, FcRn resides in acidified endocytic vesicles and binds IgG IC cargo that has been handed off from conventional FcRs that have been endocytosed from surface plasma membrane. The exact mechanism for the role FcRn plays in improving antigen presentation has yet to be elucidated. Some groups have reported that FcRn traffics multimeric IC (defined as multiple IgG bound to antigen) to lysosomal compartments where they can be processed and presented on MHC II for subsequent CD4+ T cell stimulation; monomeric IC, however, were unable to be routed to lysosomes or to stimulate CD4+ T cells, presumably because these IC were recycled out of the cell (Mi et al. 2008; Qiao et al. 12 2008). These groups hypothesize that FcRn cargo with higher ligand valency cross-links the FcRn, causes conformational rearrangement, and promotes signaling and trafficking to lysosomes. Weflen et al. found FcRn bound to multivalent IgG-opsonized antigens is diverted to lysosomes by preventing entry into recycling tubules (narrow luminal extensions of endosomes); FcRn bound to monomeric IgG, which are smaller in size, were sorted into recycling tubules and exocytosed (Weflen et al. 2013). Others report FcRn increases efficiency of antigen presentation of endocytosed monomeric immune complexes above that for soluble antigen in both DC and macrophages (Liu et al. 2011). Furthermore, FcRn has been reported to mediate cross presentation of IgG IC in CD8-CD11b+ DC. Unlike CD8+ DC, this subset does not participate in cross presentation of soluble antigen because their acidified phagosomes are unfavorable for cross presentation. However, this environment is conducive for FcRn to bind IC and protect them from degradation, resulting in epitope preservation and efficient cross presentation of IgG IC (Baker et al. 2011). By playing a role in antigen presentation and cross presentation, FcRn contributes to both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. FcRn-mediated enhancement of IgG IC antigen presentation and cross presentation, as well as its capacity for bidirectional transport of IgG IC highlights the immunoprotective roles of this receptor and underlines the advantages of targeting FcRn for mucosal vaccine design. Zhu et al. conducted a study in mice testing the efficacy of a subunit mucosal vaccine strategy that exploits the FcRn receptor. FcRn knockout (KO) or WT mice were immunized (i.n.) (gD-Fc). WT mice had efficient transcytosis of gD-Fc across airway epithelia compared to KO mice, or mice immunized with gD alone. In addition, 13 WT mice generated durable systemic and mucosal immune responses. The gD-Fc vaccine, administered i.n., protected WT mice from intravaginal challenge with HSV-2, even 6 months after primary immunization (Ye et al. 2011). A similar study used HIV Gag-Fc; WT FcRn mice exhibited significantly better immune responses and higher protection upon viral challenge compared to mice given antigen alone (without Fc) or FcRn KO mice (Lu et al. 2011). These studies demonstrated the effectiveness of targeting FcRn for developing a potent subunit vaccine for mucosal delivery. 1.4 Immune complexes and regulation of immune responses In 1907, Emil von Behring demonstrated that immunization with diphtheria toxin plus anti-diphtheria antibody resulted in long-lasting immunity against diphtheria (Haas 2001). Since then, immunization with antibodies and soluble antigen has been seen to confer enhanced immune responses and protection above that of soluble immunogens in many different models of infection. For example, live infectious bursal disease virus plus hyperimmune serum led to formation of more germinal centers, increased amounts of antigen deposited on FDC, and improved protection compared to immunization with uncomplexed virus (Haddad et al. 1997; Jeurissen et al. 1998). Equine herpesvirus 1 incorporated into Solid-Matrix-Antibody-Antigen complexes induced neutralizing antibodies (Alber et al. 2000). Rhesus macaque immunization with Venezuela equine encephalitis (VEE) virus plus IgG, compared to VEE alone, resulted in higher peak titers that consisted mainly of IgG (while both IgM and IgG were elicited by VEE) (Houston et al. 1977). We now know that the enhanced immune responses and protection seen in these studies can be attributed to antigen-antibody IC formation and engagement of FcRs (Brady 2005). 14 Due to the wide expression of FcR on innate immune effector cells, multiple mechanisms account for IC effects on immunity (Figure 1.5) (Brady 2005; Bournazos et al. 2015). Compared to soluble antigen, IC have increased uptake via FcR on dendritic cells (DC). Binding to activating FcR on DC induces maturation, increasing MHC and costimulatory molecule expression, and leads to enhanced antigen presentation (Akiyama et al. 2003). Also, IC lower the threshold of B cell activation either by increasing avidity of antigen to B cell receptors (BCR), or by fixing complement to engage complement receptors. This results in clustering of the BCR with the B cell coreceptor complex and lowers the activation threshold (Dempsey et al. ; Dempsey et al. 1996). Once a na\u00efve B cell is exposed to antigen and activated, it migrates to the border between the T cell zone and the B cell follicle to present antigen to its cognate T follicular helper (Tfh) cell (Hamel et al. 2012). Following interacting with a Tfh cell, a B cell can either become an extrafollicular plasma cell or reenter the follicle to undergo class switch, somatic hypermutation (SHM), and affinity maturation through help from Tfh signals. Early studies postulated that IC deposited on cells (FDC) within lymphoid follicles promote immunoglobulin SHM and affinity maturation (Wu et al. 2008). Current models suggest that the B cells with the highest affinity B cell receptor (BCR) are the most efficient at antigen capture from the IC on FDC, and are also the most efficient at processing antigen for MHC II-restricted presentation to Tfh (Victora et al. 2010). It is then these B cell clones that can best compete for limited Tfh help and receive the necessary signals for either further SHM and affinity maturation or differentiation into memory cells. It is not yet clear what the signals are for these alternative fates (Figure 1.6). 15 Figure 1.5 Regulatory functions of immune complexes. Immune complexes bind to activating Fc receptors (FcR) and inhibitory FcRs that are expressed by innate immune effector cells such as basophils, mast cells, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, in which they trigger the indicated effector responses. Binding of immune complexes to FcRs on dendritic cells results in phagocytosis and presentation of antigenic peptides on MHC class I and class II molecules. Antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ helper T cells or regulatory T cells (TReg cells) that recognize these peptide- MHC complexes become activated and mediate various effector functions such as killing of virus-infected cells, modulation of immune responses or providing T-cell help for antigen-specific B cells. B cells only express the inhibitory low-affinity FcR for IgG (Fc RIIB), transduced by the B-cell receptor (BCR). On plasma cells, which produce high levels of antigen-specific antibodies, BCR expression is very low or absent, resulting in exclusive triggering of inhibitory signalling pathways.

In the AIDS models of infection, indirect evidence that IC enhance humoral immunity stems from pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis studies. Passive immunization with bNAb elicited protection against intravenous or intravaginal SHIV infection in macaque models (Mascola et al. 2000). bNAb, b12, does not elicit protection when its ability to bind FcR is abrogated (Hessell et al. 2007). Immediately postinfection, IgG from an SIV-infected nonprogressor (SIVIG) suppressed viremia for over a year after the clearance of SIVIG, and resulted in the accelerated formation of de novo bNAbs (Haigwood et al. 2004). While these observations may be due to the bNAb decreasing viral load (via blocking viral entry/infection, ADCC) and preserving the function of the immune system, another potential explanation is that IC formed in vivo, and through Fc:FcR interactions, created an active immunizing effect. 17 Figure 1.6 Affinity maturation in the GC. During a T cell-dependent antibody response to protein antigens, B cells undergo expansion and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the dark zone (DZ) of the germinal center. They then migrate to the light zone (LZ), where the highest affinity cells are selected through their ability to acquire antigen from the surface of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and present this antigen to T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. By contrast, B cells that cannot compete for antigen binding are eliminated. Antigen presentation to Tfh cells directs B cells to reenter the DZ, where they undergo additional rounds of division and SHM. The amount of proliferation and mutation B cells undergo during each interzonal GC cycle is proportional to their affinity for antigen and the amount of antigen they present to T cells. This creates a feed- forward loop, where B cells with the highest affinity are continuously selected, expanded and diversified. This model explains how affinity maturation can occur in the course of an immune response.

We wanted to test if this strategy can be translated to nonhuman primates using a more relevant immunogen, Env-Fc (Chapter 3). Env-Fc contains an HIVBaL gp120 a Gly/Ser linker attached at its carboxyl terminus that is, in turn, fused to each arm of the dimeric Fc domain from rhesus IgG1. We chose to study Env as Env-specific antibodies may be the main component for a protective response. We immunized rhesus macaques via the mucosal route to target immunogens to the MALT, which contains the majority (~80%) of human lymphocytes and is the primary route of entry for many viruses including sexually-transmitted HIV. Env-Fc is capable of engaging not only FcRn, but also canonical FcRs. We immunized by the muscular route with Env-Fc or Env immunogens to assess how addition of the Fc moiety might enhance the immune response of a weak immunogen (Chapter 4). Results showed that Env-Fc elicited a greater magnitude, breadth, and durability of the immune response relative to Env. We wanted to test whether covalent conjugation of adjuvant to the imunogen might lower the required dose to elicit pro-inflammatory responses and decrease off-target effects relative to co-formulated adjuvant (Chapter 5). We linked the muramyl dipeptide (MDP) adjuvant to sialic acid on Env to create our MDP-Env-Fc immunogen. We designed MDP-Env-Fc to contain a cleavable disulfide linker such that it can be released once inside the APC. Muramyl dipeptide has been shown to bind intracellular 19 oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and elicit proinflammatory cytokines. In our studies, we first tested a modified MDP compound that would be targeted to Env-Fc and a MDP compound that would be released after entry into the APC using THP-1/IL-8 bioassays. We then immunized our animals with MDP-Env-Fc or Env-Fc alone to test whether MDP-Env-Fc has adjuvant activity and can elicit a stronger response relative to Env-Fc. We did not get to investigate how conjugated adjuvant compares to co-formulated adjuvant and leave this question to future studies. One obstacle to using Env immunogens is the diversity of circulating viral sequences. An approach to overcoming the problem of virus variation is to engineer immunogens that multimerize and present only the most avidity to low-binding germ-line BCR on na\u00efve B cells. In line with this reasoning, we built on our previous Gag-Fc immunogen and designed Gag-V1V2-Fc. V1V2 loop is a critical site in Env gp120 that has been associated with a decreased risk in HIV infection during the RV144 trial and contains the binding site of several bNAb, including PG9 and PG16 (Rerks-Ngarm et al. 2009; Haynes et al. 2012). V1V2 was substituted for the Cyclophilin A loop of Gag. Due to the self-assembling nature of the Gag capsid protein, Gag-V1V2-Fc multimerizes and presents repeating V1V2 and Fc moieties. We envisioned that Gag-V1V2-Fc could potentially elicit cellular Gag-specific responses and humoral anti-V1V2 responses. In addition, the Fc would allow it to be targeted to FcRs and be delivered to mucosal sites. At the time, we also wanted to test whether this Fc fusion protein with multiple Fc segments would stimulate stronger immune responses relative to the monomeric Env-Fc (one Fc 20 segment). To begin to answer these questions, we immunized rhesus macques with Gag-V1V2-Fc or Gag p24 by the nasal or muscular routes. Table 1.1 shows the immunization schedule with all the immunogens and animal group assignments throughout our work. 21 Table 1.1 Immunization SchematicEnv-Fc 819, 820); 250 Env-Fc (Mut) + \u00b5g CpG (802, 816, 821, 822); 170 \u00b5g Env + 50 \u00b5g CpG (809, 811, 817); Blood draw Week 0 (10/16/14) -- 1st immunizationWeek 4 (11/12/14) -- 2nd immunizationWeek Cross (i.n. 33 \u00b5g/animalGag: 33 \u00b5g/animal Blood draw Gag-V1V2-Fc: 70 \u00b5g/animal Blood draw Blood draw Blood draw Gag-V1V2-Fc: \u00b5g/animalGag-V1V2-Fc: 808, 812, Gag animals were later the MDP-Env-Fc immunizationsAugust 26, 2015 (WK8) -- i.n.-->IM crossprimeBlood (i.n.)

CHO cell lines were grown in complete DMEM supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, amino 1% penicillin/streptomycin. THP-1 were grown in complete RPMI-1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., at 37\u00b0C. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were purified from whole blood that was obtained from commercial suppliers, and PBMC were cultured in the same RPMI-based medium. PG9 antibody (Catalog # 12149), VRC01 antibody (Catalog # 12033) were acquired from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH. Manufacturing of Env-Fc and Env glycoproteins were performed by the Viral and Cell Core Facility at the Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine. HIVBaL gp120 was expressed in 293FS cells from an expression construct purchased from Aldevron (Aldevron, Fargo, ND). 24 CpG ODN was purchased from InvivoGen ( Catalog # 2395c-1, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). Sigma Adjuvant System was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used according to manufacturer's instructions (Catalog # S6322, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Env-Fc was labeled with Allophycocyanin fluorophore using the Lightning APC - XL conjugation kit (Catalog # 7-5-0010, Innova Biosciences Ltd., Cambridge, England) according to manufacturer's instructions. 2.2 Constructing the Env-Fc fusion protein expression vector The cDNA encoding gp120 from the HIV-1 isolate BaL 14 codons for glycine and serine (GSGGGGSGGGGSGS) that formed and sequences. The Fc-fragment of monkey IgG1 containing hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains, was amplified by RT-PCR from the to the G/S linker region. PCR amplificates reaction products were annealed with restriction endonucleases EcoRI and XhoI before ligating into a pCDNA3 vector containing a gp120 secretion signal sequence. Each construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids containing the Env-Fc were transfected into CHO cells using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). G418-resistant clones were selected and tested for secretion of 25 Env-Fc fusion proteins. SDS-PAGE and Western blot were performed to assess the recombinant fusion proteins using mouse anti-gp120 or anti-monkey IgG antibody. The highest expressing clones were preserved in cell banks for Env-Fc production. Env-Fc fusion proteins secreted in CHO cell supernatants were first cleaned by ultrafiltration and further purified by affinity chromatography using Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). Protein concentrations were measured with Bradford protein assay kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) using mouse IgG2a as a standard. 2.3 Biochemical characterization of Env-Fc Inhibition -- with HIVBaL gp120 (to block Env-Fc binding to cell surface CD4) and with varying molar amounts of unlabeled IgG Fc fragments for 1 hr at 4oC. Treated THP-1 cells were washed and stained with 0.5 \u00b5g of APC-labeled Env-Fc (this amount produced maximum signal intensity in the absence of competing Fc fragments or BaL). Molar ratios of Fc fragments to APC Env-Fc were 0:1, .2:1, .5:1, 1:1, and 2:1. The isotype control was THP-1 cells treated with unlabeled Env-Fc. Binding of labeled proteins were analyzed with an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Ca). Competition assay - Env-Fc binding to CD4: Peripheral blood mononuclear were pre-incubated with 2 \u00b5g of IgG Fc fragments for 30 min. on ice. Cells were treated with Env-Fc for 30 min. on ice then washed and stained with a FITC anti-CD4 antibody that does not compete with Env for binding to CD4 (OKT4, BioLegend, San Diego, CA) or with a FITC anti-CD4 antibody that competes with Env for the CD4 26 binding site (RPA-T4, BioLegend, San Diego, CA). Stained PBMC were analyzed using the Accuri C6 flow cytometer San Jose, Ca). endocytosis: THP-1 cells were treated with APC-labeled Env-Fc on ice for surface staining, or warmed to 37oC for 10, 30 or 60 minutes to allow protein internalization. Treated cells were washed and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. A cytospin centrifuge was used to concentrate fixed cells (800 rpm, 10 min) on microscope slides. Specimens were overlayed with ProLong Gold Anti-fade reagent containing 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) and cover slips were added 30 min prior to observation with confocal microscopy. An LSM 510 Meta microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy Ltd., Jena, Germany) was used for confocal studies. 2.4 Animals, Immunizations Rhesus macaques: Juvenile rhesus macaques with equal numbers of males and females, were obtained from commercial suppliers. Animal housing and experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Immunizations: Rhesus macaques were immunized according to the immunization schedule in Table 1.1. Protein immunogens plus adjuvant were formulated in 0.1 ml or .5 ml of sterile saline for intransal (i.n.) or intramuscular (IM) immunizations, respectively. IM immunizations were delivered into the thigh. Blood samples were collected from animals that had received Ketamine restraint anesthesia. Venous blood samples were obtained and immune responses were analyzed. 27 2.5 ELISA HIVBaL Env gp120, Full Length Single Chain (FLSC) ELISA: 96-well microtiter ELISA plates were coated with 5 \u00b5g/ml antigen (BaL gp120 or FLSC) in sodium bicarbonate solution, pH 9.6 (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc, Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated overnight at 4oC. Plates were washed with PBS/0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and blocked with 5% BSA for 1.5 hours at 37oC. After washing 4 times, 100 ul of animal serum or VRC01 monoclonal antibody standard were added in duplicate wells; antibody concentrations were determined in control tests. Experimental serum samples added to coated plates were incubated for 1.5 hours at 37oC and washed 6 times. 100 ul HRP-conjugated sheep anti-human IgG (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) were added at a 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 1 hr at 37oC. Plates were washed 6 times again and 100 ul of TMB Ultra solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) were added for 15 min. The reaction was quenched with 100 ul 0.16M sulfuric acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm. CD4i specific IgG levels were measured in ELISA assays using FLSC bound to the plate. Animal sera were pre-adsorbed with 10 \u00b5g BaL gp120 for 30 minutes at 4oC to block gp120-specific antibodies and reveal only the fraction of antibodies specific for the conformationally constrained FLSC. V1V2 glycopeptide ELISA: 96-well microtiter at 4oC with 40 \u00b5g/ml Neutravidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). After washing with .5% PBS-T, nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by treating plates with 5% sodium caseinate (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) for 1 hr. at 37oC. 28 Plates were washed before adding 2 \u00b5g/ml biotinylated V1V2 CAP-GP6 glycopeptide (Amin et casein. Plates were incubated at 37oC for 1 hr and washed again with 0.5% PBS-T. Serum samples were diluted 1:10 in 1% casein adding to the plate. Monoclonal antibody standard PG9 IgG (NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH) was suspended in 1% casein and added to plates beginning with a concentration of 20 \u00b5g/ml and diluting 1:3 in serial fashion. Treated plates were incubated for 2 hr. at 37oC then washed with 0.5% PBS-T. HRP-conjugated sheep 0.5% PBS-T and incubated for 1 hr at 37oC. After washing, TMB Ultra solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) was added for 20 min and the reaction was quenched with 100 ul 0.16M sulfuric acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm. Calculations: All samples were run in duplicate. Average optical density (OD) values were adjusted by subtracting the background OD values (blank wells with zero added standard). Pre-immunization (Week 0) serum IgG levels were subtracted from the Week 7 serum concentrations. The concentration of HIV-1 IgG antibody was calculated relative to the standard curve using a 4-parameter fit curve that was generated using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, Ca). 2.6 HIV Neutralization Assays Serum antibody neutralization titers were detected by measuring a reduction in virus infection using TZM-bl cells as the target for HIV (Montefiori 2009; Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al. 2014). Briefly, heat inactivated sera (56oC, 1 hr) were combined with Tier 1A, 1B, or 29 Tier 2 Clade B Env-pseudotyped viruses and overlayed on virus permissive TZM-bl expressing a Tat-regulated Firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter gene. Luciferase signal, measured in relative luminescence units (RLU), is directly proportional to infectious virus particles. Neutralization titers are reported as the dilution at which the RLU declined to 50% of the maximum RLU from virus control wells (no test sample) after subtraction of background luminescence in cell control wells. The lower limit of detection was a neutralizing titer of 20. (ADCC-GTL) assay (described (Pollara et al. 2011)) was used to measure ADCC activity in macaque sera. Recombinant HIVBaL gp120 was used coat target CEM.NKRCCR5 cells in the GTL assay. Pre-immunization or Week 7 macaque sera were used to decorate the gp120-coated cells. PBMC obtained from an HIV seronegative healthy donor were used effectors. Effector cell-derived Granzyme B hydrolyzes a fluorogenic peptide substrate within target cells, generating a fluorescent signal that allows individual target cells that have received a lethal hit to be identified by flow cytometry. ADCC is measured as the percentage of target cells with Granzyme B activity. The cut-off for positivity in the GTL assay was >8% of Granzyme B activity. The recombinant gp120 representing the HIVBaL isolate was chosen because it matched the immunogen used in the vaccine study. 2.8 Reverse Transcription - Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction The mRNA expression of IL-8 in THP-1 cells was determined by qRT-PCR. RNA was isolated from cells with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany). The 30 cDNA was synthesized using 500 ng of RNA and the iScript Synthesis Kit (Catalog # 170-8891, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Target gene expression was determined using cDNA and IL-8 primers with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Catalog # 172-5120, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA) on the Applied Biosystems StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR system (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). The cDNA of each sample was measured two times, and the averaged cycle threshold (CT) was used. Relative mRNA levels of IL-8 were normalized to the 18S house keeping gene in each sample and then normalized to the unstimulated THP-1 control. Measurements were based on the 2 -CT = avg = (CT)sample - (CT)control; 2 -CT was the relative fold change. 31 Chapter 3: Subunit Mucosal Vaccine Strategy Targeting FcRn 3.1 Introduction For a pathogen like HIV, which has a mucosal portal of entry during sexual transmission, local mucosal defenses might be able to block newly acquired HIV from spreading and/or establishing latency. However, the mucosal epithelium is a major barrier to mucosal immunization. To overcome this barrier, mucosal vaccine strategies have tried to mimic the infectious process by relying on live attenuated mucosal pathogens or bacterial/viral vectors expressing vaccine immunogens (Lycke 2012). Safety concerns associated with the use of live attenuated vaccines combined with the potential for pre-existing immunity to vector-specific vaccines makes subunit mucosal vaccination an attractive strategy if it can be delivered efficiently. FcRn-mediated bidirectional transport of IgG IC (Dickinson et al. 1999; Claypool et al. 2004; Yoshida et al. 2004), as well as its capacity for enhancement of IgG IC antigen presentation (Qiao et al. 2008) and cross presentation (Baker et al. 2011), highlights the immunoprotective roles of this receptor and underlines the advantages of targeting FcRn for mucosal vaccine design. Mouse studies have tested a subunit mucosal vaccination strategy that exploits the FcRn receptor. For example, intranasal (i.n.) immunization with inactivated Francisella tularensis that was complexed with mouse IgG2a induced stronger IgA responses in mice compared to uncomplexed iFt and enhanced protection against a virulent strain of F. tularensis (Rawool et al. 2008). Mice immunized intranasally with an protein containing efficiently transcytosed gD-Fc across airway epithelia compared to FcRn knockout 32 (KO) mice or mice immunized with gD alone. In addition, WT mice generated durable systemic and mucosal immune responses and were protected from intravaginal challenge with HSV-2 for up to 6 months after immunization (Ye et al. 2011). A similar study using HIV Gag-Fc showed that wild-type mice with FcRn exhibited significantly better immune responses and higher protection upon viral challenge compared to mice given Gag (without Fc) or when either immunogen was used in FcRn knock-out mice (Lu et al. 2011). These studies demonstrated the effectiveness of targeting FcRn for developing a potent subunit vaccine for mucosal delivery. Many HIV vaccine programs focus primarily on the gp120 portion of HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) to elicit protective immunity (Sliepen et al. 2016). Considering the potential advantages of Fc fusion protein vaccines that were observed in mouse studies, we wanted to test whether targeting Env to FcRn would result in efficient delivery to mucosal sites and enhanced immune responses in rhesus macaques. We developed a fusion protein immunogen consisting of HIV gp120 (BaL strain) attached at its carboxyl terminus to a Gly/Ser linker that was in turn fused to each arm of the dimeric Fc domain from rhesus IgG1 (Env-Fc). We also generated a mutant fusion protein (Env-Fc Mut) by introducing point mutations (H310A and H435A) known to prevent FcRn binding to the IgG Fc-domain (Shields et al. 2001). We confirmed the biochemical integrity of fusion proteins and immunized rhesus macaques by the i.n. route. We hypothesized that Env-Fc, by binding FcRn and possibly other Fc gamma receptors (FcR), would be a more potent immunogen compared to Env-Fc Mut due to FcRn-mediated transcytosis across the nasal epithelium and immune enhancing properties of FcRs (Raghavan et al. 1994). 33 3.2 Results 3.2.1 Env-Fc design, expression, and functional characterization We engineered an Env-Fc construct containing gp120 (Env) fused to rhesus IgG1 linker. The IgG1 Fc binds activating FcRs with higher affinity compared to other IgG subclasses (Guilliams et al. 2014). In our constructs, the gp120 molecule (plus the G/S linker) is fused to each chain of a dimeric Fc fragment including the hinge region (Figure 3.1A). Env-Fc Mut contains point mutations (H310A and H435A) in the Fc known to prevent IgG binding to FcRn. Env-Fc DNA expression constructs were transfected into CHO cells and Fc fusion protein expression was verified by western blot (Figure 3.1B). Functional testing of the Fc-domain was confirmed by precipitating Env-Fc, but not Env-Fc Mut proteins, with Staphylococcal Protein A on beads (Figure 3.1C). It has been shown that protein A and FcRn recognize overlapping amino acids of IgG Fc and mutations in this region can affect binding properties (Raghavan et al. 1994; Popov et al. 1996). As a result, protein A effectively and competitively inhibits IgG binding to FcRn. Figure 3.1C shows that the Fc portion of Env-Fc dictates binding for FcRn and binding is abrogated in the Env Fc-Mut version. We assessed the functional integrity of Env-Fc by testing its binding to cell surface FcRs or CD4 receptors. Flow cytometry measured cell surface binding and confocal microscopy demonstrated protein uptake into cytoplasmic human leukemic monocytic/macrophage cell line (Tsuchiya et al. 1980), was used to measure Env-Fc 34 Figure 3.1 Design and Expression of Env-Fc and Env-Fc Mut fusion proteins A) Schematic of Env-Fc fusion protein. An HIVBaL envelope glycoprotein gp120 (Env) is fused to each arm of the rhesus IgG1 Fc fragment (including the hinge) through a Gly/Ser linker. Env-Fc Mut contains point mutations (H310A and H435A) in the Fc domain designed to abrogate binding to FcRn (and also to Staphylococcal Protein A). B) Western blot illustrates the expression of Env-Fc WT or Mut when probed with anti-rhesus anti-gp120.

Western blot was probed with anti-gp120. 35 binding to FcRs and internalization into cytoplasmic vesicles. First, we performed an assay to test Env-Fc binds FcRs We pre-incubated THP-1 with unlabeled HIVBaL gp120 to block any Env-Fc binding to cell surface CD4. THP-1 cells, treated with gp120, were incubated with various concentrations of unlabeled IgG Fc fragment, washed, and stained with APC-labeled Env-Fc. As expected, the highest mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) signal from labeled Env-Fc was achieved when no competing Fc fragments were present. When cells were treated with increasing amounts of Fc fragment, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of Env-Fc binding (Figure 3.2A). We next tested whether Env-Fc binds to cell surface CD4. PBMCs were incubated with saturating concentrations (determined previously) of Fc fragment before Env-Fc was added. We tested for Env binding to CD4 by staining with either an RPA-T4 antibody that does not bind when CD4 is occupied by the Env glycoprotein or an OKT-4 antibody that binds CD4 in the presence or absence of Env glycoprotein. After adding Env-Fc, RPA-T4 binding was decreased showing that our fusion protein was binding to CD4 on PBMC (Figure 3.2B). Judging by FcRs and CD4 binding, our Env-Fc appeared to be intact with normal ligand activities. We measured the rates for FcR-mediated Env-Fc uptake into THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells were HIVBaL gp120 and then stained with APC-labeled Env-Fc on ice (surface staining) or at 37oC (allows internalization) for 10, 30 or 60 mins. Confocal microscopy images demonstrated capping of bound Env-Fc by 10 mins, and most of the Env-Fc was present in cytoplasmic vesicles that are probably endosomes within 30 mins (Figure 3.2C). We did not measure rates for Env-Fc internalization mediated by binding 36 Figure 3.2 Functional characterization of Env-Fc A) Env-Fc binding to Fc gamma receptors (FcgRs) cells. cells were with to block Env-Fc binding to CD4 receptors.

MFI, mean fluorescence intensity. B) Env-Fc binding to CD4 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). FcRs on 37 PBMC were blocked with IgG Fc fragments. PBMCs were stained with unlabeled Env-Fc and either FITC-labeled RPA-T4, which competes with Env for binding CD4, or FITC OKT-4, which binds a from Env. RPA-T4 and OKT-4 binding to PBMC without prior addition of Env-Fc is also shown. C) Env-Fc rate of internalization into THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells were with HIVBaL gp120 and then stained with APC-labeled Env-Fc on ice for surface staining, or at 37oC for 10, 30 or 60 minutes to allow uptake. Cells were visualized with confocal microscopy. 38 to both FcR 3.2 Rhesus macaque immunization with Env-Fc or Mut immunized with either 100 \u00b5g Env-Fc or Env-Fc Mut plus 50 \u00b5g CpG adjuvant by the i.n. route at weeks 0 and 4. Blood was drawn at weeks 0 (pre-immunization), 4 (primary response), and 7 (secondary response). Each group contained six animals. At week 9, Env-Fc was administered to all twelve animals by the intramuscular (IM) route; blood was drawn at week 12 and used for evaluating immune responses (Figure 3.3). Env-specific serum IgG levels were measured using ELISA. Pre-immunization background levels were subtracted for each animal. We did not detect primary immune responses (Week 4) in any animals and Week 7 responses were low. Interestingly, while five out of six animals in the Env-Fc Mut group had detectable anti-Env serum IgG levels, responses were seen in only one animal of the Env-Fc group (Table 3.1). Week 7 cell-mediated immune responses, measured by Env peptide-stimulated CD4+ or CD8+ T cell production of IL-2, IFN-, or TNF-, did not differ between the Env-Fc and Env-Fc Mut groups (Figure 3.4). To confirm that animals were primed by the initial intranasal doses, we immunized all monkeys with Env-Fc using the IM route. Results of the IM immunization showed high levels of serum anti-Env IgG antibodies in two out six animals in the Env-Fc group and four out of six animals in the Env-Fc Mut group. The high antibody responses corresponded to the levels achieved with two intramuscular immunizations (conducted in a different set of animals as described in Chapter 4), suggesting the high responders here had previously been primed (Figure 3.5). 39 Figure 3.3 Immunization Schedule Animals were immunized at weeks 0 and 4 by the intranasal (i.n.) route with 100 \u00b5g Env-Fc or Env-Fc Mut plus 50 \u00b5g CpG adjuvant. Six animals were assigned to each group. All animals then received 100 \u00b5g Env-Fc plus 50 \u00b5g CpG via the intramuscular (IM) route at week 9. Blood was drawn at weeks 0, 4, 7, and 12. 40 41 Figure 3.4 Cell mediated immune responses to i.n. immunization with Env-Fc or Env-Fc Mut Cells were stimulated with overlapping Env peptides, anti-CD28, and anti-CD49d, and intracellular staining was carried out to determine the frequency of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells producing IL-2, IFN- , or TNF- in each animal. Frequencies were adjusted for background where cells were not stimulated with peptides. 42 Figure 3.5 Anti-Env IgG levels in macaques after IM cross-prime with Env-Fc ELISA was used to measure Env-specific IgG levels at week 12. All animals, whether they were originally primed intranasally with Env-Fc or Env-Fc Mut, received Env-Fc IM at week 9. 43 3.3 Discussion We engineered Fc fusion protein immunogens to test a strategy for FcRn-mediated delivery of subunit vaccine candidates to mucosal sites. The fusion protein, Env-Fc, contained the gp120 portion of HIV envelope glycoprotein from the BaL strain joined at the C-terminus to a poly-serine/glycine linker, in turn, joined at the C-terminus to the Fc region of rhesus macaque IgG1. Mutant fusion protein, Env-Fc Mut, was designed similarly, but contained mutations (H310A and H435A) in the Fc that disrupt binding to FcRn. Both dimeric fusion proteins were highly expressed in CHO cells. Env-Fc Mut was shown to not bind Staphylococcal Protein A, which suggests it does not bind to FcRn since FcRn and Protein A bind to the same sites on Fc (Raghavan et al. 1994; Popov et al. 1996; Barnett et al. 2008). Env-Fc was functionally intact, judged by its binding to CD4 or Fc gamma cell surface receptors, and was internalized into cytoplasmic vesicles of THP-1 cells. Rhesus macaques were immunized with fusion protein plus soluble CpG adjuvant and the magnitude of IgG antibody responses against fusion protein was evaluated. After two i.n. immunizations, responses were minimal in both the Env-Fc and the Env-Fc Mut-immunized groups. Low or undetectable serum levels as a result of i.n. immunization of macaques with recombinant Env have previously been reported (Barnett et al. 2008). In our study, cross prime immunization with Env-Fc by IM route resulted in high levels of Env-specific serum IgG in in two out of six animals in the Env-Fc group and four out of six animals in the Env-Fc Mut group. We did not expect Env-Fc Mut-immunized animals to be primed and elicit a response since Env-Fc Mut FcRn-mediated delivery should not be intact. However, it was demonstrated that i.n. immunization with 44 recombinant HIVSF162 Env gp140 followed by IM immunization elicited immune responses in rhesus macaques (Barnett et al. 2008). This result suggested that FcRn-mediated delivery was not essential for Env immunogenicity. Env is a heavily glycosylated molecule, which might have supported its non-specific entry to mucosal associated lymphoid tissues (MALT). In mouse immunization studies with Env-Fc or Env-Fc Mut, similar results were seen where Env-Fc Mut crosses the mucosal surface and elicits a response (personal communication, Dr. Xiaoping Zhu). Higher average Env-specific IgG levels were generated in the Env-Fc Mut group compared to the Env-Fc group. A possible explanation for these results could be that Env-Fc, but not Env-Fc Mut, was recycled back to apical surfaces by FcRn, which carries out bidirectional transport of IgG cargo (Li et al. 2011). Thus, there would be a higher bioavailability of Env-Fc Mut that would lead to enhanced responses. We did not investigate how Env-Fc responses compare to Env alone in the i.n. route of immunization. While Env-Fc induced lower IgG levels than the mutant, it might be a superior immunogen to Env because of its ability to interact with FcRs on immune cells that would endow it with adjuvant-like qualities. Our work suggests that Env-Fc Mut is the most potent immunogen compared to Env-Fc, and probably compared to Env; this may be due to Env-Fc Mut gaining access to mucosal lymphoid tissues and interacting with FcRs, but not FcRn. Further studies would need to be conducted to show this definitively. 45 Chapter 4: Improved immunogenicity of an Env-Fc fusion protein 4.1 Introduction Developing a preventive HIV vaccine remains an unmet global public health goal. The RV144 Thai trial consisted of a prime-boost strategy that combined recombinant canarypox vaccine with monomeric gp120 Envelope glycoprotein (Env) and reduced transmission (Rerks-Ngarm et al. 2009). This vaccine strategy showed that improvements were needed to increase the quantity, quality, and durability of immune responses. Current research on HIV vaccines focuses on improving the immunogenicity of Env to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb) and other antibody effector activities capable of protecting against multiple strains of HIV. Strategies being pursued include modifying the conformation or glycosylation patterns of Env to expose conserved sites or multimerizing critical epitopes using scaffold proteins in order to enhance the immune response (reviewed in (Kong et al. 2012)). Immunization studies in mice tested recombinant fusion proteins where HIV proteins were fused to IgG Fc and showed improvements in the immune responses. When p55 Gag or Env V3 loop were fused to murine Fc from the IgG2a subclass, which binds with the highest affinity to activating Fc gamma receptors (FcR) in mice, immune responses were stronger than when Fc from the weakly binding subclass IgG1 Fc were used (Zaharatos et al. 2011). Mice immunized with gp41 prehairpin fusion intermediate attached to a Fc developed neutralizing antibody responses against HIVIIIb (Qi et al. 2010). Immunizing mice with HIVCN54 gp120 fused to IgG Fc (gp120-Fc) elicited Env-specific humoral responses in the absence of adjuvant suggesting that the Fc sequence 46 increased the vaccine potency (Chen et al. 2007). Our group constructed fusion proteins containing HIV-1 gp120 (BaL strain) and the Fc region from rhesus IgG1 (Env-Fc) to test whether immune responses against a weak immunogen could be improved in rhesus macaques. Our findings show that Env-Fc fusion proteins were more potent than monomeric Env alone and highlight the potential for improving quantity and quality of antibody responses by incorporating an Fc region within a protein immunogen. 4.2 Results 4.2.1 Env-Fc elicits IgG titers Rhesus macaques or by the intramuscular (IM) route to test whether Env-Fc is more immunogenic than Env. The six animals in the Env-Fc group and five animals in the Env group each received 100 \u00b5g immunogen plus 50 \u00b5g CpG adjuvant by IM route at Week 0 and again at Week 4. Sera were collected three weeks after the second immunization, at Week 7 (at which peak immune responses were reached), and ELISA was used to test for total IgG levels (Figure 4.1A). ELISA measurements were corrected by subtracting pre-immunization background levels for each animal. Serum anti-Env IgG levels were higher for the Env-Fc group than the Env group at 7 weeks after immunization (trending towards significance, p = 0.06) (Figure 4.1B). These differences in week 7 sera between the Env-Fc and Env groups became significantly more pronounced (p = 0.02) when measuring IgG levels specific for the FLSC protein (Fouts et al. 2000) (Figure 4.1C). FLSC contains gp120 fused to a flexible linker plus domains 1 and 2 of CD4 such that the CD4 binding site is always occupied 47 E) Env-rFc rate of internalization into THP-1 cells. THP-1 were stained with APC-labeled Env-rFc on ice for surface staining, or at 37oC for 10, 30 or 60 minutes to allow uptake. Cells were visualized with confocal microscopy.

Blood was drawn at weeks 0 (pre-immunization), 4, and 7 (peak immune responses). The Env-Fc group consists of 6 animals and the Env group consists of 5 animals. B-C) Anti-Env (B) and anti-FLSC (C) Week 7 serum IgG levels were measured by ELISA. P values were calculated using an unpaired t-test. D) The difference in Env-specific versus FLSC specific IgG responses within each animal in a group. P-value was calculated using the paired Student t-test. E) Anti-CD4i responses were measured by ELISA. Plates were coated with FLSC. Prior to addition, animal sera was preadsorbed with HIVBaL gp120 such that only conformationally induced CD4i specific IgG were detected. P-value was calculated using the Mann-Whitney test. 49 and gp120 is always in the open, or CD4-induced (CD4i), conformation (Fouts et al. 2000). Thus, FLSC exposes epitopes that are less accessible in the native, or closed conformation of Env. We assessed the breadth of antibody responses by comparing binding of serum antibodies to Env or FLSC. In the Env-Fc animals, there were significant increases in anti-FLSC IgG levels compared to their anti-Env levels, suggesting a broadening of the immune response in monkeys receiving the fusion protein. Anti-FLSC IgG responses in the Env group were below the anti-Env IgG levels (Figure 4.1D). The increase in the breadth of serum responses seen in the Env-Fc group was further demonstrated by the presence of serum IgG reacting to CD4i epitopes in 5/6 animals from the Env-Fc group and none of the Env group animals (Figure 4.1E). The anti-CD4i IgG response comprised approximately 20% of the total IgG FLSC specific response (Supplementary Table 4.1). These results show that targeting Env immunogen to Fc receptors by fusing it to an IgG Fc augments peak immune responses and broadens the Env-Fc immunization elicits a neutralizing antibody and ADCC response We tested whether Env-Fc immunization elicited antibodies against a specific epitope of the gp120 V1V2 loop that is the binding site of PG9 and PG16 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb) (Walker et al. A synthetic, biotinylated V1V2 cyclic glycopeptide (amino acids 154-177) derived from the HIV-1 CAP45 sequence (Amin et al. 2013) was bound to neutravidin coated plates. The V1V2 glycopeptide contains a Man5GlcNAc2 glycan the a terminal sialylated complex-type N-glycan at Asn156, which are critical for binding by PG9 and PG16 (Amin et al. 2013).

Week 7 sera were overlayed and anti-V1V2 glycopeptide serum IgG responses by ELISA. 52 -specific IgG, with average serum levels twice as high as the anti-V1V2 IgG amount elicited by one animal in the Env group (Figure 4.2). We next tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies at week 7 using the TZM-bl cell assay (Montefiori 2009; Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al. 2014). Sera were combined with virus, overlaid on virus permissive TZM-bl cells expressing a Tat-regulated Firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter gene, and neutralization titers were reported as the dilution at which the luciferase signal declined to 50% of the maximum (from virus control wells). Six of six animals of the Env-Fc group had modest levels of neutralizing antibodies against Tier 1A MN.3 virus (range of titer: 30-341; average neutralization titer: 143), but neutralizing activity was not detected in sera from the Env immunization group (ID50 values were below the minimum serum dilution of 20) (Table 4.2). We were not able to detect neutralization activity against the more resistant Tier 1B or Tier 2 viruses in any of the sera tested. We measured serum ADCC activity using a standard flow cytometry based ADCC-GranToxiLux (ADCC-GTL) assay (described in (Pollara et al. 2011)). ADCC was detected in four of six Env-Fc immunized animals but in none of the Env-immunized animals (Figure 4.3). The range of ADCC antibody titers was between 1:132 and 1:330; the range of maximum ADCC activity was between 8.82 and 20.83% Granzyme B activity. 4.2.3 Immunization with Env-Fc yields a more durable immune response The decay rates for Env or FLSC binding antibodies were measured during the 49 weeks after immunization. Antibody levels in animals immunized with the serum dilution at which relative luminescence units (RLUs) were reduced 50% compared to virus control wells (no test sample). The lower limit of detection is a neutralizing titer of 20. All pre-immunization titers were below 20 (data not shown).ID50 in TZM-bl assay in sera of Env-Fc or Env-immunized animals. CEM.NKRCCR5 target cells were coated with HIVBaL gp120, which was the immunogen used to immunized animals.

Antibody levels during the apparent plateau, starting at week 17 in the Env-Fc group, were 5 times higher than levels seen in the Env group (Table 4.3). By week 49, antibody levels in the Env-Fc group were 10 times above those in the Env-immunized animals. A caveat here is that animals from Env-Fc or Env groups were randomized and then boosted by intranasal dosing at week 17 with either Env-Fc, a mutant Env-Fc that does not bind to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) for IgG, or Env; responses, measured at week 21, were weakly boosted (Table 4.3). It was still possible to discern what seemed to be a plateau at week 49. In animals immunized with Env-Fc, the portion of antibodies specifically binding to FLSC declined more rapidly than Env binding titer. By weeks 7 or 12, FLSC binding titers were 1.6 times higher than Env binding titers, but by week 17, they were comparable. Thus, CD4i specific responses were only detectable for about 10 weeks after the peak response time point. 56 Figure 4.4 Env-Fc immunization elicits a more durable immune response than Env immunization Anti-Env (circle) or anti-FLSC (square) IgG responses in the Env (solid line) and Env-Fc (dashed line) groups were measured with ELISA.

Compared to monomeric gp120, the Env-Fc protein showed increased potency, greater breadth and functionality of antibody responses including both neutralizing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity, and enhanced durability of serum antibody responses. Immunization studies with Env-Fc employed the soluble adjuvant, CpG, and intramuscular route of delivery. After two immunizations with Env-Fc, macaques showed higher peak titers for gp120-binding antibodies compared to animals immunized with gp120 alone. Env-Fc was more potent for inducing antibody responses to the CD4-induced epitopes on gp120 and to the V1V2 loop. While we were able to measure antibodies against these conformational epitopes in sera from Env-Fc immunized macaques, these responses were short duration and decayed more rapidly than the overall gp120-binding antibodies. The gp120-binding antibodies were more durable in the Env-Fc immunized macaques with an apparent plateau phase extending nearly one year after the last immunization. Modest neutralizing activity against Tier 1 A virus was detected only in animals immunized with Env-Fc. Similar results were observed when immune sera were tested for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Again, only the Env-Fc animals manifested serum antibodies capable of directing the killing of cellular targets in a standard ADCC-GTL assay. The peak titers of gp120 binding antibody responses among Env-Fc immunized macaques were similar or greater than levels observed using gp120 alone (Kumar et al. 2000) or following a DNA priming/recombinant viral vector boosting strategy ((Seaman 59 et al. 2005), (Lai et al. 2012)). Gp120-binding antibody titers greater than what we attained have been reported by others using more extensive immunization regimens and/or incorporating more potent adjuvants (Li et al. 2013). Broadening the antibody response to increase recognition of CD4-induced epitopes had been achieved using the full-length single chain version of gp120 (DeVico et al. 2007) and the Fc fusion protein studied here also produced CD4i targeting antibodies. Neutralizing antibody responses obtained in our Env-Fc immunized macaques are probably insufficient to protect animals from homologous or heterologous virus challenge ((Shingai et al. 2014), (McCoy et al. 2013)); for this reason, we chose not to challenge macaques in this study with infectious virus. However, responses to Env-Fc were substantially improved over what has been achieved using monomeric gp120 ((DeVico et al. 2007), (Kovacs et al. 2012), (Kumar et al. 2000)). Of critical importance to our work is that Env-Fc immunogen was superior to gp120 for inducing the modest neutralizing antibody responses reported here, suggesting that addition of an Fc fragment altered both the quantity and quality of resulting serum antibodies. Inasmuch as we have not tested a broad range of adjuvants nor did we conduct extensive tests to optimize dose and schedule for immunization, it is notable that Env-Fc was capable of improving the immune response. Monomeric gp120 alone has not elicited strong protective immunity in macaque models (Kumar et al. 2000) or human clinical trials ((2003), (Rerks-Ngarm et al. 2009), (Robb et al. 2012)). Here, we asked whether immune responses to gp120 could be improved by building an Env-Fc fusion protein that would carry two molecules of gp120 and bind to cell surface Fc receptors to mimic some properties of IgG immune complexes 60 (IC). The IC engages FcRs and augments cell-mediated and humoral responses to immunogens bound by the antibody Fab regions (reviewed in (Brady 2005)). Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for IC effects on immunity (reviewed in (Brady 2005), (Bournazos et al. 2015)). IC binding to activating FcRs on dendritic cells (DCs) induces maturation, with consequent MHC and costimulatory molecule upregulation, and leads to enhanced antigen presentation ((Akiyama et al. 2003), (Sallusto et al. 1994), (Regnault et al. 1999)). Further, IC are deposited on follicular dendritic cells (FDC) within lymphoid follicles immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity maturation (Aydar et al. 2005). We also know that the capacity for binding to FcRn is important for increasing the half-life of IgG molecules (Roopenian et al. 2007). Since Env-Fc contains an FcRn binding site, it is expected to recycle through acidic cytoplasmic vesicles (such as endosomes) and release back into the extracellular milieu without degradation, similar to the trafficking of non-complexed IgG. This recycling mechanism increases IgG half-life by allowing temporary protection from catabolism in the harsh circulatory environment (Roopenian et al. 2003) and should also increase the half-life of Env-Fc and influence the serum antibody response to immunization. Our study was designed to make a preliminary assessment of the effect of adding Fc to gp120 in terms of altering the quantity or quality of resulting antibody responses. We did not attempt to optimize the immunogen by changing formulation, adjuvant composition, or immunization schedule, by including a prime-boost component or giving repeat doses. We reasoned that gp120 was unlikely to suffice as a component of preventive HIV vaccine, and that current status of the field was focused on well-ordered 61 envelope glycoprotein immunogens that may be found as trimers or other conformationally constrained molecules (Nabel et al. 2011). Based on our results we would argue that adding Fc segments to any of the high-performing envelope glycoprotein immunogens may improve their capacity to elicit durable antibody and such modifications should be considered as part of the vaccine development pathway. We note the previous publication from our group showing that a fusion protein containing HIV p24 Gag linked to mouse Fc (Lu et al. 2011) was extraordinarily potent for eliciting cellular or antibody responses. Perhaps Fc is a generally useful modification for immunogens and may bridge the gap between current products and truly effective HIV vaccines. 62 Chapter 5: Conjugating muramyl dipeptide adjuvant to an Env-Fc fusion protein 5.1 Introduction Immunization with a protein subunit immunogen requires co-administration of an adjuvant to elicit a proinflammatory immune response and overcome the tolerant environment of the mucosa. We set out to test the idea that adjuvants can be conjugated directly to fusion protein immunogens and delivered to dendritic cells that are binding and internalizing Env-Fc through cell surface Fc receptors. The potential advantages for conjugated adjuvants are that we can reduce the dose and avoid off-target effects including inflammation and tissue necrosis. The potential disadvantages include inactivating the adjuvant when it is derivatized, failing to release adjuvant from Env-Fc after internalization, or delivering insufficient number of adjuvant molecules to trigger cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRR). We selected the muramyl dipeptide (MDP) adjuvant to co-deliver with Fc fusion protein. MDP is a breakdown product of bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) that bears the N-acetylmuramic acid moiety with two coupled amino acids. In the 1970's, it was shown to be the minimal structure of PGN with adjuvant activity (Ellouz et al. 1974; Traub et al. 2006). MDP is a ligand cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) PRR, and has been reported to stimulate DC to produce proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 (Strober et al. 2011). We covalently attached to sialic acid residues on gp120 of Env-Fc (MDP-Env-Fc) to deliver both 63 antigen and adjuvant to the same subcellular compartment of an APC (collaboration with Dr. Wang, IHV). It was shown that DC can discriminate the contents within a phagosome as self versus non-self, selecting only the materials containing TLR ligands for antigen presentation (Blander et al. 2006). By chemically modifying our Fc fusion protein to contain MDP, we focus adjuvant delivery specifically to the cells receiving antigen and hope to stimulate proinflammatory responses by APC to equivalent or perhaps higher levels than that which could be achieved with co-delivery of soluble MDP. At the higher concentrations needed for soluble MDP, there would be a risk for inflammatory responses. MDP-Env-Fc immunogen might reduce the total MDP concentration necessary to generate a strong immune response. The mechanism for adjuvanticity involves uptake of MDP into endosomes where it binds the cytosolic NOD2 innate immune sensor. It was reported recently that two specific transporters promote MDP egress into the cytosol (Nakamura et al. 2014). They are expressed on DC endosomal membranes and are upregulated by stimulation with LPS. In addition, the endosome itself can serve as a platform for MDP dependent signaling through NOD2. Upon LPS stimulation, NOD2 colocalizes with endosomal transporters and recruits downstream signaling effectors (Nakamura et al. 2014). Expression of MDP-specific transporters by DC highlights that the immune system has evolved mechanisms to recognize this molecule during infection. Given the reported immune amplifying effects of MDP that result in humoral and cell-mediated responses, MDP, in combination with other TLR agonists (such as LPS or CpG), would serve as a good adjuvant for a vaccine (Shafique et al. 2013). 64 We conjugated MDP to Env-Fc using a series of enzymatic reactions. At the time that we were conducting these studies, we had first synthesized an MDP intermediate compound (containing a linker through which MDP would be attached to Env-Fc) as well as the MDP derivative that would be expected to release when the conjugate gets into cells. We began our studies by first measuring the biological integrity of these modified MDP compounds and comparing them to a commercially produced MDP using a THP-1/IL-8 bioassay based on reports that MDP induces IL-8 in THP-1 cells (Yang et al. 2001). We then compared the immunogenicity of MDP-Env-Fc to Env-Fc alone through immunization studies in rhesus macaque models. 5.2 Results 5.2.1 Chemical onto by chemoenzymatic remodeling of sialic acid to link MDP to Env-Fc through the sialic acid residues on gp120 (Figure 5.1). A disulfide linker was installed in the conjugate, which should be cleavable intracellularly to release MDP once delivered into the dendritic cells. It was previously reported that MDP can be modified at the free carboxyl group or at the 6-position of the sugar moiety for conjugation to other molecules (such as paclitaxel and a biotin moiety), and the resulting conjugates were equally efficient to activate NOD2 (Grimes et al. 2010). MDP was conjugated to gp120-Fc through its free carboxyl group. Test compound 1, T-1, is a commercially purchased, unmodified MDP; T-2 is MDP with the chemically attached linker that will be directly conjugated to Env-Fc; and T-3 is the soluble MDP compound that will result after the disulfide bond within the linker (in T-2) 65 Figure 5.1 Synthesis of the MDP-Env-Fc Conjugate For MDP to Env-Fc, cleavable linker is added onto MDP, which will then be added to Env-Fc. MDP (from Sigma), or T-1, was first activated via the free carboxyl group by reaction with N-hydroxylsuccinimide (NHS) to give the NHS ester of MDP. This activated ester was coupled with a cleavable linker (with a disulfide bond in the molecule) and was activated in the form of the NHS ester to obtain test compound 2 (T-2), which is ready for the conjugation to the recombinant gp120-Fc. T-2 was purified by HPLC and its identity was confirmed by NMR and ESI-MS analysis. Test compound 3 (T-3) is the MDP derivative that is expected to release after disulfide bond cleavage when the conjugate gets into cells. Final test compound 4 (T-4) is the MDP-Env-Fc immunogen. 66 is cleaved intracellularly. Final test compound, T-4, T-2 or T-3 We wanted to confirm that MDP test compounds, T-2 and T-3 (described in Figure 5.1), are functionally similar to T-1 (MDP from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.). T-4, or MDP-Env-Fc, had not yet been engineered at the time these studies were conducted. As shown in Figure 5.2, MDP acts synergistically with LPS to stimulate IL-8 production by THP-1 cells (Yang et al. 2001). LPS alone is able to stimulate some IL-8 production, but to a significantly lesser extent than when combined with MDP. We stimulated THP-1 cells for 24 hours with T-1, LPS, or LPS plus T-1, T-2, or T-3 and compared the differences in IL-8 mRNA levels (versus unstimulated cells) using reverse transcription - quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). As expected, T-1 alone did not induce IL-8 expression, but LPS stimulation induced an 11-fold increase in IL-8 levels (Figure 5.3). We expected that T-2 or T-3 plus LPS would induce IL-8 expression to similar levels as T-1 plus LPS. However, T-2 or T-3 plus LPS had a smaller fold increase than LPS alone; LPS combined with T-1 MDP stimulated THP-1 cells most effectively, resulting in a 23-fold increase of IL-8 expression compared to unstimulated THP-1 cells (Figure 5.3). 67 Figure 5.2 Synergistic effect of MDP with LPS on induction of IL-8 secretion in THP-1 cell cultures OCT-differentiated THP-1 cells were stimulated with MDP plus S. abortus-equi LPS at the indicated concentrations in triplicate. IL-8 levels in the culture supernatants were determined by ELISA, and the mean values are shown. **, P 0.01 versus control. Significant (P< 0.01) synergistic effects were detected by ANOVA including an interaction term. The results are representative of two different experiments. Yang S. et al., Infect Immun 2001 68 Figure 5.3 IL-8 induction in THP-1 cells RT-qPCR was used to measure the fold change in IL-8 mRNA levels upon THP-1 cell stimulation for 24 hours with MDP, LPS, or LPS plus T-1, T-2, or T-3 MDP. LPS was added at a of 10 ng/ml and T-1, T-2 or T-3 MDP was added at 1 \u00b5g/ml. The fold change in each condition is relative to the endogenous control (18S housekeeping gene) and normalized to IL-8 mRNA in conjugation of MDP to Env-Fc would enable this immunogen to induce stronger immune responses than Env-Fc immunization alone (without adjuvant). Each group had four animals and 100 \u00b5g immunogen per animal was administered via the intramuscular (IM) route at week 0 and again at week 4. Immune responses were then analyzed at week 0 and week 8 (Figure 5.4A). All animals from both groups except one macaque from the MDP-Env-Fc group (819) had previously received two intranasal (i.n.) immunizations with either WT or mutant Env-Fc and one I.M. boost with Env-Fc; 819 had been immunized with Env-Fc, twice via the IM route and then once via the i.n. route (all prior immunizations had included the CpG adjuvant). We measured serum IgG responses against Full Length Single Chain (FLSC) or CD4i epitopes in each animal. At the start of this set of immunizations (here, termed 'Week 0'), the animals belonging to the MDP-Env-Fc group basal anti-FLSC serum (average: 1175). At week 8, Env-Fc immunized a higher average anti-FLSC IgG 21,222 ng/ml) 5.4B). The large differences in the average anti-FLSC IgG levels seen at week 8 can be attributed to two high responders in the Env-Fc group compared to only 1 high responder in the MDP-Env-Fc group (Figure 5.4C). Both immunogens elicited modest CD4i specific IgG responses at similar levels (Figure 5.4D). 70 Figure 5.4 Rhesus macaque immune responses to MDP-Env-Fc or Env-Fc immunogens.

Sera were pre-adsorbed with HIVBaL gp120 prior to addition to soak up any Env-specific responses and enable the measurement of only anti-CD4i IgG levels. 71 Figure 5.4 continued A B C D 72 5.3 Discussion We conjugated MDP adjuvant with the Env-Fc immunogen to test whether covalently attached adjuvant was more potent than soluble adjuvant and whether use of lower adjuvant doses in the form of conjugates would reduce off-target effects. We synthesized an MDP test compound (T-2) that contains a linker with a disulfide bond that would be attached to Env-Fc through the sialic acid residues on gp120, and another MDP compound, T-3, which is the MDP that should be released intracellularly once MDP-Env-Fc is delivered to dendritic cells. We first tested whether these MDP compounds would be equally as potent as unmodified MDP T-1 (from Sigma) using THP-1/IL-8 bioassays. We selected the THP-1 monocytic cell line due to its resemblance to an antigen presenting cell (APC) and its expression of the NOD2 innate immune sensor (a ligand for MDP). Using RT-qPCR, we measured the fold change in IL-8 expression by THP-1 cells upon stimulation with LPS plus T-1, T-2, or T-3 MDP. Our results showed that MDP T-2 and T-3 were not as potent at inducing IL-8 as T-1 MDP. Nevertheless, we wanted to test whether MDP-Env-Fc would maintain some adjuvant activity and stimulate a proinflammatory response. We immunized rhesus monkeys with MDP-Env-Fc or Env-Fc without adjuvant. Env-Fc elicited higher average FLSC-specific responses than MDP-Env-Fc as measured by ELISA (though differences were not significant). We chose to evaluate responses against FLSC to be able to measure sera specific for epitopes that are less accessible in the native, or closed conformation of Env. FLSC contains gp120 fused to a flexible linker plus domains 1 and 2 of CD4 such that the CD4 binding site is always occupied 73 and gp120 is always in the open, or CD4-induced (CD4i), conformation (Fouts et al. 2000). Anti-CD4i responses were modest in both groups of animals. To explain the induction of strong immune responses by immunization with Env-Fc alone, we note that all animals have previously been immunized with Env-Fc by the i.n. or I.M. routes. It has previously been reported that Fc can act as a natural adjuvant (Getahun et al. 2006), therefore potentially obviating the need for additional adjuvant to initiate a proinflammatory response. Env-Fc or other recombinant immune complex protein immunization without adjuvant was able to induce immune responses in mice (Chargelegue et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2007). Our results did not support our hypothesis that MDP conjugation to Fc fusion protein would elicit a stronger response compared to Env-Fc alone. To confirm this, immunizations would need to be conducted using a higher number of animals to achieve a well powered experiment. These were preliminary studies using one experimental condition and were not optimized in terms of MDP dose, evaluation of off-target effects, or other consequences of MDP administration. A potential mechanism by which covalent attachment of MDP resulted in lower immunogenicity might be that MDP blocked recognition of Env by previously existing Env-specific antibodies. Thus, the extent of MDP conjugation is limited by the need to protect Env structural integrity and epitope accessibility. Future studies should test several ratios of MDP:Env to identify the most optimal condition for binding ligands (CD4; sera from previously and upregulating costimulatory markers, CD40 and CD86. In the scope of these studies, we did not answer whether immunization of conjugated adjuvant would be superior to soluble adjuvant co-formulated with 74 immunogen. Our in vitro work and previous studies suggest that MDP requires an additional adjuvant like LPS to elicit proinflammatory responses. Thus, future studies might consider using a different adjuvant to test this hypothesis. The question of whether covalent attachment of adjuvant has value in terms of lowering the required adjuvant dose and/or decreasing off-target effects is important and should be explored further. 75 Chapter 6: Gag-V1V2-Fc: A novel platform for delivering individual epitopes of HIV Envelope glycoprotein 6.1 Introduction The correlates of protection for HIV infection remain unknown, but data from vaccine trials have suggested that antibodies specific for Envelope glycoprotein (Env) are important for preventing virus acquisition. Structural proteins of HIV such as Gag p24 capsid elicit potent cellular immune response (Miller et al. 1991; Allen et al. 1998), but are poorer candidates for preventive vaccines. One obstacle to using Env immunogens is the diversity of circulating viral sequences. Protective effects of homologous vaccination in macaques (where immunogen sequences exactly match the challenge virus) are often lost when heterologous challenge viruses are used (Xu et al. 2006), and the failure of Env immunization in human clinical trials may be due to virus sequence variation. Approaches to overcoming the problem of virus variation include engineering novel immunogens to present only the most conserved epitopes. One conserved epitope of Env gp120 is the V1V2 region, which is a target for both neutralizing and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibodies (Walker et al. 2009; Yates et al. 2014). The V1V2 region was described as a single structural entity containing a hydrophobic core, connecting loops and disulfide bonds (Pan et al. 2015). Monoclonal antibodies, PG9 and PG16, recognize the V1V2 region. PG9 and PG16 were discovered in elite controllers and exhibit significant neutralization breadth, being able to neutralize 70-80% of >150 HIV viruses by binding the V1V2 loop (Walker et al. 2009). Vaccines developed so far do not efficiently stimulate anti-V1V2 76 responses, and only 10-20% of HIV positive individuals develop these responses after three years of infection (Kwong et al. 2011). The RV144 human Thai trial that consisted of a prime boost strategy combining recombinant canarypox vaccine with monomeric Env resulted in IgG antibodies against the V1V2 loop of gp120 that were correlated with a decreased risk of infection; however, antibody titers decreased in vaccinees after 24 weeks (Rerks-Ngarm et al. 2009; Haynes et al. 2012). One explanation for these inefficient vaccine responses is that critical neutralizing epitopes are buried within the unliganded envelope glycoprotein and are only revealed transiently during virus attachment and penetration reactions. Several groups have tested using multivalent immunogens to present isolated neutralizing antibody epitopes with a greater chance to stimulate potent neutralizing antibodies. For example, one study demonstrated that fusing gp120 V3 loop, which is a major neutralizing determinant of HIV gp120, to pentameric cholera toxin B elicited strong neutralizing responses (Totrov et al. 2010). Also, immunization with V1V2 scaffold proteins engineered to contain mannose-5 glycans at residues 156 and 160 for PG9 binding, elicited higher neutralizing antibody titers in rabbits than HIV gp120 engineered with the glycosylated PG9 epitope (Morales et al. 2014). We designed an immunogen that expresses critical epitopes in the V1V2 region of HIVBaL gp120 within a carrier protein that elicits strong T helper activity and provides highly multivalent epitope display. This is an advance on our previous work using HIV Gag-Fc fusion proteins to immunize mice by the intranasal route, where we saw potent immunity and protection against challenge with recombinant Vaccinia expressing Gag (Lu et al. 2011). Gag p24 is a self assembling molecule that contains two domains 77 separated by a linker. The N-terminal domain (NTD) associates with other p24 proteins to form rings of six (or sometimes five) p24 molecules and the C-terminal domain (CTD) links these hexamers to become a full capsid structure (Hong et al. 1993). The Gag-Fc molecule self assembled into 500 nm fibers (Lu et al. 2011). Previously, it was shown that mutation in the Cyclophilin A (CypA) binding region of self assembling HIV capsid protein still assembled into fibers but antigenicity was not reported (Kong et al. 1998). In our immunogen, the Env V1V2 loop substitutes for the Gag CypA binding loop and this chimeric molecule is fused to IgG1 (rhesus) Fc (Gag-V1V2-Fc). The self-assembling quality of Gag capsid protein allows it to serve as a scaffolding platform to multimerize the V1V2 and Fc regions of Gag-V1V2-Fc. We hypothesize that the direct presentation and multimerization of V1V2 might induce stronger responses against this region than immunization with Env, where the V1V2 loop is buried in the Env core and is inaccessible to germ-line antibodies. Further, the Fc of our immunogen might engage Fc gamma receptors (FcR), including the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) that will transcytose our immunogen across epithelial layers and thereby allow for its intact delivery to mucosal sites. Gag-V1V2-Fc:FcR interaction might enhance immunogenicity of our immunogen. We are testing the immunogenicity of given to rhesus macaques by 6.2.1 Gag-V1V2-Fc and Biochemical Characterization Gag-V1V2-Fc construct includes a CD5 secretion signal followed by p24 capsid protein with amino acids 132-202 of gp120 substituting for amino acids 216-232 of p24 (using numbering for the Gag polyprotein) that removes the 17 amino acid CypA binding 78 Figure 6.1 Biochemical characterization of Gag-V1V2-Fc A) Electron microscopy of negatively stained fibers. Three different spreads of Gag-V1V2-Fc (I-III) are compared to Gag-Fc (IV). The 500 nm reference is for panels I-III and the 100 nm reference is for panel IV (higher magnification). B) Sheep anti-gp120 was added to Gag-V1V2-Fc coated ELISA plates (coated with .3 \u00b5g/well); secondary rabbit anti-sheep Ig was used to detect responses. Positive control is BaL gp120 (coated with 1 \u00b5g/well). C) Directly-labeled human MAb PG16 was added to ELISA plates coated with increasing concentrations of Gag-V1V2-Fc (0 to 2.5 \u00b5g/well). PG16 binding was corrected by subtracting binding to an irrelevant antigen (gD-Fc). PBS control was used with no antigen added. PG9 did not bind to Gag-V1V2-Fc (not shown). D) MALDI-TOF MS analysis of N-glycans in Gag-V1V2-Fc. The N-glycan was released from the fusion protein by PNGase F digestion. The released glycans were labeled with 2-aminobenzoic acid (2-AA) through reductive amination and analyzed by a MALDI-TOF MS in negative relector mode. Blue square, N-acetylglucosamine; green circle, mannose; yellow circle, galactose; purple diamond, sialic acid; red triangle, fucose. 79 Figure 6.1 continued 80 loop (Gamble et al. 1996). The C-terminus of p24 Gag is linked to the Fc region of rhesus macaque IgG1 through a 12 amino acid poly glycine/serine linker. Fusion proteins were produced by transient transfection of HEK293 cells. Secreted Gag-V1V2-Fc proteins were 500 nm long fibers similar to what was observed with Gag-Fc (Figure 6.1A). Yields per liter of cell culture for Gag-V1V2-Fc were lower compared to other fusion proteins we have produced (0.3 mg for Gag-V1V2-Fc versus 5.2 mg for Gag-Fc). Gag-V1V2-Fc was recognized by a sheep polyclonal anti-gp120 serum (Figure 6.1B) and bound weakly to monoclonal antibody PG16 compared to no binding with Gag-Fc (Figure 6.1C). PG9 did not bind to Gag-V1V2-Fc. not PG9, can bind gp120 sequences when Asn 156 contains complex sugars (Amin et al. 2013). Analysis of the glycans in Gag-V1V2-Fc from HEK293 cells (Figure 6.1D) showed that complex glycans (boxed in blue) were abundant but the Man5GlcNAc2 was low (indicated in red). The glycosylation pattern may explain poor binding by the human monoclonal antibodies. 6.2.2 Immunization regimens with macaques received two i.n. immunizations at weeks 0 and 5, and then an IM immunization at week 8, with either 100 \u00b5g Gag-V1V2-Fc or an equimolar amount of Gag p24 (33 \u00b5g), plus 50 \u00b5g CpG. Each group was assigned five animals. Blood was drawn at weeks 0, 5, 8, and 12. The Gag-V1V2-Fc group was further boosted at week 26 by the IM route with 70 \u00b5g Gag-V1V2-Fc plus 50 \u00b5g CpG. Blood was drawn at weeks 26, 30, 34, and 38. All animals in this set of immunizations have previously received two 81 Figure 6.2 Immunization Schedules with Gag-V1V2-Fc or Gag Immunogens A) i.n. immunization schematic. All animals received two i.n. and one IM (i.n./i.n./IM) immunization with their respective immunogens. The Gag-V1V2-Fc group received an additional IM booster immunization at week 26, albeit at a smaller dose. B) IM immunization schematic. All animals were immunized by the IM route twice (IM/IM), receiving CpG adjuvant the first time and Sigma Adjuvant System the second time. 82 i.n. immunizations with Env-Fc or Env-Fc Mut, and one IM with Env-Fc (Figure 6.2A). Rhesus macaques were also immunized by the IM route with 100 \u00b5g Gag-V1V2-Fc or 33 \u00b5g Gag p24 (five animals per group). At Week 0 IM immunization, animals received 50 \u00b5g CpG and at Week 4 IM immunization, the Sigma Adjuvant System was administered. Blood was drawn at weeks 0, 4, 6, and 8 (Figure 6.2B). All ten animals have previously been immunized with Env-Fc or Env two times by the IM route, and then one time by the i.n. route with Env-Fc, Env-Fc Mutant, or Env. The comparison between routes is made more difficult due to the compounding variable, e.g., the use of a different adjuvant; however, an overall assessment of which immunization regimen is superior can be made. ELISA was used to measure total IgG levels against Gag p24, against V1V2 loop or against the PG9 epitope (a V1V2 cyclic glycopeptide from the HIV CAP45 sequence). ELISA measurements were corrected by subtracting background levels (Week 0) for each animal. We used the PG9 monoclonal antibody as a standard in our ELISAs. PG9 binds with much lower affinity to the V1V2 cyclic glycopeptide than to the whole V1V2 loop; thus, responses against the PG9 epitope versus V1V2 loop cannot be directly compared when reported as a concentration (that is, ng/ml, etc.), as they are in our studies. 6.2.3 Gag-V1V2-Fc is immunogenic by intranasal delivery We hypothesized that Gag-V1V2-Fc would be more immunogenic than Gag by i.n. immunization due to more efficient delivery to nasal associated lymphoid tissues 83 Figure 6.3 Anti-Gag p24 serum levels after immunization with Gag-V1V2-Fc or Gag A) Sera from animals receiving two nasal immunizations with each immunogen was assessed for anti-Gag p24 IgG by ELISA. The dashed line is the threshold for positivity at two times above the background. Serum IgG levels at Week 0 were subtracted from Week 8 levels. B) Anti-p24 levels were assessed in animals receiving each immunogen following two IM immunizations at week 6, ELISA. Serum IgG at Week 6 were adjusted by subtracting basal Week 0 IgG levels. 84 (NALT) via FcRn binding to the Fc domain of Gag-V1V2-Fc and mediating transcytosis. We tested immunogenicity immunizations by assessing anti-p24 serum IgG levels at Week 8. Our results show that all animals in the Gag-V1V2-Fc group mounted a response compared to only two out of five animals in the Gag group (Figure 6.3A). By IM immunization, on the other hand, Gag is much more immunogenic than Gag-V1V2-Fc as determined by Gag-specific serum IgG responses at Week 6 (Figure 6.3B), suggesting that Gag was inefficiently delivered by the i.n. route compared to the IM route. Anti-p24 levels induced by Gag-V1V2-Fc were higher after two i.n. immunizations (average anti-p24 IgG: 696 demonstrating that Gag-V1V2-Fc immunogenicity was higher with the i.n. immunization regimen in our studies compared to the IM regimen. We next wanted to test responses made against the PG9 epitope by Gag-V1V2-Fc immunization. For this purpose, we used a synthetic, biotinylated V1V2 cyclic glycopeptide (amino acids 154-177) derived from the HIV-1 CAP45 sequence (Amin et al. 2013) to bind to neutravidin coated ELISA plates. The V1V2 glycopeptide contains a Man5GlcNAc2 glycan at the a terminal sialylated complex-type N-glycan at Asn156, which are critical for binding by the PG9 and PG16 bNAbs (Amin et al. 2013). At Week 12, four weeks after two i.n. immunizations and one IM immunization with Gag-V1V2-Fc (i.n./i.n./IM), three out of five animals elicited IgG antibodies specific for the V1V2 glycopeptide (Figure 6.4A). By contrast, two weeks after two IM immunizations (peak responses made at Week 6 and declined at Week 8), only two animals out of six had V1V2 glycopeptide-specific serum IgG (one animal 85 Figure 6.4 to immunization with Gag-V1V2-Fc A) V1V2 glycopeptide specific IgG levels at Week 0 and Week 12, four weeks following administration of two doses of i.n. and one dose of IM Gag-V1V2-Fc (i.n./i.n./IM). B) V1V2 glycopeptide specific IgG levels a Week 0 and Week 6, two weeks after two IM immunizations (IM/IM) with Gag-V1V2-Fc. Biotinylated V1V2 from the HIV-1 CAP45 strain was immobilized onto neutravidin coated plates. Sera were overlaid and anti-V1V2 glycopeptide serum IgG responses were measured by ELISA. 86 made a high response and one animal made a very low response) (Figure 6.4B). This implies that the i.n./i.n./IM immunization regimen was superior to the IM/IM regimen. We next assessed responses made against the entire V1V2 region of Gag-V1V2-Fc following i.n. immunization. The V1V2 loop in Gag-V1V2-Fc is 70 amino acids, compared to ~200 amino acids in the full V1V2 loop of gp120. To measure responses made against the V1V2 loop, we added sera that was pre-adsorbed with HIVBaL gp120 to ELISA plates coated with Full Length Single Chain (FLSC), which exposes the entire 200 amino acid V1V2 loop. FLSC contains gp120 fused to a flexible linker plus domains 1 and 2 of CD4 such that the CD4 binding site is always occupied and gp120 is always in the open, or CD4-induced (CD4i), conformation (Fouts et al. 2000). Since all animals in the Gag-V1V2-Fc i.n. group have previously received Env-Fc (Figure 6.2A), there was a basal level of anti-V1V2 loop IgG antibodies at Week 0 compared to pre-immunization levels (Figure 6.5A). Responses at weeks 5 and 8, following the first two nasal immunizations, were not above Week 0 levels. Average V1V2 loop-specific IgG reached their peak at Week 12, four weeks post the IM immunization at Week 8 (Figure 6.5A). All five animals elicited an anti-V1V2 loop response at Week 12, where levels compared to Week 0 were approaching significance (p = .07, Paired t-test) (Figure 6.5B). Rhesus macaques in the Gag-V1V2-Fc group were further boosted by the IM route at Week 26, albeit with a smaller dose of Gag-V1V2-Fc immunogen (Figure 6.2A). Responses peaked at Week 30, but did not reach the levels of Week 12 (Figure 6.5A). From Week 30, responses declined to near basal Week 0 levels after 8 weeks (Week 38). 87 Figure 6.5 Anti-V1V2 loop IgG levels following immunization with Gag-V1V2-Fc A) Average Anti-V1V2 loop serum IgG levels of animals immunized with Gag-V1V2-Fc over time, ELISA. Pre-immune time point represents sera from na\u00efve animals. At Week 0, animals had already received Env-Fc i.n./i.n./IM, but were na\u00efve to Gag-V1V2-Fc. Immunizations with Gag-V1V2-Fc by i.n. or IM route are indicated at the week it was administered. B) Anti-V1V2 loop serum IgG responses in each animal at Week 0 or after receiving Gag-V1V2-Fc i.n./i.n./IM at Week 12, ELISA. 88 We tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies at week 12 using the TZM-bl cell assay (Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al. 2014). Neutralizing activity was not detected in sera from the Gag-V1V2-Fc immunization group (ID50 values were below the minimum serum dilution of 20). We compared anti-V1V2 glycopeptide IgG responses mounted through the i.n./i.n/IM to that of IM/IM immunizations with Env-Fc to determine whether Gag-V1V2-Fc would induce higher responses. The Env-Fc group contained two animals out of six that mounted anti-V1V2 glycopeptide IgG whereas the Gag-V1V2-Fc group had three animals out of five. The average responses of the two animals in the Env-Fc group and the three animals in the Gag-V1V2-Fc group were equivalent (Figure 6.6). 89 Figure 6.6 Anti-V1V2 glycopeptide IgG 154-177) from the HIV-1 CAP45 strain was immobilized onto neutravidin coated plates. Sera from animals immunized by by ELISA. Serum IgG levels were adjusted by subtraction of Week 0 background IgG levels. 90 6.3 Discussion The Gag-V1V2-Fc immunogen was engineered to enhance vaccine responses in several ways. First, Gag-V1V2-Fc should elicit both cellular (anti-Gag) and humoral (anti-V1V2) immunity. Second, the self-assembling quality of Gag capsid protein allows for direct presentation and multimerization of V1V2. Third, the Fc moiety on our immunogen would enable it to engage FcRs that would enhance its immunogenicity (as described in Chapter 4 with Env-Fc). It might also allow its FcRn-mediated delivery to nasal mucosal sites for needle-free immunization and development of both mucosal and systemic immune responses. Gag-V1V2-Fc multimerization was demonstrated by the fact that it formed 500 nm long fibers. V1V2 is exposed on the surface of the immunogen as seen by the binding of both sheep anti-gp120 and PG16 bNAb. We immunized by the i.n. or the IM routes to determine whether Gag-V1V2-Fc can be delivered to mucosal surfaces, and to test which immunization regimen would result in greater immunogenicity of our immunogen. IM immunization would also determine whether Gag immunogenicity of the Gag-V1V2-Fc is preserved, as Gag has been shown to be highly immunogenic in nonhuman primates (Wille-Reece et al. 2005). Our i.n. immunizations showed that Gag-V1V2-Fc can be delivered to the NALT and induce immune responses, most likely due to Fc:FcRn interactions. This is supported by our findings that Gag-V1V2-Fc i.n. immunizations elicited higher anti-p24 IgG levels than Gag i.n. immunization. Gag elicited significantly higher levels of anti-p24 IgG by IM route compared to Gag i.n. immunization, suggesting that it was the inefficient delivery rather than the poor immunogenicity of Gag that led to its low anti-p24 IgG responses in the i.n. regimen. To 91 more definitively show that only Gag-V1V2-Fc, and not Gag, was delivered to the NALT, an in vivo transcytosis assay could be conducted where levels of the immunogen can be assessed in the serum shortly after its i.n. administration. If Gag serum concentrations are lower after i.n. immunization than after IM immunization, then low anti-p24 immune responses are due to inefficient delivery versus poor immunogenicity at mucosal sites. The immunogenicity of the Gag molecule was not preserved in the Gag-V1V2-Fc as seen by the much lower anti-p24 levels with Gag-V1V2-Fc immunization than with Gag immunization. Future studies could address this by shortening the V1V2 loop in this immunogen or by removing fewer amino acids in the Gag CypA site. Anti-p24 IgG levels elicited by Gag-V1V2-Fc were slightly higher in i.n. compared to IM immunizations. Anti-V1V2 glycopeptide responses were induced in more animals in the Gag-V1V2-Fc i.n. group compared to the Gag-V1V2-Fc IM group. These results may suggest that the i.n. route of delivery is superior to the IM route; however, since different adjuvants were used, we cannot exclude that the adjuvant might have contributed to the weaker response. Irrespective of the mechanism, Gag-V1V2-Fc was more immunogenic by the i.n. regimen in our studies and further testing of the anti -V1V2 responses was conducted in this group. Responses against the V1V2 region in Gag-V1V2-Fc were detected only after the IM crossprime (i.n./i.n/IM) at Week 12. All animals at Week 12 elicited responses against the 70 amino acid V1V2 loop and responses compared to Week 0 levels were approaching significance (p = .06). By Week 26, anti-V1V2 loop responses decreased, but not quite to Week 0 basal levels. A second IM booster immunization was 92 administered at Week 26 to test if responses can be further increased above Week 12 levels. However, due to limiting yields of Gag-V1V2-Fc, a smaller dose was used and peak responses did not reach Week 12 levels. We approximate the half-life to be eight weeks as IgG levels decreased by two-fold from Week 30 to Week 38 (responses here were slightly above Week 0 levels). By comparison, anti-CD4i levels (that include the anti-V1V2 loop) through Env-Fc IM/IM immunization decayed by 10 weeks and were not elicited by Env (Chapter 4). In the RV144 trial, anti-V1V2 IgG responses were also short-lived (V1V2 antigens from the major circulating HIV strains in Thailand were used to test these responses), with an apparent half-life of 11.7 weeks (Yates et al. 2014). We cannot compare peak anti-CD4i responses from Env-Fc IM/IM (see Chapter 4) to peak anti-CD4i responses (or here, termed 'anti-V1V2 loop') in Gag-V1V2-Fc i.n./i.n./IM because Env-Fc contains the full V1V2 loop. We can, however, make the comparison between anti-V1V2 glycopeptide responses. The frequency of animals that mounted anti-V1V2 glycopeptide IgG was higher in the Gag-V1V2-Fc animals) than the Env-Fc IM/IM group (2/6 animals), though the averages of the IgG levels in animals that mounted a response was the same between the two groups. Still, in this regard, Gag-V1V2-Fc might be considered more immunogenic for V1V2 responses compared to Env-Fc. In summary, our studies show that Gag-V1V2-Fc is capable of multimerization. However, further optimization of the design is necessary. PG16 binds to Gag-V1V2-Fc, but weakly, and PG9 does not bind, likely due to the absence of mannose-5 glycosylation. Also, Gag is not as immunogenic in Gag-V1V2-Fc as Gag alone. The Gag-V1V2-Fc is immunogenic by the i.n. route. It elicits anti-V1V2 loop responses, with 93 a half-life of eight weeks, which is higher than that seen with Env-Fc immunogen (approximately 5 weeks). Gag-V1V2-Fc was more potent than Env-Fc in eliciting V1V2 glycopeptide-specific responses in a higher frequency of animals. However, unlike Env-Fc, Gag-V1V2-Fc did not elicit neutralizing antibodies. Future studies will have to be conducted to assess the effect of multimerization of V1V2 and/or Fc on immunogenicity. Challenge studies would better assess whether the Gag-V1V2-Fc is potent enough to induce protection. 94 Chapter 7: Further discussion and future studies To develop an effective prophylactic HIV vaccine, efforts are focused on improving mucosal and systemic immune responses to the poorly immunogenic HIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein. Our previous work with HIV Gag (Lu et al. 2011) and other studies have shown that fusion of immunogens to IgG Fc would target the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) for efficient delivery to mucosal sites enhanced immunogenicity. We engineered an HIVBaL gp120 Env Fc fusion protein, Env-Fc, with a gp120 molecule fused at its C-terminus to each arm of the rhesus IgG1 Fc fragment through a Gly/Ser linker. We verified the functional integrity of Env-Fc or Env-Fc mutant (unable to bind FcRn) and compared the potency of immunogens by intranasal (i.n.) immunization of 3). Unexpectedly, Env-Fc Mut generated Env-specific IgG responses at higher levels compared to Env-Fc. We hypothesize that delivery to mucosal sites was not solely FcRn-mediated. At the basolateral side of nasal epithelia, FcRn may bind Env-Fc, but not Env-Fc mutant (Mut), and shuttle it back across to the apical surface. To investigate this hypothesis in future studies, in vivo transcytosis assays could be performed with Env-Fc, Env-Fc Mut, or Env, testing for the presence of each antigen in serum after delivery. If serum contains a lower concentration of Env-Fc compared to Env-Fc Mut or Env, then it would suggest that Env-Fc was recycled out, likely by FcRn. Env-Fc Mut might then be the best immunogen of choice since it would be able to access mucosal sites and then interact with Fc gamma receptors (FcRs), leading to increased immunogenicity. Thus, future i.n. vaccination studies might have to test whether FcRn is required for mucosal delivery. If not, it might be best to attach a mutant Fc moiety that does not bind FcRn but binds other FcRs; if so, the Fc fusion might need to be 95 administered at a higher dose to account for FcRn-mediated bidirectional transport of immunogen across epithelial layers. In several models of infection, it has been demonstrated that immunization with ICs or Fc fusion proteins mimicking ICs yielded enhanced immunogenicity over soluble immunogens, most likely via Fc:FcR mechanisms. We tested whether our IC-like fusion protein, Env-Fc, would induce stronger immunity (Chapter 4). CpG adjuvant, and serum antibody responses were characterized. Our results showed that immunization with Env-Fc, compared to unmodified Env, induced higher serum magnitude and breadth, anti-CD4i responses, and modest levels of serum neutralizing and ADCC activity. Env-Fc resulted in greater durability of the antibody response, and the plateau was higher than for Env-immunized animals. Previous vaccine studies have shown that IC can increase the magnitude and diversity of the response - IC immunization broadened the usage of VH gene repertoire in mouse splenic B cells and induced somatic hypermutation (Lahvis et al. 1997; Song immunization with Venezuela equine encephalitis (VEE) virus plus IgG, resulted in higher peak titers that consisted mainly of IgG (versus IgM and IgG were elicited by VEE) (Houston et al. 1977). In future studies, it would be interesting to analyze whether our Env-Fc immunization resulted in broadened B cell VH usage. We could also map the epitopes of Env to which the antibody response was mounted in Env-Fc versus Env-immunized animals. Potential mechanisms for IC-mediated broadening of the immune responses are: 1) IC lower the threshold of B cell activation by increasing avidity of antigen to B cell receptors (BCR), or 2) IC fix complement, which bridges 96 complement receptors on B cells to BCR and to additional coreceptors, lowering the activation threshold (Dempsey et al. 1996). Future work could test whether the greater potency of Env-Fc should be attributed to increased avidity of Env (2 molecules Env on Env-Fc), its interaction with FcRs, or both. This could be done by comparison of immune responses with Env-F(ab')2 (no FcR engagement, but avidity present), Env-Fc engineered with only one molecule of Env, or Env-Fc wild type (WT, current version). Mutations in the IgG1 Fc have been demonstrated that increase binding to FcRs (Shields et al. 2001). Comparison to Env-Fc immunogens with these types of mutations can be assessed to test if improved responses can be achieved. We could also mutate the complement binding site on the Fc and evaluate responses relative to Env-Fc WT. The enhanced durability of antibody observed in the Env-Fc group might be attributed to Fc-mediated effector mechanisms. Env-Fc may maintain a longer half-life by binding to FcRn and/or being retained on FDC processes (Allen et al. 2008). The role of antigen persistence in sustaining memory B cells (Bmem) is still not definitive (Elgueta et al. 2010); however, it was shown that persistent antigen is required for the maintenance of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (Baumjohann et al. 2013), which promote the germinal center (GC) response. Administration of HIV antigens by repeated dosing increased antibody responses by at least ten-fold relative to a single vaccination following the prime, and led to prolonged antigen retention in lymph nodes and increased Tfh and GC B cell numbers (Tam et al. 2016). Bmem cells may replenish long-lived plasma cell (PC) pools, which maintain serological antibody levels. We tested whether conjugation of the muramyl dipeptide (MDP) adjuvant to Env-Fc (MDP-Env-Fc) would improve immune responses above that of Env-Fc alone 97 (Chapter 5). Our studies showed that MDP-Env-Fc was a less potent immunogen than Env-Fc. Further studies have to be conducted to test the ideal MDP:Env ratio that ensures MDP is not blocking immunogenic sites on Env. MDP-Env-Fc can then be compared to Env-Fc or Env-Fc co-formulated with MDP for the proof of principle that conjugated adjuvant might be a superior strategy to co-formulated adjuvant in that adjuvant dose could be lowered and potential off-target effects decreased. According to our work and previous studies (Yang et al. 2001), MDP requires LPS to induce pro-inflammatory effects. Thus, a different adjuvant that does not require addition of LPS might be better suited to test our hypothesis. In our studies, we fused Env gp120 monomer to Fc. Use of quaternary structures in the fusion protein may further improve efficacy. One approach is to express SOSIP trimers that are designed to prevent dissociation of gp140 gp120 and gp41subunits as domain) and an I559P mutation (SOSIP) in the gp41 domain to further stabilize the trimer (Binley et al. 2000; Sanders et al. 2002; Ringe et al. 2015). Another strategy for vaccine design has been to use scaffold proteins for multimerization of critical conserved epitopes on Env gp120 to increase binding to low affinity germ-line antibodies and avidity for na\u00efve B cells. We engineered Gag-V1V2-Fc, which we showed was able to multimerize (due to the self-assembling qualities of Gag) and elicit V1V2-specific antibody responses (Chapter 6). Gag-V1V2-Fc was immunogenic via the i.n. route of delivery, likely due to Fc:FcRn binding and transcytosis. The Fc on Gag-V1V2-Fc might also be enhancing immune responses by interaction with FcRs, though we did not show this directly. Gag-V1V2-Fc contains 98 multiple Fc moieties and multiple V1V2 moieties, and multimerization of each could contribute to enhanced immunogenicity. Multimeric IC (with multiple Fc) are more efficiently taken up by FcRs and routed to antigen presentation compartments than monomeric IC (with one Fc). To try to delineate the effect of multiple Fc versus a single Fc, we compared Gag-V1V2-Fc anti-V1V2 glycopeptide responses to Env-Fc (has two V1V2 loops from each of the Env molecules and one Fc segment). However, these measurements can only be treated as an approximation since all animals have previously been immunized with Env-Fc and since V1V2 loop is not as abundant nor is it directly presented in Env-Fc like it is in the multimeric Gag-V1V2-Fc. Future studies could compare Gag-V1V2 (without Fc) to Gag-V1V2-Fc to measure the degree to which Fc improves the response. It is difficult to evaluate the value of one Fc moiety relative to multiple Fc moieties in our system, but that is another factor to consider in future studies. Also, Gag-V1V2 (no Fc) can be compared to Gag-V1V2 assembly mutants that contain only one molecule of Gag and V1V2 to see how much multimerization of V1V2 enhances the response. Overall, our studies explored the concept of attaching an Fc to immunogens to increase their immunogenicity. We also began to investigate how adjuvant conjugation and immunogen multimerization affects immunogenicity. We were able to show that Fc adds value from the perspectives of increasing the magnitude and breadth of immune responses, including elicitation of antibodies with neutralizing and ADCC activity, and showing that nasal delivery with some immunogens is improved (Gag-V1V2-Fc versus Gag). We believe that HIV vaccine efforts should incorporate these strategies of 99 attaching Fc fragment and adjuvant to the current pipeline of immunogens to get closer to developing an effective prophylactic vaccine. 100 References (2003). \"VaxGen vaccine trial fails the test but may offer insights.\" AIDS Alert 18(4): 41, 43-45.
