The third phase began on April 1, in which people over the age of 18 can take life-saving shots. Currently, the government hasn't allowed people to decide which vaccine they want to get, but the result of the first phase clearly suggests that both the vaccines being inoculated in India are safe and effective. As of now, 41.2 crore doses have been administered. 8.55 crore people of 6.3% of the total population are fully vaccinated. Table of Contents Well, we have compiled all the information to give you a better understanding of the formulation and every other detail about covishield vs covaxin you are going to get to [stay safe from the Coronavirus](https://pharmeasy.in/health-care/covid-essentials-109?intid=361). Have a look: Covaxin has been developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Ltd in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV). Covaxin is currently trying to procure WHO approval to ease [international travel](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/the-new-omicron-variant-and-its-impact-on-your-travel-plans/) woes for people who have opted for this vaccine. All the relevant documents have urgently been submitted to the officials of WHO. Because the Delta variant is proving to be more infectious than the [other COVID variants](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/omicron-vs-other-variants-what-do-we-know/), the makers of Covaxin have started a new study to determine the effectiveness of the third dose of Covaxin (the booster dose). The results are expected to be made public in November 2021. Covishield has been developed by the Oxford-AstraZeneca and is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII). Doctors are mulling over the need for a booster dose for Covishield as well, considering the fact that the elderly and people with comorbidities may not be producing the desired immunity response to the Delta variant. Covaxin is an inactivated viral vaccine. This vaccine is developed with Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell-derived technology. They contain inactivated viruses, which can not infect a person but still can teach the immune system to prepare a defence mechanism against the active virus. These conventional vaccines have been in use for decades now. There are vaccines for some other diseases as well which are made using the same technology. These diseases are - If you are wondering Covishield is which type of vaccine, it has been prepared using the viral vector platform, a totally different technology. A chimpanzee adenovirus - ChAdOx1 - has been modified to enable it to carry the [COVID-19 spike protein](https://peasy.onelink.me/OvPM/596a5ab5) into the cells of humans. Well, this cold virus is basically incapable of infecting the receiver but can very well teach the immune system to prepare a mechanism against such viruses. The exact technology was used to prepare vaccines for viruses like Ebola. There is no difference between the two [vaccines](https://pharmeasy.in/covid/cowin-registration-cashback) in terms of dosage. Both of them are administered as 0.5ml in the upper arm region. But, the dosing schedule for both vaccines however varies. The second dose of Covaxin is scheduled after 4-6 weeks after the first dose, while for Covishield vaccines it is 84 days or 12-16 weeks after the first dose. Both Covishield and Covaxin can be stored at 2-8 \u00b0 Centigrade, which is a household refrigerator temperature. This makes both the vaccines most suited for Indian conditions as most of the vaccines here are kept at the same temperature range. This also makes the transportation and storage of both vaccines easier. Both vaccines have shown more than satisfactory results ever since the inoculation started in India. The effectiveness of the Covishield vaccine is nearly 90% as per the global reports and the Covaxin vaccine's is 81% according to interim 3rd phase trial results. After getting vaccinated, you may experience pain at the site of injection. Some people may also experience side effects such as headaches, [joint pain](https://pharmeasy.in/health-care/products/liveasy-wellness-calcium-magnesium-vitamin-d3-zinc-bones-dental-health-bottle-of-60-tablets-235886?intid=351) and may feel feverish. These side effects do not persist for long and generally go within a day or two. Covaxin has currently been granted approval for emergency restricted use, while Covishield has been allowed for restricted use in emergency situations that can potentially prevent coronavirus infection in people aged 18 years and above. The Covaxin vaccine has begun its clinical trial in children aged above 2 years of age. However, the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) has not given a market use authorization clearance to any of the vaccines till now. Both the vaccines are being inoculated free of cost at government health set-ups. However, the cost of vaccines at the private hospital varies. Thus, you should always contact the hospitals for the exact cost of the vaccine.
