If you wake up most days tired, struggle to get through the day, battle a mid-afternoon slump, and then start the whole experience all over again the next day then it's time to make some change! Prolonged or chronic stress levels lead to strained adrenal glands, which in turn causes further issues as the body tries to compensate in other areas. Your naturopath may prescribe you some supplements to support your adrenal healing and rebalancing of hormones. When our digestive system doesn't assimilate nutrients effectively, then over time our levels drop. We used to say 'you are what you eat' but now we say 'you are what you assimilate'. Ensuring your digestive system is functioning efficiently is crucial to overcoming fatigue. Sleep is as crucial to good health as a balanced diet, and exercise, in fact even more so. It really is one of the pillars of health, because without good sleep, we can lose the motivation to eat well or even exercise and then face a downward spiral. There is no way to feel energetic if you have low iron. It's absolutely essential. A digestive system that doesn't function well will make you feel fatigued! Just think about how it feels with you have a large lunch and your digestive system is overwhelmed - you want to lie down somewhere for a nap! This is how it feels when your digestive system is not working properly. When we are stretched for time, we often overlook nutritious food options, and find ourselves reaching for that extra cup of coffee or that starchy burst of carbs for quick energy. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a condition characterised by persistent, unexplained fatigue, lasting for at least 6 months. Our naturopathy treatments can assist with testing and treatment of this condition. Our naturopaths are trained to find out why you feel fatigued, and help devise a treatment plan to have you back full of energy as quickly as possible. To treat health issues from the underlying cause, make time to see a qualified Naturopath and Nutritionist, MINDD Practitioner, member of the Naturopaths and Herbalists Association of Australia. Yvette specialises in the treatment of gut health and digestive complaints, skin issues, mood disorders, hormonal concerns, fatigue, and more. "}
