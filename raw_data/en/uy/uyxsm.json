A working group at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health reviewed several drafts and offered thoughtful feedback. The second and third drafts were reviewed by clients, family members, the general public and service providers across Ontario. This book is the result of their collective wisdom. For a fuller treatment of this subject, we refer readers to The Last T a b o o : A Survival Guide to Mental Health Care in Canada by Scott Simmie and Julia Nunes. As well as presenting the opinions of many mental health care providers, this book provides a personal touch and invaluable insight into the mental health system. It is written from the point of view of people who have accessed the system either as a client or family member . Another useful r e s o u r ce for people living in the T o ronto area is M a k i n g Choices: A Consumer/Survivor's Guide to Adult Mental Health Services and Supports in Toronto .

Thus the idea for Challenges & Choices: Finding Mental Health Services in Ontario was conceived. While this guide is written in plain language and directed to clients and families, you, as service providers, will no doubt find this information useful\u2014both for your own background knowledge, and to share with clients and families. The size of the pages and the binding were select - ed specifically to make it easy for you to photocopy sections of the book for clients. You may also want to keep a copy of the book in your waiting room, or have it as a reference guide for people coming to your office. Regardless, our primary goal is to see that as many people as possible benefit from the information in this book. Actual production of the guide took close to a year. It was reviewed extensively by a working group at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; by experts working at various mental health agencies and organizations across the province; and through interviews with clients, family members and the general public. Reviewers r e p resented a br o a d range of backgrounds; for example, they come from rural and urban a reas across Ontario and from diverse ethnocultural and racial gr o u p s. And they have varying experiences and expertise. We hope you and the clients you share this with find it to be a helpful resource. 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth xi2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 1About the guide Who i sthe guide for? This guide is for people looking for mental health services in Ontario. You could be looking for services for yourself, a family member, par t n e r or friend. Or you could be a health care provider who wants to help clients and families find out about dif f e rent services and how to use them. How do I use the guide? The range of services you are seeking will var y, depending on your situation. You could be trying to find a therapist to help you deal with the CHALLENGES of a small or minor difficulty, or you could be coping with a severe and ongoing mental health problem. This guide is really about CHOICES. It provides information about mental health services available in Ontario to help you choose what' s best for you. It also offers a brief description of some of the most common types of mental health problems. And it gives tips that will help you find the services you need. It provides phone numbers and Web site addresses, so you can research a specific problem or treat - ment in more detail. And it includes questions you can ask health care providers. These questions can help you make sure that you'r e getting the kind of care you want.Whether services are available will depend on where you live and the type of services you need. People living in large cities, for example, will have access to many services. However, services will be limited in smaller urban centres and perhaps non-existent in rural areas. The same is basically true if you are seeking services that are sensitive to age, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, race, culture, ethnicity , religion, ability, income or education. You may have to shop around for services that suit your particular wants and needs. If the services you need are too far away, for instance, you may need to use services close by, even if they are not as specialized. Some sections of this guide will be important for you while others may not relate to your concerns or the kind of help you are seeking. Use the table of contents to find the sections that will be most helpful for you. If you are a health care provider, you may want to use Challenges & Choices as a reference book for clients. Feel free to photocopy sections that you think might be helpful for your clients. The size and format of the book were especially designed for this purpose. If you have a copy of the book in your waiting room, clients will be able to browse thr o u g h the sections, and let you know which parts they would like copied. We know that people have different beliefs about what mental health problems are. And people have different ideas about how to deal with these problems. This guide will be useful in outlining what's available. But you should make the final decisions about what services ar e right for you. Because this is a guide for people in Ontario, we mainly list resources that can be used by people living anywhere in the province. You can keep track of contact information for services in your area by listing them in Appendix D, a blank page at the back of the book. Chal lenges& Choic es 2 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealthA word about languag e In the mental health field, many different words are used to describe the same thing. However, these words don't always reflect all cultures or ways of looking at a problem. People from some cultures have no words to define mental health problems. And some cultures may see c e rtain behaviours as positive that others see as problems. In this guide, we use words that are commonly understood to be the most r e s p e c t f u l . Instead of saying that people have a mental illness, we prefer to say that people are seeking services for mental health problems. Sometimes when we describe different types of mental health problems, we use the word \"disorder,\" as this is the word the medical profession uses in its diagnoses of clients. In re f e rring to people with a certain mental health problem, we speak of people with schizophrenia, for example, rather than saying that a person is \"schizophrenic.\" We use the term \"people with\" because people ar e people first and shouldn't be labelled or identified by their challenges. Sometimes we describe people who use mental health services as \"clients.\" However, we recognize that there are many different terms for people using these services. What one person prefers may be quite different from what someone else likes. Other terms sometimes used are \"user,\" \"patient,\" \"consumer\" or \"survivor.\" (In Section 13: Understanding Your Rights, we use \"patient\" because the Ontario Mental Health Act uses that word.) When we use the term \"family member,\" we are referring to someone who has a relative, partner or close friend with a mental health pr o b l e m .Aboutthe guide 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 32003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 5Introduction One in five people in Ontario has a mental health problem at some point in his or her life. Only about 30 per cent of these people seek any kind of help. There are several reasons for this. People may not recognize that they have a problem. They may not know what kind of help is available. Or they may know what exists but not be able to use the services because of barriers, such as cost, language and transportation. And they may have d i fficulty finding what they want when there is a wide range of ser v i c e s , and no one place to access them. In some cases, there won't be the right services nearby for their specific concerns. Still others may know they have a problem but don't seek help because of the stigma (prejudice and discrimination) attached to mental health problems. They feel embarrassed or ashamed. They wor ry about being discriminated against. They wor ry that they will be judged, misunder - stood and perhaps left out because of their difficulties. When people feel discriminated against, it's harder for them to seek help. Sometimes they don't acknowledge a problem for which they could get treatment. This is unfortunate because ther eareservices that can help. And the earlier someone gets help, the less chance there is of the problem coming back or getting worse.1CHALLENGE: The fear of being d i s c riminated ag a in st for having a mental health problem may be preventi ng you from seeki ng help. For instance , you may fear that someone will deny you s ervices,not include you or treat you differently if they know you have a mental health problem. SUGGESTIONS: Mental health pr ovider s have to keep your pe rsonal information conf idential: expect pr ivacy from them. Telephone help l ines and s elf-help g roups are examples of some of the conf idential s ervices available. Consi der conf iding in someone you feel that you can trust. This person should und erstand your situation and be will ing to support you. How you communicate what you are expe riencing is your choice. Some people b elieve that to reduce s t igma or prejudice ag a in st people with mental health problems,it's important to talk about the challenges they face openl y.But some people have been discr iminated against because they openly talk about their challenges in the workplace or in other social situations. While you don't want to create stigma by h iding a mental health problem, sometimes it's important to protect your self. For instance ,if you l ive in a small town, you may want to consi der using a mental health agency or hospital somewhere else. Mental health problems are common. So if you are experiencing difficulties, know that you are not alone. You can feel better, and you may even fully recover. But mental health problems can take time to work through. It's important to focus on your abilities and strengths. Allow yourself opportunities to heal. Finding your way around the mental health system can be confusing, f rustrating, scary\u2014and difficult. That's why we've created this guide. In it, we tell you the basics about the most common mental health pr o b l e m s . We give information about the services available\u2014from hospital tr e a t m e n t to community support. We explain a bit about the kinds of people whoChal lenges& Choic es 6 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth1 CSprovide the care. And we summarize mental health laws, so that you will know your rights and how you can make best use of the system. For family and friends who want to help but don't know how, this guide outlines ways they can access the system for you. In the pr o c e s s , they can learn how to take care of themselves as well. Take charge of your situation by being actively involved in your care. When you meet with a health care provider or go to a certain agency , decide whether the support they offer is what you want and need. Help to shape your treatment by suggesting what has worked for you in the past. If you're not happy with the services offered, let them know. You can also suggest how the services could be improved. If it's possible, you might want to find services somewhere else. QUESTION: Isn't it easier to just work out my problems on my own? ANSWER: That's like sayi ng you can deal with a heart condition or any o t h er physical pr o blem without help from a doc t o r. Mental health pr o bl e m s are as val id a reason as physical health problems for getti ng help. Withou t support or treatment,mental health problems can get wor se.Looki ng for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.It shows that you know there is a problem and are taki ng steps to address it. Knowledge i spower You may know that you have a problem but not know exactly what it is. Recognizing a problem is the first step toward solving it. The next step is to find the kind of services that will best meet your needs. S t a rt by getting as much information as you can about your symptoms and the supports available to help you. The more you know , the better decisions you will make. And the more power and control you will have to deal with the situation. Keep in mind that you might have to go to various sources before you find the information you need. Introduction 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 71 QAGetting information you need may mean: talking to people you know going to a public librar y going through the phone book and finding a mental health agency or clinic that you can call (See Appendix B for a list of organizations in Ontario that deal with mental health problems.) going to a bookstore and looking in the health/self-help section checking the Internet: you can search the Internet by using key wor d s like \"mental health,\" \"psychotherapy\" or \"mental illness.\" You can also type in the kind of problem you want to know more about plus \"services.\" (Keep in mind that not all information on the Internet is correct.) In Appendix B, we include some recommended Web sites. (If you don't have a computer or access to the Internet, public libraries or community agencies often do.) going to educational groups or sessions organized through support or self-help groups, hospitals, community agencies or other or g a n i z a t i o n s . These groups can help you recognize and learn how to manage mental health problems or better understand a mental health issue. Thr o u g h the process, you can talk about how it feels to live and cope with a new diagnosis or difficulty. Talking openly about your feelings will often help you deal with the situation better. It will also help you decide on a treatment plan that makes sense to you. You should be aware that the mental health system in North America tends to be based on what is r e f e rred to as the \"medical model.\" The medical model tends to see a mental health problem as an illness or disease requiring medication and/or psychotherapy. Medication is used to change biochemical processes in the brain that are believed to contribute to the mental health problem.Chal lenges& Choic es 8 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth1T h e re is a gradual move toward a more community-based psychosocial rehabilitation model. This is a model that helps people who have a mental health problem gain or relearn skills they need to live in the community and cope with their difficulties. It addresses a variety of areas, including housing, basic skills training, employment and social supports and living skills (e.g., cooking, shopping, budgeting, using transportation). CHALLENGE: There is a shortage of s ervices in lan guages other than English. SUGGESTIONS: Find out if the agency has cultural inte rprete rs.Or bring someone with you who can inte rpret.Check to see if they have infor - mation pamphlets and phone l ines in different lan guages. You may also want to seek spiritual support from someone in your own community ,such as a spiritual advis er who speaks the same lan guage as you and und erstands your culture.Introduction 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 91 CS2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 11About ment alhealth and ment alhealth problems What isment alhealth? Mental health involves finding a balance in all aspects of your life: physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. It is the ability to enjoy life and deal with the challenges you face every day\u2014whether that involves making choices and decisions, adapting to and coping in difficult situations or talking about your needs and desires. Just as your life and circumstances continually change, so do your moods and thoughts, and your sense of well-being. It's important to find balance in your life over time and in a range of situations. It' s natural to feel off balance at times: for example, sad, worried, scared or suspicious. But these kinds of feelings may become a problem if they get in the way of your daily life over a long period. What contribut es to ment alhealth pr oblems? T h e re are many beliefs about why people have mental health pr o b l e m s . Scientific studies suggest that many serious mental health problems involve biochemical disturbances in the brain. Professionals also believe that various psychological, social and environmental factors a ffect your well-being. As well, mental health is affected by the physical, m e n t a l , emotional and spiritual parts of your life. Stress can affect how you cope in any or all of these areas and can make it harder to manage day-to-day2activities. You may have difficulty coping because you lack new skills and information that could help you. You may be struggling with such difficulties as: going through a divorce dealing with the death of a loved one having a car accident coping with a physical health problem growing up in a war-torn countr y, leaving the country you came from or adjusting to a new country (which often means dealing with immigration and resettlement experiences) dealing with racism or other forms of prejudice (because of sexual orientation, age, religion, culture, class, etc.) having a low income or being homeless not having equal access to education, work and health car e having a history of mental health problems in the family or being a victim of violence, abuse or other trauma. Your mental health can also be affected by how much love, suppor t and acceptance you receive from family and others. It is important to know that not all cultures view mental health in the same way. For example, in some countries, people who have schizo - phrenia are seen as having special powers and insights. Alcohol and other drug use do not usually cause a mental health problem. However, they are often used to help cope with the prob - lem. And they can make the mental health problem worse. You and your health care provider need to work together to identify the problem, what may have caused or contributed to your difficulties and how you can be helped. Whatever the cause, you should know that mental health problems are not your fault. No one chooses to have a problem.Chal lenges& Choic es 12 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth2Typesofment alhealth pr oblems Mental health problems often take different shapes and forms at different times. Some people feel depressed. Others feel anxious and fearful. A child might act out in class or avoid others. Some don't eat much. Others o v e reat. Some depend on alcohol or other drugs to numb their painful feelings. Still others lose touch with r e a l i t y . For example, they may hear voices, see things that aren't there or believe things that aren't true. Some have suicidal thoughts\u2014and some act on these thoughts. Some feel angry and aggressive. And some people are traumatized because of a single event, such as a serious car accident, or because of a mor e long-term problem, such as years of being abused as a child. Many people have more than one of these problems at a time. For many years, we thought mental health problems would either keep coming back or would never go away. We now know that many people recover from these challenges. Many people with mental health problems get better by using their own strength and resilience, the support of family and friends, psychotherapy, techniques to lessen their stress and possibly medication. In the next section, we will be using the term \"disorder\" to describe some of the most common mental health problems and labels used by the medical profession in making a diagnosis. Some people may be relieved to know how doctors identify their problems. They may be glad to get a diagnosis that provides a theor y about what's wrong and suggestions for how their problems could be treated. But others may not find it helpful to know a diagnosis. They may see it as a label or category that doesn't describe their situation. Or they may believe that their condition is due to difficult life situations rather than an illness. About mental health and mental health pr oblems 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 132In truth, some people are wrongly diagnosed and then given the wr o n g kind of treatment. Sometimes their mental health diagnosis changes so many times over the years that they lose confidence in the system. However, others find that an accurate diagnosis helps them choose the right treatment and results in the best care. Here are some common diagnoses: Anxiety disorders are believed to be the most common mental health p roblem in North America, particularly among people who are depr e s s e d . In fact, as many as two-thirds of the people who have depression also have strong symptoms of anxiety . While we all feel anxious from time to time, \"anxiety\" refers to excessive worrying that is hard to control. People who experience anxiety feel restless or \"keyed up\" and on edge. They may get tired easily or feel their minds going blank. They may also feel i rritated, have tense muscles, trouble concentrating and sleep problems. The main types of anxiety disorders are panic disorder, obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social and specific phobias. For more information on anxiety disord ers,contact the Anxiety Disord ers Association of Ontar io at (613) 729-6761 in Ottawa or toll-free at 1-877-308-3843.

For more information on OCD, call the Ontar io Obsessive Compulsive Disord er Network at (416) 410-4772 i n Toronto or view their Web site at www.oocdn.org. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the main reasons why children are refer red for mental health services. ADHD a ffects a child's attention span and concentration. It can also affect how impulsive and active the child is. The energetic way in which children normally behave shouldn't be confused with symptoms of ADHD. C h i l d r en who have ADHD are much more active, distracted, persistent and impulsive than other children. Symptoms of ADHD persist over time. Chal lenges& Choic es 14 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth2An Ontario study predicts that five to nine per cent of school-aged c h i l d r en may have ADHD. ADHD is three to four times more common in boys than girls. About two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have the symptoms in adolescence. ADHD is less common in adults. Adults with ADHD may be easily distracted (e.g., continually bored, forgetful or anxious). They may also be depressed, have low self-esteem, mood swings and difficulties at work and at other activities. Bipolar disorder was previously known as manic-depressive illness. It involves extreme mood swings that may have nothing to do with what's going on in the person's life. Typically, people with bipolar disorder move between feeling very low or depressed and feeling ver y high or \"manic.\" When people are manic, they may take part in risky and unusual activities, increase sexual behaviours or get in trouble with the law. They may also feel invincible or all-powerful, have racing thoughts and other symptoms. There's a good chance that people with bipolar disorder will feel \"normal\" and function well at times too. How long the episodes last and how often they occur will var y, depending on the person. People often experience the first sign of a problem in adolescence or early adulthood. It may begin with an episode of depression and not be followed by a manic episode for several years. Women may have symptoms when they are pregnant, or shortly after. Overall, men and women are affected equally . For more information,contact the Mood Disord ers Association of Ontar io (MDAO) at (416) 486-8046 i n Toronto or toll-free at 1-888-486-8236.

Children and youth with a conduct disorder find it difficult to followAboutmental health and mental health pr oblems 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 152rules and behave in a socially acceptable way . They may cause pr o p e rt y loss or damage, steal or lie, seriously violate rules or be violent towar d other people or animals. While conduct disorders are the most common psychiatric diagnoses among children, the disorders can be present at any age. For more information, view the section related to conduct disord ers at the Web site of the Ame rican Academy of Ch ild & Adolescent Psychiatry at www.aacap.org/pub lications/factsfam/conduct.htm. Depression is more than simply being unhappy. Someone who is d e p ressed feels abnormally sad, despairing and hopeless in a sustained way for more than two weeks. Depression may impair how the person p e rf o r ms at work, school and in relationships. The person's sleep, ener g y, appetite, concentration, memory and sexual desire may also be af f e c t e d . The person may lose interest or pleasure in life, feel irritable, wor t h l e s s or guilty and, in some cases, may think of suicide. Women are diagnosed with depression twice as often as men are. There a re many theories about why this is true. One theory is that women seek health care services more often than men. Life and body changes may also play a part: women are more likely to become depressed after puber t y, during their menstrual cycles and following pr e g n a n c y . Another theory is that women have less power and control in their lives, and are mor e likely to be victims of violence or abuse. While women are more frequently diagnosed with depression, a rising number of men are also seeking treatment. Men may use substances, s u c h as alcohol or other drugs, to cope. These drugs may hide their feelings of depression. Other factors can also contribute to depression, such as prejudice and discrimination and being marginalized or excluded. This may mean being denied your rights, not being recognized or appreciated and not being allowed to participate in things that are important to you.Chal lenges& Choic es 16 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth2Often, people of colour, older adults, lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgendered people are affected by discrimination. People who have suffered major losses may also be more at risk of having depression.

This obsession negatively affects people's health, relationships and day-to-day living. The two main types of eating disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. People with anorexia have an intense and irrational fear of gaining weight and having body fat. They are obsessed with being thin. They may believe they are fat, even when they are well below the normal weight for their height and age. People with bulimia go through cycles of bingeing and pur g i n g . B i n g e i n g involves eating large amounts of food quickly. This makes people feel physically ill and anxious about gaining weight. Then they will purge, which can involve vomiting, depriving themselves of food, overexercising or using laxatives and diuretics. About 90 per cent of people diagnosed with eating disorders are girls and women. However, these days boys are being diagnosed with eating p roblems more often. These disorders typically begin during adolescence. For more information,contact the National Eati ng Disord er Information Centre at (416) 340-4156 i n Toronto or toll-free at 1-866-633-4220.

They may have problems with self-image or having About mental health and mental health pr oblems 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 172successful relationships. They may have a dif f e rent way of seeing them- selves, others and the world. And they may have a rigid way of think - ing, feeling and acting. This makes it difficult for them to get used to changes and stresses that are an unavoidable part of everyday living. While personality disorders may look dif f e rent in dif f e rent people, any- one who has a personality disorder deals with feeling uncomfortable with themselves or others. Personality disorders begin in adolescence or early adulthood. Some personality disorders may result from child - hood sexual or physical trauma. S c h i z o p h r enia a ffects all aspects of a person' s functioning\u2014how he or she feels, thinks, acts and relates to others. People with schizophrenia often have difficulty figuring out what is real and what is fantasy. For instance, they may see or hear things that aren't actually there. They may also have difficulty car rying out everyday tasks such as bathing, getting dressed and preparing simple meals. Men and women are both affected equally by schizophrenia. However , men tend to experience their first episode in their late teens or early 20s. Women may not experience symptoms until they are a few years older.

Substance use disorders involve dependence on or abuse of sub - stances, such as alcohol, medication or illegal drugs. Most people who use substances do not progress to problem use or become dependent on substances. But those who do develop a substance use problem ar e at high risk of having a mental health problem as well. For instance, people with anxiety, depression or conduct disorders or those whoChal lenges& Choic es 18 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth2have a history of child abuse may use alcohol or other drugs to help them cope (e.g., to feel more calm or less worried) and then become addicted to the substance. Sometimes substance use hides the mental health problem, so the problem does not get addressed. Some drugs\u2014such as alcohol, sedatives (to help people sleep or feel less anxious), stimulants or \"uppers\" (that make people feel they have more energy) and marijuana\u2014can lead to depression, anxiety or psy - chosis (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder). Often these problems will go away when the person stops using the substances. When someone has both a substance use and mental health problem, they have what is called a concur rent disorder. Like mental health problems, substance use problems affect how poeple think, behave and relate with others. They also affect people's interests and perfor m- ance in school or work. Descriptions of these mental health problems can be downloaded from the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA),Ontar io Division Web site at www.ontar io.cmha.ca and from the Web site of the National Institute of Mental Health at www.n imh.nih.g ov.

But if you do decide you want to use the services available, you will likely need to have an assessment. This evaluation will help identify the types of difficulties you are having. It will also help determine the kind of services you think would be helpful. General practitioners, psychiatrists and psychologists are the only health care providers who can give an official diagnosis. These professionals should explain the diagnosis, the kind of treatment being suggested and the reasons for this type of treatment. (If they don't explain, make sure you ask them their opinion before you leave the office.) Other health care professionals, such as nurses or social workers, can assess your situation but can't make a diagnosis. QUESTION: Do I need a diagnosis to get treatment? ANSWER: You don't necessar ily need a diagnosis to get treatment. Howeve r ,it may be helpful to get a thorough assessment and diagnosis to help direct your treatment.If you have information about your condition, you'll have a better i dea,for instance ,if you need medication,or if there is a ce rtain kind of the rapy that would be most helpful.3 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 21 QABut even if you get a diagnosis, it may change or be interpreted differ - ently, depending on the doctor who is assessing you. Some conditions a re difficult to diagnose, and sometimes the only way to figure out what you are dealing with is to see how the condition develops over time. Assessments usually involve a conversation with your health car e provider. Sometimes you'll need to fill out a questionnaire. During an assessment, you will likely discuss things such as: why you have come for help, what kind of help you are looking for and what has helped in the past what condition you are in physically what problems you have been having, and how long they have lasted whether you've had recent stresses, such as a sudden change or loss (e.g., a death, losing a job) if you've experienced or seen violence (e.g., physical or sexual assault, war), even if it occur red years befor e if there is a history of mental health problems in your family what your life is like: how you feel, what you think, how you sleep, if you exercise and socialize, how you do at school or work, how your relationships with friends and family ar e if you've come to Canada in the last few years, and/or if you've come from a war-torn countr y what, if any, medications you are taking and any other topics you would like to discuss. Assessments can go many ways. You may decide you simply need more support during stressful times. You may need to find affordable housing. You may need to find meaningful work and adequate pay . Or the person giving the assessment may recommend that you see a therapist or that you start taking medication. He or she could also encourage you to seek other types of services.Chal lenges& Choic es 22 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth3Where to go for an a ssessment family doctors/general pract itioner s Family doctors, or general practitioners (GPs), are often the first professionals that people talk to about a mental health problem. In fact, family doctors spend up to half their time identifying and treating mental health problems. Doctors are able to examine your physical health and rule out problems that could be adding to or affecting changes in your mood, thinking or behaviour. They may ask some questions about your symptoms and what kind of stress you are coping with. Sometimes doctors can do a full psychiatric assessment, particularly for the more common conditions, such as depression or anxiety . Other times, doctors will suggest that you see a psychiatrist, because psychiatrists have specialized training in identifying and treating mental health problems. communi ty ag encie s Community agencies can also offer assessments. The type of assessment will depend on the health care provider available. Sometimes this may be a doctor, psychologist, social worker or nurse. But in smaller cities and rural areas, you are more likely to be seen by a community mental health worker. This person will match your needs with the services available at the agency . Social workers and community mental health workers tend to focus on the social situation that may be affecting your mental health (e.g., pover t y, family situation, work, support systems, if you have violence in y o u r life). They also examine what supports you need to cope or manage b e t t e r in the community. If you have a serious mental health problem, y o u will likely also need to see someone who is medically trained, such as a family doctor or preferably a psychiatrist. This doctor will assess your need for medication or other medical help. Getting an a ssessment 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 233psyc hiatrists Even if you believe you've identified your problem after reading or hearing a description of it, it's a good idea to get an assessment from a psychiatrist. Family doctors often have a list of psychiatrists they can refer you to. (Psychiatrists almost always need a referral from a doctor before they can see you.) After you book an appointment, you may have to wait about two to three months to see a psychiatrist. (To find a psychiatrist, see p. 31 on family doctors/general practitioners. This section describes how to find a psychiatrist as well as a doctor.) QUESTION: My psychiatrist said that I have X diagnosis, but I don' t agree.What should I do? ANSWER: If you don't agree with your diagnosis, you should ask your family doctor to refer you to another psychiatrist for a second opi nion. People often don't ask for a second opi nion because they don't want to offend their doctor .But in reality ,most doctors are open to their clients seeking another pe rspective and may even suggest it thems elves. Remembe r ,it's your health,and you have the r ight to get another opi nion. For more information on specific types of disord ers,contact the Canadian Mental Health Assoc i a t ion (CMHA), O n t a r io Div i s io n .D e s c ri p t i ons of these di s o r ders can be do w n l o a d ed from their Web site at www . o n t a r io . c m h a . c a . emergency depar tments of h ospitals If you are in a crisis or can't wait for an appointment, go to the emergency department of a nearby hospital. But be prepared for a long wait! You may want to bring someone to keep you company who can help look out for your best interests.Chal lenges& Choic es 24 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth3 QAYou will first be seen by a nurse. If the nurse determines that there is c o n c e r n for your safety , you will then be seen by the emergency r o o m d o c t o r . Based on his or her assessment, the doctor has three options, to: 1 .release you 2 .refer you to a mental health professional or 3 .admit you to the hospital. If the situation does not require immediate medical care, the next step may be for you to get a more in-depth assessment from a crisis worker. This person is often a nurse or social worker. If the worker thinks that you will be able to manage safely out of hospital, he or she may direct you to outpatient or crisis services. The crisis worker may set up an appointment with you for a couple of days later to see how you're doing. CHALLENGE: There are few ,if any ,mental health s ervices in my community . S U G G E S T I O N S : In areas that don't have many serv i c e s ,you will pr o b a bly be referred by your family doctor to a local hospital or health centre. If the r e are no psychiatrists on staff at the hospital or centre , you may be seen by a visiti ng psychiatrist. Videoconferenc ing is another way to get an assessment. It allows you to benefit from the expe rtise of a professional not in your area, withou t either of you hav ing to travel. If you don't have a fam ily doctor , you can go to the emergency depar t- ment of the nearest hospital.Getting an a ssessment 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 253 CSAbout therap y The right help for you will depend on a number of factors, including: the mental health problem(s) you are facing the seriousness of the problem, and whether you need help for a short or long period your understanding of how to improve your state of mind what is available where you live and your ability to travel (e.g., in terms of cost and time), if there are no services close to your home your spiritual values and beliefs whether your therapist is able to respect personal characteristics, such as your age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, race, cultural and ethnic background, ability and income, and is able to respond to your needs the type of care that you feel most comfortable with. the language you speak, and your therapist's ability to communicate and work with you. whether you can afford to pay for therapy . One type of treatment or one type of therapist may not always be able to provide you with everything you need. For instance, you may visit a spiritual adviser to talk about difficulties you are having. You may see a psychiatrist for a medication prescription. You may go to yoga or exercise classes to help you relax and feel less stressed. You may see a nutritionist to help you explore how various foods can influence your4 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 27mood or thinking. Or you may find it useful to talk with your family doctor or a friend. People go to psychotherapists to discuss the problems they have identified. They may get therapy one-on-one, as part of a couple, family or gr o u p . T h e re is scientific r e s e a r ch proving the effectiveness of both medication and psychotherapy to treat mental health problems, as well as proof of their effectiveness when used together . QUESTION: How do I know when a problem is s erious enough that I should f ind professional help? ANSWER: It depends on the pe rson.Generally,people seek professional h elp when their pr o blem is really i n t er f e ring with their lives (e.g., r el a t io n - s hi p s , work,school) and their abi lity to function and enjoy thems elves. Choo sing a therapi st Psychotherapists are mental health professionals who use \"talking therapy\" or counselling to help people with things such as self-esteem, changing beliefs and ways of thinking, communication and relationship skills and working through difficult issues from the past. People generally see psychotherapists when their problems affect their day-to-day living. These problems may be negatively influencing their work or school, their relationships and their ability to enjoy life. A psychotherapist can o ffer support, help you better understand your problems and help you learn new ways of coping. If you're looking for a therapist, you can ask: your family doctor a nurse a community mental health worker a social work or outpatient psychiatric department of a hospital an employee (and family) assistance program through your workChal lenges& Choic es 28 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth4 QAa religious or spiritual leader or organization a community information centr e a social service agency (e.g., mental health association) or a self-help group. Often the best way to find a therapist is to get a recommendation fr o m a friend, family member or a health care provider whose opinion you respect. When you do get referrals, try to get more than one at a time, and get on several waiting lists, if necessar y . Q U E S T I O N : H ow can talking to a ther a p i st help me deal with my pr o bl e m s ? Isn't it just as good to talk to a friend whom I already trust? ANSWER: In some cases,speaki ng to a friend who will listen and be sup - p o rt ive may be enough. H ow e v e r , if your pr o blem per s i st s , it may be he l p f u l to speak to someone who isn't connected to your life\u2014someone who can offer a safe and neutral po int of view . Therapists offer the advantage of b e ing tra ined and having pr a ctice talking in ways that have proven he l p f u l . Inter viewing a therapi st D o n 't be afraid to ask therapists questions to find out if you are comfort- able with their style and approach. Below are some sample questions. What educational and professional training do you have? How many years of experience do you have working as a therapist? Do you have specific training or experience working with my parti - cular issue (e.g., trauma, divorce, childhood sexual abuse)? What is your approach to therapy for my specific problem? Are you a member of an association or professional organization? You may want to consider whether you want a therapist of the same gender, sexual orientation or ethnic background as you. T h e re may also be other characteristics that you want your therapist to have in common with you, or to at least be sensitive to (e.g., issues of race,About therap y 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 294 QAc u l t u r e, age) or other factors that you see as important to your identity and way of viewing the world. As well, it's a good idea to find out how many sessions the therapist will provide and how much the therapy will cost. (See How much will therapy cost?, p. 35.) QUESTION: What if I'm not comfortable with my the rapist or with ho w the the rapy is worki ng? ANSWER: A trusti ng relationship between you and the the rapist is key to successful ther a py. If you are feeling uncomf o rt a b le with your ther a p i st , it's possible that your per s o n a l ities may not be the right f i t .Or the ther a p i st may be offe ring a form of the rapy that is not useful to you.Howeve r ,it's e q u a l l y possible that your d i s c o m fo r t could be related to bringing a d i f fi c u l t issue out into the open or the anxiety of speaki ng to someone new . To dete rmine the source of your discomfort,it's important to discuss your conce rns with your the rapist.If you have had the rapy before ,it's also us e- ful to tell your the rapist what wor ked and what d idn't work with othe r therapists. This will g ive your new the rapist an i dea of what you want from the the rapy and if he or she can pr ovide it. But don't stick around in the rapy if it's not worki ng.You can fire your therapist! But if you do ,make sure that there is someone else who will be a ble to see y o u .Your ther a p i st may be able to refer you to another ther a p i st . Note: It is not ethical for a therapist to see you outside of therapy. It is not right for the therapist to be your friend or for you to end up giving therapy to the therapist! And it is WRONG for a therapist to make any type of sexual comments or to behave sexually. If you have any concerns about your t h e r a p i s t , call his or her governing or regulatory college and tell them what happened.Chal lenges& Choic es 30 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth4 QAThere are many different types of therapists who vary in the amount and type of training they've received. Following are some of the mor e common types. Typesoftherapi sts family doctors/general pract itioner s Family doctors, or general practitioners (GPs), are often the first health c a re professionals someone will turn to when they have a mental health p roblem. A family doctor may prescribe medication, talk briefly to you about your concerns or refer you to a mental health specialist. Some general practitioners offer psychotherapy as a full-time practice. General practitioners don't receive much psychotherapy training as part of their general medical degree. So it's important to ask them if they had additional training in psychotherapy after completing medical school. Therapy from a general practitioner or family doctor is cover e d by OHIP . Doctors who call themselves a \"GP psychotherapist\" have a special interest in psychotherapy . However, they ar e n 't re q u i r ed to have additional training to be part of their professional organization, the GP Psychotherapy Association. To find a family doctor in your area, you can call the Find a Doctor serv i c e available through the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontar io at (416) 967-2626 i nToronto or toll-free at 1-800-268-7096.Or view their Webs i t eat www.cpso.on.ca. To get a refe rral to a GP psychothe rapist, call the GP Psychothe rapy Association at (416) 410-6644 i n Toronto. psyc hiatrists Psychiatrists have a medical degree and five years of psychiatric training. Because psychiatrists are medical doctors, they are licensed to pr e s c r i b e medication and provide psychotherapy. Their services are covered by O H I P . As medical doctors, they are more likely to identify connectionsAbout therap y 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 314between psychiatric and physical health problems. Some clients repor t that psychiatrists tend to be more focused on medication than on talking therapy\u2014perhaps because of their medical training. However, some psychiatrists put emphasis on psychotherapy in their practice. It is often very difficult to find a psychiatrist who is available to see you without a long wait, particularly if you live outside a large city. In fact, in some underserviced communities, there may not be a psychiatrist on s t a ff at the nearest hospital. These hospitals instead rely on visiting psy- c h i a t r i s t s from larger cities or videoconferencing. Through videocon - ferencing, psychiatrists are able to assess and follow up with clients even though they are in different locations. If psychiatrists are not available, psychiatric residents (medical doctors who are in training to become psychiatrists) may be available. Residents spend at least five years training to become a psychiatrist after they graduate from medical school. The work they do as psychotherapists is closely supervised by staff. To find a psychiatrist in your area, you can call the F ind a Doctor s ervice listed above und er Fam ily doctors/Gene ral practitione rs.You can also get a referral from your family doctor or visit an outpatient psych i a t ric clin i c . psych ologists Psychologists have at least nine years of university education. They also have at least one year of supervised practice. To be able to register with the College of Psychologists of Ontario, psychologists must pass oral and written exams. They have a lot of training in doing assessments, which includes making diagnoses and providing therapy. Psychologists have a PhD or PsyD, but their fees are not covered by OHIP , and they cannot prescribe medication. However , the services they provide through hospitals, community agencies or private clinics or offices may be available without charge. Their fees may also be partly covered under extended health insurance plans,Chal lenges& Choic es 32 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth4the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) or other private insurance programs. To get a refe rral to a psychologist in your area,ask your fam ily doctor or call the Ontar io Psychological Association at (416) 961-0069 i n Toronto or toll-free at 1-800-268-0069. The association will pr ovide names of psychologists in pr ivate practice in your area. They can also pr ovide details about the s ervices they offe r ,the lan guage they are offered in and the focus of their work (e.g., eating disord ers,family violence ,learning disability assessments). other heal th care pr ofessionals Professionals from a variety of other fields (e.g., social work, nursing, occupational therapy) may also provide therapy. Depending on the field, their training may range from a diploma to a PhD. Many of these professionals supplement their education by taking extra courses and counselling training from universities or hospitals. Some take advantage of community-based workshops, training programs, seminars and conferences. Social workers and nurses are particularly common in a psychiatric setting. They also tend to be available more often than doctors. Social workers are trained to focus on how a person's social environment affects his or her health. (By social environment, we're referring to a p e r s o n ' s housing, family , work, financial situations, social suppor t s , education, gender, etc.) (See How much will therapy cost, p. 35.) To get a refe rral to a social wor ker in pr ivate practice , you can call the Ontar io Association of Social Workers at (416) 923-4848 i n Toronto or view their Web site at www.oasw.org. The association will try to match you with three social workers from the age group (e.g., c hild ,a d o l e s c e n t ) , s p e ci a l t y (e.g.,marital couns elling) and lan guage you desire.About therap y 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 334QUESTION: Is what I say to my the rapist pr ivate and conf idential? ANSWER: Trust is the basis of a good relationship. Part of this trus t involves knowi ng that what you say to your the rapist will be kept between the two of you. Therapists must keep your information conf idential. Howeve r ,there are a few exceptions to the rule. If they suspect that you may s eriously harm your self or someone els e,or in some court proceed - ings,they are ob liged to report their suspic ions.If, for instance ,a health practitione rsuspects that you have abused a ch ild,they must contact the Children's Aid Society .If the client has a condition, includ ing a mental health problem,that would make it dange rous for h im or her to ope rate a motor vehicle ,then a physician must report this to the Mi nistry of Transportation. The courts can also subpoena your the rapy records and your the rapist's testimony und er certain conditions,such as a s exual assault case.So it's a good i dea to discuss with your the rapist what he or she will include i n your records,and how they will be kept. Your the rapist should explain conf identiality (pr ivacy) issues with you at the beg inning of the the rapy. non-licensed therap ists Anyone can call themselves a psychotherapist and advertise their services, even if they don't have training. So it is important to find out what kind of experience the therapist has. Non-licensed therapists do not belong to an organization that makes sure they're doing their job right. No one ensures that they are com - petent and ethical in their practices. And if clients have complaints, there is no one to handle them. For more information about what to expect from your the rapist, call his or her professional organization. This organization will have gui delines about supe rvision, training and ethics for its membe rs.If you have a Chal lenges& Choic es 34 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth4 QAcomplaint about your the rapist, call the g overning or regulatory college to which he or she belongs. QUESTION: Are the rapists available in the even ings or on weekends? ANSWER: Therapists can sometimes see clients in the mor ning before they go to work or at the end of the work day .Howeve r ,it's often hard to get these time slots because many people want to see their the rapists ou t- side of regular office hours. It's unusual for a the rapist to see clients on the weekend. How much w illtherap y cos t? Psychotherapy from a psychiatrist or any other medical doctor is cov - ered by OHIP , and will thus not cost you anything. Services obtained f rom other health care professionals (e.g., psychologists, social workers) may also be free if they are offered in government-funded hospitals, clinics or agencies. If psychotherapists work in a private practice, their services will not be covered by OHIP, and you will be charged a fee. These fees range from about $40 to $180 per hour. However, the fee will vary depending on the therapist's experience and training and the type of therapy . (Group therapy may be less expensive.) Some therapists offer a sliding scale, which means that they can offer a reduced fee based on your income. Fees may also be covered through an extended health care plan or private insurance. (You may have a benefits plan through your work.) Some of these plans may only cover services up to a certain amount and for certain types of therapists (e.g., psychologists but not social workers). If you are working in a large organization, you may have access to an employee assistance program (EAP)\u2014sometimes refer red to as an employee and family assistance program (EFAP). (For more infor m a t i o n about counselling services provided through EAPs and EFAPs, see Reducing job stress, p. 89, in Section 11.) About therap y 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 354 QAIf you are a student, counselling services will most likely be provided by your high school, college or university .

Typesoftherap y Just like finding a therapist, choosing a type of therapy will be dif f e re n t for each person. It will depend on your problems, the approach you feel comfortable with and how long you want to be involved in therapy . Being a certain type of professional (e.g., social worker, psychiatrist) doesn't mean that the therapist will practise a certain type of therapy . In reality, many clinicians use a combination of different approaches. Therapists' style will also var y. Some therapists will give you a lot of feedback about how they think you are doing and suggestions of what they think might help you. Other therapists will tend to be quieter during sessions, and will let you draw your own conclusions. You can tell therapists which approach you pr e f e r, and ask them how they work. Therapists may be willing to adapt their style to suit your needs. If they can't, they may not be the right match for you. Chal lenges& Choic es 36 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth4 CSQUESTION: How will I know if and when the rapy is worki ng? ANSWER: Most lik ely when you start the rapy, you'll have ce rtain goals or ideas of what you'd like to be different.If you f ind that you are meet - ing these goals over time ,chances are the the rapy is maki ng a difference. It's important to und erstand that results don't necessar ily happen overnight.In fact, sometimes you'll feel wor se at the start as issues are brought to the surface. If you don't know if you are maki ng progress in the rapy, you should dis - cuss this with your the rapist. You may want to schedule times to evaluate how th ings are g oing in the sessions. Studies indicate that only 15 per cent of successful therapies happen because of the model or technique a therapist uses. The most impor t a n t factor for successful therapy is the quality of the relationship between the therapist and client. Therapy can be short- or long-term. Because r e s o u r ces are often limited, you're more likely to receive short-term therapy, and then be linked to other service providers in the community . brief vs. long-term therapy Brief therapy (e.g., solution-focused therapy), as its name implies, is a short-term therapy that often lasts between eight and 20 sessions. S h o rt - t e r m therapies are frequently used to deal with a specific pr o b l e m , such as death, divorce, parenting issues or a specific phobia, rather than problems that have lasted for years. The sessions tend to focus mor e on cur rent rather than childhood or other issues from the past. And the therapist generally takes an active role in guiding the discussions. Sometimes clients are given homework (e.g., exercises to help them cope with stress or anxiety between therapy sessions). Brief therapies are particularly helpful for depression and anxiety .About therap y 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 374 QAL o n g - t e r m therapy (e.g., psychodynamic psychotherapy , psychoanalysis) is less structured than brief therapy. The client has more flexibility to talk about a variety of concerns related to both past and present issues. The length of therapy is indefinite, and can last a year or longer . QUESTION: How long will I need the rapy? ANSWER: How often you will need to go to the rapy depends on the nature of your pr o bl e m s . You may have a concern that can be addressed in a few s e s s io n s . Or you may have more complicated issues that require about 20 sessions.Some people get the rapy off and on throughout their l ives. most co mmon appr oaches Therapy can be quite different depending on the kind of approach being used. Therapy may focus on changing clients' behaviours or their way of thinking about the world. It can focus on understanding d i fficult situations from the past. Or it can focus on expressing feelings that have come from old wounds, such as a history of abuse. Therapy can also be about supporting a client through a difficult time. Four of the most common forms of psychotherapy now being practised ar e cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, psychodynamic therapy and supportive therapy . Cognitive-behavioural therapy is considered by many experts to be the number one way to treat depression and anxiety . It focuses on help- ing clients become aware of how certain negative automatic thoughts, attitudes, expectations and beliefs contribute to feelings of sadness and a n x i e t y . Clients learn how these thinking patterns, which may have been developed in the past to deal with difficult or painful experiences, can be identified and changed in their day-to-day lives to reduce unhappiness. They learn to have more control over their moods by having mor e control over the way they think.Chal lenges& Choic es 38 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth4 QAInterpersonal therapy focuses on identifying and resolving problems in establishing and maintaining satisfying relationships. These pr o b l e m s may include dealing with loss, life changes, couple difficulties or conflicts, and increasing the client's ease in social situations. Psychodynamic therapy involves exploring the client's beliefs and inner states, even when the client may not be completely conscious of them. Psychodynamic therapy assumes that because clients may not be aware of what is causing their unhappiness, the usual methods for finding relief (e.g., talking to friends or family, getting advice) may not be helping. The therapy instead focuses on finding the underlying problems that show up in various ways (e.g., difficulties at work, problems in a relationship). Supportive therapy involves providing support and advice during a difficult period. This form of therapy can be short- or long-term. It focuses more on cur rent problems rather than long-term difficulties. The overall goal is to reduce clients' discomfort level and help them cope with their cur rent circumstances. individualvs. couple, f amilyand group therapy Whether you choose to see a therapist alone, with a partner, family member or as part of a group (with other participants you don' t know) will depend on the kind of problem you want help with. Family therapy is focused on changing the way families interact. It aims to increase understanding and improve communication among family members. It does so without placing blame on any one person. Family therapy is generally used when the family system is seen as contributing to one family member's difficulties (such as a child or adolescent's). Or it is used when one family member's difficulties are influencing other family members, and they need help in how to cope and adjust to the situation. Both the \"identified client\" (the person identified as having the problem) and the other family member(s) can benefit from this kind of therapy .About therap y 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 394If you are looking for a family ther a p i st ,c o n t a c t the Ontario Assoc i a t ion for M a rriage and F a mily Th era py at (416) 364-2627 in T o ronto or toll-free at 1-800-267-2638.

Participants share their thoughts and feelings and receive feedback, encouragement and support from other members. This process enables them to learn more about how others respond to them. They can also practise new behaviours in the safety of the group.

These problems can show up in different ways. Children may be fr e- quently sad or rebellious; have difficulty paying attention; have prob - lems eating, sleeping or getting along with schoolmates; or they may skip school. As an adolescent, they may use alcohol or other drugs. While it can be difficult to find mental health services for anyone, parents may find it particularly difficult to find services for children and youth. This is because these services fall under more government ministries, and involve more laws than adult services. There is also a shortage of child and adolescent mental health specialists, which can mean long waiting lists. While it can be frustrating to find services for your child, don't give up! T ry to be hopeful and be persistent. The Internet is a valuable tool for doing research. (For a list of helpful Web sites and phone numbers, see Appendix B.) assess mentand referrals Tw o - t h i r ds of r e f e rrals to childr e n 's mental health services are for behav- ioural problems. Behavioural problems are more common among boys as boys are more likely to act out their problems. Girls, on the other hand, a re more likely to hold in their problems, which can lead to emotional5 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 43problems, such as depression and anxiety. Young people's difficulties often arise from stressful life events, such as abuse, neglect, a parent dying, parents divorcing or other major changes. Adolescents who struggle with gender identity and sexual orientation may develop feel - ings of loneliness and depression. Because of this, rates of suicide ar e higher among gay youth. Children are unlikely to find mental health services on their own. They are usually refer red by a family member, doctor, school, cour t or the Children's Aid Society. As teenagers, they may be able to refer themselves, but it depends on the agency's policies. At some agencies, therapists are required to tell the parents or caregivers that the youth has approached them. Assessments can be done by many different specialists, including child or adolescent psychiatrists (who are specially trained to evaluate, diagnose and treat children and adolescents), nurses, child and youth workers, social workers or psychologists. During an assessment, the specialist usually speaks to both the child and his or her parents, or any other adult who has refer red the child. The specialist will ask each person's opinion of the child's problem. The specialist will also want to know, for example, how the child is doing at school and what the child's relationships are like with friends and family members. As well, the therapist will want to determine if the child has any medical problems that are affecting his or her mood, thoughts or behaviour. If the child is very young, the assessment may include other methods of evaluation. For instance, children may be asked to draw or play with certain toys if they can't use words to express themselves. If the child is having emotional problems and learning difficulties, it is important to refer the child for academic or psychometric testing. This kind of testing assesses both the child's academic and emotional well-being. Psychometric testing can be provided by schools, hospitalsChal lenges& Choic es 44 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth5or psychologists working in private practice. Because there are long waiting lists, parents may choose to have their child tested by private psychologists; however, this can be quite costly . A child's assessment is rarely clear-cut. It can be difficult for parents to know if their adolescent's unusual behaviour or mood is a normal part of adolescent change or a real concern. Because of this, parents sometimes delay getting help. And before they know it, they have a crisis on their hands. Long waiting lists can prevent youth from getting help when the situation is critical. Children's problems often come and go. They may seem to disappear for a while, and then return in a different form or during a stressful time. Because children are continually growing and changing, results of an assessment may suggest several different things that need to be done. These suggestions will depend on the child's stage of develop - ment and age. For instance, when the child is younger, the specialist may want to focus on language and speech or communication. As the child gets older, the specialist may suggest supportive therapy and possibly medication. treatmentand suppor t Depending on the problem, a child could receive services from the following places: family doctor or general practitioner's office school (if a social worker or guidance counsellor is on site) youth clinic, mental health or addiction treatment centre or community residential treatment program children's mental health agency psychiatric unit of a children's hospital or psychiatric hospital private practice or program for young offenders, if the child or youth is in trouble with the law .Servicesatdifferent life s tages 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 455Children are usually treated in outpatient services. While they ar e rarely hospitalized, they may be if they: are a danger to themselves or others have been living in an unhealthy environment (e.g., an abusive home) or have experienced severe symptoms of an eating disorder or early onset depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder . Various specialists may be involved in a child's care (e.g., psychologists, child and youth workers, nurses, child and adolescent psychiatrists, speech or language therapists and families). Children benefit from the many perspectives provided by a team of professionals. Treatment for children or youth generally consists of: working with parents to teach them ways to avoid conflict and to be supportive when interacting with their child. This is an increasingly common part of treatment that may include educational or parents' groups. psychotherapy, with the child individually and with participating family members. (For more information on family therapy, see p. 39 i n Section 4.) The therapist may use a cognitive-behavioural appr o a c h (see p. 38 in Section 4 for a definition) or offer supportive counselling. Because there are often many people involved in a child's care, a case manager may also help co-ordinate services provided by the various caregivers. These caregivers work in schools, hospitals or the community . medication. However, medication is prescribed less often to childr e n than adults. Parents' and professionals' first choice for treatment isn't usually medication. This is because there is little, if any , r e s e a rch on the l o n g - t e r m effects on growing children. Yet r e s e a rch shows that therapies that work to change behaviour do work, so these are often pr e f e rred. Parents and professionals have to consider the potential benefits of medication for the child. Will using the medication mean the childChal lenges& Choic es 46 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth5will lead a happier life? Will the child have an easier time growing up? Will there be less disruption in the child's development? Parents and p ro f e s sionals also have to consider the potential side-effects of the med- i c a t i o n . P a rents should be aware that schools may encourage medication as a way to manage or control a child's behaviour. If a doctor or teacher recommends medication for your child, it is important to determine if he or she is simply harder to handle or is affected by a mental health p ro b l e m . (For more information on medication, see T aking medication, p. 55, in Section 7.) Services for older adult s The percentage of adults 55 years of age and over is growing. As we age, our needs change. Our need for health care, social services and institutional care tends to increase. And yet the needs of older adults are often neglected. The main mental health problems affecting older adults are dementias (along with paranoia), depression and anxiety . They may also experience many other problems, including physical health problems, grief over friends or partners dying, feelings of isolation and loneliness, language barriers, stress around recent immigration and abuse. Older adults are most commonly abused financially (e.g., by theft or fraud). However, the abuse may also be physical. For example, an adult child may hit, slap or punch an older adult. Or the abuse may be psychological (e.g., when partners or adult children are critical, controlling or threatening). Older adults tend to be refer red to mental health specialists by other adults (e.g., a family member or caretaker.) These people often have the difficult task of figuring out if the older adult's behaviour or mood is normal. Is their behaviour just a part of growing old, or is it s o m e - thing to be concerned about? For instance, memory or concentration problems may be a result of the aging process. Or these problemsServicesatdifferent life s tages 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 475could be related to dementias, depression or other mental health pr o b- lems. Problems such as misuse or overuse of alcohol and prescription d rugs may be difficult to detect and can affect the older adult's abilities. Older adults often have to rely on others to refer them for services. This means they may not get services until their situation has reached a crisis and someone else decides it is time for them to seek help. The shame and stigma associated with mental health problems can be particularly severe for older adults. They grew up in a time when t h e re was less openness and understanding of mental health pr o b l e m s . Unfortunately, the fear of being discriminated against, along with the fear of being put in a hospital, often prevent older adults from seeking help on their own. assess mentand referrals Older adults are usually assessed by a family doctor or geriatric outr e a c h team. These teams are made up of doctors, social workers, nurses and occupational therapists. The assessment generally takes place in the older adult's home to see how the person manages and to find out if changes are needed to make it easier and safer to continue living at home. To see a geriatric psychiatry team, older adults usually r e q u i r e a re f e rr a l from their family doctor . treatmentand suppor t While older adults usually receive care from geriatric psychiatrists or geriatric outreach teams, in general, there are not enough profes - sionals to respond adequately to their needs. T reatment usually consists of support, education for family and caregivers, and possibly medica - tion. Team members work with community agencies to provide the support needed. Treatment for older adults may also include addiction services.Chal lenges& Choic es 48 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth5Other care for older adults with mental health problems tends to be mainly social services, rather than actual treatment for mental health problems. These social services may be offered through: seniors' clubs drop-in centres Meals on Wheels, which delivers meals to the home and Community Care Access Centres (CCAC). (See Home care, p. 68, in Section 8.) CCACs mainly provide in-home support services (e.g., a personal support worker comes to the home to prepar e meals for older adults who need help with activities of daily living). Servicesatdifferent life s tages 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 495Natur al healing Many people choose to use natural therapies to help them cope with a mental health problem. These therapies can be less intrusive than medical treatments. They tend to focus more on preventing illness, and p romoting self-healing and healthy living. Natural practitioners generally focus more than medical practitioners on the client's overall well-being (mind, body a n dspirit). They also tend to spend more time with clients than medical practitioners. These therapies are often used in addition to other more traditional approaches. However, some people find that treatments such as acu - puncture, naturopathic remedies or meditation are enough to help them reduce stress and get through difficult times. Still other people may choose traditional healing practices used by the culture or group within which they have lived. Body work Many therapies involve working with the body to influence the mind. Many of these approaches to healing, such as biofeedback, acupunctur e , reflexology, reiki and shiatsu, are drawn from ancient Eastern-based practices. They work to realign the body's energy; reduce stress, anxiety and physical pain; and increase feelings of relaxation. S h i a t s u is a Japanese massage treatment that involves applying physical pressure (through the thumbs, knees and elbows) along energy paths6 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 51called meridians. Shiatsu treatments help balance or regulate the body's energy, which is influenced by stress, fatigue, muscle tension and other health problems. Biofeedback is a technique in which people are taught to use signals from their own bodies to give them feedback about their health. Acupunctur euses similar principles of healing as shiatsu. But instead of applying manual pressure, the practitioner inserts needles into spe - cific points on the skin to regulate the body's flow of energy . These practices are not covered by OHIP , and are generally not cover e d by extended health care plans. An exception is Swedish massage. This may be covered by an extended health care plan for up to a certain amount each year if done by a registered massage therapist. Shiatsu is occasionally covered by extended health care benefits.

Many people are happy to find a pill that decreases their suffering and improves their quality of life. Others do not find medication helpful at all. They may be disturbed by side-effects that are unpleasant and even debilitating or unknown in the long-term. And they may not like the idea that the drug alters the way they think and feel. Some may view their need to take medication as a sign of weakness. Still others may be concerned about addiction. Or they may be discouraged because the drug isn't as effective as they had hoped. Even those people who find that medication is useful may still experi - ence side-effects that make it difficult for them to continue to take their p rescriptions. Many people have to try two or more medications before they find one that they can tolerate (e.g., has few or no side-effects) and which is effective. This is because it is often difficult to predict which drug will work best for which person. It is up to you to decide whether medication is right for you. Should you decide to take medication, your body may have to adjust to it befor e your doctor can assess how long you'll need to take it and the amount of the dose. The doctor's opinion may change, depending on how your body reacts to or absorbs the drug and as new research evolves. 7 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 55A doctor may gradually increase the dose to figure out the amount needed to get the best effect from a drug. The drug will most likely come in a pill or tablet form. Liquids or injections (short- or long-acting) may be recommended for treating certain kinds of conditions. Establish a relationship with one pharmacist you trust, particularly when you are taking several different medications. This way, the pharmacist will be aware of all the medications you've been prescribed and will be able to tell you about possible interactions. But don't rely just on your pharmacist for information: speak to other experts and read up on the medications. QUESTION: What if the medication doesn't work?

Commonly used anti-anxiety medications are diazepam (Valium\u00ae) and lorazepam (Ativan\u00ae). Antidepressants are most commonly used to treat depression. They are also used to treat different forms of anxiety, severe premenstrual mood changes and bulimia. Commonly used called neuroleptics, are used to treat symptoms of acute or chronic psychosis, including schizophrenia, mania and or g a n i c disorders. Some of the most common antipsychotics a re used to help control mood swings (extreme highs and lows) connected with bipolar disorder and prevent further episodes of this condition. Commonly used mood stabilizers are lithium (Lithane\u00ae, Duralith\u00ae) and divalproex (Epival\u00ae). Please note that while some of the more common drugs are listed above, this does not imply that CAMH endorses the use of these particular medications over others. side-effect s Side-effects can be minor or serious, and vary greatly from person to person. Common side-effects include: minor stomach problems (nausea, constipation, diar rhea) sexual difficulties dizziness dry mouth blurred visionMedical servicesallergic reactions fatigue or difficulty getting to sleep twitching and trembling akathisia (restlessness, feeling like you have to move your legs, especially at night) and weight gain. A particularly serious side-effect that can be caused by antipsychotics is tardive dyskinesia. This is an involuntary movement, usually of the tongue, lips, jaw or fingers, that can be permanent. Which side-effects you experience depend on the drug and dose you are taking and how sensitive you are to the medication. In most cases, s i d e - e f fects lessen as therapy continues. But it is also true that side-ef f e c t s may not develop immediately. If you did not have certain symptoms before taking the medication, it's possible that they are a result of the medication. If you do experience side-effects, do not stop or change your medication without first talking to your doctor, pharmacist, nurse or caseworker to find out how to cope with them. If the doctor dismisses your concer n s , persist with your questions. Then consider getting a r e f e rral to someone else if you are not satisfied with the care you are receiving. If the doctor's suggestions don't work, he or she can: p rescribe another drug to counteract the unpleasant effects of the dr u g switch you to a different drug reduce the dose of the drug or gradually withdraw you from the drug.

If you suddenly stop taking your medication, you could experience withdrawal symptoms or the return of the symptoms you were origi - nally being treated for (e.g., insomnia after stopping to take a sleeping pill). You may also experience other symptoms, such as nausea, headaches and dizziness. Withdrawal symptoms usually start within hours or a day or two of stopping a medication. Sometimes even missing two consecutive doses can cause withdrawal. Recurrence or r e t u rn of the original problems can occur within a few days, but can also happen weeks or months later . It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between withdrawal and recur rence of the original problem. If you decide with your doctor to go off your medication or switch to another drug, your cur rent dose will be tapered. This means that the amount of medication you are taking will be slowly reduced. This happens over a few days to several weeks, decreasing your chances of w i t h d r a w a l .

Many are intended to be taken for a long time or indef initely,but that does not mean they are addictive.Mental health problems i nvolve a chemical imbalance , and just like other non-psychiatric problems, they often need long-te rm treatment. Some psychiatric medications,such as anti-anxiety medications and sti m- ulants used to treat attention-deficit/hype ractivity disord er ,can become a d di ct iv e , even when they are taken as prescr i b e d . If you have any concer n s a b o ut thi s ,d o n ' t hesitate to speak to your doc t o r,p h a rm a ci s t or health care p rovider .Tell your doctor if you know you have pr o blems with add i ct io n ,s o the doctor can be careful about the types of med i c a t ion he or she prescr i b e s . Electrocon vuls ive therap y Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is most commonly used for people who have severe depression for whom other treatments have not worked. ECT can be very effective for these people; however, it remains highly controversial. The client is given an anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant. Then an elec - tric charge is applied to the brain that induces a small seizure. Almost all people who are treated with ECT experience some memory loss of what happened immediately before or during the treatment. In some cases, clients lose the memory of significant periods in their lives. Like other treatments for mental health problems, it is important to get all the facts about ECT and its potential side-effects before you decide whether this treatment is right for you.Medical services 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 637 QAMore inten sive and specialized suppor t There are various forms of specialized care for people with severe and continuing mental health problems who have many complex needs. Assertive community treatment (ACT) t eams A s s e r tive community treatment (ACT) teams may include a psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse, social worker, peer support worker (someone with a similar problem or issue who offers support), caseworker, re c reation therapist, addiction specialist, vocational (job) specialist and/or occupational therapist who help you with tasks for day-to-day living. Teams often have up to 10 members. Some of the team members ar e linked to a hospital. Others are based in the community and may work with a local hospital close to where the client lives. ACT teams offer intensive case management and support for people with severe and continuing mental health problems (e.g., people who may have been hospitalized often, and who need help taking medica - tion or following a prescription, finding a place to live or using work and other support services). ACT team members often meet with the client every day in the person's community (e.g., in the person's home or in a coffee shop). They provide services on a long-term basis to make sure people receive consistent care and strong, ongoing support from the same group of health care workers.8 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 65Most of the time, you can get ACT team services through a mental health agency. Like many other services, you may be more likely to find ACT teams in cities and larger communities. Inten sive c ase management Intensive case management is similar to the support offered by ACT teams. The dif f e rence is that it tends to be provided by nurses or social workers working one-on-one with the person, rather than as part of a team. Case managers see their clients regularly to co-ordinate the per - son's care and services. They can provide more one-on-one suppor t than outpatient services, for example. Specialized outpatient servicesin psy chiatric facilities Specialized outpatient services include special intensive programs, rehabilitation for people with severe and chronic (long-term) prob - lems, and community support through case managers. Specialized services may also include day programs. Clients may participate in educational groups or receive help with medication, which may be checked and given out as part of the day program.Chal lenges& Choic es 66 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth8CHALLENGE: Many mental health wor kers do not have specialized training to respond to ce rtain kinds of problems or needs.Some examples where special trai ning may be helpful include treati ng people with more than one problem,such as: a mental health and an addiction problem or concurrent disord er a mental health problem and a developmental disabi lity or dual diagnosis or a mental health problem and physical disabi lity. Health care wor kers may also need trai ning to help people from different communities: for example ,children or ol der adults; people from specific ethnoracial/ethnocultural g roups; people bisexual, gay, transgend ered or transs exual;or people whose needs are not satisfied by existing prog rams (like someone who can't l ive complete ly independentl y but does not need to be in a g roup home). SUGGESTIONS: Generally, you have two main options if you are looki ng for specialized s ervices.You can go to hospitals and health care agencies or you can contact an org a ni z a t i on that serves your particular commun i t y (e.g.,an organization that focuses on helpi ng imm igrants and refugees or people with a dual diagnosis). Specialized s ervices are not ve ry common, so you are more lik ely to get services from an agency s erving the gene ral population.Even if someone does not have specialized trai ning,that pe rson will often have expe rience w rk i ng with people from di v erse cultures and backgr o u n d s . If you look f o r mental health services from this type of agency, you may want to ask if they offer the kind of clin i c ,p ro g ram or e x p ert i se that meets your par t i c u l a r needs (e.g., a cultural i n t erp r e t er , a concurrent d i s o r der pro gram for people with both a mental health and addiction problem,or a youth cl inic for a teenager). If you contact a community organization,they may be able to offer informal couns elling,or l ink or refer you to a mental health agency .More inten sive and spec ialized suppor t 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 678 CSForen sicservices People with mental health problems who break the law (forensic clients) may be placed in forensic psychiatric facilities or community pr o g r a m s , with certain conditions. People who have committed non-violent or low risk offences (e.g., mis- c h i e f , minor theft) may be able to enter diversion programs. Diversion p rograms are set up by the courts as a way to r e d i rect clients and connect them to mental health treatment services or supports. They prevent some people from going to jail and having a criminal record. You can refer yourself to a diversion program or be r e f e rred by a family member, friend or defence lawyer (or duty counsel, if you don't have a lawyer). Court support workers are located in many courts to help you deal with the court system. They help make sure that your case goes through the courts and that alternative sentencing is considered. They can also help you get into supportive housing. Forensic clients can also use assertive community treatment (ACT) programs, community supports and other mental health services in the c o m m u n i t y or receive specialized services in certain hospitals.

Home car e Case managers, community support workers, social workers, psychiatric nurses, occupational therapists and other health care workers can visit you at home to provide help with daily living (e.g., shopping for gr o c e r i e s , preparing a budget). They can help support your family and friends, while helping you make the best use of your own strengths. Assertive community treatment (ACT) team members may also conduct home visits.

There are 43 CCACs across the province that of f e r health and personal support services, including home care for people who are less mobile. First, CCAC case managers assess the types of s e rvices and amount of help the client needs. Depending on the client's needs, they can provide nursing, social work, occupational therapy , physiotherapy, nutrition counselling, help with daily living (such as bathing and cleanliness or getting dressed) and other care. Anyone can make a r e f e rral to CCAC services, including family members, friends, caregivers, health care professionals\u2014and clients themselves.

A crisis is a time of danger or great difficulty. Generally, you will know you are in crisis if you feel like you can't cope and are not in control. For instance, you may be having difficulty sleeping, eating, paying attention or carrying on your normal routine at home, work or school. Or you may have had a serious setback or be wondering if you can keep going. Acting on thoughts of suicide\u2014for example, cutting your wrists\u2014is an emergency . A crisis could result from losing your housing, problems with money , w o rries about your child's well-being, or a problem or difficult situation that is not cleared up and becomes more serious over time. What is a d i fficult situation for one person may be a crisis for another, depending on the person's support system, and how he or she interprets and copes with the problem. Some people show no signs when they are in crisis. In other people, it is obvious when they are having a hard time. They may behave differ - ently and may not think clearly . suicid e Some people may have thoughts of suicide or have even made suicide attempts. They may feel so hopeless and despairing about their lives that they see dying as the only way out of their difficulties.9 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 71More women attempt suicide than men. But more men actually die as a result of suicide because the methods men use are more likely to cause death. Suicide also tends to be more common among people with serious depression, bipolar disorder (formerly called manic depr e s s i o n ) , schizophrenia; people with substance use problems; people with few social supports; Inuit living in the North; and youth who are lesbian, g a y, bisexual, transsexual or transgendered who may be struggling with gender identity issues, and experiencing prejudice and discrimination. Crisis intervention\u2014stepping in to help a person in crisis\u2014involves providing treatment and support as soon as possible after you know the person is in distress. (For information on preparing a crisis plan and having someone admitted to a hospital, see Take action, p. 110, in Section 12.) In an emergency ,call 911. Typesofcrisisservices Here are some ways to get help in a crisis. emergency deper tments of h ospitals You can go to the emergency department of a hospital for help. However, unless you are a danger to yourself or others, the health care pr o f e s s i o n a l (e.g., doctor, nurse) at the hospital may suggest you r e t u rn home or stay with a friend or family member as long as you have someone with you for support. Choosing to be admitted to the hospital is a personal decision. Some people find it stressful to be in a hospital where they are separated from their usual supports and must follow rules and regulations and structured programs. (For more information about getting an assessment in emergency departments of hospitals, see p. 24 in Section 3.)Chal lenges& Choic es 72 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth9QUESTION: When is it necessary for someone to be hospitalized? ANSWER: Hospitalization is usually only recommended when outpatient services cannot adequate ly meet the care needs of a pe rson's condition or the pe rson's challenges of dai ly living. You may prefer to be in the hospital,sur rounded by a support system and away from your day-to-day responsibi lities where your need for medica - tion can be assessed\u2014or if you are already usi ng medication, you can be observed for possible si de-effects. Howeve r ,if you have supports in the community ,it may be better for you not to be in the hospital as long as you feel safe.Bei ng in the hospital can be ve ry disruptive to your life; for example ,it may be difficult to keep up social contacts or deal with f inancial or housi ng issues.Howeve r , you can be forced into hospital in ce rtain situations. (See Appendix C.) Outpatients have a variety of prog rams available to them.Hav ing regular , pre-set appo intments are often helpful dur ing a difficult time. QUESTION: If I am hospitalized,how long will it last? ANSWER: With fewer hospital beds available across the pr ovince and greater efforts to offer supports with in the community ,generally people are only hospitalized for s erious problems and for a short time. Usuall y, hospital stays are for two weeks or less. mobile crisis uni ts and ser vices A mobile crisis unit can provide help in a crisis over the phone or at a person's home. A worker will assess the situation, help to lessen the present crisis and decide on the best way to deal with the problem. Both new and existing clients receive a psychiatric consultation if needed. They are assessed and treated on the spot and connected with other useful services. In an emer gency or cri sis 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 739 QA QALike many other health care services, mobile crisis units are mor e likely to be found in cities and larger communities. However, a greater number of these units are now operating, with some variations, to provide more service to rural areas. To reach a mobile crisis unit, call 911, or contact your local hospital, community mental health agency or a community care access centre. distress and crisis line s D i s t ress or crisis phone lines are open 24 hours a day if you need to talk to someone. Crisis hotlines offer free, anonymous telephone counselling and information. The counsellors must keep everything you say confi - dential. Trained volunteers usually run these phone support services. There are different types of hotlines; for example, assaulted women or rape crisis hotlines, suicide lines and kids' help lines. Distress lines outside of cities are a major source of support and can link you to local services. You can f ind emergency numbe rs at the front of your phone book or through a local community information centre.

(For a list of hotlines,see Appendix A.) safe hou ses and shel ters Shelters offer a safe, temporary place to live during a crisis where workers can give you advice and support. Shelters and safe houses often pr o v i d e s e rvices to specific groups of people; for example, women only , women and children, men only or youth. They may offer housing services, counselling and other supports along with providing a bed and a meal. (See Housing, p. 99, in Section 11.)

Here is a mor e detailed look at some community supports. (For more information, see Section 8: More intensive and specialized support, p. 65.) Consumer/sur vivor initiativ es People who have a mental health problem or people who have used mental health services or programs sometimes describe themselves as consumer/survivors. (Some people believe they \"survived\" a mental health problem. Others see themselves as having survived the mental health system\u2014depending on their experiences.) C o n s u m e r / s u r vivor initiatives are run by and for people who use or have used the mental health system. They were created as an alternative to traditional mental health services. These programs offer education, infor- mation and support from people who have had similar experiences. They also provide social and r e c reational activities, work oppor t u n i t i e s and employment in an alternative business. These programs may be able to help you start up your own business, learn m o re about a mental health issue that affects you or do work as an advo- cate. An advocate is someone who fights for a cause, such as better s e rv- ices for a particular group of people with a specific mental health problem. 10 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 77The Ontario Peer Development Initiative (OPDI) offers support and training to consumer/survivor groups and organizations in Ontario.

CMHA offices will refer you to other mental health centres in your area. They also offer counselling, case management, housing, club - houses, grief support groups, information and assertive community treatment (ACT) teams.

Contact the community information centre in your neighbourhood to f ind supports and s ervices near you. clubhou ses Clubhouses are a place where people with serious mental health problems can go for a sense of belonging and community. Members socialize, develop skills and work side-by-side with staff in the daily operation of the clubhouse. They may prepare meals, do office or maintenance work or other jobs. Some clubhouses also offer transi - tional employment or housing support programs. Clubhouses differ from other mental health services in that consumer/ survivors, in partnership with staff, run the clubhouse, rather than simply receiving services. Clubhouses can be accessed through the Ontar io Peer Development Initiative (OPDI), your local CMHA office or other mental health s ervice provider s.Progress Place ,the fir st clubhouse in Canada and the largest, lists other Ontar io clubhouses on its Web site at www.progressplace.org. drop-in cen tres D rop-in centres focus more on providing r e c reational and social oppor- tunities than work experience. They may have organized programs; for example, craft classes, r e c reational activities, meals and educational sessions. Or people may use the centre to drop by for a coffee, have a rest, play a board game, meet with friends, use the phone or computer o r, in some facilities, take a shower or do laundry . Some drop-in centr e s also provide counselling. Community supports 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 7910Self-help group s Self-help, or mutual aid, groups are made up of people who share a common issue or mental health problem (e.g., abuse, grief, addiction, d e p ression) in themselves or a family member. These groups are usually open-ended, so you can join in or leave the group at any time. Consumer/ survivors or their family members who have experience in the mental health system usually lead the groups. Many people find it rewarding to volunteer in these organizations and share what they have learned with others. G roup members generally gather in informal meetings where they give and receive support and exchange information and ideas on coping and solving problems. The main goal is to decrease feelings of isolation by sharing their experiences with people who will understand what they're going through. Self-help meetings are free, anonymous and confidential. You can also find self-help groups on the Internet. You can join an on-line support group to offer and receive support, discuss issues and problems, and share information. There is more secrecy since you don't meet face-to-face with the group. And you don't have to travel, so people living in remote areas or people with physical disabilities can easily take part. However, you should be careful. You cannot be sure that information you receive on the Internet is accurate or that everyone you communicate with will be responsible and honest.

Alcoho land other drug tr eatment Most people who use alcohol or other drugs do not end up with a problem or dependency. But some do, and many people who come for treatment for alcohol or other drug use problems (also called substance use problems) also have mental health problems. Treatment for substance use problems is usually based on an abstinence or har m - reduction model. Abstinence programs r e q u i r e you to stop all use of the problem drug. Harm reduction programs offer a greater range of possibilities. You might not cut out drug use altogether, but cut back on the amount you use and decide to use the drug more appr o- priately\u2014for example, by not drinking and driving. Harm reduction is viewed as a starting point for people who are not ready to change their behaviour completely . You can live at home and receive treatment through daytime or evening counselling or by taking part in a day program (which means you go to the treatment centre usually three or more days a week for several weeks). Or you can live at the treatment centre and attend a r e s i d e n t i a l t reatment program. Residential treatment can be shor t - t e rm (up to one month) or long-term (about six weeks to six months).Community supports 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 8110Mutual aid or self-help and other support groups provide added suppor t . These include Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Gamblers Anonymous (GA). Family and friends who are affected by the addiction may want to look into mutual support groups such as Al-Anon (for family mem - bers of people with alcohol use problems) and Co-Anon (for family members of people with cocaine use problems). In some cases, support g roups are available for people of a certain age (e.g., youth or older adults) or people from certain cultural or language groups. However, these spe- cialized groups are more likely to be found in cities or larger communities. More and more mental health and addiction programs are also pr o- viding treatment for people who have both an addiction and mental health problem (refer red to as a concur rent disorder). Some commu - nity mental health centres, addiction treatment agencies and hospitals offer services for these concur rent disorders.

They may find that their condition disrupts their work, school and home life. And they may feel unable to take on responsibilities or take part in activities. These feelings are natural and understandable. But with effective treatment and support, people often return to their previous lifestyle, responsibilities and activities. Setting goals and priorities is key to making changes successfully. Your goals and priorities are individual\u2014it is different for every person. Set goals that will challenge you and that will allow you to enjoy and find meaning in what you do. And take some risks\u2014without getting too overwhelmed. Decide how much stress is too much for you and know when to slow down. Finding the right balance can be hard, but it can be learned. Getting better is a process that happens in stages. It helps to discuss your goals with your family, psychiatrist or other health care professional, such as a social worker or a case manager . Both social workers and case managers can link you with other agencies and services, communicate with your family and other caregivers and keep track of your progress. Part of their job is helping you have the best quality of life possible in the community . That could mean finding housing, school, work, social activities or medical care\u2014or dealing with money issues or other hardships. 11 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 85Family and friend s An important part of r e c o v e r y is spending time with loved ones\u2014family , friends, a pet or perhaps your co-workers. These supports can be a gr e a t source of comfort. Other times you may want to open up to someone who has no connection to your personal life, such as a therapist. You must be the judge. People who don't listen and people who criticize or put you down are not supportive. Do you have supportive people in your life? Are your relationships only based on getting support fr o m people or do you like spending time together? Does your friend or family member want to be a support?

Find out about social groups or associations within your ethnocultural community by picking up a copy of the community newspaper . Search the Internet for free things to do in your community or city , or check the events listings in your local community newspaper . Visit local attractions such as a scenic route, historic site or museum. Get involved in local amateur sports organizations.

Or youChal lenges& Choic es 86 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth11may want to try meditation, yoga, tai chi, karate, journal writing, drumming, painting, praying or nature walks. Explore your creative side. You can take classes through local community colleges, art schools, boards of education, community centres and sometimes hospital outpatient programs. In the hospital, there may be a r e c reation therapist who can assess your recreational or social needs and help you create a plan to satisfy these needs. For example, if you're feeling alone or isolated, the recreational therapist may arrange social outings for you. Work We all need and deserve the self-respect that comes from doing some - thing meaningful, whether it is a hobby , r e c reational activity or volunteer or paid work. It gives us a sense of purpose, connects us to other people, and, if we're lucky, provides the money we need to support ourselves. Our society places a great value on work. Often the first question people ask when they meet someone is, \"What do you do?\" It's the way people judge others and, often, the way we identify ourselves. Not having work can be discouraging and financially stressful. People who are out of work may begin to doubt their abilities and lose their self-confidence. Some people who have a period of mental health problems recover fully and return to their jobs. Others never have to leave their jobs and continue to work as usual. Still others find that their problem is more constant and serious and that related difficulties\u2014such as a lack of confidence, difficulty remembering or paying attention, anxiety , restlessness and tiredness\u2014make it too difficult to work. Sometimes these are symptoms of the mental health problem. Other times they are due to the side-effects of medication. Getting wel land s taying wel l 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 8711People who have more than one problem (e.g., a substance use pr o b l e m or an intellectual or physical disability in addition to a mental health problem) may find it harder to get a meaningful job and keep it. And they often face added discrimination. types of work Work can mean having a full-time job, working part-time, doing casual work (work that is neither pr e - a rranged nor regularly scheduled), being self-employed or doing volunteer work to gain experience and confidence in an area that interests you. Volunteer work is often useful if you have been out of the workplace and need recent work experience and references. It is also an oppor - tunity to find out if you need more training. Casual work is a source of additional income\u2014for instance, for people who receive Canada Pension Plan Disability or Ontario Disability Support Program benefits. Another option is working with an alternative business. Alternative businesses are started up and managed entirely by consumer/sur v i v o r s . Employees have the opportunity to work flexible or part-time hours and receive skills training and mentorship (guidance and teaching). They are expected to participate in all business matters and are paid a fair market value for their work. The Ontario Council of Alternative Businesses (OCAB) provides support to consumer/survivor groups that want to set up their own business. Alternative businesses employ more than 800 people across Ontario.

If you have a job, but worry that the effects of job stress may be making a health problem worse, you may want to consider asking for changes in your workplace or work schedule. These are called workplace accommodations. Depending on your needs, accommodations could mean changes in the workplace (e.g., a quieter office) or changes in how you do the work (e.g., taking more frequent breaks or time of f to attend doctor's appointments, changes in job duties, working from home, or receiving more individual supervision or direction). Accom - modations are made as long as you can still do the important, central tasks of the job. In a small organization, approach your immediate supervisor directly about an accommodation; in a large organization, contact your occu - pational health and safety department or employment (and family) assistance program (EAP or EFAP) first. You may have to tell your boss that you have a mental health problem. This decision should be made c a re f u l l y . Weigh the possibility of getting special accommodations with the possibility that your supervisor may view you dif f e rently as a person and as an employee. EAPs and EFAPs are programs that an employer provides to its employees, usually for free. EAPs offer a range of mental health services, such as individual, family and marriage counselling and help with alcohol and other drug problems, legal and financial troubles, workplace conflict and other stress-related problems. work suppor ts Various income benefit programs offer employment (job) support. This support could include job coaching, computer training and paying transportation costs to attend the training. Getting wel land s taying wel l 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 8911Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) provides ODSP employment supports without requiring that you be receiving ODSP income benefits. You can receive these supports when you are working: for instance, if you are having trouble keeping your job because of a disability.

Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) , formerly the Worker's Compensation Board (WCB), supports people who have had a work-related injury or illness. This includes: -traumatic mental stress \u2014a strong, severe reaction to something sudden and unexpected that happens in the workplace or -psychotraumatic disability \u2014having a mental health problem that results indirectly from an injury or accident at work or a condi - tion that was caused by the work-related injur y . The disability has to have occur red within five years of the injury or within five years of the last surgical pr o c e d u r e. You cannot receive WSIB benefits for traumatic mental stress that results from the employer' s work decisions or actions: for instance, if you are laid off, demoted or transfer red. WSIB provides 85 per cent of your net (after deductions) average income before the accident, helps with health care and offers various work supports. They include return-to-work programs involvingGetting wel land s taying wel l 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 9111changes to your job, job market re-entry assessments, job search skills and financial assistance for post-secondary education or other schooling. For more information on WSIB, call 1-800-387-0750 or see the listi ng of phone numbe rs and addresses of local WSIB offices on the WSIB Web site at www.wsib.on.ca. Speak with a local mental health agency (e.g., your local CMHA office) about work supports in your area. Or ask your health car e provider to refer you to an employee support program. (For more information about these programs, see Income benefits on p. 103. For information on vocational programs, see Learning and developing skills below.) Learning and developing sk ills Many people develop a mental health problem between ages 15 and 30, a time when they may be finishing secondary school or taking a post-secondary education program. People with mental health problems succeed in their education like everyone else but mental health difficulties can affect learning. For instance, people with mental health problems may not be treated well by other students. They may fear failure, feel tired and have problems with some thought processes: focusing attention and thoughts, r e m e m - bering things in the short-term, thinking and arguing critically, and solving problems. Some people may experience a crisis related to their condition, which could inter rupt their studies. acco mmodat ions In Ontario high schools, students with behavioural and emotional pr o b l e m s can receive special education through the Individual Education Plan.Chal lenges& Choic es 92 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth11H o w e v e r , services for children and youth with mental health pr o b l e m s are very limited in the schools. Some Ontario universities and community colleges have offices wher e students with mental health problems can get accommodations, or supports, to help them continue their studies; however, these services may also be limited. The name of the office to go to varies; for instance, it could be called the disability office, accessibility services or special needs office. These offices can help students get accommodations such as: writing exams or tests in a separate location from other students having a longer time to write exams or assignments or dropping a course after the official deadline without charges. Students can also get help to access other school services, such as the finance department, tutoring or mental health services. While you can approach a disability office at any time in the school year, contacting them early will mean that your request for an accommodation may be processed faster if you experience a crisis. learning and skills pr ograms Some programs will help you upgrade your skills and increase your confidence: Skills training programs are offered through community and private colleges, universities and high school upgrading services. A local community centre or library may also offer skills training (e.g., computer training for people with low-income) or provide computer time free. Supported education programs help people with mental health problems prepare to return to school or work. These programs are often offered at community colleges. Classes may include assertiveness training, communication, stress management and academic courses.Getting wel land s taying wel l 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 9311Vocational pr o g r a m s s u p p o r t your goals to r e t u rn to work.

These programs offer services such as vocational (job) assessment, career counselling, aptitude (capabil - ities and skills) testing, job search skills and on-the-job training. Drug benefit s Psychiatric drugs sometimes cost a lot, but various benefit programs exist that will cover some or all of your medication costs. If you feel that you cannot afford medications, discuss this with your doctor , pharmacist or caseworker. They may have helpful suggestions. The Ontario government does not cover all prescriptions auto m a t i c a l l y . Some drugs are only covered for a specific use (e.g., bupr o p i o n is cover e d for use as an antidepressant but not when used by someone to stop smoking). You may have to try other less expensive medications first. If they do not work or have too many side-effects, then the cost of the more expensive or alternative drugs may be covered. You may be eligible for the following: Ontario's Drug Benefit Program covers many prescription drugs for people 65 years of age and over and people living on disability or welfare benefits. The program includes a: -Deductible Pr o g r a m for people aged 65 and over with higher incomes. You pay $100 every year up front (deductible), and then $6.11 for every prescription after that. Everyone automa - tically receives this benefit at age 65. Pharmacists can submit the claims automatically if they have your health card. -Co-Payment Program for people aged 65 and over with lower incomes and people receiving support from Ontario Works (OW) or the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP). (See p. 103.) Each prescription can be filled for up to $2. Chal lenges& Choic es 94 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth11To take part, your income or combined income (with your spouse or partner) must be below a certain amount. Applications ar e available at your local pharmacy. If you are aged 65 and over and are approved for coverage, give your pharmacist your health card number and your claims will be submitted automatically . If you are on OW or ODSP , you will need to show your drug eligibility card. To find out more about who can use these prog rams, call the Sen iors Information Line of the Mi nistry of Health and Long-T erm Care toll-free at 1-888-405-0405. TheTrillium Drug Program is an Ontario government drug benefit program. It is aimed at people who have no medical insurance, only limited benefits and/or people who take medications that are ver y costly in view of their income. Anyone with a valid Ontario health c a rd can use the program. The deductible (amount you pay out first) varies depending on your income or combined income (with your spouse or partner) and the number of people in your family .T h e deductible is roughly four per cent of your household net income. After you have paid the deductible, prescriptions cost $2 each. However, as with Ontario's Drug Benefit Program, not all drugs are covered. Applications are available at your local pharmacy . Call the Min i st ry of Health and Lon g - Term Care toll-free at 1-800-575-5386 for more information about the Trillium Drug Prog ram. If you have a private health plan (e.g., a health plan organized thr o u g h your workplace or Blue Cross), check to see which prescription dr u g s and what percentage of their costs are covered for you and your family members.Getting wel land s taying wel l 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 9511Your pharmacist may not charge the $2 administrative fee to fill a prescription. Pick up your prescriptions in person, so you can ask your pharmacist any questions about the medications. If necessar y, some pharmacies will deliver to your home without charge.

If you are a client at a psychiatric fac ility or hospital i n Ontar io, you can contact the Psychiatric Patient Advocate Office (PPAO). Or find out if there is a client relations office or patient representative that handles your complaints at the hospital. If the complaint is with a community agency or cl inic,there won't be a patient advocate. Howeve r , certain health care wor kers,such as a case manager or social wor ker , could advocate for you. You could also report the problem to the health care wor ker's employ er (e.g., a unit director or a supe rvisor). If the complaint is against your the rapist, you should contact the com - plaints department of the g overning or regulatory college your the rapist belongs to.

Hou sing We all need comfortable, safe, affordable housing, a place we can live with dignity\u2014not just a house but a home. Many people will comfortably continue to live where they've always lived. But some people will need to make changes. If you need housing, various options exist for people with a mental health problem. You can find an apartment or house where you can live independently or with v a rying levels of support from workers who will come to your home. Or you can live in a home where you have support with day-to-day living. If you have been an inpatient in a psychiatric hospital or unit, a social worker or caseworker may talk to you and members of your family about living arrangements. You may be able to return home, go to a group home or find a room or apartment where you can live on your own. It is common for people to try one living plan and then anotherGetting wel land s taying wel l 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 9911to find the one that suits them best. For instance, you may find that a more supportive environment is important early on in your recover y, but you might prefer to live independently at a later stage. Ask about all the options that are available in the community . choo sing the be st housin g What you choose will depend on your needs as well as what is available when you are looking. Here are some questions to help you choose the most appropriate housing: How much can you pay? (Prepare a budget.) Do you like the neighbourhood? Is it safe? Is the place in good condition? How much support do you need? Is there shopping close by? Public transportation? Are you close to a mental health agency or worker? Do you want to live alone or with others? If you choose to live with other people, will you be compatible with them in the home? There are housing workers in the community who can assess your housing needs and tell you about the housing and supports that ar e available. You may face a waiting period before the type of housing you want becomes available. types of housin g The range of housing choices varies greatly between communities\u2014 with far less available to First Nations and other isolated communities. Here are the five main types of housing: Private market housing refers to a home that is privately owned. There are no government subsidies and the rent is not based on your income. This includes: -rooms, flats, apartments (in a house or apartment building) or houses. It is usually cheaper to live with other people than to live alone. If you want to live alone or choose to share a placeChal lenges& Choic es 100 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth11with other(s), you could check the For Rent listings in the Classifieds section of newspapers. If you prefer to find a place where people are looking for a housemate, check the Shared Accommodations listings under Classifieds. (Shared accommo - dation usually means having your own bedroom and sharing the rest of the space in the house or apartment.) You could also look for signs on public bulletin boards (e.g., in laundromats or gr o- cery stores) or windows of houses in the area where you would like to live. -rooming or boarding houses. Both rooming and boarding houses involve living together in one house or building, and often sharing rooms with someone else. Rooming houses do not include meals; boarding houses do include meals. Social housing is housing that is partly paid for by government or charges rent geared to income. In this kind of housing, the rent will never be more than 30 per cent of your income. For this reason, many people on social assistance (e.g., Ontario Works or Ontario Disability Support Plan) choose this option. However, there ar e often long waiting lists\u2014sometimes as long as eight to 10 years. In To ro n t o , you can call T o ronto Social Housing Connec t ions (416) 392-6111 to find out about all rent-geared-to-income places in the city . There is no central number for social housi ng outsi de Toronto. Supportive housing is housing where there are support workers in the home who work for the housing provider. The support varies depending on what you need. There could be no support, on-call support, weekly or daily support or 24-hour-a-day support. To get into supportive housing, you need to meet certain conditions: have a diagnosis of a mental disorder for a minimum length of time or have been admitted to a psychiatric facility a minimum number of times or for a minimum amount of time.Getting wel land s taying wel l 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 10111Most supportive housing (e.g., a boarding home, a group home or a co-op) involves sharing living space. However, there are some apar t- ments where you can live on your own. S u p p o r ted housing d i ffers from supportive housing. With suppor t e d housing, the support worker provides care and services from outside the home. People living in supported housing tend to need much less support and can live more independently than people in supportive housing. Supported housing could be a social housing coalition or any other housing environment that provides staff from a community agency. Support workers could be: -visiting homemakers who come in for about an hour a day to help with chores like laundry and cleaning (This service is not easy to get.) -case managers or support workers who spend most of their time helping the client with living skills, such as learning to use the local transit system or learning to cook, prepare a budget and shop or -nurses who give medication and provide support and counselling. E m e r gency housing includes shelters and hostels. It is set up as temp- orary housing for people in crisis. The people who use shelters and hostels generally have no home or their homes have become unsafe (e.g., people who are living on the street, refugees or new immigrants awaiting housing, women who have been abused). Many shelters provide services to specific groups of people: women only, families, women and children, single men only or youth). (See Safe houses and shelters, p. 74, in Section 9.)

Getting wel land s taying wel l 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 10511Help for familie s There are two reasons why you, as a family member, may access men - tal health services: to find treatment and support for someone in your family who has a mental health problem or to get information and support for yourself. The effect on family member s When someone has a serious mental health problem, it is natural for the person's family members to feel worried and stressed. You may be m o u r ning a change triggered by a newly diagnosed mental health pr o b- lem in someone close to you. Or you may be exhausted with trying to help your family member, at the sacrifice of your own needs being met. It is common for family members to feel confused or fearful about what the future holds\u2014or angry or guilty about times they have spent w i t h the family member. Some people lose touch with their own network of friends, which can make them feel isolated and alone. Often people take a long time to realize how emotionally and physically w o rn out they have become. The stress can lead to sleeping poorly and feeling exhausted or irritable all the time. If you are experiencing this stress yourself, don't despair. Seeing the signs is the first step to looking after your own physical and mental health. Finding your own limits and making time for yourself are keys to self- care. Caring for your own needs includes creating a support system of12 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 107friends and family you can rely on. Think about people you might want to share your thoughts and feelings with. Mental health problems ar e h a rd for some people to understand. Open up to people who will support you. And help others by sharing the information and knowledge you have gained. Also, make sure that\u2014along with your own needs\u2014you focus on the needs of other family members who may be in the same situation. T h e re may be times when people's mental health problems cause t h e m to behave danger o u s l y , but violence is not common among people w i t h mental health problems. In fact, they are far more likely to be the victims of violent or aggressive behaviour than to commit violence. However , when someone who has a mental health problem is aggressive, their actions will often be directed toward the people close to them. Care for familie s There are many practical ways to take care of your own needs: L e a rn as much as you can about your family member's mental health p roblem. You can get i n f o rm a t i o n on mental health issues and policies through family support programs, hospitals and organizations that focus on specific disorders, such as the Schizophrenia Society of Ontario and the Mood Disorders Association of Ontario. (For contact information, see Appendix B.) You can also find out about individual family support projects or programs by contacting your local Canadian Mental Health Association office. Join a support group or support program for family members: you can discuss your feelings, get support and learn from others in a similar situation. Family support groups or programs often focus on a specific problem (e.g., schizophrenia or bipolar disorder). In addition to groups for all family members, there are special groups just for spouses, children or parents of people with mental health problems. Some family support programs also have staff or trained volunteers who can give individual support. You can find support groups andChal lenges& Choic es 108 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth12programs through hospitals, community mental health agencies and self-help organizations. Contact specific family support groups thr o u g h the Schizophrenia Society of Ontario and the Mood Disorders Asso - ciation of Ontario. Find out how you can get involved. (See Self-help groups, p. 80, in Section 10.) Find out about the many other services available to you: from mar r i a g e or family therapy to massage, naturopathy or opportunities for cr e a t i v e e x p ression. (See Section 4: About therapy, p. 27, and Section 6: Natural healing, p. 51.) Look into educational groups that help family members and friends understand what the person with a mental health problem is going t h rough. You can learn about symptoms and treatment (e.g., medication or natural therapies). And you can learn about how to help someone you care about and limits to the help you can give. Educational gr o u p s may be of f e red at the hospital or community agency where your family member is being treated. Some self-help organizations have regular education meetings. Think about finding your own therapist. (See Section 4: About therapy, p. 27.) C H A L L E N G E : You do not have anyone to care for your children while y o u go to an appo intment.(T his can be a particular wor ry for si ngle parents.) SUGGESTION: Find out if ch ild care is offered through the prog ram or if you can br ing your ch ildren with you. How you can help suppor t your f amilymember to get help Someone who is moderately depressed or anxious is more likely to agree to get help without needing to be talked into it. But a person with a severe, ongoing mental health problem may refuse treatment. The person may not believe there is a problem. He or she may want to avoid the mental health system because of a bad experience or may feel that treatment will not make a difference. Help for familie s 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 10912 CSYou may try over and over again to convince your family member to take his or her medication or talk to a doctor. But trying to coax and persuade sometimes leads to arguments and continuing conflict. Although you may be very close to your family member, your views may not be welcome. The person may shut you out. Sometimes it helps to have someone else you trust talk to your family member . take actio n There are other ways you can help yourself and your family member . Familiarize yourself with parts of the Mental Health Act ; for instance, the forms that have to be filled out for a mandatory psychiatric assess- ment and possible hospitalization. Family support programs are also a good place to find this kind of information. (See Appendix C, Forms 1 and 2 and information below about calling the police.) Suggest to your family member that he or she consider making a power of attorney for personal care or pr o p e rty in the event that he or she may become incapable of making decisions about personal care (including treatment) or money and other property .(For information on contact- ing a lawyer , see Legal help, p. 96, in Section 11. For more information on mental health laws, see Section 13: Understanding your rights, p. 113.) Write a journal with details of your family member's problem. This could include the history of the problem (e.g., when the problem s t a rted, how it began and pr o g ressed, how many times he or she had symptoms and what they were) as well as a record of treatment (e.g. hospitalizations, medications and a list of the health care pr o f e s s i o n a l s who treated your family member). It may help to pr e p a re the history with another family member; dif f e rent people may have had dif f e re n t experiences or may remember things differently . Confidentiality laws prevent professionals from sharing family information about an adult client without that person's consent, but family members are allowed to provide information. So a journal can be very helpful.Chal lenges& Choic es 110 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth12Prepare a crisis plan if your family member or someone close to you has been in a crisis, in case of another emergency. Keep this plan near the phone or somewhere else where it is easy to find. A crisis plan contains all the information that would be important to have should there be a crisis. For instance, write down the names and phone numbers of: -the hospital nearest you -a mobile crisis unit (see Mobile crisis units and services, p. 73, in Section 9) and -a community relations or other contact person at the local police department. Making contact and informing the local police about your family member's situation will help if a crisis occurs, especially when ther e is a continuing problem. If your family member is in conflict with the law, find out mor e about court diversion programs and other mental health services in the court system. (See Section 8: More intensive and specialized support, p. 65.) If you think your family member might harm him- or herself or others, you might want to consider having your family member put in a hospital. You can contact a doctor, a justice of the peace or the police. -A doctor can make a house call to assess if your family member can be taken to a psychiatric facility for a period of up to 72 hours (three days) for a more complete assessment under Form 1 of the Ontario Mental Health Act . -A justice of the peace can issue a Form 2 for a psychiatric assess- ment authorizing the police to take your family member to the hospital. This is based on a sworn statement from you. Your family member does not have to have seen a doctor. However, the Form 2 only r e q u i r es that your family member be brought to the psychiatricHelp for familie s 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 11112facility for an assessment. The person only stays in the hospital if a doctor issues a Form 1. To contact a justice of the peace in T o ro n t o , call (416) 327-5179. To fi n d a justice of the peace outsi de of Toronto ,contact your local courthouse. -The police are authorized to take someone to the hospital for an assessment if the police or someone else, such as a family member, have seen the person behaving dangerously as a result of a mental health problem or if they have a completed Form 1 or Form 2. (See Appendix C for more details about Form 1 and Form 2.) Prepare a list of questions before you meet with the people who ar e helping your family member. The following will give you an idea of the questions you might ask, depending on whether your family member is already in a hospital or is still being assessed: -Are there any resources to help me cope? -Who will assess (or who has assessed) my family member? -When will we know how long my family member will be kept in hospital? -What are visiting hours? Can children come? -Can I bring food or gifts? -Can I meet the social worker and primary care nurse to discuss plans for leaving the hospital? -Can I be involved in my family member's care team? -Will you contact me before my family member is discharged? (For information about how someone can admit themselves to a hospital, or about admitting someone to hospital against their will, see Section 13: Understanding your rights, p. 113.)Chal lenges& Choic es 112 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth12Under standin g your right s Ontario ment alhealth l aws T h e re are three main acts that outline your rights with respect to mental health services. The Mental Health Act is a set of rules decided by the Ontario legislature that gives doctors and psychiatric facilities cer t a i n powers and gives patients particular rights. These laws apply in general hospital psychiatric units and psychiatric hospitals but not mental health clinics. The Health Care Consent Act deals with rules for consenting, or a g reeing, to treatment. The Substitute Decisions Act deals with how deci- s i o n s can be made for a person and the appointment of powers of attor- ney for personal care and pr o p e rt y . (See the Glossary for an explanation of the term power of attorney.) The Mental Health Act deals with many inpatient issues, including: when someone can be taken and admitted to a psychiatric facility involuntarily how a person can be kept in the hospital who can see a patient's records in the facility, and how to arrange to see them a patient's right to information and right to appeal being involuntarily admitted, held in a facility, denied access to records and so on.13 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 113Being admitted to ho spital volun taryadmission Most people are admitted voluntarily to a psychiatric facility. They choose to enter the hospital for help with a problem. To be admitted voluntarily for care, you can get a doctor's recommendation or go to the emergency department of a psychiatric or general hospital or a local distress centre. You will be admitted if you need observation, care and treatment provided by an inpatient psychiatric facility . involun taryadmission Admitting someone against his or her wishes is a much more difficult situation for everyone concerned. The law identifies various ways to admit a person to a hospital as an involuntar y, or certified, patient. The person must be seen to be a danger to him- or herself or to others, or at risk of serious physical impairment due to a mental health pr o b l e m . A person can also be admitted involuntarily i fthe following are all tr u e : The person received treatment for a mental health problem before. The person showed clinical improvement as the result of the treatment. Based on the person's history and condition, it is likely that the person will cause harm to him- or herself or others, or to suffer substantial mental or physical deterioration or serious physical impairment. The person has been found to be incapable of consent and a substi - tute decision-maker (SDM) (see definition on p. 136) consents to treatment on his or her behalf AND The person is not suitable for informal or voluntary admission. You can become an involuntary patient (r e q u i r ed to stay in the hospital) if you meet the criteria or conditions described above. How long you have to stay in the hospital depends on how long you continue to meet the involuntary criteria or conditions. The Mental Health Act re q u i r es that c e rtain forms must be used to admit patients and keep them in the hos- p i t a l involuntarily, and to let them know about their rights. (To look at some commonly used forms, see Appendix C.)Chal lenges& Choic es 114 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth13If you are an involuntary client, you cannot leave the hospital unless permitted under conditions set by a doctor. If you disagree with being committed to (or kept in) the hospital, you can apply to the Consent and Capacity Board to have the doctor's decision reviewed. Members of this board are not part of the health care team responsible for your care. If you want legal representation (a lawyer) at the hearing, Legal Aid Ontario may be able to cover the costs. (For more information about rights advice, see Legal help, p. 96, in Section 11.) Consenting to or ref using tr eatment The Health Care Consent Act sets out the rules for making decisions about treatment. when you are capable of making decisio ns abou t your treatment You have the right to make a decision about your treatment if you ar e capable of doing so. You are considered capable of making a decision about treatment if you are able: to understand the information that is relevant to the decision about the treatment and to appreciate the likely consequences of consenting to or refusing the treatment (or of not making the decision at all). While in the hospital, you can refuse psychiatric treatment if you ar e considered mentally capable to decide on treatment. All people have the right to get information from their doctor before consenting to treatment. That information should include: the nature of the treatment expected benefits of the treatment important risks of the treatment important side-effects of the treatmentUnder standin g your rights 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 11513other approaches that could be taken and what will probably happen if you don't have the treatment. when you are n otcapable of making decisio ns abou t your treatment If you are found incapable of making treatment decisions, a substitute decision-maker (SDM) is asked to make decisions for you. The SDM has to make choices based on what you said you would want when you were capable. If you didn't express any wishes, the SDM must act in your \"best interests.\" An SDM may be a person's guardian, a power of attorney for personal c a re, someone appointed by the Consent and Capacity Board or a family m e m b e r . If no one is available to act as an SDM, the Office of the Public G u a r dian and Trustee assumes this role. (See Public guardian and tr u s t e e in the Glossar y.)

T o be judged \"incapable of managing your pr o p e rty\" means you are not able to understand important information about your finances and you cannot appreciate the consequences of making or not making financial decisions. Unless you already have a guardian of property or you have made a power of attorney for property that states who will make money and property decisions for you, the Public Guardian and T rustee (PGT) becomes your guardian of property under the Mental Health Act andChal lenges& Choic es 116 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth13makes those decisions. The PGT is a government worker who will man- a g eyour pr o p e rty by making sure that money owed to you is paid and your bills and other expenses are paid. The PGT may let another person (e.g., a family member) take over responsibility if the person shows that he or she has a plan for managing your property in a way that is fair and appropriate. If you think there is a risk that you might be found incapable of managing your finances, you can set up a power of attorney for pr o p e rty to allow someone you trust to take care of these responsibilities (such as paying your mortgage or credit cards). For instance, someone with bipolar dis- o rder or schizophrenia may appoint someone they trust to have power of attorney if necessar y . If you are found to be incapable of managing your pr o p e rty or finances, and you have not already made a continuing power of attorney while you were capable, the court may select a guardian of property for you.

Community treatment order s In December 2000, laws abo ut community treatment orders (CTOs) w e readded to the Mental Health Act . A CTO is a legal order, issued by a d o c t o r , and consented to by the person or his or her substitute decision- m a k e r . The CTO outlines the conditions a person with a serious mental health problem must meet to live in the community . You can be put on a CTO if you have a serious mental illness and meet the following criteria: You have been an inpatient in a psychiatric unit two or more times or for at least 30 days in the last three years.Under standin g your rights 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 11713You and others helping with your care (e.g., SDM, doctor) have made a community treatment plan. Your doctor has talked with the people named in your treatment plan, and they agree to their part in the plan. Your doctor knows that you and your SDM (if you have one) have had the chance to talk with a rights adviser . You or your SDM (if you have one) agrees to the plan. Your doctor has examined you 72 hours before entering into the plan. He or she also believes that: - You will likely become unwell if you do not get treatment or care, and continued supervision in the community. Without this care, your mental illness may cause you to seriously harm your own body or someone else's. Or you could get much worse mentally or physically, or become physically hurt. -If you are not now a patient in a psychiatric facility, your doctor believes you meet the criteria for a Form 1. -The care, treatment and supervision described in your treatment plan is available in the community . CTOs are often used for people who come into contact with the men - tal health system repeatedly. Generally, treatment has worked for them but\u2014for various reasons\u2014they do not continue treatment after leaving the hospital. CTOs cannot be used to treat people against their will while they ar e in the community. But if someone does not follow the requirements of the CTO, that person can be brought against their will to see the psychiatrist issuing the CTO and could possibly be hospitalized.

Appendi xB: Resour ces 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 127Appendi xC: Common l egal f orms Form 1 (Application for Psychiatric Assessment) can be used to bring someone to a psychiatry facility for an assessment that lasts up to 72 hours (three days). To put someone on a Form 1, a doctor must have personally examined the person within the previous seven days and have reason to believe that the person meets certain tests under the Mental Health Act. (See Being admitted to hospital, p. 114, in Section 13 for more details about these tests.) Form 1 also ensures that another doctor will examine the person with the mental health problem. During the assessment, other mental health p rofessionals (e.g., nurses, psychologists and social workers) may meet with the person and his or her involved family members, friends or caregivers to get additional information. F o rm 2 (Order for Examination) is used under the same conditions as the Form 1 but is issued by a justice of the peace. T y p i c a l l y , the Form 2 is used by a person's family or friends when it is not possible for the person to be examined by a doctor. This form allows the police to bring the person to a hospital for a psychiatric assessment. But the form does not authorize the person to be kept at the hospital. If an assessment in hospital is necessary , the examining doctor must then complete a Form 1. Form 3 (Certificate of Involuntary Admission) is used to admit the person to the hospital against his or her will. A Form 3 cannot be issued by the same doctor who issued the Form 1. The Form 3 means that 2003 Centre for Addiction & MentalHealth 129the person will have to stay in hospital for up to two weeks. The person has a right to have the Consent and Capacity Board quickly review the form. Form 4 (Certificate of Renewal) is used when a doctor determines that the person must remain in the hospital involuntarily for another month. This certificate can later be renewed so that the person has to stay for another two months (second renewal) or up to three months (third renewal or more).
