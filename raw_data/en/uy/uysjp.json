Most commonly: chiropractic and massage is combined with healing technologies, such as cold laser. Additionally, visits include posture correction, exercise and nutritional consultation Massage I use myofascial release and massage to assist the healing process. It supports the chiropractic adjustment, encourages tissue healing, and it feels good. Most commonly I use it for pain relief and correcting biomechanics like rotator cuff symptoms. Vertitrac The Vertitrac system is a belt that provides \"Active Decompression\" of the lumbar spine. It is a powerful tool if you are looking for help with disc pain and surgery free rehabilitation from Disc injury. Kinesiology Taping Taping has evolved to elastic based tapes. The new tape helps with support, correction, healing, and can last on the skin 3-5 days. Great for shoulder rotator cuff conditions and feet conditions. Cold Laser Cold laser uses new technology to help improve healing quality and reduce the healing time. It is used with conditions that involve pain, inflammation, and tissue healing. Most commonly I use the Cold laser supplementary to the other body work. Cold laser is available for primary plans as well. Benefit of Cold Lasers Pain Reduction Reduced healing time - Increased Easy to apply Extremely safe Non-Toxic Non-Invasive No side effects or pain Cost effective for both the practitioner and patient Highly effective in treating ailments (more than 90% efficacy) Superior alternative to analgesics, NSAID's and other medications Reduces the need for surgery Works synergistically with other modalities like Chiro, Acupuncture, and PT General Therapeutic Laser Biological Effects Increased Cell Growth Laser photons accelerates cellular reproduction and growth. Increased Metabolic Activity Photons initiate a higher outputs of specific enzymes, greater oxygen and food particle loads for blood cells and thus greater production of the basic food source for cells, Adenosine Tri-Phosphate (ATP). Faster Wound Healing Cold laser photons stimulates fibroblast development and accelerates collagen synthesis in damaged tissue. Anti-Inflammatory Action Laser photons reduce swelling caused by bruising or inflammation of joints resulting in enhanced joint mobility. Increased Vascular Activity Laser photons induce temporary vasodilation that increases blood flow to effected areas. Reduced Fibrous Tissue Formation Laser photons reduce the formation of scar tissue following tissue damage from: cuts, scratches, burns or post surgery. Stimulated Nerve Function Laser photon exposure speeds the process of nerve cell reconnect ion to bring the numb areas back to life. Pain Reduction Almost all systems have a mode of operation specifically designed to reduce pain. "}
