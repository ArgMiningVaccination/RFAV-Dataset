Contraindications EZALLOR SPRINKLE is contraindicated in the following conditions: - Acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. - or any excipients in Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema have been reported with EZALLOR SPRINKLE [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5. Warnings and Precautions 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis EZALLOR SPRINKLE may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including EZALLOR SPRINKLE. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher EZALLOR SPRINKLE dosage. Asian patients on EZALLOR SPRINKLE may be at higher risk for myopathy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]. The myopathy risk is greater in patients taking EZALLOR SPRINKLE 40 mg daily compared with lower EZALLOR SPRINKLE dosages. Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis The concomitant use of EZALLOR SPRINKLE with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil is not recommended. EZALLOR SPRINKLE dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain antiviral medications, darolutamide, and regorafenib [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Niacin, fibrates, and colchicine also increase the risk myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if EZALLOR SPRINKLE is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy). Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the EZALLOR SPRINKLE dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist discontinuation reductase with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of EZALLOR SPRINKLE [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, increases in serum transaminases to more than three times the ULN occurred in 1.1% of patients taking EZALLOR SPRINKLE versus 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with EZALLOR Sprinkle. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including EZALLOR SPRINKLE. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Consider liver enzyme testing before EZALLOR SPRINKLE initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. EZALLOR SPRINKLE is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE. 5.4 Proteinuria and Hematuria In the rosuvastatin clinical trial program, dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among rosuvastatin treated patients. These findings were more frequent in patients taking rosuvastatin 40 mg, when compared to lower doses of rosuvastatin or comparator statins, though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function. Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown, consider a dose reduction for patients on EZALLOR SPRINKLE therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and/or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing. 5.5 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including EZALLOR SPRINKLE. Based on clinical trial data with EZALLOR SPRINKLE, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices. 6. Adverse Reactions/Side Effects The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Myopathy and (5.3)] Proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 2. These studies had a treatment duration of up to 12 weeks. Table 2.

The following laboratory abnormalities have also been dipstick-positive thyroid function abnormalities. In the METEOR study, patients were treated with rosuvastatin 40 mg (n=700) or placebo (n=281) with a mean treatment duration of 1.7 years. Adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Adverse Reactions Reported in 2% of Patients Treated with Rosuvastatin and > Placebo in the METEOR Trial | | Adverse Reactions | | Placebo N=281 % | | Rosuvastatin 40 mg N=700 % | | Myalgia | | 12.1 | | 12.7 | | Arthralgia | | 7.1 | | 10.1 | | Headache | | 5.3 | | 6.4 | | Dizziness | | 2.8 | | 4.0 | | Increased CPK | | 0.7 | | 2.6 | | Abdominal pain | | 1.8 | | 2.4 | | ALT greater than 3x ULN2 | | 0.7 | | 2.2 2 Frequency recorded as abnormal laboratory value. In the JUPITER study, patients were treated with rosuvastatin 20 mg (n=8,901) or placebo (n=8,901) for a mean duration of 2 years. In JUPITER there was a significantly higher frequency of diabetes mellitus reported in patients taking rosuvastatin (2.8%) versus patients taking placebo (2.3%). Mean HbA1c was significantly increased by 0.1% in rosuvastatin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. The number of patients with a HbA1c >6.5% at the end of the trial was significantly higher in rosuvastatin-treated versus placebo-treated patients [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 4. Table 4. Adverse Reactions Reported in 2% of Patients Treated with Rosuvastatin and > Placebo in the JUPITER Trial | | Adverse Reactions | | Placebo N=8,901 % | | Rosuvastatin 20 mg N=8,901 % | | Myalgia | | 6.6 | | 7.6 | | Arthralgia | | 3.2 | | 3.8 | | Constipation | | 3.0 | | 3.3 | | Diabetes mellitus | | 2.3 | | 2.8 | | Nausea | | 2.3 | | 2.4 Pediatric Patients with HeFH In a 12-week controlled study in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH with rosuvastatin 5 mg to 20 mg daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14)], elevations in serum CK greater than 10 x ULN were observed more frequently in rosuvastatin-treated patients compared with patients receiving placebo. Four of 130 (3%) patients treated with rosuvastatin (2 treated with 10 mg and 2 treated with 20 mg) had increased CK greater than 10 x ULN, compared to 0 of 46 patients on placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of rosuvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood Disorders: thrombocytopenia Hepatobiliary use Nervous System Disorders: peripheral neuropathy, rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, and confusion) associated with the use of all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. Psychiatric Disorders: depression, sleep disorders (including insomnia and nightmares) Reproductive Systemand Breast Disorders: gynecomastia Respiratory Disorders: interstitial lung disease Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), lichenoid drug eruption 7. Drug Interactions 7.1 Drug Interactions that Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with EZALLOR SPRINKLE Rosuvastatin is a substrate of CYP2C9 and transporters (such as OATP1B1, BCRP). Rosuvastatin plasma levels can be significantly increased with concomitant administration of inhibitors of CYP2C9 and transporters. Table 5 includes a list of drugs that increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly with EZALLOR SPRINKLE and instructions for preventing or managing them [see Warnings andPrecautions (5.1)and Clinical Pharmacology(12.3)]. Table 5: Drug Interactions that Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with EZALLOR SPRINKLE | | Cyclosporine | | Clinical Impact: | | Cyclosporine increased rosuvastatin exposure 7-fold.

The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with EZALLOR SPRINKLE | | Intervention: | | Consider if the benefit of using fibrates concomitantly with EZALLOR SPRINKLE outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. | | Niacin | | Clinical Impact: | | Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have occurred with concomitant use of lipid-modifying doses (1 g/day) of niacin with EZALLOR SPRINKLE. | | Intervention: | | Consider if the benefit of using lipid-modifying doses (1 g/day) of niacin concomitantly with EZALLOR SPRINKLE outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. | | Colchicine | | Clinical Impact: | | Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of colchicine with EZALLOR SPRINKLE. | | Intervention: | | Consider if the benefit of using colchicine concomitantly with EZALLOR SPRINKLE outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. 7.2 Drug Interactions that Decrease the Efficacy of EZALLOR SPRINKLE Table 6 presents drug interactions that may decrease the efficacy of EZALLOR SPRINKLE and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 6: Drug Interactions that Decrease the Efficacy of EZALLOR SPRINKLE | | Antacids | | Clinical Impact: | | Concomitant aluminum and magnesium hydroxide combination antacid administration decreased the mean exposure of rosuvastatin 50% [see ClinicalPharmacology (12.3)]. | | Intervention: | | In patients taking antacid, administer EZALLOR SPRINKLE at least 2 hours after the antacid. 7.3 Rosuvastatin Effects on Other Drugs Table 7 presents rosuvastatin's effect on other drugs and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 7: Rosuvastatin Effects on Other Drugs | | Warfarin | | Clinical Impact: | | Rosuvastatin significantly increased the INR in patients receiving warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. | | Intervention: | | In patients taking warfarin, obtain an INR before starting EZALLOR SPRINKLE and frequently enough after initiation, dose titration or discontinuation to ensure that no significant alteration in INR occurs. Once the INR is stable, monitor INR at regularly recommended intervals. 8. Use In Specific Populations 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE when pregnancy is recognized. Alternatively, consider the ongoing therapeutic needs of the individual patient. EZALLOR SPRINKLE decreases synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol; therefore, EZALLOR SPRINKLE may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. In addition, treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients. Available data from case series and prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies over decades of use with statins in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations. Published data from prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies with rosuvastatin use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage (see Data). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in pregnant rats or rabbits orally administered rosuvastatin during the period of organogenesis at doses that resulted in systemic exposures equivalent to human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg/day, based on AUC and body surface area (mg/m2) respectively (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data A Medicaid cohort linkage study of 1,152 statin-exposed pregnant women compared to 886,996 controls did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester of pregnancy, after adjusting for potential confounders - including maternal age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and alcohol and tobacco use - using propensity score-based methods. The relative risk of congenital malformations between the group with statin use and the group with no statin use in the first trimester was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.37) after controlling for confounders, particularly preexisting diabetes mellitus. There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ-specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders. In the majority of pregnancies, statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation, lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index, use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin, and lack of information on non-live births. Animal Data In female rats given 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg/day before mating and continuing through to gestation day 7 resulted in decreased fetal body weight (female pups) and delayed ossification at 50 mg/kg/day (10 times the human exposure at the MRHD dose of 40 mg/day based on AUC). In pregnant rats given 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 (weaning), decreased pup survival occurred at 50 mg/kg/day (dose equivalent to 12 times the MRHD of 40 mg/day based body surface area). In pregnant rabbits given 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 6 to day 18, decreased fetal viability and maternal mortality was observed at 3 mg/kg/day (dose equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg/day based on body surface area). Rosuvastatin crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits and is found in fetal tissue and amniotic fluid at 3% and 20%, respectively, of the maternal plasma concentration following a single 25 mg/kg oral gavage dose on gestation day 16 in rats. In rabbits, fetal tissue distribution was 25% of maternal plasma concentration was observed in rabbits after a single oral gavage dose of 1 mg/kg on gestation day 18.Risk Summary EZALLOR Sprinkle is contraindicated for use in pregnant women since safety in pregnant women has not been established and there is no apparent benefit to therapy with EZALLOR Sprinkle during pregnancy. Because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol, EZALLOR Sprinkle may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. EZALLOR Sprinkle should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications (4)]. Limited published data on the use of rosuvastatin are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects with oral administration of rosuvastatin during organogenesis at systemic exposures equivalent to a maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg/day in rats or rabbits (based on AUC and body surface area, respectively). In rats and rabbits, decreased pup/fetal survival occurred at 12 times and equivalent, respectively, to the MRHD of 40 mg/day [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Limited published data on rosuvastatin have not shown an increased risk of major congenital malformations or miscarriage. Rare reports of congenital anomalies have been received following intrauterine exposure to other statins. In a review of approximately 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to simvastatin or lovastatin, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deaths/stillbirths did not exceed what would be expected in the general population. The number of cases is adequate to exclude a 3 to 4-fold increase in congenital anomalies over the background incidence. In 89% of the prospectively followed pregnancies, drug treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Animal Data Rosuvastatin crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits and is found in fetal tissue and amniotic fluid at 3% and 20%, respectively, of the maternal plasma concentration following a single 25 mg/kg oral gavage dose on gestation day 16 in rats. A higher fetal tissue distribution (25% maternal plasma concentration) was observed in rabbits after a single oral gavage dose of 1 mg/kg on gestation day 18. Rosuvastatin administration did not indicate a teratogenic effect in rats at 25 mg/kg/day or in rabbits 3 mg/kg/day (doses equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg/day based on AUC and body surface area, respectively). In female rats given 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg/day before mating and continuing through to gestation day 7 resulted in decreased fetal body weight (female pups) and delayed ossification at 50 mg/kg/day (10 times the human exposure at the MRHD dose of 40 mg/day based on AUC). In pregnant rats given 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 (weaning), decreased pup survival occurred at 50 mg/kg/day (dose equivalent to 12 times the MRHD of 40 mg/day based body surface area). In pregnant rabbits given 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 6 to day 18, decreased fetal viability and maternal mortality was observed at 3 mg/kg/day (dose equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg/day based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in published literature indicate that rosuvastatin is present in human milk. There is no available information on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Statins, including EZALLOR SPRINKLE, decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol and may cause harm to the breastfed infant. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, based on the mechanism of action, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with EZALLOR SPRINKLE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of rosuvastatin as an adjunct to diet to reduce LDL-C have been established in pediatric patients 8 years of age and older with HeFH. Use of rosuvastatin for this indication is based on one 12-week controlled trial with a 40-week open-label extension period in 176 pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH and one 2-year open-label, uncontrolled trial in 175 pediatric patients 8 years of age and older with HeFH [see ClinicalStudies (14)]. In the 1-year trial with a 12-week controlled phase, there was no detectable effect of rosuvastatin on growth, weight, BMI (body mass index), or sexual maturation in patients aged 10 to 17 years. The safety and effectiveness of rosuvastatin as an adjunct to other LDL-C-lowering therapies to reduce LDL-C have been established pediatric patients 7 years of age and older with HoFH. Use of rosuvastatin for this indication is based on a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 14 pediatric patients 7 years of age and older with HoFH [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The safety and effectiveness of rosuvastatin have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 8 years of age with HeFH, younger than 7 years of age with HoFH, or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia (other than HeFH or HoFH). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of rosuvastatin-treated patients in clinical studies, 3,159 (31%) were 65 years and older, and 698 (6.8%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Advanced age (65 years) is a risk factor for rosuvastatin-associated myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, recognizing the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of myopathy. Monitor geriatric patients receiving EZALLOR SPRINKLE for the increased risk of myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Rosuvastatin exposure is not influenced by mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Exposure to rosuvastatin is increased to a clinically significant extent in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) who are not receiving hemodialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Renal impairment is a risk factor for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Monitor all patients with renal impairment for development of myopathy. In patients with severe renal impairment not on hemodialysis, the recommended starting dosage is 5 mg daily and should not exceed 10 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment EZALLOR SPRINKLE is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis. Chronic alcohol liver disease is known to increase rosuvastatin exposure. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Contraindications (4), Warning and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.8 Asian Patients Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated an approximate 2-fold increase in median exposure to rosuvastatin in Asian subjects when compared with White controls. Adjust the EZALLOR SPRINKLE dosage in Asian patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 10. Overdosage No specific antidotes for rosuvastatin are known. Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of rosuvastatin. Contact Poison Control (1-800-222-1222) for latest recommendations. 11. Ezallor Sprinkle Description Rosuvastatin calcium is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA)-reductase calcium is bis[(E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino] pyrimidin-5-yl]-(3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid] calcium salt with the following structural formula: The molecular formula for rosuvastatin calcium is (C22H27FN3O6S)2\u00b7Ca and the molecular weight is 1,001.14. Rosuvastatin calcium is off-white to light yellow amorphous powder that is slightly soluble in water and methanol, and insoluble in ethanol. Rosuvastatin calcium is a hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient (octanol/water) of 0.13 at pH of 7. Each rosuvastatin capsule for oral use contains 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg of rosuvastatin (present as 5.198 mg, 10.395 mg, 20.790 mg, or 41.580 mg of rosuvastatin calcium) in the form of granules with the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 4000, and silicon dioxide. The capsule shells have the following inactive ingredients: gelatin, titanium dioxide, water, and sodium lauryl sulfate. Additionally following colorants are used in capsules: FD&C Red 40 (5 mg), FD&C Blue 1 (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg), D&C Red 28 (5 mg, 10 mg), FD&C Red 3 (20 mg), and FD&C Green 3 (40 mg). The imprinting black ink contains shellac, dehydrated alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, propylene glycol, strong ammonia solution, black iron oxide, purified water, and potassium hydroxide. 12. Ezallor Sprinkle - Clinical Pharmacology 12.1 Mechanism of Action Rosuvastatin is an inhibitor reductase, converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl cholesterol 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by rosuvastatin accelerates the expression of LDL-receptors, followed by the uptake of LDL-C from blood to the liver, leading to a decrease in plasma LDL-C and total cholesterol. Sustained inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver also decreases levels of very-low-density lipoproteins. The maximum LDL-C reduction of rosuvastatin is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In clinical pharmacology studies in man, peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing. Both Cmax and AUC increased in approximate proportion to rosuvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20%. The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration. Effect of food Administration of rosuvastatin with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin. Distribution Mean volume of distribution at steady-state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters. Rosuvastatin is 88% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations. Elimination Metabolism Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized; approximately 10% of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite. The major metabolite is N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 \\ 2C9, and in vitro studies have demonstrated that N-desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one-sixth to one-half the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound. Overall, greater than 90% of active plasma HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound. Excretion Following oral administration, rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces (90%). After an intravenous dose, approximately 28% of total body clearance was via the renal route, and 72% by the hepatic route. The elimination half-life of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between the nonelderly and elderly populations (age 65 years). Pediatric Patients In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of two pediatric trials involving patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 10 to 17 years of age and 8 to 17 years of age, respectively, rosuvastatin exposure appeared comparable to or lower than rosuvastatin exposure in adult patients. Male and Female Patients There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between men and women. Racial or Ethnic Groups A population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics among White, Hispanic, and Black or Afro-Caribbean groups. However, pharmacokinetic studies, including one conducted in the US, have demonstrated an approximate 2-fold elevation in median exposure (AUC and Cmax) in Asian subjects when compared with a White control group. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) had no influence on plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. However, plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin increased to a clinically significant extent (about 3-fold) in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) not receiving hemodialysis compared with healthy (CLcr >80 mL/min/1.73 m2). Steady-state plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin in patients on chronic hemodialysis were approximately 50% greater compared with healthy volunteer subjects with normal renal function. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcohol liver disease, plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were modestly increased. In patients with Child-Pugh A disease, Cmax and AUC were increased by 60% and 5%, respectively, as compared with patients with normal liver function. In patients with Child-Pugh B disease, Cmax and AUC were increased 100% and 21%, respectively, compared with patients with normal liver function. Drug Interactions Studies Rosuvastatin clearance is not dependent on metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 to a clinically significant extent. Rosuvastatin is a substrate for certain transporter proteins including the hepatic uptake organic anion-transporting polyprotein (OATP1B1) and efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Concomitant administration of rosuvastatin with medications that are inhibitors of these transporter proteins (e.g., cyclosporine, certain HIV protease inhibitors) may result in increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Higher plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin have been reported in very small groups of patients (n=3 to 5) who have two reduced function alleles of the gene that encodes OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1 521T > The frequency of this (i.e., SLCO1B1 521 C/C) is generally lower than 5% in most racial/ethnic groups. The impact of this polymorphism on efficacy and/or safety of rosuvastatin has not been clearly established. 13. Nonclinical Toxicology 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 2, 20, 60, or 80 mg/kg/day by oral gavage, the incidence of uterine stromal polyps was significantly increased in females at 80 mg/kg/day at systemic exposure 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC. Increased incidence of polyps was not seen at lower doses. In a 107-week carcinogenicity study in mice given 10, 60 or 200 mg/kg/day by oral gavage, an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma was observed at 200 mg/kg/day at systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC. An increased incidence of hepatocellular tumors was not seen at lower doses. Rosuvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the mouse lymphoma assay, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Rosuvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 5, 15, 50 mg/kg/day, males were treated for 9 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout mating until gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 50 mg/kg/day (systemic exposures up to 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC). In testicles of dogs treated with rosuvastatin at 30 mg/kg/day for one month, spermatidic giant cells were seen. Spermatidic giant cells were observed in monkeys after 6-month treatment at 30 mg/kg/day in addition to vacuolation of seminiferous tubular epithelium. Exposures in the dog were 20 times and in the monkey 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on body surface area. Similar findings have been seen with other drugs in this class. 14. Clinical Studies Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study, the effect of rosuvastatin on the occurrence of major cardiovascular (CV) disease events was assessed in 17,802 men (50 years) and women (60 years) who had no clinically evident cardiovascular disease, LDL-C levels <130 mg/dL and hsCRP levels 2 mg/L. The study population had an estimated baseline coronary heart disease risk of 11.6% over 10 years based on the Framingham risk criteria and included a high percentage of patients with additional risk factors such as hypertension (58%), low HDL-C levels (23%), cigarette smoking (16%), or a family history of premature CHD (12%). Patients had a median baseline LDL-C of 108 mg/dL and hsCRP of 4.3 mg/L. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n=8901) or rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily (n=8901) and were followed for a mean duration of 2 years. The JUPITER study was stopped early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board due to meeting predefined stopping rules for efficacy in rosuvastatin-treated subjects. The primary end point was a composite end point consisting of the time-to-first occurrence of any of the following major CV events: CV death, nonfatal myocardial or an arterial revascularization procedure. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of major CV events (252 events in the placebo group vs. 142 events in the rosuvastatin group) with a statistically significant (p<0.001) relative risk reduction of 44% and absolute risk reduction of 1.2% (see Figure 1). The risk reduction for the primary end point was consistent across the following predefined subgroups: age, sex, race, smoking status, family history of premature CHD, body mass index, LDL-C, HDL-C, and hsCRP levels. Figure 1. Time to First Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Events in JUPITER The individual components of the primary end point are presented in Figure 3. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and arterial revascularization procedures. There were no significant treatment differences between the rosuvastatin and placebo groups for death due to cardiovascular causes or hospitalizations for unstable angina. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (6 fatal events and 62 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 9 fatal events and 22 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin-treated subjects) and the risk of stroke (6 fatal events and 58 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 3 fatal events and 30 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin-treated subjects). In a post-hoc subgroup analysis of JUPITER subjects (rosuvastatin=725, placebo=680) with a hsCRP 2 mg/L and no other traditional risk factors (smoking, BP 140/90 or taking antihypertensives, low HDL-C) other than age, after adjustment for high HDL-C, there was no significant treatment benefit with rosuvastatin treatment. Figure 2. Major CV Events by Treatment Group in JUPITER At one year, rosuvastatin increased HDL-C and reduced LDL-C, hsCRP, total cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels (p<0.001 for all versus placebo). Rosuvastatin Total-C, LDL-C, ApoB, non-HDL-C, and in hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with hyperlipidemia, rosuvastatin given as a single daily dose (5 to 40 mg) for 6 weeks significantly reduced Total-C, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and ApoB, across the dose range (Table 10). Table 10: Lipid-modifying Effect of Rosuvastatinin Adult Patients with Hyperlipidemia (Adjusted Mean % Change from Baseline at Week 6) | | Dose | | N | | Total-C | | LDL-C | | Non-HDL-C | | ApoB | | TG | | HDL-C | | Placebo | | 13 | | -5 | | -7 | | -7 | | -3 | | -3 | | 3 | | Rosuvastatin 5 mg | | 17 | | -33 | | -45 | | -44 | | -38 | | -35 | | 13 | | Rosuvastatin 10 mg | | 17 | | -36 | | -52 | | -48 | | -42 | | -10 | | 14 | | Rosuvastatin 20 mg | | 17 | | -40 | | -55 | | -51 | | -46 | | -23 | | 8 | | Rosuvastatin 40 mg | | 18 | | -46 | | -63 | | -60 | | -54 | | -28 | | 10 Rosuvastatin was compared with the simvastatin, patients with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

Percent Change in LDL-C by Dose of Rosuvastatin, Atorvastatin, Simvastatin, and Pravastatin From Baseline to Week 6 (LS Mean1) in Adult Patients with Hyperlipidemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia (Sample Sizes Ranging from 156 to 167 Patients Per Group) | | Treatment Daily Dose | | Treatment | | 10 mg | | 20 mg | | 40 mg | | 80 mg | | Rosuvastatin | | -462 | | -523 | | -554 | | --- | | Atorvastatin | | -37 | | -43 | | -48 | | -51 | | Simvastatin | | -28 | | -35 | | -39 | | -46 | | Pravastatin | | -20 | | -24 | | -30 | | --- 1 Corresponding standard errors are approximately 1.00. 2 Rosuvastatin 10 mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin 10 mg; pravastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg; simvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg. (p<0.002) 3 Rosuvastatin 20 mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin 20 mg and 40 mg; pravastatin 20 mg and 40 mg; simvastatin 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg. (p<0.002) 4 Rosuvastatin 40 mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin 40 mg; pravastatin 40 mg; simvastatin 40 mg, and 80 mg. (p<0.002) Slowing of the Progression of Atherosclerosis In the Measuring Effects on Intima Media Thickness: an Evaluation Of Rosuvastatin 40 mg (METEOR) study, the effect of therapy with rosuvastatin on carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B-mode ultrasonography in patients with elevated LDL-C, at low risk (Framingham risk <10% over ten years) for symptomatic coronary artery disease and with subclinical atherosclerosis as evidenced by carotid intimal-medial thickness (cIMT). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study 984 adult patients were randomized (of whom 876 were analyzed) in a 5:2 ratio to rosuvastatin 40 mg or placebo once daily. Ultrasonograms of the carotid walls were used to determine the annualized rate of change per patient from baseline to two years in mean maximum cIMT of 12 measured segments. The estimated difference in the rate of change in the maximum cIMT analyzed over all 12 carotid artery sites between patients treated with rosuvastatin and was -0.0145 mm/year (95% CI -0.0196, -0.0093; p<0.0001). The annualized rate of change from baseline for the placebo group was +0.0131 mm/year (p<0.0001). The annualized rate of change from baseline for the group treated with rosuvastatin was -0.0014 mm/year (p=0.32). At an individual patient level in the group treated with rosuvastatin, 52.1% of patients demonstrated an absence of disease progression (defined as a negative annualized rate of change), compared to 37.7% of patients in the placebo group. HeFH in Adults In a study of adult patients with HeFH (baseline mean LDL of 291 mg/dL), patients were randomized to rosuvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg. The dose was increased at 6-week intervals. Significant LDL-C reductions from baseline were seen at each dose in both treatment groups (Table 12). Table 12: LDL-C Percent Change from Baseline | | Rosuvastatin(n=435) LS Mean1(95% CI) | | Atorvastatin (n=187) LS Mean1(95% CI) | | Week 6 | | 20 mg | | -47% (-49%, -46%) | | -38% (-40%, -36%) | | Week 12 | | 40 mg | | -55% (-57%, -54%) | | -47% (-49%, -45%) | | Week 18 | | 80 mg | | NA | | -52% (-54%, -50%) 1 LS Means are least square means adjusted for baseline LDL-C HeFH in Pediatric Patients In a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, 12-week study, 176 (97 male and 79 female) children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia were randomized to rosuvastatin 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg or placebo daily. Patients ranged in age from 10 to 17 years (median age of 14 years) with approximately 30% of the patients 10 to 13 years and approximately 17%, 18%, 40%, and 25% at Tanner stages II, III, IV, and V, respectively. Females were at least 1 year postmenarche. Mean LDL-C at baseline was 233 mg/dL (range of 129 to 399). The 12-week double-blind phase was followed by a 40 week open label dose-titration phase, where all patients (n=173) received 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg rosuvastatin daily. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced LDL-C (primary end point), total cholesterol and ApoB levels at each dose compared to placebo. Results are shown in Table 13 below. Table 13. Lipid-Modifying Effects of Rosuvastatin in Pediatric Patients 10 to 17 years of Age with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (Least-Squares Mean Percent Change from Baseline To Week 12) | | Dose (mg) | | N | | LDL-C | | HDL-C | | Total-C | | TG1 | | ApoB | | Placebo | | 46 | | -1% | | +7% | | 0% | | -7% | | -2% | | 5 | | 42 | | -38% | | +4%2 | | -30% | | -13%2 | | -32% | | 10 | | 44 | | -45% | | +11%2 | | -34% | | -15%2 | | -38% | | 20 | | 44 | | -50% | | +9%2 | | -39% | | 16%2 | | -41% 1 Median percent change 2 Difference from placebo not statistically significant Rosuvastatin was also studied in a two year open-label, uncontrolled, titration-to-goal trial that included 175 children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who were 8 to 17 years old (79 boys and 96 girls). All patients had a documented genetic defect in the LDL receptor or in ApoB. Approximately 89% were White, 7% were Asian, 1% were Black, and fewer than 1% were Hispanic. Mean LDL-C at baseline was 236 mg/dL. Fifty-eight (33%) patients were prepubertal at baseline. The starting rosuvastatin dosage for all children and adolescents was 5 mg once daily. Children 8 to less than 10 years of age (n=41 at baseline) could titrate to a maximum dosage of 10 mg once daily, and children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age could titrate to a maximum dosage of 20 mg once daily. The reductions in LDL-C from baseline were generally consistent across age groups within the trial as well as with previous experience in both adult and pediatric controlled trials. HoFH in Adult and Pediatric Patients In an open-label, forced-titration study, HoFH patients (n=40, 8 to 63 years) were evaluated for their response to rosuvastatin 20 to 40 mg titrated at a 6-week interval. In the overall population, the mean LDL-C reduction from baseline was 22%. About one-third of the patients benefited from increasing their dose from 20 mg to 40 mg with further LDL-C lowering of greater than 6%. In the 27 patients with at least a 15% reduction in LDL-C, the mean LDL-C reduction was 30% (median 28% reduction). Among 13 patients with an LDL-C reduction of <15%, 3 had no change or an increase in LDL-C. Reductions in LDL-C of 15% or greater were observed in 3 of 5 patients with known receptor negative status. HoFH in Pediatric Patients Rosuvastatin was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, crossover study in 14 pediatric patients with HoFH. The study included a 4-week dietary lead-in phase during which patients received rosuvastatin 10 mg daily, a cross-over phase that included two 6-week treatment periods with either rosuvastatin 20 mg or placebo in random order, followed by a 12-week open-label phase during which all patients received rosuvastatin 20 mg. Patients ranged in age from 7 to 15 years of age (median 11 years), 50% were male, 71% were White, 21% were Asian, 7% were Black, and no patients were of Hispanic ethnicity. Fifty percent were on apheresis therapy and 57% were taking ezetimibe. Patients who entered the study on apheresis therapy or ezetimibe continued the treatment throughout the entire study. Mean LDL-C at baseline was 416 mg/dL (range 152 to 716 mg/dL). A total of 13 patients completed both treatment periods of the randomized crossover phase; one patient withdrew consent due to inability to have blood drawn during the crossover phase. Rosuvastatin 20 mg significantly reduced LDL-C, total cholesterol, ApoB, and non-HDL-C compared to placebo (Table 14). Table 14.

Following dietary lead-in, patients were randomized to a sequence of treatments for 6 weeks each: rosuvastatin 10 mg followed by rosuvastatin 20 mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg followed by rosuvastatin 10 mg. Rosuvastatin reduced non-HDL-C (primary end point) and circulating remnant lipoprotein levels. Results are shown in the table below. Table 15.
