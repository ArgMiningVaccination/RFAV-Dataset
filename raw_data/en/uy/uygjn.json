The World Wide Web is overflowing with wackymedical devices, services, therapies and healers. Indeed, itis such a mecca for the weird and not-so-wonderful thatDr. Stephen Barrett, a retired American psychiatrist andwell-known medical consumer advocate, has taken his fa-mous \"Quack Watch\" online ( www.quackwatch.com/ ). He explains that \"quackery\" developed from the word quacksalver, which describes someone who boasts abouthis salves. and \"one who talks pretentiouslywithout sound knowledge of the subject discussed.\" Whatever the definition, the Internet is Quack Cen- tral. And it seems that when people turn on theirmodems and \"click\" into the Web, they check their crit-ical thinking at the door. Here is a small \u2014 make that atiny, no, an infinitesimal \u2014 sample of what's out there. Personal Life Force Energy Discs www.ozelink.com/natures_energies/discs.htmHaving trouble with all those nasty electromagneticfields in the neighbourhood? The folks who operate thissite have just the thing: their personal Ch'i energy discs.These amazing Life Force devices \"cancel out the nega-tive effects [of EM fields] on living systems by producinga gentle energy harmonized for the human energy field.\"The sellers admit that their discs are not scientificallyproven but \"kinesiology tests have revealed their effec-tiveness in experiments where human subjects wereplaced in the presence of an electromagnetic field withand without the disc.\" That's enough evidence for me. Therapeutic touch www.therapeutic-touch.org/html/touch.htmlWho needs doctors, medicines or medical procedures?These folks have put perfect health at your fingertips \u2014literally. According to this site, \"therapeutic touch is anintentionally directed process of energy exchange duringwhich the practitioner uses the hands as a focus to facili-tate the healing process.\" Unlike the Life Force Discs(see above) this is a \"scientifically based practice.\" This isbecause the \"human body, mind, emotions and intuition form a complex, dynamic energy field.\" Disease happenswhen this field is out of balance, so the TT practitionersimply needs to massage it back into place. For some ob-scure reason, sceptics have kept the practice out of themedical curriculum. Maharishi Ayur-Ved products www.mapi.com/index.htmAt this site you can choose from a num-ber of herbs, roots and programs thatnot only promise \"a vibrant body, apeaceful mind, a heart filled with joy,and long life,\" but also total enlighten- ment. \"Once thought of as unattainable, enlightenmentis now within your grasp. Maharishi Ayur-Ved brings youto the place where T otal Health resides within you, creat-ing the ultimate healing experience.\" Museum of Questionable Medical Devices www.mtn.org/quack/index.htmLearn all about the MacGregor Rejuvenator, the Psyco-graph and the Chiropractic T oftness Radiation Detector.This is a collection of the weirdest and wackiest medicaldevices ever invented \u2014 and used. This museum exists toeducate consumers about medical-device fraud and topromote healthy scepticism. Located in Minneapolis, themuseum's artifacts are available for viewing online. Preventing heart problems with Kirlian photography and gem therapywww.bicserve.com/htm/jmshah.htmAs this site points out, all living organisms have 2 bodies.\"One is visible physical body [sic] and other is invisibleenergy body [sic].\" This second body, called the aura, iswhere disease first enters. Using Kirlian photography, thepractitioner detects disease onset 6 to 8 months beforesymptoms appear. Even better, these folks can use rubiesto cure heart disease. \"Ruby is a hot Gem. It opens theheart. It has to be energised, and its negativity has to beremoved. It is then put on energy blocks of left hand sec-ond finger and of left palm and fixed with an adhesivetape for several hours for 6 to 7 days.\" Mine's in the mail. TOTALLY WACKY WEB SITES oreilly @ internet medicine show Docket:1-5525 Initial: JN Customer: CMAJ Dec 15/98Advanced longevity medicine the aging process www.chelationtherapy.com/Dr. Herb Pardell (DO, FAAOI) of the Natural HealthInstitute in Aventura, Fla., offers chelation therapy as a\"non-toxic treatment for hardening of the arteries.\"QuackWatch Director Barrett says chelation therapy isa series of intravenous infusions involving various sub-stances. Proponents claim it is effective against athero-sclerosis and many other serious health problems, butthere is no scientific evidence to support this. Sports event conception blocker www.babycenter.com/conflicts/The nice folks at The Baby Center have a tool to makesure a trivial incident like childbirth doesn't interferewith major sporting events. Select the event, from theNew York City Marathon to the Grey Cup and SuperBowl, and the blocker will tell you \"when not to makebabies.\" If you've already gone ahead and done the deed, you can find out what you're going to miss usingthe birth and labour conflict catcher. 21 days toward detoxification www.picsmallbiz.com/detox2.htmAccording to the good people at the Botanic Gardens ofHammond, Ind., \"by age 30 most of us have collected somuch 'debris' in our intestinal tract (diverticula, etc.) andcolon that fermentation and putrefaction has begun totake place. The result is a constant release of toxins, in-cluding noxious gases, into our bloodstream and lym-phatic system, which can result in poisoning our bod-ies!!\" By sheer coincidence, they have just the product tofix the problem: ELIMITOX 21.
