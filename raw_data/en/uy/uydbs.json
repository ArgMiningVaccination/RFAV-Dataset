In the last decade, EOs have also been applied to contrast the biodeterioration of cultural heritage, representing a powerful resource in green conservation strategies. In this study, an integrated approach based on microscopic observation, in vitro culture, and molecular investigation was preliminarily employed to identify biological systems colonizing wooden artworks. In order to contrast the biodeterioration processes induced by fungal colonization (Aspergillus flavus) or insect infestation (Anobium punctatum), wooden artworks were exposed to the volatile compound of Origanum vulgare or Thymus vulgaris essential oils (EOs), the chemical composition of which was determined by GC-MS using both polar and apolar columns. Artwork exposure was performed in ad-hoc-assembled \"clean chambers.\" Evaluating the effects on biological systems, the compatibility with artwork constitutive materials, and the lack of negative effects on human health and environmental pollution, the use of EOs as a valid alternative to traditional biocides must be considered.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-02-07", "cleaned_text": "Essential Oils as Natural Biocides in Conservation of Cultural Heritage [https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25030730](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25030730) [Recent Advances in and Fragrances]( /journal/molecules/topical_collections/flavors_fragrances )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-molecules-25-00730), [2](#B2-molecules-25-00730)]. In order to inhibit or eradicate biological colonization, several chemical procedures\u2014sometimes in combination with physical methods\u2014are usually utilized. Common active components include benzalkonium chloride, permethrin, sodium fluoride, or other molecules applied for the disinfection of fungi and insects. These chemical compounds are generally toxic and not degradable, being persistent in the environment and causing uncontrollable contamination in areas far from the site of application [ [3](#B3-molecules-25-00730), [4](#B4-molecules-25-00730)]. [5](#B5-molecules-25-00730)], natural molecules such as plant essential oils (EOs) are applied for several purposes to contrast biological colonization [ [6](#B6-molecules-25-00730), [7](#B7-molecules-25-00730), [8](#B8-molecules-25-00730)], acting through different pathways such as the regulation of intermediary metabolism, activation or blocking of enzymatic reactions, direct effects on enzyme synthesis, or alteration of membrane structures [ [9](#B9-molecules-25-00730), [10](#B10-molecules-25-00730)]. The EOs derived from different vegetable matrices contain several secondary metabolites able to inhibit the growth of bacteria, yeasts, and molds. They act directly on the microbial cell by inhibiting its growth, inducing the deterioration of the cytoplasmic membrane, regulating intermediary metabolism, activating or inhibiting enzymatic reactions, or affecting the repellent of Anobium punctatum insects that had infested the heads of wooden Sicilian puppets ( [Figure 2](#molecules-25-00730-f002)); both artifacts are from the 18th century. 2. Results [19](#B19-molecules-25-00730), [20](#B20-molecules-25-00730)], a diffused Aspergillus flavus colonization was identified on the base of a wooden sculpture (BWS), as shown in [Figure 1](#molecules-25-00730-f001), while A. punctatum (Anobiidae family) infestation was revealed in wooden puppet heads (WPHs), as seen in [Figure 2](#molecules-25-00730-f002). The infestation represents a grave risk to the conservation of wooden artifacts, since those insects can digest cellulose substrates and several generations can re-infest the same wooden structure. [21](#B21-molecules-25-00730)]. As shown in [Figure 3](#molecules-25-00730-f003), the growth-inhibition-halo diameters underline the good antimicrobial activity of both EOs, as shown in [Figure EOs on A. punctatum, infesting four WPHs, was also evaluated. 6](#molecules-25-00730-f006)), grew for EO exposed samples. [Table 2](#molecules-25-00730-t002)according to their retention indices on an HP 5MS column. [23](#B23-molecules-25-00730)], several chemotypes of thyme, based on essential oil compositions, have been established, including (1) linalool, (2) borneol, (3) geraniol, (4) sabinene hydrate, (5) thymol, as well as a number of multiple-component chemotypes. It has been reported [ [24](#B24-molecules-25-00730), [25](#B25-molecules-25-00730)] that the majority of commercial T. vulgaris essential oils are derived from thymol chemotypes, but according to our analysis, we suggest that the oil used in the present work belongs to the carvacrol chemotype. [26](#B26-molecules-25-00730)]. As reported in [Table 1](#molecules-25-00730-t001), quite rich in thymol (27.18%) and p-cymene (11.29%), clearly showing its belonging to the cymyl chemotypes. 3. Discussion [2](#B2-molecules-25-00730), [27](#B27-molecules-25-00730)]. In routine practice, pest colonization is countered by chemical pesticides, the toxicity and persistence of which are well known, and several factors such as toxicity to humans, risks of environmental pollution, and compatibility with substrates need to be discussed. Many biocides are difficult to degrade and are persistent in the environment, also causing contamination of the areas that are far from the site of treatment communis against bacteria isolated from indoor air in the document repositories of the National Archives of Cuba has been determined [ [36](#B36-molecules-25-00730)]. Considerable interest in the Origanum vulgare EO has been established in agricultural, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries [ [37](#B37-molecules-25-00730)]. The antifungal activity Lavandula angustifolia (Lamiaceae) such and Penicillium sp., isolated from stone and wooden objects, respectively [ [31](#B31-molecules-25-00730)]. The results allow us to hypothesize new applicative protocols for the protection of cultural heritage, based on EOs directly applied to biofilm [ [38](#B38-molecules-25-00730)] or as volatile compounds presented here. In this case, it should also be investigated if the exposure occurs in low-oxygen-concentration microenvironments that probably contribute to the biocidal effect of EOs [ [39](#B39-molecules-25-00730)]. The antifungal activity of Origanum vulgare and Thymus vulgaris has been evaluated by Lavin and colleagues against Scopulariopsis sp. and Fusarium sp., isolated from paper documents [ [40](#B40-molecules-25-00730)]. Particularly, the good antimicrobial activity of the Thymus EO against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis (comparable to chloramphenicol and ketoconazole), as well as against Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus niger (frequently infesting archives, libraries, and historical art craft objects), has been demonstrated [ [18](#B18-molecules-25-00730)]. Furthermore, plant essential oils can be applied in the prevention of fungal infections, demonstrating an antifungal activity greater than some commercial fungicides, which due to their selective action and safety can be applied in sustainable conservation protocols [ [41](#B41-molecules-25-00730), [42](#B42-molecules-25-00730)]. 4. Conclusions 5. Materials and Methods 5.1. Essential Oils (EOs) [Table 2](#molecules-25-00730-t002). 5.2. Essential Oil Isolation and Chemical Characterization [43](#B43-molecules-25-00730)]. The other GC analysis was performed in a Shimadzu QP 2010 plus (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) single-quadrupole GC-MS system, fitted with a Supelcowax 10 capillary column (30 m \u00d7 0.25 transfer line temperature 280 \u00b0C. Helium was the carrier gas (1 mL min1). For both columns, the temperature was initially kept at 40 \u00b0C for 5 min, then gradually increased to 250 \u00b0C at a rate of 2 \u00b0C min1, held for 15 min, and finally raised to 270 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C min1. One microliter of diluted samples (1/100 v/v, in n-pentane) was injected at 250 \u00b0C automatically and in the spitless mode; transfer line temperature 295 \u00b0C. 5.3. Identification of Compounds [43](#B43-molecules-25-00730)] databases. These identifications were confirmed by linear retention indices (LRIs) with those available in the literature on the SciFinder database. Some of the compounds were also confirmed by the comparison of mass spectra and retention times with standard compounds available in the laboratory. The retention indices were determined in relation to a homologous series of n-alkanes (C8-C30) injected under the same operating conditions. Component relative (%) amounts were calculated based on GC peak areas without using correction factors. 5.4. Pests 5.4.1. Fungal Colonization [Figure 1](#molecules-25-00730-f001)C), and molecular investigation [ [20](#B20-molecules-25-00730)], allowing the characterization of Aspergillus flavus colonies spread on the BWS surface. The molecular investigation was performed by analyzing the genomic DNA target sequences. Preliminarily, the isolated fungal colonies underwent five freezing (80 \u00b0C) and thawing (+55 \u00b0C) cycles, in the presence of a 500 L-1X TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0/1 mM EDTA). Genomic DNA was extracted by QI Amp DNA stool Kit (Qiagen), (modified by adding 5 mg/mL of Proteinase K (Invitrogen) and incubating at 65 \u00b0C for 4 h). The DNA was the template molecule in PCR reactions, utilizing the universal internal transcribed spacer primers, ITS1 (forward) and ITS4 (reverse), specific for fungi genomes. The amplification products (about 750 bp in length) were previously analyzed on 2.0% agarose gel (1X TBE, Tris-HCl/Borate/EDTA), staining USA). Aliquots of 50 ng were sequenced by Eurofins-Operon service and the similarity evaluated through the Blast platform referred to genomic databases (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) [ [44](#B44-molecules-25-00730), [45](#B45-molecules-25-00730)]. [38](#B38-molecules-25-00730)]. In each well of a 96-well microtiter, 30 L of the EO solutions (12.5%, 25%, 50%, and 100%) were added to a 30 L liquid nutritive medium and an equal volume of microbial suspension. Benzalkonium chloride (0.2%, v/v) was utilized as Commercial reference Biocide. Microbial growth after 18 h of incubation at 30 \u00b0C was evaluated by estimating the optical density at 500-600 nm. The MIC value was measured as the lowest concentration corresponding to any visible microbial growth, after incubation at 30 \u00b0C. The MFC was determined as the lowest concentration of EO able to kill 99.5% of the original inoculum, evaluating antimicrobial-free Evaluation Antimicrobial Activity [Figure 3](#molecules-25-00730-f003), the test of growth inhibition of the A. flavus colonies was performed by T. vulgaris (A), 70% ethanol (B), and 12.5% solutions of two commercial biocides (benzalkonium chloride and Nipagin) (C); each test was [Table 1](#molecules-25-00730-t001)and sensitivity or resistance to EO antimicrobial activity was determined in relationship to the halo diameter (6 mm = sensible; <6 mm = resistant). 5.6. EO Volatile Compounds Exposition 4](#molecules-25-00730-f004),5. [Figure 4](#molecules-25-00730-f004)). An Oregon Scientific datalogger (model JB913R) equipped with a microprobe was utilized to track In/Out-Min/Max Temp. and R.H. values. [Figure 5](#molecules-25-00730-f005)). A Wee-Neckarsulm Temperature/Humidity Station (model HG00073A) equipped with a wireless device was utilized to monitor the thermo-hygrometric conditions.
