Dr. Ellen Gong and the entire staff are incredibly skilled at what they do and truly care about their patients. Before seeing Ellen, at age 32, I had seen countless specialists, with $60,000+ for no answers to ongoing chronic health issues. Ellen is THE only one who has had successful solutions to provide relief and healing. She genuinely cares about me like family and has made it possible to happily live my life again. In addition to acupuncture and natural medicine, she generously includes life coaching, aiding me in making the healthiest lifestyle changes. I wish I had found Ellen 20 years ago! I have been treated by the other doctors who are also amazing. With my whole heart, I recommend everyone to go to Eastern Balance. I promise you will find healing here.\" - Woodbury Roland \"Since I have started accupuncture treatments with Dr. Ellen Gong my health has improved dramatically. But not just my physical health. Acupuncture and Chinese medicine deals with the improvement of healing in the mind, body and spirit because they are all tied together thereby improving your overall health, wellness and well being. Not only does she promote this but cares about each and every patient and teaches us how to accomplish this. Nothing against Western medicine but these methods have been time tested, proven and effective for thousands of years. I highly recommend the clinic and you will not be disappointed!\" - Ralph Meyers \"Dr. Gong really cares about her patients. I came to her for fertility issues. We had several miscarriages with no successful pregnancies. I am now 20 weeks pregnant due to her care and treatment. I became pregnant right at the beginning of COVID and Dr. Gong went out of her way to make sure that I stayed safe and healthy. Even when many businesses were closing, she kept our appointments because she knew it was a very critical time in my pregnancy. She provided personalized care that you would never receive from a typical Western doctor. I really can't say enough about how much she has helped me through this process. If you are considering getting IVF, I strongly suggest trying Eastern Balance first. It takes time and you'll need patience, but it does work.\" -Linsi B \"Eastern Balance is phenomenal they addressed all of my immediate pain i have had and helped me increase my work life balance I have improved tremendously with better sleep, mobility, and increased energy levels. They are very friendly and attentive to my needs Ellen & Kate are great and make you feel very comfortable!!!\" -Joe Torres What Is Acupuncture? The human body is believed to have meridiansinvisible energy channels running throughout the body. Along these channels are more than [1,000 acupressure points](https://www.verywellhealth.com/acupuncture-health-uses-88407) that can be stimulated to balance the body's energy levels. Qi, pronounced \"chee,\" is the life energy that courses through the body. When qi becomes unbalanced, disease and pain invade the body. Acupuncture inserts small, thin needles at various points along the body's meridians, gently manipulating them with heat or electrical pulses to balance the energy within. Depending on the severity of your pain or chronic condition, you may require several sessions before feeling the results. Each session typically lasts less than an hour and involves gently inserting hair-thin needles into your side, front, or backdepending on your specific needs. There is minimal discomfort associated with this procedure, even when heat and mild electrical pulses are used to bring your qi back into balance. A small number of people report a mild ache at the point of insertion, but because the needles are so small, most people do not feel them at all. What Benefits Can You Get in Our Houston Acupuncture Clinic? In addition to balancing your life energy, acupuncture has been proven to help numerous health conditions. Scientists believe that the needles used during these treatments stimulate the nervous system in addition to balancing energy, leading to numerous acupuncture benefits. While there are still many ongoing studies to determine how acupuncture can benefit various diseases, the treatment has been proven to [relieve pain and symptoms from the following chronic conditions](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/156488.php): - Morning sickness - Headaches and migraines - Lower back pain - Nausea and vomiting that is caused by chemotherapy - Sciatica - Neck pain - Menstrual cramps - Knee pain - Osteoarthritis What Are The Risks? Acupuncture creates very few risks. When performed by a licensed practitioner using single-use, sterilized needles, acupuncture is a safe and effective procedure. The [most significant risks lie with people who fall into the following categories](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/acupuncture/about/pac-20392763): - Pregnant women: Acupuncture has been proven to induce labor, which could result in a pre-term delivery for women who are not full term. Please look for a licensed acupuncturist to have the treatment done while you are pregnant. Acupuncture can help with the success of IVF, morning sickness, pregnancy related swollen legs, itchy skin. - People with blood disorders: The insertion of the needles usually does not cause excess bleeding, but people who have blood disorders may experience a little blood loss, bruising, and discomfort. - People with pacemakers: Because acupuncture often uses electrical impulses delivered through the needles to stimulate problem areas, the electric stimulation-acupuncture treatment is not recommended for people who use pacemakers. The electrical currents could damage the internal devices and cause them to stop functioning properly. Regular acupuncture treatments without e-stimulates would be recommended for patients who have pacemakers.
