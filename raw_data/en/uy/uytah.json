(The recipe is featured below, followed by details about the ZooRun.) A daily routine that includes fruits, vegetables and regular exercise can put you on the path to longevity, according to [a study from the University of Michigan](http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/20422-exercise-and-healthy-eating-make-a-difference-even-later-in-life) and John Hopkins University. The study tracked women, age 70 and older, and found those who exercised and ate plenty of fruits and vegetables lived longer than peers with a lifestyle that did not include fitness and a healthy diet. \"This is the first study to show that the combination of a healthy diet and greater physical activity predict greater survival and that the combination of both positive factors confers lower mortality risk than either factor alone,\" according to Emily Nicklett, a University of Michigan researcher. Fitness and nutrition were front and center when Chef Edy created a platter of fruit sushi treats. The Baptist Health News Team joined him in the kitchen. Watch now. Fruit Sushi With Mango Sauce Ingredients: - 8-ince plain crepe. - 1 medium-ripe banana. - 1 teaspoon honey. - 1 medium strawberry, sliced thin. - 4-5 blueberries. - 2 tablespoons puffed rice cereal, placed in a small dish. - 2 tablespoons Greek non-fat plain yogurt, placed in a small dish. - 1/2 ounce pureed fresh or frozen mango for dipping, placed in a small dipping dish. Directions: 1. Place crepe golden side down. On the outer edge of the crepe, furthest side away from you, spread the honey from one end to the other. 2. On the edge of the crepe closest to you, place the strawberries slices approximately 1 inch from edge to form a straight line, from one end to the next. Then remove the banana from peel, and place the banana on top of the line of strawberry slices. 3. Grab the edge of the crepe that is closest to you and roll it over the banana firmly. Keep rolling until the entire crepe is rolled into a log. 4. With a sharp knife, slice the roll into even 1-inch pieces, which will yield approximately 4-5 pieces. 5. Dip each piece into the Greek yogurt, and then dip into puffed rice cereal. Repeat this process for every piece. 6. Garnish with a blueberry and serve with pureed mango. Ready to Run Wild?
