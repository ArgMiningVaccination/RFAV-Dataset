When cells are chemically damaged, they stimulate the pain cycle. Laser excites the kinetic energy within cells by transmitting healing stimuli known as photons. The skin absorbs these photons via a photo-chemical effect, not photo-thermal; therefore, it does not cause heat damage to the tissues. Once photons reach the cells of the body, they promote a cascade of cellular activities. Laser therapy light can ignite the production of enzymes, stimulate mitochondria, increase vasodilation, increase lymphatic drainage, increase ATP synthesis (energy), and elevate collagen formation substances to prevent the formation of scar tissues. These cellular activities are a critical step in reducing long-term disabling chronic myofascial pain syndromes. Other formative cells are also positively influenced, including the immune system. Immune activities are enhanced by increasing the number of macrophages. Simply stated, cold laser enables patients to get out of pain faster and heal at the same time. Our office offers three of the most advanced cold laser therapies used in the industry. Erchonia's lasers made history by becoming the first to receive FDA market clearance for the treatment of chronic pain and increasing range of motion, proven through two double blind IRB (Independent Review Board) studies. The Erchonia Lasers are the most advanced on the market, with their sleek revolutionary design, patented line generated beam, and the ability to program independent frequencies in all their lasers. It is extremely beneficial for enhancing and accelerating wound healing and reducing acute inflammation. The cold laser has been called \"The Therapy\" of the 21st century. With over 200 clinical studies many of which are double-blind, placebo-controlled, and more than 2000 published articles on LLLT (low-level laser therapy), this innovative technology has a well-documented research and application history. LLLT is now being considered a therapy of choice for difficult pain management challenges such as fibromyalgia and myofascial pain. This versatile tool is safe, non-toxic, and easy to use. It has synergistic effects with chiropractic, rehabilitative, and nutritional therapies. It is both doctor and patient friendly. Laser Therapy has been FDA Cleared for use with all Musculoskeletal Conditions and Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI). It has also shown great benefits clinically with: When you combine Chiropractic, Rehabilitative Exercises, Nutrition, and Cold Laser Therapy you can tear down the walls of pain and suffering, beginning your journey towards healing. It does not matter if it is a new injury, or an old injury or condition, Cold Laser Therapy can help start or accelerate your healing process, and it can do it naturally without the use of drugs or surgery. Erchonia's Zerona Z6 is a full body fat loss treatment that allows clients to target areas of stubborn fat, and is the first laser specifically designed for body contouring. The Zerona Z6 is FDA Market-Cleared, non-invasive and clinically tested. Applied externally, the laser targets excess fat by emulsifying fatty tissue through the use of cold laser technology developed by Erchonia. It provides an alternative fat loss treatment without the adverse side effects associated with surgical and other weight loss procedures like liposuction, cryolipolysis and body wraps. What is Cold Laser? Laser is light amplification at specific wavelengths that has been scientifically proven to create healing properties in human cells. Like a plant cell uses sunlight for growth and health, human cells have been shown to respond to light in a comparable way. Are all lasers the same? No. There are heavily researched wavelengths and doses of laser light that have been shown to be the most therapeutic and safest. Research demonstrates that lasers in the range of 630 - 830 nM and doses levels ranging from 0.5 - 10 J/cm2 to be the ideal \"sweet spot\" for optimal health benefits. This is the reason the doctors at Timber Land Chiropractic only use lasers that meet these specific requirements. Are lasers safe? Yes. When used in the ranges mentioned above lasers are one of the safest devices currently used in healthcare. They are non-ionizing, non-thermal, non-invasive, non- toxic applications so you do not receive any harmful byproducts. When lasers get too powerful, they serve a different purpose such as surgical lasers. These are not \"cold lasers\". The only tissues that Class 2 lasers are contraindicated with are directly onto the retina. What can lasers help with? Research has shown lasers to be helpful in nearly every tissue of the human body including brain, muscle, bone, cartilage, and ligaments. They stimulate nerve function and growth, decrease pain, decrease inflammation, stimulate antioxidant pathways, promote wound healing, decrease scar tissue formation, increase blood flow, stimulate new blood flow, and speed up recovery time in almost every injury. Lasers have been shown to be safer and more effective than many drugs and surgeries. Does laser therapy hurt? No. Patients typically do not \"feel\" cold laser therapy, but some patients do say they feel a tingling sensation in the area the cold laser is applied. What are the differences between lasers and regular red- light sources? Although red light does range in the same wavelengths as cold laser, it is just scattered photons of energy that are not easily absorbed into the body. Red light therapies like infrared do have some therapeutic value on the surface (like burn healing) but do not have penetration and the cellular tissue effects like parallel, coherent waves from true laser diodes. Will I receive just laser therapy? Lasers can either be used as a stand-alone or used in conjunction with other modalities and therapies. Because of our vast scope of therapies and conditions we treat you will receive various treatments based on what your needs and exam findings show. If it is indicated that you only need laser therapy, it will be provided by itself. Many patients have heard about the many beneficial effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT, Cold Laser, Therapeutic laser) but are not familiar with what laser therapy is. "}
