Whether that be the ceremony for mediation, exploration, healing, a baby blessing, a wedding, a birthday, a passing or to mark any transitional point in life. I bubble with joy to celebrate the beauty and wonder of experience and to hold souls with tenderness and finesse. REIKI Group Healing Monthly Drop-in Stating in September in the Roundhouse I'm offering a monthly Reiki drop-in here in Lewes. This will be a place where you will come together with other Reiki practitioners and we will work on self healing on ourselves but together. Working in a group raises the vibration of the energy. I will hold the space and guide you through the practice so you can finely tune into the highest vibration for your highest good. This will be an energetically potent space and hold powerful transmission. In this container I would also like to leave space, after our treatment to have a sharing circle so we can talk about your individual experience, see if there are any collective messages for healing and ask any questions about Reiki and channelling energy for healing. This will be a very safe and energetic space for real healing and transformation. The first group Reiki Healing gathering will be on Sunday 30th July 7pm to 9pm in the Roundhouse. The exchange is \u00a328. The Roundhouse. 1 Hill Road. Lewes. BN7 1DB. It's a 2 hour offering of healing and sharing and learning. Please [book you spot](https://www.openandbalanced.com/contact) in advance. You are welcome with the experience you have wether that be as a Reiki One or Two or a Reiki Master. This is a sacred place to bath in the energies, to heal, to amplify and to meet yourself and others. This is also a great space if you haven't practiced for a while but you would like to reconnect with Reiki and its phenomenal power and the strength I feel really called to hold this at this time. I am open to creating a daytime holding if people are interested. Meditation and Ceremonial Cacao Friday's at 9.30am to 11am in my Roundhouse in Lewes I invite you to join me and the beautiful spirit of Cacao. We will come together in a sacred space, drink ceremonial Cacao and through meditation work with the transformative plant medicine. I have been working with Cacao daily for few years and her heart opening healing is something I hold with great reverence and the utmost respect. Together we will sip the powerful nectar that is ethically sourced Peruvian Ashaninka Cacao. We will be working with the finest Ceremonial Grade Criollo Cacao which has been grown, harvested, fermented and dried by Ashaninka families. Directly sourced from ancient Cacao gardens in the Rio Ene region of Peru. Cacao has quite a bitter taste but I sweeten it slightly with a natural agave syrup. I think it's the most delicious chocolate treat! We will call in her spirit and I will lead you through a gentle guided meditation, using crystal sound bowls and Sun Gong to accompany your journey. We will be softly working towards dropping deeply into the heart space and open ourselves to a deeper listening and receiving. I will hold an energetically charged space that will be wrapped in Reiki love and protection. You may want to bring a notebook and pen, and please bring a willingness to sit with others and be. When; Friday morning from Friday 8th September to the 20th October 2023 At 9.30am to 11am. There will be two Ceremonies during August; 11th and the 25th August at 9.30am -11am Exchange \u00a318 We will then return to weekly Cacao Love on Friday September 8th-20th October Exchange; \u00a3105 for 7 conservative ceremonies or \u00a318 drop in. The Roundhouse, 1 Hill Road, Lewes. BN7 1DB. Who; This is open to anyone who feels called. You don't have to have worked with Cacao before, or even meditation. You are welcome to join without drinking Cacao. You can still work with her beautiful earth energy for love and insight. Please book and pay for your spot in advance. Thank you. Each Ceremony is stand alone but like anything the more we practise, connect and commit the greater the reward. I really look forward to welcoming you. It's going to be blissful.
