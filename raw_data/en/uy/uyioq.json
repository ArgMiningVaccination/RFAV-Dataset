It is a term that embodies women's power and recognizes the pivotal role and hard-earned wisdom that Indigenous women and elders exercise within their families and communities. Women hold communities together through the renewed relationships with the human and spiritual world to create a space of connectedness to grow and heal. Adapted from Brenda. J Child - Holding Our World Together: Ojibwe Women and Survival of Community (2012) I am honoured to have witnessed the determination of the Indigenous community and our hardworking dedicated staff who worked two jobs to support the Mindimooyenh clinic week after week. Their commitment to saving lives while bringing the comfort of our culture to the community during this difficult, stressful time was outstanding. Against the backdrop of a colonial system determined to dictate their wants and needs we stood our ground on the frontline providing solutions by Indigenous people for Indigenous people. We have so much to be proud of in the crucial work achieved behind the countless masks, PPE and important safety guidelines. Cora McGuire-Cyrette, Executive Director (ONWA) My daughter is thrilled to have received her first vaccine and I don't think that I could have asked for a more kind and pleasant experience than what we received. It might sound weird to say that we're looking forward to coming to get our second doses but I'm pretty sure we'll be happily heading there in a few weeks to see all the faces that I know were smiling behind those masks.
