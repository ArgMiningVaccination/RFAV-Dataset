Shingles is the common name of Herpes zoster, is an outbreak of a painful, itchy rash or blisters on the skin that is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox, the Varicella-zoster virus. Shingles duration is most often between 3 to 5 weeks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1 out of every 3 people in the United States, will develop shingles. People most at risk for developing shingles include those: With a weakened immune system Older than 50 years of age Under excessive stress Have experienced major trauma Recovered from recent sickness Shingles can affect any portion of the body, including the eyes. However, it most commonly often presents as a band of blisters on one side of body, torso, neck or face. Be sure to keep the rash and blisters clean and dry, not to touch them especially, avoid popping or picking at them, keeping them covered as much as possible. The fluid from open blisters is infectious. Shingles is generally treated by medical intervention. Vaccines are available to older people (age 60 years and over), that can help to prevent the condition, though not entirely effective. Eating a diet high in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants strengthens immune system enabling it to fight the shingles virus. Researchers have found that certain essential oils with antiviral, pain-relieving properties and can boost immune system, can help to alleviate pain and itchiness associated with shingles, though further studies are needed. Essential Oils are natural, volatile, concentrated extracts of different parts of plants and have been used since centuries to cure various ailments due to their different chemical (therapeutic) properties. The following essential oils may help: Peppermint, Capsaicin, Geranium, Thyme, Lemon, Oregano, Tea tree, Chamomile, Frankincense Acute Phase Spray Blend: 28 drops Lavender Essential Oil 12 drops Geranium Essential Oil 10 drops Chamomile Essential Oil 10 drops Frankincense Essential Oil 1oz (30 ml) Witch Hazel 1oz (30ml) Fractionated Coconut Oil or Rose Hip Oil In a 2oz glass spritzer bottle, add essential oils, pour Witch Hazel and Coconut Oil, cover, label, and mix well.
