Foreword The Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) is a framework approved by the World Health Assembly in May 2012 to achieve the Decade of Vaccines vision by delivering universal access to immunization. The mission outlined in the GVAP is straightforward: improve health by extending by 2020 and beyond the full benefits of immunization to all people, regardless of where they are born, who they are, or where they live. Overwhelming evidence demonstrates the benefits of immunization as one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions known. Over the past several decades, immunization has achieved many things, including the eradication of smallpox, an accomplishment that has been called one of humanity's greatest triumphs. Vaccines have saved countless lives, lowered the global incidence of polio by 99 percent and reduced illness, disability and death from diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, and epidemic meningococcal A meningitis. page 6 Global Vaccine Action Plan Foreword page 7 Further progress has been made in introducing vaccines against pneumococcal disease and rotavirus diarrhoea as well as vaccines which prevent chronic diseases such as liver and cervical cancer. We are facing a pivotal moment in history. Right now, the global health community has an unprecedented opportunity to coordinate with governments to develop and implement plans and strategies that will improve the lives of millions of people around the world through universal access to appropriate vaccines. Together, we can overcome the hurdles that remain in delivering vaccines to every corner of the planet. These powerful tools are already available to most, but not yet all, people. To extend immunization to everyone, the GVAP seeks to ensure adequate resources, develop supportive health systems and infrastructure, and work with countries to train health workers needed to reach remote and marginalized populations. The plan also articulates the need for a concerted effort to develop new and improved vaccines and technologies that will help maximize the benefits of immunization around the world for years to come. This ambitious action plan to reach all people with the vaccines they need is the product of the Decade of Vaccines Collaboration, an unprecedented effort that brought together development, health and immunization experts and stakeholders. The powerful idea that vaccines work and save lives must now be shared with a much broader audience, using such vehicles as World Immunization Week and others to promote universal vaccination and help focus on current challenges related to immunization. While dedicated health workers immunize people daily in all countries, World Immunization Week gives countries and organizations additional, focused opportunities to raise public awareness of how immunization saves lives\u2014during the same week, every year, in every country. When they endorsed the GVAP, health officials of 194 countries also declared that the completion of polio eradication is a programmatic emergency for global health, asking for sufficient funding to complete the initiative. Polio eradication is an early, major milestone in the implementation of the GVAP. Our aim is to build on past achievements and use our know-how and experience to save more lives. This plan, that builds on the WHO-UNICEF Global Immunization Vision and Strategy, and the GAVI Alliance Strategy, provides the guiding principles and strategic objectives that will enable immunization of more people against more diseases; introduce newly available life-saving vaccines and technologies; and coordinate immunization and other critical health interventions. The plan also suggests key targets for further research and development. The Decade of Vaccines Leadership Council, along with all partners\u2014governments and elected officials, health professionals, academia, manufacturers, global agencies, development partners, civil society, media and the private sector\u2014are committed to achieving the ambitious goals of the GVAP. Together we will track and measure progress through the GVAP and the UN Secretary General Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health Accountability Frameworks. Many more are expected to add their support in the future as the plan is translated and implemented at the country and regional levels. The success of this ambitious global plan will be one of the most enduring legacies for today's children and the generations who follow them.

Subsequently, the Executive Board at its 130th session in January 2012 considered the Global Vaccine Action Plan and provided guidance. 2 The Board also adopted resolution EB130.R12 on World Immunization Week.3 The final plan was endorsed at the 65th World Health Assembly in May 2012.2. 1 See WHO documents A64/14 and WHA64/2011/REC/2, summary records of the sixth meeting, section 2, the seventh meeting and the eighth meeting, section 2. 2 See WHO documents EB130/21 and EB130/2012/REC/2, summary record of the eleventh meeting. 3 See WHO document EB130/2012/REC/1 for the resolution, and for the financial and administrative implications for the Secretariat of the adoption of the resolution.page 10 Global Vaccine Action Plan Title of Section (TK) page 11 Introduction The Global Vaccine Action Plan builds on the success of the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy, 2006-2015, which was launched in 2005 as the first 10-year strategic framework to realize the potential of immunization. Developing the plan has brought together multiple stakeholders involved in immuni- zation, including governments and elected officials, health professionals, academia, manufacturers, global agencies, development partners, civil society, media and the private sector, to define collectively what the immunization community wants to achieve over the next decade. In total, the global consultation process reached over 1100 individuals representing more than 140 countries and 290 organizations, and included two special sessions to brief representatives of the Permanent Missions of the United Nations Offices and other Intergovernmental Organizations in Geneva and New York. Developing the plan brought together more than 1100 individuals in 140 countries, representing 290 distinct organizationsipage 12 Global Vaccine Action Plan Introduction page 13 Immunization is, and should be recognized as, a core component of the human right to health and an individual, community and governmental responsibility. Vaccination prevents an estimated 2.5 million deaths each year. Protected from the threat of vaccine-preventable diseases, immunized children have the opportunity to thrive and a better chance of realizing their full potential. These advantages are further increased by vaccination in adolescence and adulthood. As part of a comprehensive package of interventions for disease prevention and control, vaccines and immunization are an essential investment in a country's\u2014 indeed, in the world's\u2014future. Now is the time for showing commitment to achieving the full potential of immunization. The collective recognition of this opportunity has led the global health community to call for a Decade of Vaccines, in line with the requests made in resolution WHA61.15 on the global immunization strategy. The vision for the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020) is of a world in which all individuals and communities enjoy lives free from vaccine-preventable diseases. The mission of the Decade of Vaccines is to extend, by 2020 and beyond, the full benefit of immunization to all people, regardless of where they are born, who they are or where they live. The Global Vaccine Action Plan reiterates existing goals and sets new goals for the decade, proposes six strategic objectives and the actions that will support their achievement, and provides an initial estimate of resource requirements and return on investment. Annex 1 summarizes recommended indicators to monitor and evaluate progress. Beyond the action plan, country, regional and global stakeholders need to take responsibility for specific actions, translate the action plan into detailed operational plans (updating both the action plan and the operational plans as new information becomes available), complete the development of an accountability framework for the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020) and mobilize resources to ensure that the vision for the Decade of Vaccines becomes a reality. Accomplishing this will require global and national institutions to innovate and to change the way they work. Annex 2 provides a summary of stakeholder responsibilities.The last century was, in many respects, the century of treatment, resulting in dramatic reductions in morbidity and mortality, with the discovery and use of antibiotics as one of the biggest agents of change in health. This century promises to be the century of vaccines, with the potential to eradicate, eliminate or control a number of serious, life-threatening or debilitating infectious diseases, and with immunization at the core of preventive strategies. Ensuring that the vision for the Decade of Vaccines becomes a reality is a powerful step in that direction. This century promises to be the century of vaccines the v ision for the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020) is of a world in which all individuals and communities enjoy lives free from vaccine-preventable diseases. page 14 Global Vaccine Action Plan Title of Section (TK) page 15 The Immunization Landscape Today Important progress in the last decade In the last 10 years, great advances have been made in developing and introducing new vaccines and expanding the reach of immunization programmes. More people than ever before are being vaccinated and access and use of vaccines by age groups other than infants is expanding. As a result of immunization combined with other health care and development interventions\u2014including improved access to clean water and sanitation, better hygiene and education\u2014 the annual number of deaths among children under five years of age fell from an estimated 9.6 million in 2000 to 7 .6 million in 2010, despite an increase in the number of children born each year. The annual number of deaths among children under five years of age fell an estimated 2 million from 2000 to 2010ipage 16 Global Vaccine Action Plan The Immunization Landscape Today page 17 Immunization has helped drive this reduction in child mortality: coverage of vaccines that have been in use since the inception of the Expanded Programme on Immunization has expanded, and new vaccines have been introduced. Vaccines against hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b have become part of national immunization schedules in 179 and 173 countries, respectively; poliomyelitis is nearing eradication; and a large number of deaths from measles are being averted every year. The number of deaths caused by traditional vaccine-preventable diseases (diphtheria, measles, neonatal tetanus, pertussis and poliomyelitis) has fallen from an estimated 0.9 million in 2000 to 0.4 million in 2010. 4 New and increasingly sophisticated vaccines that have become available in the last decade, including pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and vaccines against infection with rotavirus and human papillomavirus, are currently being rolled out globally. Efforts are being made to shorten the time lag that has historically existed in the introduction of new vaccines between high- and low-income countries. For example, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were introduced in low-income countries approximately a year after being introduced in high- income countries. Through an innovative international collaboration, an affordable conjugate vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A was developed and is now in use in the African meningitis belt. There are now licensed vaccines being used to prevent, or contribute to the prevention and control of, 25 vaccine-preventable infections (Table 1 ). The strengthening by countries of national programmes, aided by improved support from and coordination among local, national, regional and international stakeholders, has succeeded in improving immunization coverage rates. Financing from domestic budgets allocated to immunization programmes has risen over the past decade, as has the flow of international resources dedicated to immunization. According to the immunization programme data for 2010, 5 154 of the 193 Member States report having a specific budget line item for immunization, and 147 have developed multi-year national plans to sustain the gains achieved, further enhance performance to reach desired goals and introduce appropriate new vaccines.Efforts are being made to shorten the time lag that has historically existed in the introduction of new vaccines between high- and low- income countries 4 Sources for estimates: measles and neonatal tetanus, in World Health Statistics 2012, Geneva, World Health Organization, 2012; diphtheria and poliomyelitis, for 2000: http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional_ 2000_v3/en/index.html (accessed 5 April 2012), for 2008: http://apps.who.int/ghodata/ (accessed 5 April 2012); pertussis, WHO Secretariat provisional data. 5 http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/data/en/ (accessed 13 April 2012).tabLe 1: tabLe 1: v aCCine- PreventabL e infeCtious agents diseases japanese zoster (shingles)5 Meningococcal diseaseanthrax influenza Pertussis rabies yellow fever4 Cholera human papilloma-virusMeasles diphtheria tuberculosis Poliomyelitis page 18 Global Vaccine Action Plan The Immunization Landscape Today page 19 Significant unmet needs remain Despite this progress, vaccine-preventable diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Adoption of new vaccines by low- and middle-income countries (where disease burdens are often the highest) has been slower than in high-income countries. In 2010, for example, only 13% of the total high- income country birth cohort lived in countries that did not have pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in their immunization schedules. Of the total low-income country birth cohort, 98% lived in countries that did not have pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in their schedules. Coverage gaps persist between countries, as well as within countries. The average coverage with three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing vaccine and with measles-containing vaccine in low-income countries was 16% and 15% below that of high-income countries in 2010, respectively. However, this represents a positive trend in comparison with the coverage gap of 30% for both vaccines in the year 2000. In some countries, coverage of measles-containing vaccine in rural areas is 33% lower than in urban areas. Similarly, the measles vaccine coverage rate for the richest fifth of the population in some countries is up to 58% higher than for the poorest fifth. Coverage can also be very low in settlements of the urban poor, especially in cities with transitory migrant populations, and in indigenous communities. Geographical distance from health centres is not the only determinant of low coverage; inequities are also associated with other socioeconomic determinants, such as income levels and the educational status of the mother. A special geographic focus is needed on lower-middle-income countries with large populations, where the majority of the unvaccinated live. Reaching underserved populations will be especially challenging, but inequities need to be tackled because these populations often carry a heavier disease burden and may lack access to medical care and basic services, with the fragile economies of individuals and their families suffering a severe disease-related impact as a consequence.Reaching underserved populations will be especially challenging, but inequities need to be tackled because these populations often carry a heavier disease burden Global and regional immunization initiatives have supported countries in building up their systems and introducing new vaccines. Global goals and milestones established through the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy 2006-2015, the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the United Nations World Summit for Children, the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children, and, more recently, the United Nations Secretary-General's Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health have stimulated expansion of national immunization programmes. In low- and middle-income countries these have been supported by initiatives such as the GAVI Alliance, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, the Measles Initiative, the vaccine procurement services of UNICEF, and PAHO's Revolving Fund for Vaccine Procurement. 16% lower DTP3 coverage in low-income countries than in high-income countries in 2010 page 20 Global Vaccine Action Plan The Immunization Landscape Today page 21 New opportunities and challenges for the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020) Individuals and communities, governments and health professionals have primary responsibility for exploiting the opportunities and confronting the challenges that this decade will bring. New and improved vaccines are expected to become available, based on a robust pipeline that includes several vaccines for diseases that are not currently preventable through vaccination. The introduction of new vaccines targeted against several important causes of major killer diseases, such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and cervical cancer can be used as a catalyst to scale up complementary interventions. In addition to reducing mortality, these new vaccines will prevent morbidity with resulting economic returns even in countries that have already succeeded in improving mortality rates. Innovations in existing vaccines will bring additional benefits, such as greater effectiveness, thermostability, easier administration and lower cost. At the same time, the development of vaccines and other immunization innovations is facing increasingly complex manufacturing and regulatory processes, as well as rising research, development and production costs. As new vaccines (for example, against dengue and malaria) become available and underutilized vaccines (for example, those against cholera, human papillomavirus, rabies, rotavirus, rubella and typhoid) are administered more widely, supply and logistics systems\u2014already burdened\u2014will face an even greater need for innovations. Finally, the number of health workers, as well as their knowledge and skills, will need to be enhanced, better coordinated and better supervised. While the challenges are many, the introduction of new vaccines also represents an opportunity to strengthen immunization systems and to act as a catalyst to implement many of the required reforms. As national immunization investments increase, so must government oversight and accountability.Immunization funding needs in the areas of research and development, procurement and delivery are expected to more than double in the coming decade. New and more complex vaccines will bring new funding requirements and countries will be confronted with difficult decisions in dealing with competing health priorities. Resources will need to be allocated more efficiently, with the relevant decisions guided by national priorities, capacity, clear information on the costs and benefits of choices, and improved financial management. Expenditures must be linked to outputs and impacts, showing a clear investment case for immunization. As the economies of many low- and middle-income countries continue to grow, so will their potential to fund immunization. Countries that have relied on development assistance will be able to fund an increasing proportion of their immunization programmes, and may even, eventually, be able to fully sustain them. Some will be able to extend new financial and technical support to global immunization projects. At the same time, vaccine manufacturers in some of these countries will be expected to make an even more significant contribution to the supply of high-quality, affordable vaccines, spreading the sources of production more widely and increasing competition. The growing availability of information and penetration of mobile telephone and social networks can boost public demand for immunization, and ensure that people are made aware of both the benefits derived from vaccines and their potential risks. The immunization community can take advantage of social networks and electronic media to more effectively allay fears, increase awareness and build trust. The lessons learnt from past decades, the unmet needs, and the opportunities and challenges that this decade presents have been carefully considered in the formulation of the guiding principles, measures of success and recommended actions articulated in the following sections. The number of health workers, as well as their knowledge and skills, will need to be enhanced As the economies of many low- and middle-income countries continue togrow, so will their potential to fund immunizationpage 22 Global Vaccine Action Plan Six Guiding Principles page 23 Six Guiding Principles Six principles have guided the elaboration of the Global Vaccine Action Plan. 1 3 5 2 4 6 Country oW nershiP countries have primary ownership and responsibility for establishing good governance and for providing effective and quality immunization services for all.shared resPonsibi Lity and P artnershiP immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases is an individual, community and governmental responsibility that transcends borders and sectors.equity equitable access to immunization is a core component of the right to health.integration strong immunization systems, as part of broader health systems and closely coordinated with other primary health care delivery programmes, are essential for achieving immunization goals.sustainabi Lity informed decisions and implementation strategies, appropriate levels of financial investment, and improved financial management and oversight are critical to ensuring the sustainability of immunization programmes.innovation the full potential of immunization can only be realized through learning, continuous improvement and innovation in research and development, as well as innovation and quality improvement across all aspects of immunization. These six fundamental principles can realistically and effectively guide the full spectrum of immunization activities throughout the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020). Although the Global Vaccine Action Plan will need to be translated into specific regional, country and community contexts, these guiding principles are universally applicable and relevant to each of the Decade of Vaccines' goals and strategic objectives described below. page 24 Global Vaccine Action Plan Title of Section (TK) page 25 Measures of Success The Decade of Vaccines is about taking action to achieve ambitious goals. Early in the decade, this means achieving already established elimination and eradication goals. It means dealing with the public health emergency constituted by wild poliovirus transmission in order to secure a world free of poliomyelitis. It also means assuring the global or regional elimination of measles, rubella and neonatal tetanus. 6 Completing this agenda has never been more critical. Success will encourage the achievement of additional ambitious goals. Failure will mean millions of preventable cases of disease and death will continue to occur.By 2020, coverage of target populations should reach at least 90% national vaccination coverage and at least 80% vaccination coverage in every district or equivalent administrative unit for all vaccines in national immunization programmes 6 By 2015, achieve maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination (defined as less than one case of neonatal tetanus per 1000 live births) in every district, measles elimination in at least four WHO regions and rubella elimination in at least two WHO regions. By 2020, achieve measles and rubella elimination in at least five WHO regions.ipage 26 Global Vaccine Action Plan Measures of Success page 27 Later in the decade, success will be recorded in terms of the expansion of immunization services to meet vaccination coverage targets in every region, country and community. In 2015, the coverage of target populations should reach the goal of the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy, 2006- 2015 of at least 90% national vaccination coverage and at least 80% vaccination coverage in every district or equivalent administrative unit (the marker for this being coverage for diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing vaccines). By 2020, coverage of target populations should reach these levels for all vaccines in national immunization programmes unless alternative targets exist. Vaccine introductions should also be monitored, with the goal of at least 80 low- or middle-income countries introducing one or more appropriate new or underutilized vaccines by 2015. These technical accomplishments will not be sustained unless countries take full ownership of their routine immunization programmes (see strategic objective 1 below). During this decade millions of additional deaths and cases of disease should become preventable as a result of the development, licensure and introduction of new and improved vaccines and technologies for high-burden diseases. Specifically, progress towards the licensure and launch of vaccines should be tracked against one or more major pathogens not currently vaccine preventable (such as, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, group A streptococcus, hepatitis C virus, hookworm, leishmania and respiratory syncytial virus) and at least one new platform delivery technology. Meet vaccination targets in every region, country, and community page 28 Global Vaccine Action Plan Goals of the Decade of Vaccines page 29 Goals of the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020) achieve a world free of poliomyelitisMeet global and regional elimination targets Meet vaccination coverage targets in every region, country and communitydevelop and introduce new and improved vaccines and technologies exceed the Millennium development goal 4 target for reducing child mortalityMdg4 If these immunization-specific goals are achieved, hundreds of millions of cases and millions of future deaths will be averted by the end of the decade, billions of dollars of productivity will be gained, and immunization will contribute to exceeding the Millennium Development Goal 4 target for reducing child mortality (and the target that succeeds it post-2015). 24-26 million future deaths could be averted For example, it is estimated that if the coverage targets for introduc- tion and/or sustained use of 10 vaccines alone (those against hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcus, rotavirus, rubella and yellow fever) in 94 countries during the decade are met, between 24 and 26 million future deaths could be averted compared with a hypothetical scenario under which these vaccines have zero coverage (see also Annex 4). page 30 Global Vaccine Action Plan Six Strategic Objectives page 31 Six Strategic Objectives Continuous progress towards the following Six Strategic Objectives will enable the achievement of the goals of the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020). aLL C ountries C oMMit to iMMunization as a Priority.

An accountability framework is needed that defines the methodology and source of data for these indicators, identifies which stakeholders will be responsible for what actions, and articulates the process and responsibilities for monitoring and evaluating progress over the course of the Decade. The Global Vaccine Action Plan lays the groundwork for each of these elements. Further development and implementation of the accountability framework at country, regional and global levels could take place over the course of 2012 by leveraging the findings of the Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health and aligning work, wherever possible, with other accountability efforts and initiatives by all stakeholders at the country level to deliver and monitor progress.page 34 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 1 page 35 All countries commit to immunization as a priority. Committing to immunization as a priority first and foremost means recognizing the importance of immunization as a critical public health intervention and the value that immunization represents in terms of health and economic returns. Countries demonstrate a commitment to immunization by setting ambitious but attainable national targets and allocating adequate financial and human resources to programmes to achieve these targets; ensuring that their national immunization plans are fully integrated into national health plans, with appro- priate budgets and formulated with the participation of all major stakeholders; and demonstrating good stewardship and implementation of their national health plans. Country commitment to immunization does not, however, imply that immunization programmes will be prioritized or funded at the expense of other vital health programmes. National legislation, policies and resource allocation decisions should be informed by credible and current evidence regarding the direct and indirect impact of immunization. Much of the evidence base exists but does not reach policy-makers, as those who generate the evidence are not always those who interact with these decision-makers. Collaboration between, on the one hand, technical experts who generate the evidence and, on the other, the champions of immunization who construct context-specific messages that highlight the importance of immunization within health and social services, can unequivocally articulate the value of immunization and how immunization supports equity and economic development.1 strategic objective All countries: Establish and sustain commitment to immunization; Inform and engage opinion leaders on the value of immunization; Strengthen national capacity to formulate evidence-based policies.page 36 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 1 page 37 Independent bodies, such as regional or national immunization technical advisory groups, that can guide country policies and strategies based on local epidemiology and cost effectiveness should be established or strengthened, thus reducing dependency on external bodies for policy guidance. These bodies can readily be supported by institutions or individuals charged with collating and synthesizing information required for informed decision- making. Regional support systems and initiatives, such as the PAHO ProVac initiative, 7 can be expanded to support countries in strengthening their decision-making. It is important that national immunization technical advisory groups or their regional equivalents, engage with academia, professional societies, and other national agencies and committees, such as the vaccine regulatory agencies, national health sector coordination committees, and inter - agency coordination committees, in order to ensure a cohesive and coordinated approach to achieving national health priorities. Strong links between ministries of health, education 8 and finance, as well as human resources and legislators are also essential for sustainable programme implementation. Support and formal endorsement of national policies and plans at the highest political and administrative levels, nationally and subnationally, is considered essential for ensuring commitment and sustainability. Governments and elected officials are responsible for putting in place necessary legislation and budget allocations. As immunization is a strong indicator of the overall ability of the health system to deliver services, legislators should be encouraged to scrutinize, defend and closely follow immunization budgets, disbursements and immunization programme activities, both at the national level and within their respective constituencies. Civil society organizations can effectively advocate for greater commitment and hold governments accountable for commitments once they are made. Immunization programmes need to have management structures for programme implementation to be effective. Officials at the national and subnational levels responsible for implementation of the immunization plans can be held accountable for programme performance when they are sufficiently empowered to provide effective leadership and have the required management and programme monitoring skills.For high- and middle-income countries, commitment to immunization should cover the same areas, but may also include maintaining or assuming the role of development partners. Together with global agencies, development partner countries can coordinate the sharing of information and best practices among countries, help bridge temporary funding gaps, and support capacity strengthening by working with stakeholders in different country settings. Ensuring that national immunization plans are fully integrated into national health planstabLe 2: su MMary of reC oMMended aCtions for strategi C objeCtive 1 aLL C ountries C oMMit to i MMunization as a Priority. inform and engage opinion leaders on the value of immunization. exPL ore models to promote collabora- tion between the stakeholders that generate evidence on immunization and those who use it in order to set priorities and formulate policies. deveL oP and disseminate the evidence base on the public health value of vaccines and immunization and the added value of achieving equity in access and use of immunization. deveL oP and disseminate the evidence base for the broad economic benefits of immunization for individuals, house- holds, communities, and countries. inCLude immunization in the agendas of governing body meetings at all levels and in other social, health and economic forums.strengthen national capacity to formulate evidence-based policies.

Significant improvements in coverage and programme sustainability are possible if individuals and communities understand the benefits and risks of immuni- zation; are encouraged to seek services; are empowered to make demands on the health system; and have ownership of the planning and implementation of programmes within their local communities. Although there has generally been a high demand for vaccination services, accessing hard-to-reach populations, attaining higher coverage levels and achieving equity objectives may require additional approaches to stimulate demand for vaccination. Generating individual, household and community demand will require using traditional platforms more effectively as well as new strategies to convey the benefits of immunization, emphasize immunization as a core component of the right to health and encourage greater use of services. New efforts could take advantage of social media and approaches used by commercial and social marketing efforts to promote immunization and address concerns. New mobile and Internet technologies should also be utilized, drawing on the experiences and successes of other innovative public health campaigns. Communications and social research to identify the barriers to and drivers of vaccination should inform the development of context-specific messages. Lessons on vaccines and immunization should be included in the primary school education curriculum. Multisectoral approaches that promote efforts, such as female education and empowerment, will help improve utilization of immunization and health services in general. Significant improvements in coverage and programme sustainability are possible if individuals and communities understand the benefits and risks of immunization2 strategic objective page 40 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 2 page 41 Where appropriate, programme strategies could also include measures to provide an incentive both to households to seek immunization services and to health care providers to improve their performance in vaccinating children, particularly those that have not been reached previously. At the household level, conditional cash transfer programmes often include vaccination of children as a requirement for receiving household income transfers. There is evidence that such programmes may have a positive impact on immunization coverage rates, even in countries with high coverage rates, and particularly for more marginalized populations. Because conditional cash transfer programmes are often administered in countries as part of a broad package of social protection or poverty alleviation measures, these programmes provide an opportunity to link immunization programmes and health ministries with other broader development initiatives, including those administered by other ministries. At the health facility level, both households and health care providers can be further motivated by in-kind gifts at the time of vaccination, or by giving performance-based financing bonuses to providers. There is some early evidence to suggest that performance-based financing of immunization services leads to increasing numbers of children being vaccinated, although more rigorous analysis of the impact of performance-based financing on immunization is still being carried out. Providing incentives to health care workers and households through monetary and in-kind gifts has implementation challenges that need to be carefully addressed. These schemes need to respect the autonomy of beneficiaries. Social research is also needed to determine the conditions under which incentives contribute to improved coverage and the types and levels of incentives that are appropriate for a given context. Demand-generation activities must be coupled with mechanisms to ensure reliability of vaccine supply. Some reasons for hesitancy are undoubtedly amenable to improved communica- tions and advocacy initiatives designed to counteract growing anti-vaccination lobby groups and to increase understanding of the value of vaccines or of the danger of diseases. However, others are best addressed by ensuring the quality of the services provided. Individuals will be less hesitant to use services if they perceive the quality of those services to be acceptable. They are more likely to come to vaccination sessions when scheduled services are convenient and predictably available; when practical counselling is offered about where and when to come for vaccination and why, and about what to expect following vaccination; when the health workers have a welcoming attitude; when waiting times are reasonable; and when services are offered without charge. Health care workers should receive training in effective communication to enable them to deal with the media and with local communities when there are reports of serious adverse events following immunization, in order to allay fears and tackle vaccine hesitancy. Bringing about change will require the participation of individuals, households and communities in the development and implementation of all demand- generation strategies. It will also require new and stronger community-based advocates with local knowledge, credibility and the front-line experience necessary to drive change. The participation of in-country civil society organizations will be crucial to develop strong advocacy efforts and should be supported by capacity building. Here again, an effort that promotes collaboration between evidence generators and evidence users could provide training for champions and link with local social and professional networks, which are an important source of grass-roots immunization champions. This will especially be required as country programmes embrace a life-course approach to immunization. Current advocates must recruit new voices\u2014potentially including educators, religious leaders, traditional and social media personalities, family physicians, community health workers and immunization champions. Researchers and technical experts will also have an important role in creating greater community awareness and providing credible responses to misinformation regarding immunization. Generating individual and community demand will reinforce country commitment to vaccines and immunization (strategic objective 1). Activities to generate demand for vaccines and immunization should build on the broader movement in order to help people to hold their governments accountable for access to health services.There is some early evidence to suggest that performance-based financing of immunization services leads to increasing numbers of children being vaccinatedDemand-generation activities must be coupled with mechanisms to ensure reliability of vaccine supply page 42 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 2 page 43 tabLe 3: su MMary of reC oMMended aCtions for strategi C objeCtive 2 individuaL and C oMMunities understand the vaL ue of vaCC ines and deMand i MMunization as both their right and resPonsibi Lity.

Today, four out of every five children receive at least a basic set of vaccinations during infancy and are therefore able to lead healthier, more productive lives. Unfortunately, this means one child in every five is not being reached. In this decade, the benefits of immunization should also be more equitably extended to all children, adolescents and adults. Achieving this strategic objective will mean that every eligible individual is immunized with all appropriate vaccines\u2014irrespective of geographic location, age, gender, disability, educational level, socioeconomic level, ethnic group or work condition\u2014thereby reaching underserved populations and reducing disparities in immunization both within and between countries. Because disease burdens tend to be disproportionately concentrated in more marginalized populations, reaching more people will not only achieve a greater degree of equity, but will also achieve a greater health impact and contribute to economic development. Furthermore, disease eradication and elimination goals cannot be met without achieving and sustaining high and equitable coverage. In 2002, WHO, UNICEF and other partners introduced the concept of \"Reaching Every District\", a first step toward achieving more equitable coverage. Through its various operational components, which include re-establishing outreach services, providing supportive supervision, engaging with communities, monitoring and use of data and district planning and resource management, the Reaching Every District strategy was able to expand the provision of immunization services. Similarly, initiatives aimed at disease eradication and elimination or rapid mortality reduction have used strategies, such as national or subnational immunization days (for poliomyelitis eradication) and supplementary immunization activities (for measles and rubella elimination, Achieving this strategic objective will mean that every eligible individual is immunized with all appropriate vaccines\u2014irrespective of geographic location, age, gender, disability, educational level, socioeconomic level, ethnic group or work condition3strategic objective page 46 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 3 page 47 measles mortality reduction and neonatal tetanus elimination). More recently, strategies collectively referred to as periodic intensification of routine immunization have been used to extend immunization to the unreached, packaged together with other primary health care interventions. Even these strategies continue to miss populations, for example those that reside outside traditional social and governmental structures. To sustain the gains of these historical efforts and to achieve and sustain disease control goals, the Reaching Every District strategic approach should be recast as \"Reaching Every Community\". To attain more equitable coverage, the definition of community should be expanded beyond geographically defined communities. Reaching every community will mean aiming to encompass every eligible individual, even those beyond typical government outreach. Reaching every community will call for an understanding of the barriers to access and use of immunization; it will also require the underserved to be identified, and micro-plans at the district and community levels to be reviewed and revised in order to ensure that these barriers can be overcome. The rapid expansion of information technology should be leveraged to establish immunization registries and electronic databases that will allow each individual's immunization status to be tracked, timely reminders to be sent when immunization is due and data to be accessed easily to inform actions. The introduction of unique identification numbers could be a catalyst for the establishment of such systems. Drawing on the experiences of successful poliomyelitis vaccination campaigns, decentralized planning and outreach should be used to reach populations that are remote or nomadic or that have been historically marginalized. New strategies for reaching the urban poor and urban migrants will also be necessary. Given the tenuous and evolving community structures and the inadequate security involved, new approaches to community outreach will be especially critical for reaching these groups. This is all the more true in view of the fact that sometimes the most unifying force in these urban and peri-urban areas is a shared and deep-seated mistrust of outsiders, especially governments.Implementing strategies to reach all underserved populations will require engagement with the nongovernmental sector, including civil society organizations and private sector organizations, and will need to involve all aspects of immunization including advocacy, social mobilization, service delivery and monitoring programme performance. To support such collaboration, governments should allocate increased resources to underserved communities and ensure that programmes have sufficient, well-trained personnel to execute strategies effectively. Partnerships across government sectors (for example, with educational institutions) and coordination with programmes that focus on vulnerable populations will be essential. In addition, efforts to provide high- quality immunization services to all children will need to continue unabated in order to protect gains already recorded.The Reaching Every District strategic approach should be recast as \"Reaching Every Community\" page 48 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 3 page 49 tabLe 4: su MMary of reC oMMended aCtions for strategi C objeCtive 3 the benefits of i MMunization are equitabL y extended to aLL P eoPL e. develop and implement new strategies to tackle inequities. reCast \"Reaching Every District\" to \"Reaching Every Community\" in order to deal with inequities within districts. engage underserved and marginalized groups to develop locally tailored, targeted strategies for reducing inequities. introduCe appropriate new vaccines into national immunization programmes (see also objective 5). estabLish a life-course approach to immunization planning and implementa- tion, including new strategies to ensure equity across the life span.Prevent and respond to vaccine- preventable diseases during disease outbreaks and humanitarian crises, and in conflict zones. build knowledge base and capacity for enabling equitable delivery. traCk each individual's immunization status, leveraging immunization registries, electronic databases and national identification number systems. take advantage of community structures to enhance communication and deliver services (for example, traditional birth attendants, birth registries). invoL ve civil society organizations in community outreach and planning.There are other dimensions of equity that merit consideration during the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020), including disparities between countries, adolescent and adult immunization, and immunization during emergencies. Historically, it took decades before new vaccines used in high-income countries became available in low- and middle-income countries. Steps are being taken to address this inequity, including the introduction of new vaccines, with the support of the GAVI Alliance. However, much more needs to be done to sustain and extend these gains, particularly to middle-income countries. A \"life-course\" approach must also be taken in order to make the benefits of immunization available to all those at risk in every age group. As diseases are being successfully controlled through infant immunization, the need to boost immunity to sustain and extend these gains is increasingly being recognized. In addition, new and existing vaccines that are beneficial for school children, adolescents and adults at special risk\u2014such as health workers, immunocom-promised individuals, animal handlers, and the elderly\u2014(for example, vaccines against human papillomavirus, influenza and rabies) are now available and being increasingly used. The success of efforts to eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus and the benefits to both women and infants of influenza vaccination during pregnancy have increased interest in exploring the development of other vaccines that could be used during pregnancy (for example, group B streptococcus or respiratory syncytial virus vaccines). This will mean creating strategies for reaching individuals throughout their life course, and developing plans for the systems that will monitor and track progress.deveL oP new approaches to community engagement for urban and peri-urban areas. train health workers and civil society organizations in engaging communities, in identifying influential people who can assist in planning, organizing and monitoring health and immunization programmes, as well as community needs, and in working with communities to meet those needs. ConduCt operational and social science research to identify successful strategies to reduce inequities and improve the quality and delivery of immunization services. Likewise, targeted plans are needed to ensure access to immunization during humanitarian crises, outbreaks and in conflict zones. These plans should include a focus on communication and provision for the development of vaccine stockpiles. Social and operational research is needed to inform the design and test the effectiveness of the delivery strategies mentioned above. Key areas of focus for this research could include identifying the main causes of low coverage in particular areas and communities, assessing economic barriers to immunization, understanding the best approaches for reaching individuals of various ages, and assessing the most effective incentives for reaching different groups.Creating strategies for reaching individuals throughout their life coursepage 50 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 4 page 51 Strong immunization systems are an integral part of a well functioning health system. The success of national immunization programmes in introducing new vaccines, attaining goals for quality, equity and coverage, and becoming financially sustainable depends upon a well functioning health system. The many inter- connected components of an immunization system require multi-disciplinary attention in order to build a cohesive, non-fragmented and well-functioning programme that coordinates and works in synergy with other primary health care programmes. Health systems encompass a range of functions from policy and regulation to information and supply chain systems, human resources, overall programme management and financing. Health systems include both the public and private sectors, and in some countries the private sector can play a valuable role in educating households about the need for and benefits of vaccination, as well as providing health care. Some of these functions have been dealt with in other sections of this document. This section discusses the actions required to foster greater coordination between immunization and other programmes within health systems and to strengthen the information, human resources, supply chain and logistics components of health systems. Immunization service delivery should continue to serve as a platform for providing other priority public health interventions, such as those for vitamin A supplementation, deworming, and insecticide-treated bednets. Other priority programmes should also serve as a platform for delivering immunization. Every contact with the health sector should be used as an opportunity to verify immunization status and provide immunization where indicated. Furthermore, Immunization service delivery should continue to serve as a platform for providing other priority public health interventions\u00a5R4strategic objective page 52 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 4 page 53 as new vaccines become available that target some but not all pathogens that cause particular syndromes, such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and cervical cancer, it is important that their introduction be an opportunity to scale up the delivery of complementary interventions. For example, the vaccines against pneumococcus and rotavirus should be complemented with other actions to protect, prevent and treat related respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases. New vaccine deployment should therefore be accompanied by comprehensive disease-control plans both within countries and globally. Coordination of immunization with other services should take place at all levels of a country's programmes, involve outreach efforts and participation by health centres, and be a part of programme management. Coordinating immunization with integrated primary health-care programmes may also facilitate social mobilization efforts, helping to generate community demand for services (strategic objective 2) and address inequity (strategic objective 3). Additionally, efforts should be made to ensure that global vaccine programmes focused on eradication and elimination goals (for example, poliomyelitis and measles campaigns) do not operate in silos. The choice of mechanisms to promote greater interaction and coordination between different programmes should be made by countries according to their local context. The synergies and efficiencies as a result of integration and coordination will be particularly beneficial in countries with fragile health systems.Access to timely high-quality information is essential for effective immunization. Critical information includes process indicators that allow programmes to monitor their performance and take corrective action, and outcome indicators that measure the impact of programmes. Output and impact indicators need to be analysed along with expenditures in order to identify bottlenecks and best practices and to gauge overall programme efficiency (value for money). Immunization information systems need to be linked to broader health information systems, while remaining readily accessible and meeting immunization programme needs. Monitoring of immunization coverage and dropout rates has been in place since the launch of the Expanded Programme on Immunization to ensure programme effectiveness. Although the quality and timeliness of data reporting have improved steadily over the years, the quality of administrative coverage data is still inadequate in many countries. Furthermore, the use of data in order to take corrective action at district and community levels is still unsatisfactory. New approaches to immunization tracking through unique identification numbers (discussed in strategic objective 3) can improve the quality of immunization coverage data and facilitate the development of comprehensive immunization registries. New technologies, including hand-held communication devices and mobile phones, can support this effort and facilitate data sharing. Armed with higher-quality data and new data-analysis tools, programme managers at all administrative levels can use information to improve programme performance, allocate funding appropriately, and track progress more effectively. Disease surveillance is critical for informing decision-making on the adoption of new vaccines and on the strategies for their use in their respective national programmes. Such surveillance is also essential for monitoring the impact of immunization and changes in disease epidemiology, and for supporting sustained use. Robust epidemiological data will also be crucial for understanding vaccine effectiveness and guiding priorities in the research and development community, and will help to identify the areas where research and development is most needed (strategic objective 6). Disease surveillance platforms need to be strengthened to improve the quality and sharing of information. This will include strengthening laboratory capacity for microbiological confirmation of diagnosis and for tracking the spread of diseases using molecular typing techniques.Coordinating immunization with integrated primary health-care programmes may also facilitate social mobilization efforts page 54 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 4 page 55 The increasing complexity of immunization programmes and ambitious new goals, mean that more trained health workers are needed to manage the increased burden of work, including programme managers at the national and subnational levels as well as front-line workers who deliver services and interact directly with communities. Programme managers need to be equipped with technical knowledge about vaccines and immunization, as well as with management skills. Front-line health workers, who deliver not only vaccinations but also primary health care interventions and health education, need coordinated, comprehensive and very practical pre- and in-service training, with updated, relevant curricula and post-training supervision. Health-care workers need to be able not only to explain why immunization is important, but also to give advice to individuals and communities on nutrition, create a healthier envi - ronment and recognize the danger signs when someone falls ill. Immunization programmes should ensure that this training and supervision is effectively extended to community-based health workers. Civil society organizations can help with training and coordinating such workers. Health workers can only be effective if sufficient supplies (vaccines, supplements and medicines) are available when they need them. The influx of new vaccines has outstripped the capacity of the current cold-chain system in many countries. Thus, supply chains and waste management systems urgently need to be expanded and made more efficient and reliable. They should be streamlined to maximize effectiveness. They should also take into account and make an effort to minimize the environmental impact of energy, materials and processes used for immunization both within countries and globally. The availability of new technologies provides the opportunity to innovate, not only to improve immunization supply chain management, but also to seek increased synergies with other sectors and supply systems for other health interventions. Another potential area of innovation concerns understanding the lessons learnt from private-sector practices and supply chain management. In addition, tasks that could be outsourced to private sector companies in order to create greater efficiency should be explored. The availability of new technologies provides the opportunity to innovateOn rare occasions, adverse reactions can affect the health of vaccine recipients. More frequently, coincidental health events can follow immunization and may be wrongly attributed to vaccines. In both instances, it is extremely important to detect and analyse promptly serious adverse events following immunization. To assist low- and middle-income countries in managing such important issues, WHO and its partners have developed the Global Vaccine Safety Blueprint. This strategic plan will enable the countries concerned to have at least minimal capacity for vaccine safety activities; it will also enhance capacity for vaccine safety assessment in countries that introduce newly developed vaccines, that introduce vaccines in settings with novel characteristics or that both manufacture and use prequalified vaccines; and it will establish a global vaccine safety support structure. Implementing the Global Vaccine Safety Blueprint strategies to build capacity for safety surveillance during the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020) will ensure that everyone everywhere receives the safest vaccines possible and that safety concerns are not a cause of hesitancy in using vaccines.

Likewise, improvements to health information systems should also support the management of resources, helping staff to ensure that adequate quantities of vaccines are always available to meet demand. Efforts to strengthen supply chains should be implemented in such a way that they benefit both immunization programmes and broader national health efforts. Developing stronger, more efficient, comprehensive approaches to disease control and immunization will require health ministries to take the lead in strengthening and coordinating immunization programmes and health systems more broadly, including engaging civil society organizations, academia and private practitioners. They can draw on the expertise of academics to help develop and deploy new tools and approaches to service delivery. Civil society organiza-tions can contribute to the development of integrated programmes so that they are aligned with local realities and incorporate community-based human resources. Communities can ultimately hold their governments accountable by demanding integrated services. Regional and global organizations can also help by ensuring that data and best practices are shared in and across countries and that country programmes have access to analytical tools. Development partners can provide supplemental financial resources if needed.Front-line health workers need coordinated, comprehensive and very practical pre- and in-service training page 58 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 5 page 59 Immunization programmes have sustainable access to predictable funding, quality supply and innovative technologies. To meet goals of the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020), actions must be taken both within countries and globally to increase the total amount of available funding for immunization from both countries and development partners. Countries should ensure the financial sustainability of national immunization programmes through regular evaluation of resource needs; efficiency in service delivery; availability of adequate domestic financing; and resource mobilization from development partners to meet any funding gaps. Governments also need to explore alternative and innovative financing mechanisms for health and immunization. Some countries have established trust funds or use dedicated tax revenues, among other strategies. In addition, it is important to move beyond budgets and into expenditures. Governments can improve vaccine access and prevent shortages of vaccines, immunization equipment or health workers by assuring that budgeted funds are disbursed in an ongoing and timely fashion that responds to programmes' needs. Although the financing of immunization services is first and foremost a core responsibility of governments, development partners should support national strategies through more predictable, longer-term financing, and should also explore the next generation of innovative financing mechanisms. Emphasis needs to be placed on mutual accountability between countries and their development partners in terms of immunization financing. One possible Actions must be taken both within countries and globally to increase the total amount of available funding for immunization 5strategic objective page 60 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 5 page 61 approach is to undertake annual resource tracking of immunization financing from partners and governments alike. For both countries and development partners, evidence-based advocacy and policy efforts should be focused on obtaining a renewed commitment to past funding pledges. There is also a need to improve the allocation, accountability and sustainability of funding. Coordinating funding support from development partners and other external sources to target national budget priorities will ensure that funds are addressing the most pressing country needs. Funding allocation strategies should be revised periodically to confirm they are achieving goals, such as eradication and elimination of disease, as quickly and as effectively as possible. Feedback loops should be established to enhance programme sustainability, results and impact. One potential methodology to explore is a pay-for-performance funding system. However, the merits of this approach must be balanced against the importance of ensuring the predictability of funding, the risks of creating perverse incentives, and the fact that implementation of such a scheme requires high-quality data. This would include linking international, national, and local funding distribution to specific performance metrics and leveraging the resulting metrics to promote programme improvement.Innovative pricing and procurement mechanisms are needed to alleviate funding pressure and to support the development and scale-up of new and existing vaccines. Innovations will be particularly important for those lower-middle- income countries that do not have access to the PAHO, UNICEF and GAVI Alliance pricing and procurement mechanisms. Mechanisms to explore include differential pricing using new approaches to define price tiers and pooled negotiation or procurement methods for lower-middle-income countries. Current pooled procurement models exist in both the vaccines and pharmaceuticals markets. One example is the PAHO revolving fund pooled procurement and short-term credit mechanism. This and other models could be assessed and modified to best suit the needs of the lower-middle-income countries and the individual vaccine markets. The provision of long-term sustainable funding will be an incentive to manufacturers, thereby improving supply security. In addition, supply-side interventions are needed. A growing proportion of affordable vaccines that are used to immunize the world's population are manufactured in middle- and lower-middle-income countries. In the coming decade, these countries will not only have a requirement to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of vaccines used domestically, but also a growing global obligation to protect and enhance the security of the global immunization enterprise. Potential supply-side interventions to ensure quality, safety and efficacy include identifying and disseminating best practices in manufacturing and quality control, investing in research and development capabilities, and initiating technology transfers and co-development agreements. A crucial but often overlooked key driver underpinning all these interventions is the quality assurance of vaccines. Good-quality assurance relies crucially on effective standardization, which ensures that each vaccine product can be manufactured consistently and also enables multiple manufacturers to make similar products of the same quality. Normative processes to achieve globally harmonized standards for vaccines already exist, including international biological reference materials, but action is needed to strengthen global standardization. A crucial but often overlooked key driver underpinning all these interventions is the quality assurance of vaccines page 62 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 5 page 63 In addition, each country should develop the capacity to monitor and assure the safe use of vaccines, in line with the strategy defined in the WHO Global Vaccine Safety Blueprint initiative (as discussed under strategic objective 4). Action should also be taken to strengthen national regulatory systems and develop globally harmonized regulations in order to ensure that the increasing demand for regulatory reviews can be managed in an effective and timely manner. This is an issue not just for low- and middle-income countries involved in technology transfer, but also for regulatory agencies in high-income countries where expertise and resources need to be maintained. These supply-side interventions need to be based on solid business cases developed by countries to ensure the impact of these significant and long-term investments. Making change happen with respect to sustainable funding will require commitments from governments and development partners to increase resources and improve programme efficiencies, as well as from additional countries joining the development partner ranks. Likewise, sustainable supply will require the multisectoral involvement of governments (for example, the science and technology, trade, industry and health sectors) in order to create an environment that helps suppliers to strengthen their capabilities. Emerging economies have a particularly important role to play in both cases, given their high rate of economic growth and the rapid expansion of the supply base there. To increase alignment, activities currently performed by the UNICEF Supply Division and the GAVI Alliance to improve communication and coordination among countries, vaccine manufacturers and public-sector organizations should be further expanded. Countries need a forum where they can more clearly communicate expected demand for new vaccines and provide guidance on desired product profiles. This first-hand information would enable suppliers to make more informed product development and capacity planning decisions, thereby mitigating product development and supply risk. This information would also help development partners and other public-sector organizations to establish more defensible and reliable strategies and support plans. This forum could further be utilized to enable suppliers to accurately communicate the possible current and future range of pricing and supply to countries, and for countries to share information on and experience with vaccine procurement.tabLe 6: su MMary of reC oMMended aCtions for strategi C objeCtive 5 iMMunization PrograMMes have sustainabL e aCCess to L ong-terM funding and quaLity suPPL y. increase total amount of funding. estabLish a commitment for governments to invest in immunization according to their ability to pay and the expected benefits. engage new potential domestic and development partners and diversify sources of funding. deveL oP the next generation of innovative financing mechanisms. increase affordability for middle-income countries. exPL ore differential pricing approaches to define explicit criteria for price tiers and the current and future prices to be made available to lower middle-income and middle-income countries. exPL ore pooled negotiation or procurement mechanisms for lower-middle-income and middle- income countries.improve allocation of funding in low- and middle-income countries. strengthen budgeting and financial management in-country to better integrate financial and health care planning and priority setting.

In the coming decade, targeted and innovative research and development efforts are needed across discovery, development and delivery. Innovative research and development efforts will lead to: (1) identification of mechanisms of protection and pathogenesis; (2) well-defined and novel antigenic targets for development of new vaccines; (3) development of bio-processing, formulation, manufacturing and delivery technologies for new and improved vaccines; and (4) development of disease-burden and cost-effectiveness data for in-country decision-making. WHO has conducted a detailed study of disease prioritization and the Institute of Medicine in the United States of America is in the process of developing a model designed to assist decision-makers in prioritizing preventive vaccines based on health, economic, demographic, programmatic and social impact criteria, as well as scientific, technical and business opportunities. The Decade of Vaccines collaboration has not undertaken a vaccine or disease prioritization exercise. To complement the above efforts, a spectrum of research and develop-ment needs is presented across discovery, development and delivery, from which stakeholders can choose to invest according to their own priorities and perceptions of the return on their investments. Research is needed to accelerate development, licensing and uptake of vaccines that are currently in early development6strategic objective page 66 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 6 page 67 Across all research and development activities, increased engagement and consultation with end-users is needed to ensure that technologies and innovation are prioritized according to real demand and added value. New arrangements will also be required to facilitate the transfer of technologies and access to and sharing of associated information, while acknowledging and respecting intellectual property rights. In order to support this work and maximize its effectiveness of, scientists from disciplines not previously engaged in vaccine research (systems biology, nanotechnology, structural biology and metabolomics) will need to be recruited. Chemical and mechanical engineers, chemists and information technology specialists will also have key roles to play in this endeavour. In addition, capacity building and human resource development are needed in low- and middle-income countries to conduct research and development, including finding better ways to conduct operational research and evaluate immunization programmes. Research and development is being conducted in institutions of excellence in many low- and middle-income countries. This capacity is producing indigenous data, as well as fostering bilateral and multilateral collaboration in basic sciences and vaccine development. Capacity can be further strengthened through peer-to-peer training and exchanges between countries. Greater networking among research centres (from discovery to clinical trials) will facilitate the exchange of ideas and the efficient building of partnerships among institutions in high-, middle- and low-income countries.Discovery and basic research will lay the groundwork for impact in future decades. Research at the interface between host and pathogen is needed to enable the development of new vaccines. Advancing knowledge of innate and adaptive immune responses will permit more rational vaccine design. Strengthening the understanding of immunologic and molecular characteristics of microbes through systems biology will permit the identification of new antigenic targets for vaccine development and effective ways of predicting protective immune responses and mechanisms of protection. Appropriate studies of host genetics and biomarkers will contribute to understanding the causes of variation in human population responses to vaccines, or susceptibility to adverse effects. For the development of new and improved vaccines and vaccine technologies, the research and development community will benefit from adopting best practices in portfolio and partnership management, including the identification of early indicators of success and failure to inform milestone-based investments. The community should also consider new approaches to ensure promising vaccine candidates are advanced from discovery to development, particularly where market incentives are insufficient. This is especially important for vaccines to prevent \"neglected\" diseases. Research is needed to accelerate development, licensing and uptake of vaccines that are currently in early development, including development of technologies for more efficacious and less expensive manufacturing of vaccines. Greater access to the technology and associated information for adjuvants and their formulation into vaccines is needed for advances in developing new and more effective vaccines. Non-syringe delivery mechanisms and vaccine packaging that best suit the needs and constraints of countries, as well as thermostable vaccines and new bioprocessing and manufacturing technologies, are priority research areas for accelerating the development of next-generation vaccines that are more effective, less expensive and easier to manufacture and deliver. Non-syringe delivery mechanisms as well as thermostable vaccines are priority research areasScientists from disciplines not previously engaged in vaccine research will need to be recruited page 68 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 6 page 69 Additionally, the elaboration and aggressive pursuit of a global regulatory science agenda will improve manufacturing efficiency, better characterize products, improve clinical trial design and safeguard the highest standards for vaccine safety and efficacy. The challenge is considerable in achieving understanding of the adverse effects, finding ways to avoid them and yet not compromising the known efficacy of the existing product\u2014and without incurring the costs of developing, testing and registering a new product. In this dimension, research on animal models and in vitro systems that better predict safety and efficacy would shorten the time for developing safe and effective vaccines and for making them available to communities. Knowledge of the correlates of protection and safety will greatly help to bring these second-generation products to licensure and use. With respect to delivery, priority areas to improve programme efficiency and increase vaccine coverage and impact should include research on the use of effective information through modern communication technologies and social research in order to understand the cultural, economic and organizational determinants of immunization. Health economic analysis will guide the intro- duction and prioritization of vaccines, and hence representative epidemiological, immunological and operational studies and studies of vaccine impact will be needed. Operational research on the most effective delivery approaches is also needed in order to overcome the challenges posed by life-course immunization (newborn, infant, adolescent, pregnant women, elderly, among others) and vaccination in emergency and outbreak situations. Research on immunological interference effects and optimization of delivery schedules will be required as more new vaccines are introduced into routine programmes and immunization is extended beyond the first year of life. In the case of special populations, such as pregnant women, confirmation of safety will be particularly important. Furthermore, research is required in order to develop bio-markers for validating immunization coverage estimates and enabling better measurement of population-level immunity profiles. In addition, research to develop field-usable and cost-effective diagnostic tools for establishing etiology that are suited for use at point-of-care in low-income countries will be valuable additions to improving surveillance quality.Concerted action among the research community, manufacturers, health professionals, programme managers, national immunization technical advisory groups, vaccine regulatory agencies and development partners will be needed to attain the full potential of research and development in the next decade. Methods and arguments for prioritization and allocation of scarce resources will have to be agreed upon by these groups, balancing the tensions between country-driven choices and the need for large-scale research efforts and markets in order to sustain development and commercialization. Health professionals, programme managers, vaccine regulatory agencies and national immunization technical advisory groups can help to identify areas where innovations could be made, and assess their real demand and added value. Development partners can help promote a judicious allocation of some resources for research and development, according to the agreed priorities. The research community and manufacturers will have prime responsibility for promoting innovation and pursuing the research agenda defined above. Operational research on the most effective delivery approaches is also needed in order to overcome the challenges posed by life-course immunization page 70 Global Vaccine Action Plan Strategic Objective 6 page 71 tabLe 7: su MMary of reC oMMended aCtions for strategi C objeCtive 6 regionaL, and benefits of i MMunization.

By extending coverage for existing vaccines, introducing new vaccines and pursuing elimination and eradication for specific diseases, millions of deaths can be averted and billions of dollars in economic benefit can be generated. All stakeholders investing together will drive a significant health and economic impactipage 74 Global Vaccine Action Plan Health Returns on Investment in Immunization page 75 It is projected that costs to sustain and scale up current immunization programmes, introduce new and underutilized vaccines, and conduct supplemental immunization activities to reach elimination and eradication goals in the world's 94 low- and lower-middle-income countries will rise from between US$ 3500 million and US$ 4500 million in 2011 to between US$ 6000 million and US$ 8000 million in 2020, costing approximately between US$ 50 000 million and US$ 60 000 million cumulatively over the course of the decade (from 2011 to 2020). The following estimates all pertain to these 94 countries.9 An estimated US$ 42 000 million to US$ 51 000 million of these costs (roughly 85% of the total) will support expanding routine immunization coverage and introducing additional vaccines to routine immunization programmes. 10 For example, pneumococcal vaccine coverage for the birth cohort in the 94 countries is projected to go from 8% in 2011 to approximately 90% by 2020. Similarly, coverage with the pentavalent vaccine (against diphtheria-tetanus- pertussis hepatitis B and Hib) is projected to move from 50% in 2011 to more than 90% by 2020. To take another example, it is anticipated that up to five additional vaccines that are currently not licensed or widely used in low- and lower-middle-income countries will be introduced across many of the countries in the analysis during the decade: vaccines against cholera, dengue and malaria, inactivated poliovirus vaccine, and typhoid Vi conjugate vaccine. Delivery programmes will need to be strengthened to ensure they meet current needs, are well-maintained over the decade, have sufficient capacity to accommodate additional vaccines that are planned to be introduced, and facilitate immunization coverage aspirations across low- and lower-middle-income countries. As a consequence, the costs of annual routine immunization will increase from approximately US$ 2500 million in 2011 to US$ 7500 million by 2020. Of these costs, an estimated cumulative figure of between US$ 8000 million and US$ 9000 million (the remaining 15% of the total) will be for supplementary immunization activities for accelerated disease control and eradication and elimination efforts throughout the decade, which will complement routine immunization programmes. This analysis assumes that these efforts will be focused on measles, meningococcus A meningitis, poliomyelitis, rubella, tetanus and yellow fever.

These costs do not include the additional costs or efficiencies that may be generated through the actions recommended in the global vaccine action plan where there is an insufficient evidence base for these costs at this time. Specifically, it does not include the additional cost of scaling up seasonal influenza vaccination or the additional resource needs for increased surveillance, increased civil society engagement, and current and additional technical agency support to implement the Global Vaccine Action Plan. Nevertheless, the costs do represent the majority of the cost of achieving the strategic objectives of the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020). The governments of low- and lower-middle-income countries will continue to play a pivotal role in meeting resource needs. Assuming that country funding for immunization grows in line with projected gross domestic product and all GAVI Alliance-eligible countries fully meet its co-financing requirements, it is estimated that the available funding from country governments for routine immunization and supplemental immunization activities could total approximately US$ 20 000 million over the decade. In addition, if the GAVI Alliance renews its current level of funding for the 2016-2020 period, its resources will generate an estimated additional US$ 12 000 million of funds for the decade, approximately US$ 11 000 million for routine immunization programmes and approximately US$ 1000 million for programmes involving supplementary immunization activities. Based on these assumptions, country governments and the GAVI Alliance combined could provide a total of approximately US$ 32 000 million in funding for the decade. These estimates could be considered the minimum available financing over the decade because they do not include contributions from development partners beyond that provided through the GAVI Alliance (owing to the considerable uncertainty surrounding future levels of development partner financing). Meeting the estimated US$ 18 000 million to US$ 28 000 million in additional funding will require commitment from all stakeholders, with governments needing to continue making immunization a priority in resource allocation decisions; development partners needing to sustain and bolster access to funding for immunization in spite of competing priorities; and the entire community needing to continue efforts to reduce the cost of vaccine acquisition and immunization service delivery. All stakeholders investing together will drive a significant health and economic impact. Work to sustain or extend coverage of existing vaccines and efforts to introduce new vaccines, if undertaken together, have the potential to avert millions of future deaths, as well as hundreds of millions of cases of disease, and generate hundreds of billions of dollars in economic impact over the decade. As an example of the potential impact of immunization, a sub-analysis of 10 vaccines, delivered during the decade, that represent an estimated US$ 42 000 million of the US$ 50 000 million to US$ 60 000 million cost for the decade, 11 have the potential to avert in total between 24 and 26 million future deaths (Table 8) as compared with a hypothetical scenario under which these vaccines have zero coverage.12 11 Vaccines included in health benefits analysis cover the following diseases in countries representing 99.5% of the birth cohort of the 94 countries included in the costing analysis: hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type rotavirus, rubella, yellow fever and measles. 12 Data were insufficient to estimate morbidity averted through immunization in these countries.10 Diseases covered by the vaccines included in the scope of the costing analysis include: diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae fever.If the GAVI Alliance renews its current level of funding for the 2016-2020 period, its resources will generate an estimated additional US$ 12 000 million for the decade: 11 000 million1 000million routine immunization programmessupplementary immunization activitiespage 78 Global Vaccine Action Plan Health Returns on Investment in Immunization page 79 tabLe 8: tabL e 8: t otaL future deaths averted, Ming no vaCC ination as the C ounterfaCtuaL a The estimated future deaths averted was developed by a working group that included staff from WHO, the GAVI Alliance, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and PATH.

They are not limited to only the incremental benefits of the additional actions undertaken during the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020). The current projections of costs, available funding and health impact will evolve as additional analysis is completed and new and better data become available. Additional analysis will allow for the expansion of the scope described by this document, including increasing the number of diseases covered by the cost and health benefits analysis, quantifying impact on morbidity, quantifying economic benefits and further increasing the level of detail of costing and funding projections. Additional analysis is needed in order to better understand vaccine research and development costs and benefits, which are not included in the current projections. New and better data will, among other things, enhance the analysis with revised disease burden statistics, better vaccine price forecasts, improved population information and more consistent data across all countries. In addition, a process should be developed and maintained to allow for updates to cost, funding, and health and economic impact estimates at the country and global levels, ideally on an annual basis. This will facilitate enhanced planning, coordination and engagement among the many stakeholders that will be required to achieve the strategic objectives and goals of the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020). page 80 Global Vaccine Action Plan Title of Section (TK) page 81 Continuing Momentum for the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020) Ensuring success throughout the Decade of Vaccines requires additional focus and action beyond the development of the Global Vaccine Action Plan. Four critical sets of activities will be required in order to translate the action plan into actions and results: development of tools for translation of the plan; development of a complete accountability framework; securing commitments from the stakeholder community; and communicating Decade of Vaccines opportunities and challenges. Tools are needed [to] help stakeholders better understand how to translate the actions recommended in the action plan into the local context ipage 82 Global Vaccine Action Plan Continuing Momentum for the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020) page 83 Tools are needed that provide the full thinking behind the Global Vaccine Action Plan, together with details, to enable implementation. The production, publication and communication of these tools will help stakeholders better understand how to translate the actions recommended in the action plan into the local context. The Global Vaccine Action Plan lays the groundwork for an accountability framework, which will be finalized with more detailed roles and responsibilities for stakeholders, a complete set of indicators, the methodology and data sources for each indicator detailed and baselines established where required. Investments are needed to improve data quality and develop more robust in-country monitoring and evaluation systems. Regular audits should be conducted to verify data quality. Progress should be reviewed annually, beginning in 2013, by country, the WHO regional committees and the Health Assembly. Commitments aligned to the Global Vaccine Action Plan from countries, civil society organizations, multilateral agencies, development partners and vaccine manufacturers can transform the action plan from a document to a movement. Efforts to build these commitments and a strategy for coordinating them will be required at the global, regional and country levels. Appropriate channels must be identified and targeted communications developed to ensure that Decade of Vaccines messages reach and resonate with all stakeholders. The period of time immediately following the Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly will be critical for ensuring that the agenda-setting translates into effective action. Key opportunities to sustain and build on the current momentum during the remainder of 2012 include the WHO regional committee meetings, the meeting of the Board of the GAVI Alliance, the UNICEF Executive Board meeting, the GAVI Alliance Partners' Forum and the Child Survival: A Call to Action summit. The Decade of Vaccines collaboration was a time-limited effort that ended with the completion of the Global Vaccine Action Plan and related activities identified above. There will be no new structure to support the implementation phase of the Decade of Vaccines/Global Vaccine Action Plan. Lead stakeholders need to assume ownership to support implementation and progress monitoring. WHO will play a leadership role for the action plan as the normative lead agency in global health, including the defining of norms and standards for production and quality control of vaccines, as well for strengthening immunization delivery, programme monitoring and surveillance systems. In collaboration with other stakeholders, the WHO Secretariat will also advocate for and provide technical support to Member States in promoting greater country ownership, creating synergies between immunization and other primary health-care programmes and implementing research, notably to increase programme efficiencies and impact.The Decade of Vaccines collaboration was a time- limited effort that ended with the completion of the Global Vaccine Action Plan and related activities identified abovepage 84 Global Vaccine Action Plan World Health Assembly Resolution page 85 World Health Assembly Resolution SIXTY-FIFTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA65.17 Agenda item 13.12 26 May 2012 Global Vaccine Action Plan The Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report on the draft Global Vaccine Action Plan;1 Recognizing the importance of immunization as one of the most cost-effective interventions in public health, which should be recognized as a core component of the human right to health; Acknowledging the remarkable progress made in immunization in several countries to ensure that every eligible individual is immunized with all appropriate vaccines, irrespective of geographical location, age, gender, disability, educational level, socioeconomic level, ethnic group or work condition; 3. 1 Document A65/22.page 86 Global Vaccine Action Plan World Health Assembly Resolution page 87 Applauding the contribution of successful immunization programmes in achieving global health goals, in particular in reducing childhood mortality and morbidity, and their potential for reducing mortality and morbidity across the life-course; Noting that the introduction of new vaccines targeted against several important causes of major killer diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and cervical cancer can be used as a catalyst to scale up complementary interventions and create synergies between primary health care programmes; and that beyond the mortality gains, these new vaccines will prevent morbidity with resulting economic returns even in countries that have already succeeded in reducing mortality; Concerned that, despite the progress already made, disease eradication and elimination goals such as the eradication of poliomyelitis, the elimination of measles, rubella, and maternal and neonatal tetanus cannot be met without achieving and sustaining high and equitable coverage; Concerned that low-income and middle-income countries where the adoption of available vaccines has been slower may not have the opportunity to access newer and improved vaccines expected to become available during this decade; Alarmed that globally routine immunization services are not reaching one child in five, and that substantial gaps persist in routine immunization coverage within countries; Recalling resolutions WHA58.15 and WHA61.15 on the global immunization strategy, 1 Document A65/22.

The projections draw upon and consolidate information from existing forecasts and costing studies as well as country-specific data available from country immunization plans. The analysis focuses on projecting costs and financial flows likely to be available to cover those costs for vaccines and injection supplies, associated delivery efforts and immunization-specific system costs (e.g. cold chain). The financing projections model the domestic funding flows from country governments, support received through the GAVI Alliance, and other major sources of development assistance for immunization. page 102 Global Vaccine Action Plan Annex 3: Costing and Funding Methodology and Assumptions page 103 tabLe 9: Country s CoPe for anaL ysis Afghanistan Malawi Congo, d'Ivoire Mongolia Ukraine Benin Mozambique Djibouti Morocco Uzbekistan Burkina Faso Myanmar Egypt Nicaragua Vanuatu Burundi Nepal El Salvador Nigeria Viet Nam Cambodia Niger Fiji Pakistan West Bank & Gaza CAR Rwanda Georgia Papua New Guinea Yemen Chad Sierra Leone Ghana Paraguay Zambia Comoros Somalia Guatemala Philippines Azerbaijan Congo, DR Tajikistan Guyana Samoa Cuba Eritrea Tanzania Honduras S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 & Principe Ethiopia Togo Indonesia Senegal Gambia Uganda India Solomon Islands Guinea Zimbabwe Iraq Sri Lanka Guinea-Bissau Angola Kiribati Sudan, N.

The remainder of this document provides of an overview of the methodology and approach that underpins this analysis. Instead of covering all actions in the GVAP, this analysis focuses on the costs, projected financing, and resulting funding gap, under different scenarios, to immunize target populations in low and lower-middle-income countries with existing vaccines and upcoming vaccines that are expected to address significant disease burden in these countries. Methods Countries inCL uded While the Decade of Vaccines Collaboration (DoVC) is intended as a global enterprise, the immunization cost and financing projections analysis focused on 94 countries, consisting of all those classified as low (35) or lower-middle- income (57) by the World Bank in 2011, as well as two countries that are now in the process of graduating from GAVI eligibility and are classified as upper- middle-income countries. 4 A table listing the specific countries included in this analysis can be found below. Due to data availability for key variables, the analysis sample consisted of 89 countries representing >99% of the total birth cohort of the original 94 countries. Of the 89 analysis countries, 57 are currently eligible for new GAVI support, 16 are countries that are currently graduating from GAVI support, and 21 countries are ineligible for GAVI support. This analysis focuses on the costs, projected financing, and resulting funding gap, under different scenarios of the total birth cohort of the original 94 countries represented >99% 4 World Bank income classification released July 2011, based on 2010 GNI per capita. Low-income countries have a 2010 GNI per capita of US$1005 or less. Lower-middle-income countries have a GNI per capita of between US$1006 and US$3975.page 104 Global Vaccine Action Plan Annex 3: Costing and Funding Methodology and Assumptions page 105 Cost and finanC ing C oMPonents inCL uded For each of the above categories included in the analysis, costs were developed in three segments: vaccine and injection supplies, vaccine delivery (including capital cold chain operation costs) and capital investment in cold chain capacity. The vaccine delivery and capital investment in cold chain costs were then combined into a single delivery cost category. deLivery C osts for routine servi Ces inCL ude: huMan resour Ces (national, subnational, district and service levels) CoLd Chain equiPMent and their overheads (installation, energy, maintenance and repairs)deLivery C osts CaMP response) soCiaL Mobi Lization disease survei LLanCe teChni CaL assistanCe (at country level only) Costs refer to immunization-specific costs only and human resources costs for individuals partially dedicated to immunization. Other shared health system costs such as buildings were excluded. Total costs to sustain current gains and to incremental needs to scale up over the next decade were included. Cost projections on a country-by-country basis were developed and aggregated for the categories of vaccines described in Table 2 covering the period 2011-2020. The assumptions and methodology for the baseline cost scenario are summarized below. In addition, low and high scenarios were created. All costs are presented in constant 2010 US$. For each of the vaccine groups included in the analysis, financing flows were projected from three financing sources: (i) Country Governments, (ii) the GAVI Alliance, and (iii) Other Development Partners (i.e. bilateral donors, multilateral agencies and philanthropic agents). While all vaccines are important within the wider scope of the DoVC, the vaccines that have been included in the scope of this analysis are those vaccines that are for use in humans, currently available, and in many cases, widely used, along with newer vaccines that are expected to significantly address the vaccine-preventable disease burden 5 within the 94 countries included in the country scope identified above. In addition to vaccines licensed and available today, the analysis also accounts for the expected introduction of several new vaccines over the course of the decade. Veterinary vaccines and vaccines primarily recommended for therapeutic use (e.g. Rabies vaccines) as well as vaccines predominantly employed outside of resource-poor settings (e.g. Seasonal Flu vaccines) were excluded from the analyses. For the purposes of defining methods and identifying data sources, two (non-mutually exclusive) categories were used to classify the vaccines covered in the analysis: (1) Vaccines delivered via campaigns and associated with Accelerated Disease Control (ADC), Eradication, or Elimination initiatives and (2) Vaccines delivered through routine immunization programs. This categori-zation was helpful since delivery costs differ markedly depending on the delivery strategies (e.g. primarily through in-frequent vaccination campaigns versus the routine vaccination), and the timing and intensity of delivery efforts (that affect costs) differ depending on whether the vaccines/disease were associated with high-level global or regional eradication, elimination or ADC initiatives. The table below summarizes the vaccines/diseases in each of the categories. The vaccination schedule and targeting strategies selected for each of these vaccines was based on global guidance (e.g. from WHO Position Papers, SAGE Guidance). While for pipeline vaccines where such information is often not available, assumptions about the delivery strategy as well as the expected timing of licensure were based on the advice of vaccine development experts particularly from relevant Product Development Partnerships. These were analytical assumption rather than pre-suppositions of guidance and decisions on the part of regulators and individual countries.tabLe 10: vaCCine/d A Measles Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) Rubella Yellow Fever (2) r outine v aCCination PrograMs Cholera (campaign) Conjugated Meningitis A Dengue Hepatitis Human Papilloma Virus Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) Japanese Encephalitis (routine and catch up) Malaria (routine) Measles (1st and 2nd dose) Non-penta Yellow Fever 5 The list of vaccines was drawn from a previous effort undertaken by WHO on behalf of GAVI to characterize vaccines by public health priority.

In the absence of long-term projections for this cost component, recent core cost estimates were projected forward based on the programme forecasts. Operational costs encompass all running costs outside of vaccines and core costs to implement a vaccination campaign. Country-specific operational cost information recorded in comprehensive multi-year immunization plans (cMYPs) were used to generate metrics which were applied to the aforementioned forecasts to project the running costs of all planned campaigns. Finally, contingency funds include the resource needs to procure and manage vaccine stockpiles and monies held in reserve to implement reactive campaigns in the event of disease outbreaks \u2014 These amounts are based on historic needs and taper off over time as it is assumed the ADC, Elimination and Eradication programmes make progress towards their respective goals. These costs were also taken directly from programme plans. (2) Routine Vaccination programmes (a) v aCCine Costs Demand forecasts for traditional routine vaccines already on the market were estimated on a country-by-country basis using existing demand forecasts from WHO, UNICEF as well as GAVI (Strategic Demand Forecast version 4.0 and Adjusted Demand Forecast version 4.0). These demand forecasts were then combined with estimated prices to project the costs of these vaccines and related injection supplies. For GAVI-eligible countries, GAVI-like price forecasts were used on a disease-by-disease basis. For the non-GAVI lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) in the analysis, baseline prices were assumed to be held constant at the same differential between current GAVI prices and PAHO Revolving Fund prices. Using the demand forecasts and price forecasts, the acquisition costs of vaccines and associated supplies were projected. For vaccines still in the pipeline, demand forecasts were developed based on expert input obtained through interviews with Product Development Partnership (PDP) representatives and other external stakeholders familiar with these vaccines under development. Expected acquisition costs for these vaccines were projected by applying these demand forecasts to a projected price per dose for each of the vaccines in this segment. Projecting both the costs of vaccine and injection supplies, and vaccination delivery for each of these programmes over the decade (1) Accelerated Disease Control (ADCs), Elimination and Eradication programs The World Health Organisation (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) lead the implementation of country-level programmes for a variety of disease control, eradication and elimination efforts to combat vaccine-preventable diseases (listed in Table 10 above). These programmes produce plans and forecasts detailing the key activities, and the cost associated with the implementation of these programs. These plans and forecasts have been used as the basis for projecting both the costs of vaccine and injection supplies, and vaccination delivery for each of these programmes over the decade as well as for other critical activities necessary for administering the programs. (a) v aCCine Costs The target populations and planned timing of vaccination campaigns to achieve the relevant disease control, eradication or elimination goals over the course of the decade were taken from the plans as delineated by the programs. These were combined with estimates of current vaccine prices (provided by UNICEF Supply Division) to create forecasts of the vaccine/injection supply costs of these programs. (b) deLivery Costs Delivery costs for the ADC, Eradication and Elimination programmes were separated into core costs incurred primarily by implementing partners to facilitate programs, operational costs to physically deliver vaccines and run the vaccination campaigns and contingency funds in the case of disease outbreaks. Core costs cover critical activities\u2014for example to stimulate demand (Social Mobilization) and to monitor the incidence and prevalence of disease (Surveillance) in affected countries. Core cost projections were also taken at face page 108 Global Vaccine Action Plan Annex 3: Costing and Funding Methodology and Assumptions page 109 values for the remaining 35% of countries for which point estimates were not available. The needs for scaling up were derived from a variety of sources linked to the anticipated coverage projections and how countries have identified priorities, strategies and needs within their cMYPs. The vaccine delivery costs are those that are needed to ensure adequate supply of vaccines through the health system and to store and transport vaccines in a safe and effective manner throughout the entire supply chain and logistics systems of countries (from the national vaccine store to a service delivery point in a health centre or outreach post). In other words, these encompassed all the cold chain costs for storing vaccines (whether the capital equipment or their recurrent overheads) and the logistics of transporting vaccines (whether the vehicles or their recurrent overheads). The WHO global forecast for cold chain and logistics is the basis of the costing for vaccine delivery. The global forecast tool estimates (using the same demand forecast assumptions for vaccines) the on-going needs to maintain the existing cold chain infrastructure in place along with the incremental needs to scale up needs to raise coverage and introduce new vaccines. Incremental capital cold chain costs were analyzed on a country-by-country basis. Total expected volume of vaccines was compared to country-level cold chain capacity. If capacity was projected to exceed country capacity in a given year, incremental cold chain needed was estimated using relevant cost per volume cold chain benchmarks. Due to its unique service delivery, HPV delivery costs were defined on the basis of findings from several pilot demonstration projects as reported by PATH. Countries launched a process to strategically plan for their national immunization programme including estimating the current and future costs required to reach the goals and targets of their programme(b) deLivery Costs Delivery costs include the main components of routine immunization service delivery systems: human resources at all levels of the system and ongoing capacity building (training); the supply chain and logistics systems needed to store and transport vaccines (cold chain equipment, vehicles, transport...), and the cost of programme management (information systems, M&E...), social mobilisation and disease surveillance. The approach to estimate the delivery costs rested on separating those costs for service delivery and those costs for vaccine delivery. The service delivery costs are those that are needed to implement the national immunization programme to deliver the immunization services. Information provided by countries in their cMYPs was the basis of the costing and financing estimates for delivery. Under the auspices of the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS), countries launched a process to strategically plan for their national immunization programme including estimating the current and future costs required to reach the goals and targets of their programme. Based on the wealth of information available for approximately 65% of the countries (58) in scope, a bottom-up costing exercise using a standard ingredients approach to costing was undertaken by countries. From this sample of real data from countries, average unit costs by typology of country was used to impute missing 65%of the countries undertook a bottom- up costing exercise using a standard ingredients approach to costing page 110 Global Vaccine Action Plan Annex 3: Costing and Funding Methodology and Assumptions page 111 Financing projections Financing projections were developed across three main sources: public spending on health from government's own sources, GAVI Alliance funding, and other development partners. These projections were calculated for the vaccines described in Table 10. (i) governMent f LoWs for i MMunization The methodology to project government flows for immunization rested on relying on the available financing data provided by countries in their national multi-year immunization plans (cMYPs). The analysis of this data was the basis of the government financing estimates for both vaccines and systems costs. For countries that did not have cMYP, a methodology of unit financing and typologies was applied in a similar fashion as done on the costing side. For SIAs, typologies were based on population groupings since the per capita investments by governments tend to be lower for midsize/larger countries (i.e. population 10 million) than much smaller countries (i.e. population <10 million)\u2014mainly due to economies of scale that can be leveraged in the former. For government financing for routine vaccination services, rather than using a typology by population groups, the GAVI co-financing groupings were used that stratify countries since these groups provide a proxy of the ability to finance vaccines and immunization. This typology groups countries into Low-Income, Intermediate, Graduating and Non-GAVI. In broad terms the method for projecting government flows involved generating a baseline estimate of government funding for the year 2010 derived from the cMYP data. This baseline estimate was projected forward between 2011 and 2020 based on IMF projections of real GDP growth. The assumption underlying the projection methods is that growth in the health budget of countries will grow at the same rate as economic growth. In other words, the base case funding assumes that governments will continue to provide the same share of the health budget for immunization as they currently do over time\u2014despite the fact that in absolute terms, the amount governments contribute will increase in line with economic growth forecasts.deLivery Costs inCL uded servi su MMary of the aPProaCh to esti Mate the C ost of deLivery huMan resour Ces At all levels of the system PrograMMe ManageMent Including M&E, informationsystems, planning...etc training Training of health care workers and on-going capacity building soCiaL Mobi Lization Activities to stimulate demand for immunization services including IEC, advocacy and communications disease survei LLanCeWHO Global Forecast cold chain forecast at national level.

LiMitationsIn the baseline scenario, no additional government funding was assumed to be available for the mainly new or pipeline vaccines that are not part of the traditional/basic EPI vaccines or those supported by GAVI (e.g. malaria, dengue vaccines) (ii) gavi aLLianCe funding For those vaccines delivered through campaigns and that are part of ADC activities but that are funded by GAVI, (i.e. MenA, yellow fever, rubella), GAVI Alliance funding was assumed to cover the full costs of the vaccines/injection supplies, while for operational costs, it was assumed that GAVI will provide funding at least equivalent to current levels (i.e.US$0.30 per targeted person). For routine GAVI-supported vaccines, GAVI's own financing projection assumptions were applied through 2020 to determine the amount of finances GAVI will provide for New Vaccine Support over the decade. The analysis does not include any GAVI funding that is and might be made available for delivery activities associated with routine vaccination programmes/systems. (iii) o ther deveL oPMent Partner funding For routine programs, country-specific levels of other development partner funding (in a sample of 40 cMYPs that included programs with PCV, pentavalent, and rotavirus vaccines) were used to generate two population-weighted indicators: 1) OD partner financing of vaccines as a share of GHE; and 2) OD partner financing of delivery costs as a share of GHE by two population groups (<100 million and >100 million) using STATA10. Population-weighted averages were applied to each country in the model based on their population group, and multiplied by GHE to project over the period. This method assumes that 2010 levels of other donor support for vaccines and routine program delivery relative to GHE remain constant over time. This represents a baseline level of other donor financing, above which additional other partner financing for new vaccines might be added. Other development partner funding aside from contributions to immunization that occur through GAVI Alliance funding have not been included for the purposes of this analysis. This exercise does not analyse or attempt to approximate the cost of the implementation of the Global Vaccine Action Plan. The analysis described above is only an exercise to determine the vaccine acquisition and service delivery cost and resource availability for increasing coverage of existing vaccines and the introduction of new vaccines over the course of the decade. The costs projections produced from this effort to do not include the agency overhead costs for the implementation and maintenance of the GVAP - there will be additional resources required for this activity. Costs and funding for Research and Development activity are not captured in this analysis. While it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the analysis that was conducted, it is not believed that any of the limitations outlined above will alter the directional nature of the results of this exercise. Costs and funding for Advocacy and Political Support activity are not captured in this analysis. The approach taken for this exercise builds on existing sources of information and global projection of needs generated by different groups (e.g. Polio, Measles, etc) in order to leverage the best data available, when possible. Because of this approach, it is difficult to ensure a consistency in the methods throughout the work, and a complete mitigation of double counting risks. The costs are limited to a priority set of countries although the aspirations of the Decade of Vaccine and GVAP are global.page 114 Global Vaccine Action Plan Title of Section (TK) page 115 Annex 4: Health Impact Methodology and Assumptions Projecting the total impact of vaccination administered between 2011-2020, relative to a no vaccination scenario, for selected vaccines page 116 Global Vaccine Action Plan Annex 4: Health Impact Methodology and Assumptions page 117 grouP vaCCine-PreventabL e diseasevaCCination strategynuMber of future deaths avertednuMber of deaths averted P er 1,000 Persons vaCC inated Original EPI vaccines Measles - 1st dose routine 10.6M 16.5 Measles - 2nd dose routine 0.4M 1.9 Measles - SIA campaign 3.1M 3.5 Hepatitis B routine 5.3-6.0M 8.3 Hib routine 1.4-1.7M 2.6 Pneumococcal routine 1.6-1.8M routine 0.8-0.9M Acampaign routine 0.03M 0.8 Japanese encephalitis campaign & routine 0.07M 0.1 Rubella campaign & routine 0.4M 0.4 TOTAL (2011-2020) 24.6-25.8M a. saMPL e data outPut data shown for persons vaccinated for dov impact scenariob. indiCator Future deaths averted calculated over period of mortality risk in vaccinated cohorts, relative to a no vaccination scenario, for vaccines delivered during the period 2011-2020.foreC ast i MPaCt of vaCC ination adM inistered betWeen 2011-2020 C.

Annex 5: Countries and Organizations that Contributed to the Elaboration of the GVAP page 123page 124 Global Vaccine Action Plan Title of Section (TK) page 125 Annex 6: The Monitoring and Evaluation/ Accountability Framework Background The Monitoring and Evaluation/Accountability Framework is a critically important element of the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP). Recognizing the importance to closely monitor the GVAP implementation progress, the World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution called for annual reports on progress at each Regional Committee meeting and at the WHA, through the WHO Executive Board (EB). page 126 Global Vaccine Action Plan Annex 6: The Monitoring & Evaluation/Accountability Framework page 127 The Accountability Framework for the United Nations (UN) Secretary General's Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health The GVAP calls for leveraging the recommendations of the Commission for Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health and aligning work, wherever possible, with other accountability efforts. The Accountability Framework of the UN Secretary General's Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health refers to a cyclical process of monitoring, review and remedy/action to assess progress, document success, identify problems that need to be rectified and take prompt action as and where needed. This process needs to occur at the country and global levels as illustrated in Figure 1.6 To have a better oversight of progress an independent Expert Review Group (iERG)7 reports annually to the UN Secretary General on the results and resources related to the Global Strategy and on progress in implementation of the Commission's recommendations. The Decade of Vaccines annual report that will be submitted to the WHA will also be shared with the iERG as information for their annual report to the UN Secretary General.figure 1: the aCC ountabi Lity fraMeW ork for the un seCretary generaL 's gLobaL s trategy for Wo Men's and Chi Ldren's heaL th to finaLize a complete set of GVAP indicators with the appropriate methodology and data sources for each indicator defined and baselines established, where required. to invest in improving data quality and developing more robust in-country monitoring and evaluation systems.to seC ure commitments aligned with the GVAP from different stakeholders, including countries, civil society organizations, multilateral agencies, private foundations, development partners, and vaccine manufacturers.to deveL oP a mechanism for coordinating the implementation of these commitments at global, regional and national levels. to ensure annual reporting of progress at each Regional Committee meeting and at the WHA, through the WHO EB. in defining the s CoPe of the M&e/a fraMeW ork, the gvaP refers to the need: 6 Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health.

In addition to the national and global levels, another level of GVAP M&E/A at the regional level is required to accommodate the requirement of reporting annually to the WHO Regional Committees. Using a similar framework allows for complementarity with the accountability process for the UN Secretary General Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health and provides opportunities to leverage and/or use these processes for tracking and reporting on some of the aspects of GVAP. This applies in particular to the process to monitor commitments and resources as described in the related documents for this session. Figure 2 illustrates the proposed GVAP M&E/A Framework process. Guidelines for making immunization commitments under the UN Secretary General Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health framework can be found on each Decade of Vaccines (DoV) Collaboration Leadership Council website. The GVAP M&E/A Framework will be applied to: (1) monitoring results (defined as progress against the GVAP Goals' and Strategic Objectives' indicators); (2) documenting and monitoring stakeholder commitments to GVAP and DoV; (3) tracking resources invested in vaccines and immunization; and (4) inclusion of independent oversight and review of progress, through the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, in the reporting to the governing bodies. A final set of GVAP indicators (see Table 12 and Table 13) was reviewed and approved by SAGE during their 6-8 November 2012 meeting, and will be presented to the WHO EB in January 2013 and the WHA in May 2013.

The report will also be shared with iERG for their women's and children's health annual report to the UN Secretary General. regionaL L eveL: The WHO Regional Offices are developing their mechanisms for review and reporting to the Regional Committees. Regional Technical Advisory Groups on Immunization may take on that role, similar to the SAGE role at the global level. Country L eveL: The National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) and the Interagency Coordination Committees (ICCs) could also assume roles of monitoring commitments and resources at the country level. This will be determined as countries continue to develop their national plans.page 130 Global Vaccine Action Plan No wild poliovirus isolated globally for at least 1 year, in the presence of certification quality AFP surveillance (annual non-polio AFP rate of at least 1/100,000 population < 15 years at national and sub-national level, with adequate stool specimens collected from at least 80% of AFP cases)No wild poliovirus isolated globally for at least 3 years in the presence of certification quality AFP surveillance< 1 NT case/1,000 live births in each district and maintenance of elimination based on annual WHO/UNICEF District Data SpreadsheetNumber of regions with 100% of countries having declared interruption of endemic measles virus transmission for a period of > 12 months in the presence of high quality surveillance The surveillance quality will be assessed as described in criteria for verification of eliminationNumber regions with 100% of countries having declared interruption of endemic rubella virus transmission for a period of > 12 months without occurrence of CRS cases associated with endemic transmission in the presence of high quality surveillance WHO/UNICEF District Data Spreadsheet, and WHO validation report (based on LQA in worst performing district)Each region has a verification commission which annually reviews the status of all countriesEach region has a verification commission which annually reviews the status of all countries 2010 (40 countries still to achieve elimination)2010 (0/5 regions - AMRO, WPRO, AMRO, 2015: 4 WHO regions 2020: 5 WHO regions2015: 2 WHO regions2020: 5 WHO regions 10 countries eliminated NT by 2012; 22 countries eliminated NT by 2013; 36 countries eliminated NT by 2014; 40 countries eliminated NT by 2015Monitor # and % of countries in each region that are verified as having eliminated diseasesMonitor # and % of countries in each region that are verified as having eliminated diseases 2020: 5 WHO regionsNational AFP surveillance systems + supplementary surveillance data where available (environmental surveillance or enterovirus surveillance through national lab networks)Final national documentation on polio-free status submitted by NCCs and accepted by RCCs 2011: 650 WPV-confirmed cases reported from 16 countries2011: National documentation on polio-free status accepted by RCCs in 168 out of 194 WHO member states (87%) 2014 2018 Track number of countries with national documentation of polio-free status, accepted by RCCsoPerationaL definition data sour Ce/CoLLeCtion baseLine target MiLestones1. aChieve a W orLd free of PoLio MyeLitis2.
