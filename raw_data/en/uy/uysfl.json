The first bowls were made from an alloy of various metals and were used already 6000 years ago in the Far East. Tibetan singing bowls area a mysterious acoustic phenomenon, which was discovered by \"spiritual tourists\" in the Himalayas and after the Chinese invasion of Tibet appeared also in Europe and the USA. The sound of Tibetan singing bowls and the gong harmonizes and allows deep relaxation of both sides of the brain. It stimulates stress relief on all levels and the elimination of toxins from the body. After sound therapy emotions are calm and the mind clearer, and the sound vibrations have effect on the body after the singing bowls have been played on it. After sound therapy we are tuned again ... The bowl sings ''ommmmm'', which revives the basic DNA codes and activates the codes that we haven't yet perceived or we had suppressed till now. Tibetan singing bowls are one of the strongest musical instruments for healing with sound therapy and vibrations. They are called singing bowls because their exotic sound continues to float for a long time after we have played on them. Why are these bowls so special? Tibetan bowls are forged with alloys that usually contain from five to seven precious metals, which are connected to the planets of our galaxy: lead (Saturn), tin (Jupiter), iron (Mars), copper (Venus), mercury (Mercury), silver (the Moon) and gold (the Sun). The size of the bowl and the ratio between the metals affect the tone, vibration and quality of sound produced by the bowl. Bowls vary in shapes and looks as they are used for sound therapy in different ways and with different accessories. The most commonly used accessory are the so called \"strikers\", which are used to strike to bowls, or wooden mallets which are rotated around the rim of the bowl. Besides Tibetan bowls, there are also Nepalese, Japanese, Bengalese and crystal bowls - the latter are made out of glass. How does sound affect our body? The sound is undoubtedly one of the most powerful media, as it can take the human spirit in different states of consciousness. Besides their traditional use for meditation, Tibetan singing bowls are used for deep relaxation and muscle regeneration, to relieve pain in the joints, muscles and shoulders, to ease pain related to sciatica, the digestive system, headaches and migraine or spine injuries, to improve circulation, release tensions or blockages, to open the energy flow, eliminate the toxins from the body. When we relax with the sounds of Tibetan bowls or the gong, our concentration improves and our emotional tensions and blockages are eased. The sound with its vibrations can ease mental or emotional pain (low self-esteem, worries, fear, anger, anxiety, depression, insomnia). Tibetan singing bowls and their unique tones are used to stabilise blood pressure, to ease asthma related issues, to renew the functioning of the adrenal gland, to open and stabilise the meridians and to improve the synaptic responses in our brain. They also help children with hyperactive disorders and they stimulate the immune system. Sounds affect all three human levels: the physical, mental and spiritual: The physical effect of vibrations on the body: - deep relaxation and muscle regeneration - pain relief for joints, muscles, sciatica, headache and migraine, the digestive system, headaches and migraine, spine injuries, shoulders, improved blood circulation - better digestion - atoms, molecules, cells, tissues and organs function in a more synchronised way - better energy flow - elimination of toxins from the body - better immune system Mental or emotional effect: - relaxed mind, mental/emotional tensions and blockages are eased - better concentration - inner feelings are activated and released - more energy and strength in everyday life - alleviated mental or emotional pain - improved self-confidence, boosted creative and productive potential Spiritual effect: - a positive feeling of self - better balance and harmony in your life - experiences of bliss - cleansing of chakras (energetic centres and the nadi - astral channels) - a higher frequency reaches our innermost essence, which boosts our energy and our vibrational level - the way to a more intense and higher vibration of love is open Despite the numerous beneficial effects, the sounds of Tibetan singing bowls and the gong are not a replacement for classic healing methods, but just a tool to ignite the spiritual intelligence. Scientific studies have proven that Tibetan singing bowls produce specific waves... Scientific analyses of electromagnetic brainwaves have confirmed the existence of clearly recognisable waves, which are connected to different states of consciousness. It is known that the brain in its normal state, i.e. in everyday conscience, produces beta waves. Alpha waves are present in the states of meditation and calm consciousness. Theta waves are typical for the state of slumber, whereas delta waves are present only during deep sleep. When the waves produced by singing bowls were recorded, scientists discovered wave patterns which were the same as the alpha waves produced by our brain. These waves give a feeling of deep relaxation. The gong, the instrument with the strongest energy ... Sound therapy is one of the quickest and most effective ways to restore harmony and to relax. Any kind of music can be therapeutic, however the gong has the most powerful energy. For millennia sound has been used as a tool to awaken deep states of consciousness, to expand consciousness and to correct energetic imbalances. Recently the ancient Chinese therapy which uses the vibrating sounds of the gong has become available also in Slovenia. Our wellness centres offer sound therapy during your visit to the saunas and swimming pool. The sound of the gong vibrates with the energetic lines of the body and balances them. Kundalini energy is released (the silent energy in the core chakra) and it rises along the central energetic channel along the spine, which can be felt as a subtle tingling in the muscles or as a slight discomfort if there are blockages along the energetic lines. Gong therapy has a beneficial effect also with people who are deaf of have hearing disabilities. Although they don't hear sounds, they can feel their vibrations. "}
