Withrenewed attention on these therapies from researchers and policy makers alike, the well-documented challenges of evaluating their safety and efficacy are once again of globalconcern. Between 2005 and 2018, the World Health Organization conducted a series ofsurveys, in which 88 percent of responding member states confirmed that their biggestchallenge in traditional medicine was the need for technical guidance on research andevaluation. As a first step in pursuing this need, our commentary summarizes thirteeninternational and regional guidance documents by three broad categories on evaluatingsafety, efficacy, and product quality for market-based approval and distribution of thesetreatments. We highlight the paucity of updated international recommendations on thesesubjects and identify gaps that could inform the current evidence base. All availableguidance note the need for evidence surrounding the efficacy of these treatments andpractices but are also quick to caution against methodological difficulties in the conductof such evaluations. Evidence suggests that improved evaluation methods on efficacy andeffectiveness are crucial toward expanding future research into establishing the cost-effectiveness of these therapies, in the context of shifting acceptance, interest, andintegration of traditional medicines into health systems, and as another step towardUniversal Health Coverage. Background Globally, countries are under pressure to develop methods to prevent and treat symptoms of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and a few, like China and India, have indicated the need toconsider traditional medicine as a viable option. Most recently, the General Office of theNational Health and Health Commission of China supported the wider application of aTraditional Chinese herbal medicine treatment program for COVID-19 pneumonia andreleased an update to the regional outbreak treatment guidelines facilitating inclusion ofthese treatments on the frontline ( 1;2). Meanwhile, India has initiated a national-level clinical trial on three herbs to improve immune response ( 3), whereas in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, officials have begun community-level distribution of a herbal concoction that has yet toundergo any evaluations on safety or effectiveness regarding its immunity-boosting claims ( 4). The national Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy(AYUSH), the traditional medicine authority in the country, continues to promote several\"self-care \"prevention tips using herbal remedies for symptoms of COVID-19 and has recently also opened a call for proposals to study possible prophylaxis, although providing little guid-ance on the types of supporting evidence required as a component of these studies. Withrenewed attention on these therapies from researchers and policy makers alike during the cur-rent viral outbreak, the well-documented challenges of evaluating their safety and efficacy areonce again of global concern. In a series of three World Health Organization (WHO) global surveys distributed between 2005 and 2018, 99 of 113 (88 percent) responding member states confirmed that their biggestchallenge in traditional medicine was the need for more technical guidance on research andevaluation relating to the safety ,efficacy , and quality of these treatments ( 5), given that the WHO 's last comprehensive global guidance on these topics was published almost 20 years ago in 2000 ( 6). The increasing demand for research guidance has also been catalyzed by the adoption of the 2009 World Health Assembly resolution (WHA62.13) to encourage theappropriate development of traditional systems of medicine and examine the therapeutic prop-erties of such remedies ( 7). Most recently, in 2019, the inadequacy of evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of Traditional Chinese medicine has been raised in critique of its inclusioninto the 11th revision of the WHO International Code of Disease (WHO-ICD) ( 8), the first instance of formal recognition of these therapies. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266462321000179 Published online by Cambridge University PressTraditional medicine is defined by the WHO as the \"sum total of the knowledge, skill and practices based on the theories, beliefsand experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explica-ble or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the pre-vention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical andmental illness \"(9). Complementary/alternative medicine is a related term for practices that exist but are not indigenous tothe country, and it is often used interchangeably with the termtraditional medicine ( 5). Combined, traditional, and other com- plementary medicines (T&CM) comprise products, practices,and practitioners; products are specific to herbs and herbal mate-rials, whereas examples of practices include medication andprocedure-based therapies, such as herbal medicines, acupunc-ture, chiropractic, osteopathy, yoga, naturopathy, and thermalmedicine ( 9). 171 of 194 (88 percent) WHO member states have acknowledged the formal use of T&CM within their healthsystems ( 5), establishing offices, national policies, laws, and regu- lations for T&CM uptake. At the same time, these therapies havebeen variably conceptualized, defined, and categorized in terms oftheir integration within the health system, service delivery, andconsumer levels ( 10). In this commentary, we put together insights from peer- reviewed articles, gray literature sources, as well as regional andinternational guidance on the evaluation of herbal products andT&CM practices specifically enlisted for market-based approvaland distribution, These are active guidance still endorsed byand published on the Web sites of organizations (e.g., WHO, EU). We also highlight the paucity of updated international guid- ance and identify gaps that could help inform and contributeto the current evidence base for an increased uptake of thesetherapies in future.Safety Evaluation Across thirteen guidelines (see Table 1 for the list of documents), a central guiding principle on evaluating the safety of T&CM isthe distinction in evidence requirements between long-standinguse of these medicines for generations, as compared to those con-sidered more recent. Herbal medicines of widespread use areexempt from providing additional safety evidence for marketapproval ( 11). Although global guidance defines \"traditional use\"to indicate those used over a long period with no demonstra- ble harm, regional guidance specifies certain market-based regu-latory criteria such as length of use, individual productcomponents, and other categories to define these drugs ( 6;11- 17). For instance, in the European Union (EU), a product quali- fies as \"traditional use \"if it has been used for at least 30 years, including at least 15 years within the EU ( 11). That said, even in cases where drugs have been used over a long period, chronic toxicological risks may have occurred butnot recognized, raising concerns regarding safety evaluations ofsuch treatments. The 2000 guidance outlines specific conditionswhere new safety evidence is required such as in cases whereunrecognized chronic toxicology risks are likely, even in estab-lished, long-term use drugs, and also emphasizes the need forconsistent monitoring of side-effects in line with normal pharma-covigilance practices ( 6;12;14;15;18). In guidelines applicable to member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN), four types of products require evidence to substantiate their safety: (i) products with new ingredients, (ii) products with ingredients derived from new methods of purification, extraction,or manufacturing, (iii) existing products with new combinations,new dosage, new method of delivery, or new indication, and (iv) Table 1.

Across these guidelines, standard methods of nonclinical toxicological studies toassess safety include carcinogenicity tests as well as a broadumbrella of toxicological studies such as immunotoxicity (e.g.,tests for allergic reactions), genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity,and others to measure specific, acute, chronic, and long-term tox-icity, as suggested by the WHO 's global guidance in 1993 and 2000. In 2004, the WHO further proposed the inclusion of herbal medicines into its existing WHO International DrugMonitoring Programme, a pharmacovigilance initiative estab-lished in the 1970s for exchanging safety information amongmember states and maintaining the global WHO database ofadverse drug reaction (ADR) reports ( 20). A licensed T&CM product undergoes similar postmarketing safety monitoring asall other drugs in Western medicine. For countries in theOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD), the establishment of safety standards for componentchemicals in T&CM products in accordance with OECD testguidelines and principles of good laboratory practices allowsacceptance of these results by all members under the OECDMutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) system ( 15). Similar regional harmonization methods can be observed in the set of ten guide-lines developed for the ASEAN region; for example, establishingnegative lists for substances and limits on contaminants in herbalmedicine as well as recommendations for member states to ensurethe availability of postmarket surveillance to handle early signalsof adverse drug events and/or product safety issues ( 21). National monographs or pharmacopoeias alongside good manu- facturing practices for countries/regions also aid evaluations ofsafety using shared frameworks as in the Western Pacific regionas well as the EU ( 16;22). To assess the safety of T&CM practice and procedure-based therapies, effective measures include ensuring that equipment inuse is of good quality and practitioners have sound theoreticaland practical training. To maintain both efficacy and safety inT&CM practices, some countries such as China and HongKong have professional licensing bodies that require the comple-tion of an exam in order to be a registered practitioner. InSingapore and Thailand, licensing bodies for different T&CMpractices and procedures approve recognized international accred-itations and undergraduate degrees in T&CM from local institu-tions ( 5). In both high- and low-income countries, T&CM practitioners are required to complete professional trainings andprograms, with countries in North America, India, Republic ofKorea, and Vietnam mandating that T&CM practitioners mustbe university graduates ( 5). However, in many lower-income countries, traditional medicine practices are passed on intergen-erationally viainformal channels, which is a challenge in ensuring uniform patient safety, despite existing guidelines ( 7). Specifically, the lack of evidence concerning adverse effects from procedure-based therapies is well recognized, calling for amore systematic approach to record these and develop specificguidelines for the safe conduct of these procedures ( 6;23). All guidelines indicate that the primary source of evidence regarding drug safety can be obtained from published datasources, such as peer-reviewed scientific literature, with a focuson conducting independent trials in cases where possible andmandated, such as \"stand-alone applications \"in the EU that require safety data to be supplemented with data from indepen-dent studies conducted by the company seeking approval(6;14;17;20;24). Similarly, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also stipulates the need for all productsfiling for commercialization to provide evidence of a history of safe use; other evidence including clinical testing, animal testing,or both; or some combination of history of use and other evidenceof safety ( 14). However, support for conducting tests in vivo (in live specimens) by the FDA is in contrast to WHO guidelines,which give preference to in vitro techniques (outside of live spec- imens) ( 6). Other accepted sources of evidence include reports from authoritative bodies, data on food or nutrient composi-tion/consumption, as well as case reports of serious ADR andmust be shown to be weighed against appropriate additionalpotential benefit ( 13;14;21). Many of these safety guidelines for products and practices are integrated into regional and national regulatory processes, whereinadequate compliance to safety reporting and monitoring stan-dards implicates approval being refused or re-evaluated. In2018, the AYUSH Ministry in India released the first edition ofguidelines for safety and toxicity evaluations of traditional drugformulations drawing from international guidance on the topicsfrom the WHO, the OECD, and the US FDA, among others(25). A Web portal for pharmacovigilance of Ayurvedic formula- tions, \"AyushSuraksha, \"has also been set up for consumers to confidentially log any ADRs from these drugs. However, this isnot available for T&CM practices such as yoga and naturopathyand is limited to drugs alone. Efficacy Evaluation Guidance on efficacy assessment frequently emphasizes the need for different considerations to that of conventional medicinebecause T&CM has to be evaluated in an integrated manner, tak-ing into account its holistic practice and approach, as well as keep-ing in mind the varying methods of individual practice andcultural background of the user ( 6;25). For instance, many herbal remedies consist of a combination of several active ingredients,and the assessment should differentiate between old and newcombination products ( 6;12;24 ). The WHO views well- established, randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) as the highest level of evidence for efficacy in its 1993 and 2000 guide-lines ( 6;12). An explanation of a new combination of well-known substances, including effective dose ranges and compatibility, isrequired in addition to documentation of traditional knowledgeof single ingredients ( 6;24). Clinical studies are required to justify the efficacy of each new ingredient and its positive effect on thetotal combination, as well as facilitate the acceptance of herbalmedicines in different regions and in people with different culturaltraditions. However, in cases of T&CM treatment of minor disor-ders, nonserious indications, and in use as prophylaxis, efficacycan be adequately evaluated using observational studies ( 6). Where traditional use of a specific herb in a country or region has not been established, additional evidence on clinical efficacy isrequired. More specific to countries in the EU, traditional herbalmedicinal products that satisfy the criteria of \"traditional use \"do not require clinical trials on efficacy ( 11;18;24). If the product meets the conditions of \"well-established use \"(active substances that have been in medicinal use in the EU for at least 10 years),registration should include strong evidence in scientific literatureestablishing the efficacy of active substances. Candidates for bothtypes can refer to the EU Herbal Monographs for establishedmedicinal products/active substances of the committee approvedlevel of safety and efficacy ( 18;22).\"Stand-alone applications \" require clinical data on efficacy to be supplemented by the com-pany seeking approval, using their own studies. Key elements ofInternational Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care 3 https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266462321000179 Published online by Cambridge University Pressclinical data include a combination of: systematic reviews, critical assessment of clinical data for credibility and methodologicalrigor, clinical data reports that meet reporting standards, assess-ment of clinical relevance of putative efficacy, and at least one con- trolled clinical study of good quality as evidence of efficacy ( 22). In assessing the efficacy of traditional procedure-based thera- pies and practice, researchers should consider the holistic contri-bution of practitioner proficiency and equipment quality, which isoften impacted by varying standards of manufacturing quality.This may explain reports of disparity or inconsistency in results,even though the methodologies in different studies have beenequally sound ( 5). Clinical trials are key in efficacy evaluations of traditional procedure-based therapies. The general principles and requirements for conventional drugs [e.g., the WHO 's Good Clinical Research Practice (GCP) Protocols] ( 26) should still apply to new herbal medicines, or new indications, dosage, or the method of administration forexisting medicines. Trials involving human subjects should beconducted in accordance with international ethical guidelinesfor biomedical research, for example, the Declaration ofHelsinki by the World Medical Association ( 12). Product Quality Evaluation Quality evaluation guidance by the WHO and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) focuses on the quality aspects of natu-ral herbal medicinal products in the market, which excludes anyproduct containing chemically isolated constituents or mixtures(12;27). Within this scope, reliability of the identity and quality of plant material and preparation should be ensured by stipulatinghow to identify, label, collect, and process the herbal material, aswell as checks for authenticity and purity ( 12). In preparation of the material for manufacturing, guidance documents define qual-itative and quantitative specifications of active ingredients, adescription of the method of preparation, control tests of startingmaterials, manufacturing, and stability tests. The European set ofguidelines should be read in conjunction with the EU 's Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for Medicinal Products, Volume4, Rules Governing Medicinal Products, and all GMP recommen-dations should be followed ( 27). Discussion of quality assurance or evaluation does not extend beyond the scope of herbal medi-cine and products in the literature. In Thailand, Indonesia, andIndia, GMP regulatory mechanisms for T&CM drugs are consid-ered different from those for conventional pharmaceutical drugsdue to the nature of the raw materials involved. They undergo reg-ular inspections and government-authorized laboratory tests andrequire safety and toxicity assessments, among other regional stip-ulations, before registration and are governed by special clauses under the Drug legislations ( 5). In contrast, in countries like Sri Lanka, Republic of Korea, Myanmar and Nepal, these drugs aretreated the same as pharmaceuticals in their registration processes,and some countries like Nepal have yet to follow GMP as well ( 5). Gaps in Current Guidance on T&CM Evaluation A significant finding is the absence of an updated global guidance on the evaluation of T&CM; the last comprehensive guidancefrom the WHO on this topic dates back two decades, althoughother regional resources on the subject have since been developed.This is key in setting the direction for research, regulation, andpolicy mechanisms, both internationally and regionally, as theWHO plays a key advisory role in the development of nationaland regional guidance documents. For instance, the WHO African Region emphasizes the role of national governments inestablishing formal safety standards for T&CM in consultationwith WHO protocols on these subjects ( 17). In further recogni- tion of the importance of international guidance, we also identifychallenges and gaps in the evidence base for T&CM, suggestingthat improved standardized methods and data on efficacy andeffectiveness are crucial in expanding future research into estab-lishing cost-effectiveness of these therapies. Effectiveness All available guidance notes the need for evidence surrounding the efficacy of these treatments and practices but are also quickto caution against methodological difficulties in evaluation. Forexample, RCTs could be challenging on technical and ethicalfronts. Placebo control is difficult when herbal medicines have astrong flavor \u2014sometimes low dosages of the same herbal medi- cine of similar color, taste, and weight must be used as a control(6). Sham acupuncture interventions used as placebo are often not disclosed to participants ( 23), and such deceptive practices do not correspond to ethical standards for clinical research. Moreover, asthe duration of clinical research studies is usually short, RCTs canreveal only the short- and mid-term clinical efficacy of interven-tions, whereas the effectiveness of T&CM techniques typicallymanifests over the long term ( 28). In a review focusing on Traditional Chinese medicine from 2019, Yang et al. ( 28) suggest that systematic and standardized eval- uation indicators based on basic theories such as the Concept ofHolism, Yin-Yang, and Meridian have not yet been established.Traditionally, clinical efficacy evaluation of Traditional Chinesemedicine techniques is based on biochemical examination indica-tors and some subjective observation indicators. According to theauthors, its working principle and multiple-link comprehensiveeffect are difficult to accurately evaluate by existing research meth-ods ( 28), and RCT findings cannot objectively reflect the clinical value of Traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment. These problems point to whether measuring effectiveness would better suit the concept of T&CM. Effectiveness refers tothe benefit of using a technology, program, or intervention toaddress a specific problem under general or routine clinical con-ditions, rather than under controlled conditions in an RCT ( 29). Guidance on effectiveness evaluations is rather limited.Observational studies involving large numbers of patients couldbe a valuable tool for the evaluation of herbal medicines and itseffectiveness over the long term, alongside other study designssuch as single-case design and black-box design ( 6), but there are no frameworks for adapting these to T&CM. There is no uni-versally valid method for grading observational studies, but a listof categories has been offered by the WHO, notably cohort (lon-gitudinal) studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies,uncontrolled case series or cohort studies, and time-series studies(6). Studying the effectiveness of T&CM is particularly challeng- ing as they are often combined with Western medicine treatmentsin clinical scenarios, and the true effects of traditional medicinetreatments are difficult to measure ( 28). As such, studies that attempt to provide evidence for either efficacy or effectivenessof T&CM will have to mitigate the issues of confounding, blind-ing, and randomization. In an attempt to recognize and addressthese evaluation challenges, Liu et al. ( 30) have developed guide- lines on using different types of research methods for evaluatingthe therapeutic effect of Traditional Chinese medicine, including 4 Lydia Wenxin Lin et al . https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266462321000179 Published online by Cambridge University Pressa variety of clinical trial -based techniques; these hold valuable insights for other T&CM as well. Examples include pragmaticclinical trials that are closer to the real-world conditions but retainthe elements of randomization essential to comparative effective-ness research ( 30). Cost-Effectiveness Essential medicines are defined as those that satisfy priority healthcare needs of the population, and the inclusion of T&CMin the lists of countries 'national essential medicines (NEML) sig- nals strong public recognition for these treatments. Thirty-fourWHO member states (10 in Asia) have herbal medicines ontheir NEML ( 5). Additionally, several governments provide national insurance coverage for T&CM, including Bhutan,where full coverage is available for gSo-ba Rig-pa (traditionalBhutanese medicine). In China, government and commercialinsurance (both state-owned and private insurance companies)cover indigenous traditional medicine but only part-coverT&CM practices of acupuncture, herbal medicines, osteopathy,and Traditional Chinese medicine. Thailand includes herbal med-icines in its national list of essential medicines and T&CM ser-vices are reimbursed by public insurance as of 2018 ( 5). In countries that now provide partial coverage, such as Japan,Korea, and others in the Western Pacific, there is an impetus toconduct cost-effective analyses for T&CM that have proven safetyand efficacy (a process more generally known as health technol-ogy assessments or HTA), as a means to formalize their coveragethrough national insurance schemes ( 16). In theory, T&CM appear cost-effective and good candidates for HTA as studied under a payer or societal perspective because of their impact on national budgets, especially in countries where they are subsidized for large populations; avoid technology; offerinexpensive remedies; and harness the power of the body 's natural ability to heal itself ( 27). They are also likely to be the most easily available options for remote populations ( 10). HTAs of specific therapies [e.g., acupuncture ( 28)] have been previously conducted, but there is, to our knowledge, no organized framework or theadaptation of economic evaluation methods to the unique featuresof T&CM. The collection of costs and patient-reported/health-related quality-of-life outcomes remains uncommon in T&CMevaluation, despite their impacts on national budgets, as theyare heavily subsidized for populations. Conclusion Globally, many countries and regions have established regulatory systems for T&CM as well as networks and initiatives for cooper-ation between member states to develop, share, and adopt regula-tory standards as can be seen from guidelines in the EU, OECD,US FDA, ASEAN as well as overarching guidance from the WHO(6;12-15). Africa and the Western Pacific have also shown thought leadership, with frameworks, tools, and concrete objec-tives for integration of T&CM into their health systems ( 17). Specifically, Asia shows great promise for uptake of these productsand procedures as affordable, available, and accessible medicalcare on the path to Universal Health Coverage (UHC), especiallythrough primary health systems. China, Japan, Thailand, and theRepublic of Korea have stringent regulation and integration ofthese treatments into their health systems; Malaysia andCambodia too are in the process of developing similar ones(10;16). Twelve WHO member states, eleven of whom werefrom the global South, affirmed that they were using public or government research funding toward T&CM ( 5). As we write this commentary, the interest in traditional medic- inal products as a potential supplement or alternative to Westernmedicine is strong, as has been witnessed during this pandemicoutbreak; however, global guidance lags behind the demand forit (6). In this context, we highlight some of the pertinent chal- lenges that future guidance should explicitly make recommenda-tions on, which include: (i) the lack of a system to evaluate efficacyand effectiveness that is based on T&CM concepts, (ii) technicalproblems with studies (placebo control is difficult when herbalmedicines have a strong flavor; difficulties blinding practitioners;variation in practitioner skill) ( 6), and (iii) confounding issues, for example where T&CM treatments combine multiple T&CMproducts, practices, practitioners; and often also combined withWestern medicine in clinical scenarios, making the true effectof T&CM treatments difficult to measure. We recognize thatour commentary has been limited to the content of all guidancedocuments in effect and is unable to account for the adherenceor application of the same guidance in practice. It is also restrictedto documents available in the English language up until May 2020for a topic such as this that demands a broader Asian perspective,although several of our English sources from the ASEAN, theWHO, and peer-reviewed articles had considered country-levelsafety, quality, and efficacy evaluation requirements for marketentry in many of the Asian countries for T&CM products. Inaddition, the ubiquitous nature of T&CM as a system of healing has ancient origins with treatments and practices extensively con- ducted at the individual, household, or community levels. Home-or community-based remedies offer great potential as a method ofaccessible, affordable, and available care; however, their means ofdistribution and practice have not been included and, therefore,offer a crucial opportunity for future research. The shift since 2000 in global acceptance and integration of T&CM into health systems also raises questions on how to eval-uate their new and important aspects, including effectiveness andcost-effectiveness. One of the most significant policy-level deci-sions for governments has been whether to include traditionalmedicines into a scheme of UHC, and if accepted, what this deci-sion would look like in practice ( 16). Forty-five of the WHO member states currently have health insurance coverage for tradi-tional medicine and T&CM practices (e.g., acupuncture and chi-ropractic) that are provided by the government and/or privatesectors ( 5). In many cases, this coverage is partial and is specifically designed to regional conditions; for instance touching only specificareas such as acupuncture, chiropractic, and herbal medicine or, inother cases, is only specific to government-approved products andpractices as in the Western Pacific region ( 16). Should countries want to take a step in the direction of UHC for traditional medi-cines, evidence-based assessment of its budget impact and valuefor money will become a matter of growing importance. Keeping these current challenges in mind, future research must focus on developing better frameworks for evaluating T&CM. Suchguidance must align with incentives for compliance in order toobtain regulatory approval and/or reimbursement. Given thetrend of supranational monitoring and current interest and devel-opment of these products and practices in Asia, the region offerswide opportunities to systematically study these treatments in detailand for evidence-informed policymaking in T&CM.
