This list may be amended by the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission. The latter shall consult the Scientif ic and Technical Committ ee established under Article 134. Article 5 For purposes of coordinating and com plementing researc h under taken in Member States, the Commission shall, either by a specif ic request addressed to a given recipient and conveyed to the government concer ned, or by a general published request, call upon Member States, persons or under takings to communicate to it their programmes relating to the researc h whic h it specif ies in the request. After giving those concer ned full oppor tunity to comment, the Commission may deliver a reasoned opinion on each of the programmes communicated to it. The Commission shall deliver such an opinion if the State, person or under taking whic h has communicat ed the programme so requests. By such opinions the Commission shall discourag e unnecessar y duplication and shall direct researc h towards sectors whic h are insuff iciently explored. The Commission may not publish these programmes without the consent of the State, person or under taking whic h has communicated them. The Commission shall publish at regular inter vals a list of those secto rs of nuclear researc h whic h it considers to be insuff iciently explored. The Commission may bring toget her representatives of public and private researc h centres as well as any exper ts engaged in researc h in the same or relate d fields for mutual consultation and exchang es of information. 7.6.2016 C 203/7 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN Article 6 To encourag e the carrying out of researc h programmes communicat ed to it the Commission may: (a) provide financial assistance within the framew ork of researc h contracts, without, however , offering subsidies; (b) supply , either free of charg e or against payment, for carrying out such programmes, any source mat erials or special fissile mat erials whic h it has available; (c) place installations, equipment or exper t assistance at the disposal of Member States, persons or under takings, either free of charg e or against payment ; (d) promot e joint financing by the Member States, persons or under takings concer ned. Article 7 Community researc h and training programmes shall be deter mined by the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, whic h shall consult the Scientifi c and Technical Committ ee. These programmes shall be drawn up for a period of not more than five years. The funds required for carrying out these programmes shall be included each year in the researc h and investment budg et of the Community . The Commission shall ensure that these programmes are carried out and shall submit an annual repor t thereon to the Council. The Commission shall keep the Economic and Social Committ ee informed of the broad outlines of Community researc h and training programmes. Article 8 1. After consulting the Scientif ic and Technical Committ ee, the Commission shall establish a Joint Nuclear Researc h Centre. This Centre shall ensure that the researc h programmes and other task s assigned to it by the Commission are carried out. It shall also ensure that a unif orm nuclear terminology and a standard system of measurements are established. 7.6.2016 C 203/8 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN It shall set up a central bureau for nuclear measurements. 2. The activities of the Centre may, for geographical or functional reasons, be carried out in separat e establishments. Article 9 1. After obtaining the opinion of the Economic and Social Committ ee the Commission may, within the framew ork of the Joint Nuclear Researc h Centre, set up schools for the training of specialists, particularly in the fields of prospecting for minerals, the production of high purity nuclear mat erials, the processing of irradiated fuels, nuclear engineer ing, health and safety and the production and use of radioisot opes. The Commission shall deter mine the details of such training. 2. An institution of university status shall be established; the way in whic h it will function shall be deter mined by the Council, acting by a qualif ied majority on a proposal from the Commission. Article 10 The Commission may, by contract, entr ust the carrying out of certain parts of the Community researc h programme to Member States, persons or under takings, or to third countr ies, international orga nisations or nationals of third countr ies. Article 11 The Commission shall publish the researc h programmes referred to in Articles 7, 8 and 10, and also regular progress repor ts on their implementation. CHAPTER 2 Dissemination of information Section 1 Information over which the Community has power of disposal Article 12 Member States, persons or under takings shall have the right, on application to the Commission, to obtain non exclusive licences under patents, provisionally prot ected patent rights, utility models or patent applications owned by the Community , where they are able to make effective use of the inventions covered thereb y. Under the same conditions, the Commission shall grant sublicences under patents, provisionally protec ted patent rights, utility models or patent applications, where the Community holds contractual licences conf erring power to do so. 7.6.2016 C 203/9 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN The Commission shall grant such licences or sublicences on terms to be agreed with the licensees and shall furnish all the information required for their use. These terms shall relat e in particular to suitable remuneration and, where appropr iate, to the right of the licensee to grant sublicences to third parties and to the oblig ation to treat the information as a trade secret. Faili ng agreement on the terms referred to in the third paragraph, the licensees may bring the matt er before the Cour t of Justice of the European Union so that appropr iate terms may be fixed. Article 13 The Commission shall communicat e to Member States, persons and under takings information acquired by the Community whic h is not covered by the provisions of Article 12, whether such information is derived from its own researc h programme or communicated to the Commission with author ity to mak e free use of it. The Commission may, however , mak e the disclosure of such information conditional on its being treated as conf idential and not passed on to third parties. The Commission may not disclose information whic h has been acquired subject to restr ictions on its use or dissemination such as information known as classifi ed information unless it ensures com pliance with these restr ictions. Section 2 Other information (a)Dissemination by amicable agreement Article 14 The Commission shall endea vour, by amicable agreement, to secure both the communication of information whic h is of use to the Community in the attainment of its objectives and the granting of licences under patents, provisionally prot ected patent rights, utility models or patent applications covering such information. Article 15 The Commission shall establish a procedure by whic h Member States, persons and under takings may use it as an inter mediar y for exchanging provisional or final results of their researc h, insof ar as these results have not been acquired by the Community under researc h contracts awarded by the Commission. 7.6.2016 C 203/10 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN This procedure must be such as to ensure the conf idential nature of the exchang e. The results communicated may, however , be transmitt ed by the Commission to the Joint Nuclear Researc h Centre for documentation purposes; this shall not entail any right of use to whic h the communi \u00ad cating party has not agreed. (b) Compulsor y communication to the Commission Article 16 1. As soon as an application for a patent or a utility model relating to a specif ically nuclear subject is filed with a Member State, that State shall ask the applicant to agree that the content s of the application be communicat ed to the Commission forthwith. If the applicant agrees, this communication shall be made within three months of the date of filing the application. If the applicant does not agree, the Member State shall, within the same period, notify the Commission of the exist ence of the application. The Commission may require a Member State to communicate the content s of an application of whose exist ence it has been notifi ed. The Commission shall mak e any such request within two months of the date of notifi cation. Any extensi on of this period shall entail a corresponding extension of the period referred to in the sixth subparagraph of this paragraph. On receiving such a request from the Commission, the Member State shall again ask the applicant to agree to communication of the cont ents of the application. If the applicant agrees, communi \u00ad cation shall be made forthwith. If the applicant does not agree, the Member State shall never theless be required to make this communication to the Commission within 18 months of the date on whic h the application was filed. 2. Member States shall inform the Commission, within 18 months of the filing date, of the exist ence of any as yet unpublished application for a patent or utility model whic h seems to them, prima facie, to deal with a subject whic h, although not specifi cally nuclear , is directly connect ed with and essential to the development of nuclear energy in the Community . If the Commission so requests, the content s of the application shall be communicated to it within two months. 3. In order that publication may take place as soon as possible, Member States shall reduce to a minimum the time taken to process applications for patents or utility models relating to subjects referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 concer ning whic h a request has been made by the Commission. 7.6.2016 C 203/11 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN 4. The Commission shall treat the abovementioned communications as conf idential. They may only be made for documentation purposes. The Commission may, however , mak e use of the inventions communicat ed to it, either with the consent of the applicant or in accordance with Articles 17 to 23. 5. The provisions of this Article shall not apply when an agreement concluded with a third State or an international orga nisation precludes communication. (c)Grant of licences by arbitration or under compulsor y powers Article 17 1. Failing amicable agreement, non exclusive licences may be granted either by arbitration or under com pulsor y powers in accordance with Articles 18 to 23: (a) to the Community or to Joint Under takings accorded this right under Article 48 in respect of patents, provisionally prot ected patent rights or utility models relating to inventions directly connect ed with nuclear researc h, where the granting of such licences is necessar y for the continuance of their own researc h or indispensable to the operation of their installations. If the Commission so requests, such licences shall include the right to author ise third parties to mak e use of the invention, where they are carrying out work for or orders placed by the Community or Joint Under takings; (b) to persons or under takings whic h have applied to the Commission for them in respect of patents, provisionally prot ected patent rights or utility models relating to inventions directly connect ed with and essential to the development of nuclear energy in the Community , provided that all the following conditions are fulfi lled: (i) at least four years have elapsed since the filing of the patent application, save in the case of an invention relating to a specif ically nuclear subject ; (ii) the requirements arising out of the development of nuclear energy , in the Commission's concep tion of such development, in the territory of a Member State where an invention is prot ected, are not being met with rega rd to that invention; (iii) the propr ietor , having been called upon to meet such requirements either himself or through his licensees, has not com plied with this request ; (iv) the persons or under takings applying for licences are in a position to meet such requirements effectively by making use of the invention. 7.6.2016 C 203/12 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN Member States may not, in order to meet such requirements, take any coercive measures provided for in their national legislation whic h will limit the prot ection accorded to the invention, save at the prior request of the Commission. 2. A non exclusiv e licence may not be grant ed as provided for in paragraph 1 where the propr ietor can establish the exist ence of legitimat e reasons, in particular that he has not had sufficient time at his disposal. 3. The granting of a licence pursuant to paragraph 1 shall confer a right to full com pensation, the amount of whic h shall be agreed between the propr ietor of the patent, provisionally prot ected patent right or utility model and the licensee. 4. The provisions of this Article shall not affect those of the Paris Con vention for the Prot ection of Industr ial Proper ty. Article 18 An Arbitration Committ ee is hereb y established for the purposes provided for in this Section. The Council shall appoint the members and lay down the Rules of Procedure of this Committ ee, acting on a proposal from the Cour t of Justice of the European Union. An appeal, having suspensor y effect, may be brought by the parties before the Cour t of Justice of the European Union against a decision of the Arbitration Committ ee within one month of notif ication thereof. The Cour t of Justice of the European Union shall conf ine its examination to the formal validity of the decision and to the inter pretation of the provisions of this Treaty by the Arbitration Committ ee. The final decisions of the Arbitration Committ ee shall have the force of res judicata between the parties concer ned. They shall be enforceable as provided in Article 164. Article 19 Where, failing amicable agreement, the Commission intend s to secure the granting of licences in one of the cases provided for in Article 17, it shall give notice of its inten tion to the propr ietor of the patent, provisionally prot ected patent right, utility model or patent application, and shall specify in such notice the name of the applicant for and the scope of the licence. Article 20 The propr ietor may, within one month of receip t of the notice referred to in Article 19, propose to the Commission and, where appropr iate, to the applicant that they conclude a special agreement to refer the matt er to the Arbitration Committ ee. Should the Commission or the applicant refuse to enter into such an agreement, the Commission shall not require the Member State or its appropr iate author ities to grant the licence or cause it to be granted . 7.6.2016 C 203/13 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN If, when the matt er is referred to it under a special agreement, the Arbitration Committ ee finds that the request from the Commission com plies with the provisions of Article 17, it shall give a reasoned decision containing a grant of the licence to the applicant and laying down the terms of the licence and the remuneration theref or, to the extent that the parties have not reac hed agreement on these points. Article 21 If the propr ietor does not propose that the matt er be referred to the Arbitration Committ ee, the Commission may call upon the Member State concer ned or its appropr iate author ities to grant the licence or cause it to be grant ed. If, having heard the propr ietor's case, the Member State, or its appropr iate author ities, considers that the conditions of Article 17 have not been com plied with, it shall notify the Commission of its refusal to grant the licence or to cause it to be grant ed. If it refuses to grant the licence or to cause it to be grant ed, or if, within four months of the date of the request, no information is forthcoming with regard to the granting of the licence, the Commission shall have two months in whic h to bring the matt er before the Cour t of Justice of the European Union. The propr ietor must be heard in the proceedings before the Cour t of Justice of the European Union. If the judgment of the Cour t of Justice of the European Union establishes that the conditions of Article 17 have been com plied with, the Member State concer ned, or its appropr iate author ities, shall take such measures as enforcement of that judgment may require. Article 22 1. If the propr ietor of the patent, provisionally prot ected patent right or utility model and the licensee fail to agree on the amount of com pensation, the parties concer ned may conclude a special agreement to refer the matt er to the Arbitration Committ ee. By doing so, the parties waive the right to institut e any proceedings other than those provided for in Article 18. 2. If the licensee refuses to conclude a special agreement, the licence he has been granted shall be deemed void. If the propr ietor refuses to conclude a special agreement, the com pensation referred to in this Article shall be deter mined by the appropr iate national author ities. 7.6.2016 C 203/14 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN Article 23 After the lapse of one year, the decisions of the Arbitration Committ ee or the appropr iate national author ities may, if there are new facts to justify it, be revised with respect to the terms of the licence. Such revision shall be a matt er for the body whic h gave the decision. Section 3 Secur ity provisions Article 24 Information whic h the Community acquires as a result of carrying out its researc h programme, and the disclosure of whic h is liable to harm the defence interests of one or more Member States, shall be subject to a secur ity system in accordance with the following provisions. 1. The Council shall, acting on a proposal from the Commission, adopt secur ity regulations whic h, account being taken of the provisions of this Article, lay down the various secur ity gradings to be applied and the secur ity measures appropr iate to each grading. 2. Where the Commission considers that the disclosure of certain information is liable to harm the defence interests of one or more Member States, it shall provisionally apply to that information the secur ity grading required in that case by the secur ity regulations. It shall communicate such information forthwith to the Member States, whic h shall provisionally ensure its secur ity in the same manner . Member States shall inform the Commission within three months whether they wish to maintain the grading provisionally applied, substitut e another or declassify the information. Upon the expir y of this period, the highest grading of those request ed shall be applied. The Commission shall notify the Member States according ly. At the request of the Commission or of a Member State, the Council may, acting unanimously , at any time apply another grading or declassify the information. The Council shall obtain the opinion of the Commission before taking any action on a request from a Member State. 7.6.2016 C 203/15 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN 3. The provisions of Articles 12 and 13 shall not apply to information subject to a secur ity grading. Never theless, provided that the appropr iate secur ity measures are obser ved, (a) the information referred to in Articles 12 and 13 may be communicat ed by the Commission: (i) to a Joint Under taking; (ii) to a person or under taking other than a Joint Under taking, through the Member State in whose territory that person or under taking operat es; (b) the information referred to in Article 13 may be communicated by a Member State to a person or to an under taking other than a Joint Under taking, operating in the territory of that State, provided that the Commission is notifi ed of this communication; (c) each Member State has, however , the right to require the Commission to grant a licence under Article 12 to meet the needs of that State or those of a person or under taking operating in its territory. Article 25 1. A Member State notifying the exist ence or communicating the content s of an application for a patent or utility model relating to a subject specif ied in Article 16(1) or (2) shall, where appropr iate, draw attention to the need to apply a given secur ity grading for defence reasons, at the same time stating the probable duration of such grading. The Commission shall pass on to the other Member States all communications received in accordance with the preceding subparagraph. The Commission and the Member States shall take those measures whic h, under the secur ity regulations, correspond to the grading required by the State of origin. 2. The Commission may also pass on these communications to Joint Under takings or, through a Member State, to a person or to an under taking other than a Joint Under taking operating in the territory of that State. Invent ions whic h are the subject of applications referred to in paragraph 1 may be used only with the consent of the applicant or in accordance with Articles 17 to 23. 7.6.2016 C 203/16 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN The communications and, where appropr iate, the use referred to in this paragraph shall be subject to the measures whic h, under the secur ity regulations, correspond to the secur ity grading required by the State of origin. The communications shall in all cases be subject to the consent of the State of origin. Consent to communication and use may be withheld only for defence reasons. 3. At the request of the Commission or of a Member State, the Council may, acting unanimously , at any time apply another grading or declassify the information. The Council shall obtain the opinion of the Commission before taking any action on a request from a Member State. Article 26 1. Where information covered by patents, patent applications, provisionally prot ected patent rights, utility models or applications for utility models has been classif ied in accordance with Articles 24 and 25, the States whic h have applied for such classifi cation may not refuse to allow corresponding applications to be filed in the other Member States. Each Member State shall take the necessar y measures to maintain the secur ity of such rights and applications in accordance with the procedure laid down in its own laws and regulations. 2. No applications relating to information classif ied in accordance with Article 24 may be filed outside the Member States except with the unanimous consent of the latter . Should Member States fail to make kno wn their attitude, their consent shall be deemed to have been obtained on the expir y of six months from the date on whic h the information was communicat ed to the Member States by the Commission. Article 27 Com pensation for any damag e suffered by the applicant as a result of classifi cation for defenc e reasons shall be governed by the provisions of the national laws of the Member States and shall be the responsibility of the State whic h applied for such classif ication or whic h either obtained the upgrading or exten sion of the classif ication or caused the filing of applications outside the Community to be prohibit ed. Where several Member States have either obtained the upgrading or extension of the classif ication or caused the filing of applications outside the Community to be prohibit ed, they shall be jointly responsible for making good any damage arising out of their action. The Community may not claim any com pensation under this Article. 7.6.2016 C 203/17 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN Section 4 Special provisions Article 28 Where, as a result of their communication to the Commission, unpublished applications for patents or utility models, or paten ts or utility models classif ied for defence reasons, are improperly used or come to the knowledg e of an unauthor ised person, the Community shall mak e good the damag e suffer ed by the party concer ned. Without prejudice to its own rights against the person responsible for the damag e, the Community shall, to the exten t that it has made good such damag e, acquire any rights of action enjo yed by those concer ned against third parties. This shall not affect the right of the Community to take action against the person responsible for the damag e in accordance with the general provisions in force. Article 29 Where an agreement or contract for the exchang e of scientif ic or industr ial information in the nuclear field between a Member State, a person or an under taking on the one hand, and a third State, an inter national organisation or a national of a third State on the other , requires, on either part, the signature of a State acting in its sovereign capacity , it shall be concluded by the Commission. Subject to the provisions of Articles 103 and 104, the Commission may, however , on such conditions as it considers appropr iate, author ise a Member State, a person or an under taking to conclude such agreements. CHAPTER 3 Health and safety Article 30 Basic standards shall be laid down within the Community for the prot ection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionizing radiations. The expression 'basic standards ' means: (a) maximum permissible doses com patible with adequat e safety; (b) maximum permissible levels of exposure and contamination; (c) the fundamental principles governing the health surveillance of workers. 7.6.2016 C 203/18 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN Article 31 The basic standards shall be worked out by the Commission after it has obtained the opinion of a group of persons appoint ed by the Scientific and Techn ical Committ ee from among scientif ic exper ts, and in particular public health exper ts, in the Member States. The Commission shall obtain the opinion of the Economic and Social Committ ee on these basic standards. After consulting the European Parliament the Council shall, on a proposal from the Commission, whic h shall forward to it the opinions obtained from these Committ ees, establish the basic standards; the Council shall act by a qualifi ed majority. Article 32 At the request of the Commission or of a Member State, the basic standards may be revised or supplement ed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 31. The Commission shall examine any request made by a Member State.

Article 37 Each Member State shall provide the Commission with such general data relating to any plan for the disposal of radioactive waste in whatever form will mak e it possible to deter mine whether the implementation of such plan is liable to result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State. The Commission shall deliver its opinion within six months, after consulting the group of exper ts referred to in Article 31. Article 38 The Commission shall mak e recommendations to the Member States with regard to the level of radioactivity in the air, water and soil. In cases of urgency , the Commission shall issue a directive requir ing the Member State concer ned to take, within a period laid down by the Commission, all necessar y measures to prevent infringement of the basic standards and to ensure com pliance with regulations. Should the State in question fail to com ply with the Commission directive within the period laid down, the Commission or any Member State concer ned may forthwith, by way of derog ation from Articles 258 and 259 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, bring the matter before the Cour t of Justice of the European Union.

The Commission shall attac h a detailed repor t on the project as a whole. Article 47 The Council may, when the matt er has been submitted to it by the Commission, request the latter to supply such further information or to under take such further inquir ies as the Council may consider necessar y. 7.6.2016 C 203/22 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN If the Council, acting by a qualifi ed majority, considers that a project forwarded by the Commission with an unfa vourable opinion should never theless be carried out, the Commission shall submit to the Council the proposals and the detailed repor t referred to in Article 46. Where the opinion of the Commission is favourable or in the case referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Council shall act by a qualifi ed majority on each of the proposals from the Commission. The Council shall, however , act unanimously in respect of: (a) participation by the Community in the financing of the Joint Under taking; (b) participation by a third State, an inter national organisation or a national of a third State in the financing or manag ement of the Joint Under taking. Article 48 The Council may, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, mak e applicable to each Joint Under taking any or all of the advantag es listed in Annex III to this Treaty ; each Member State shall for its part ensure that these advantag es are confer red. The Council may, in accordance with the same procedure, lay down the conditions governing the confer ment of these advantag es. Article 49 Joint Under takings shall be established by Council decision. Each Joint Under taking shall have legal personality . In each of the Member States, it shall enjo y the most extensi ve legal capacity accorded to legal persons under their respective national laws; it may, in particular , acquire or dispose of movable and immo vable proper ty and may be a party to legal proceedings.

Article 51 The Commission shall be responsible for carrying out all decisions of the Council relating to the establishment of Joint Under takings until the bodies responsible for the operation of such under takings have been set up. CHAPTER 6 Supplies Article 52 1. The supply of ores, source mat erials and special fissile mat erials shall be ensured, in accordance with the provisions of this Chap ter, by means of a common supply policy on the principle of equal access to sources of supply . 2. For this purpose and under the conditions laid down in this Chapt er: (a) all practices designed to secure a privileg ed position for certain users shall be prohibit ed; (b) an Agency is hereb y established; it shall have a right of option on ores, source mat erials and special fissile mat erials produced in the territories of Member States and an exclusiv e right to conclude contracts relating to the supply of ores, source mat erials and special fissile mat erials coming from inside the Community or from outside. The Agency may not discr iminat e in any way between users on grounds of the use whic h they intend to mak e of the supplies request ed unless such use is unla wful or is found to be contrar y to the conditions imposed by suppliers outside the Community on the consignment in question. Section 1 The Agency Article 53 The Agency shall be under the super vision of the Commission, whic h shall issue directives to it, possess a right of veto over its decisions and appoint its Direct or General and Deputy Direct or General. 7.6.2016 C 203/24 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN Any act, whether implied or expressed, perf ormed by the Agency in the exercise of its right of option or of its exclusive right to conclude supply contracts, may be referred by the parties concer ned to the Commission, whic h shall give a decision thereon within one month. Article 54 The Agency shall have legal personality and financial autonom y. The Council shall lay down the statut es of the Agency , acting by a qualif ied majority on a proposal from the Commission. The statut es may be amended in accordance with the same procedure. The statut es shall determine the Agency's capital and the terms upon whic h it is to be subscr ibed. The major part of the capital shall alwa ys belong to the Community and to the Member States. The contr ibutions to the capital shall be deter mined by common accord of the Member States. The rules for the commercial manag ement of the activities of the Agency shall be laid down in the statut es. The latter may provide for a charg e on transactions to defra y the operating expenses of the Agency . Article 55 The Member States shall communicate or cause to be communicat ed to the Agency all the information necessar y to enable it to exercise its right of option and its exclusive right to conclude supply contracts. Article 56 The Member States shall be responsible for ensur ing that the Agency may operat e freely in their territories. They may establish one or more bodies having author ity to represent, in relations with the Agen cy, producers and users in the non European territories under their jurisdiction. Section 2 Ores, source mater ials and special fissile mater ials coming from inside the Community Article 57 1. The right of option of the Agency shall cover: (a) the acquisition of rights to use and consume mat erials owned by the Community under the provisions of Chap ter 8; (b) the acquisition of the right of ownership in all other cases. 7.6.2016 C 203/25 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN 2. The Agen cy shall exercise its right of option by concluding contracts with producers of ores, source mat erials and special fissile mat erials. Subject to Articles 58, 62 and 63, ever y producer shall offer to the Agency the ores, source mat erials or special fissile mat erials whic h he produces within the territories of Member States before they are used, transf erred or stored. Article 58 Where a producer carries out several stages of production from extraction of the ore up to and including production of the metal, he may offer the product to the Agency at whic hever stag e of production he chooses. The same shall apply to two or more connect ed under takings, where the connection has been duly communicated to the Commission and discussed with it in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 43 and 44. Article 59 If the Agency does not exercise its right of option on the whole or any part of the output of a producer , the latter: (a) may, either by using his own resources or under contract, process or cause to be processed the ores, source mat erials or special fissile mat erials, provided that he offers to the Agency the product of such processing; (b) shall be author ised by a decision of the Commission to dispose of his available production outside the Community , provided that the terms he offer s are not more favourable than those previously offered to the Agency . However , special fissile mat erials may be expor ted only through the Agency and in accordance with the provisions of Article 62. The Commission may not grant such author isation if the recipients of the supplies fail to satisfy it that the general interests of the Community will be safeguarded or if the terms and conditions of such contracts are contrar y to the objectives of this Treaty . Article 60 Potential users shall periodically inform the Agency of the supplies they require, specifying the quantities, the physical and chemical nature, the place of origin, the inten ded use, deliver y dates and price terms, whic h are to form the terms and conditions of the supply contract whic h they wish to conclude. 7.6.2016 C 203/26 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN Similarly , producers shall inform the Agency of offers whic h they are able to make, stating all the specif ications, and in particular the duration of contracts, required to enable their production programmes to be drawn up. Such contracts shall be of not more than 10 years' duration save with the agreement of the Commission. The Agency shall inform all potential users of the offers and of the volume of applications whic h it has received and shall call upon them to place their orders by a specifi ed time limit. When the Agency has received all such orders, it shall make known the terms on whic h it can meet them. If the Agency cannot meet in their entirety all the orders received, it shall, subject to the provisions of Articles 68 and 69, share out the supplies propor tionat ely among the orders relating to each offer . Agen cy rules, whic h shall require appro val by the Commission, shall determine the manner in whic h demand is to be balanced against supply . Article 61 The Agency shall meet all orders unless prevented from so doing by legal or mat erial obstacles. When concluding a contract, the Agency may, while com plying with the provisions of Article 52, require users to mak e appropr iate advance payments either as secur ity or to assist in meeting the Agen cy's own long term commitments to producers where these are essential to carrying out the order . Article 62 1. The Agency shall exercise its right of option on special fissile mat erials produced in the territories of Member States in order: (a) to meet demand from users within the Community in accordance with Article 60; or (b) to store such mat erials itself; or (c) to expor t such mat erials with the author isation of the Commission whic h shall com ply with the second subparagraph of Article 59(b). 2. Never theless, while continuing to be subject to the provisions of Chap ter 7, such mat erials and any fertile wast es shall be left in the possession of the producer , so that he may: (a) store them with the author isation of the Agency ; or (b) use them within the limits of his own requirements; or 7.6.2016 C 203/27 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN (c) mak e them available to under takings in the Community , within the limits of their requirements, where for carrying out a programme duly communicat ed to the Commission, these under takings have with the producer a direct connection whic h has neither the aim nor the effect of limiting production, technical development or investment or of improperly creating inequalities between users in the Community . 3. The provisions of Article 89(1)(a) shall apply to special fissile mat erials whic h are produced in the territories of Member States and on whic h the Agency has not exercised its right of option. Article 63 Ores, source mat erials and special fissile mat erials produced by Joint Under takings shall be allotted to users in accordance with the rules laid down in the statut es or agreements of such under takings. Section 3 Ores, source mater ials and special fissile mater ials coming from outside the Community Article 64 The Agency , acting where appropr iate within the framew ork of agreements concluded between the Community and a third State or an inter national organisation, shall, subject to the exceptions provided for in this Treaty , have the exclusive right to enter into agreements or contracts whose principal aim is the supply of ores, source mat erials or special fissile mat erials coming from outside the Community . Article 65 Article 60 shall apply to applications from users and to contracts between users and the Agen cy relating to the supply of ores, source mat erials or special fissile mat erials coming from outside the Community . The Agency may, however , decide on the geographical origin of supplies provided that conditions whic h are at least as favourable as those specif ied in the order are thereb y secured for the user . Article 66 Should the Commission find, on application by the users concer ned, that the Agency is not in a position to deliver within a reasonable period of time all or part of the supplies ordered, or that it can only do so at excessively high prices, the users shall have the right to conclude directly contracts relating to supplies from outside the Community , provided that such contracts meet in essential respects the requirements specif ied in their orders. 7.6.2016 C 203/28 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN This right shall be grant ed for a period of one year; it may be extended if the situation whic h justif ied its granting continues. Users who avail themselves of the right provided for in this Article shall communicat e to the Commission the direct contracts whic h they propose to conclude. The Commission may, within one month, object to the conclusion of such contracts if they are contrar y to the objectives of this Treaty . Section 4 Prices Article 67 Save where except ions are provided for in this Treaty , prices shall be determined as a result of balancing supply against demand as provided in Article 60; the national regulations of the Member States shall not contra vene such provisions. Article 68 Pricing practices designed to secure a privileg ed position for certain users in violation of the principle of equal access laid down in the provisions of this Chap ter shall be prohibit ed. If the Agency finds that any such practices are being emplo yed it shall repor t them to the Commission. The Commission may, if it accep ts the findings, set the prices of the offers in issue at a level com patible with the principle of equal access. Article 69 The Council may fix prices, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission. When the Agency lays down, in pursuance of Article 60, the terms on whic h orders can be met, it may propose to the users who have placed orders that prices be equalized. Section 5 Provisions relating to supply policy Article 70 Within the limits set by the budget of the Community , the Commission may, on such conditions as it shall deter mine, give financial suppor t to prospecting programmes in the territories of Member States. The Commission may mak e recommendations to the Member States with a view to the development of prospecting for and exploitation of mineral deposits. 7.6.2016 C 203/29 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN The Member States shall submit annually to the Commission a repor t on the development of prospecting and production, on probable reser ves and on investment in mining whic h has been made or is planned in their territories. The repor ts shall be submitt ed to the Council, together with an opinion from the Commission whic h shall state in particular what action has been taken by Member States on recommendations made to them under the preceding paragraph. If, when the matt er has been submitted to it by the Commission, the Council finds by a qualified majority that, although the prospects for extraction appear economically justif ied on a long term basis, prospecting activities and the expansion of mining operations continue to be mark edly inadequate, the Member State concer ned shall, for as long as it has failed to remedy this situation, be deemed to have waived, both for itself and for its nationals, the right of equal access to other sources of supply within the Community . Article 71 The Commission shall mak e all appropr iate recommendations to Member States with regard to revenue or mining regulations. Article 72 The Agency may, from mat erial available inside or outside the Community , build up the necessar y commercial stoc ks to facilitat e supplies to or normal deliver ies by the Community . The Commission may, where necessar y, decide to build up emerg ency stocks. The method of financing such stocks shall be appro ved by the Council, acting by a qualif ied majority on a proposal from the Commission. Section 6 Special provisions Article 73 Where an agreement or contract between a Member State, a person or an under taking on the one hand, and a third State, an international organisation or a national of a third State on the other , provides inter alia for deliver y of products whic h come within the province of the Agency , the prior consent of the Commission shall be required for the conclusion or renewal of that agreement or contract, as far as deliver y of the products is concer ned. Article 74 The Commission may exemp t from the provisions of this Chap ter the transf er, import or expor t of small quantities of ores, source mat erials or special fissile mat erials such as are normally used in researc h. The Agency shall be notif ied of ever y transf er, import or expor t operation effected by virtue of this provision. 7.6.2016 C 203/30 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN Article 75 The provisions of this Chap ter shall not apply to commitments relating to the processing, conversio n or shaping of ores, source mat erials or special fissile mat erials and entered into: (a) by several persons or under takings, where the mat erial is to retur n to the original person or under taking after being processed, converted or shaped; or (b) by a person or under taking and an inter national organisation or a national of a third State, where the mat erial is processed, converted or shaped outside the Community and then retur ned to the original person or under taking; or (c) by a person or under taking and an inter national organisation or a national of a third State, where the mat erial is processed, converted or shaped inside the Community and is then retur ned either to the original orga nisation or national or to any other consignee likewise outside the Community designat ed by such organisation or national. The persons and under takings concer ned shall, however , notify the Agency of the exist ence of such commitments and, as soon as the contracts are signed, of the quantities of mat erial involved in the movements. The Commission may prevent the commitments referred to in subparagraph (b) from being under taken if it considers that the conversion or shaping cannot be carried out efficiently and safely and without the loss of mat erial to the detr iment of the Community . The mat erials to whic h such commitments relate shall be subject in the territories of the Member States to the safeguards laid down in Chap ter 7. The provisions of Chap ter 8 shall not, however , be applicable to special fissile mat erials covered by the commitments referred to in sub\u00ad paragraph (c). Article 76 On the initiative of a Member State or of the Commission, and particularly if unforeseen circum \u00ad stances creat e a situation of general shor tage, the Council may, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, amend the provisions of this Chapt er. The Commission shall inquire into any request made by a Member State. Seven years after 1 Januar y 1958, the Council may conf irm these provisions in their entirety . Failing conf irmation, new provisions relating to the subject matt er of this Chap ter shall be adop ted in accordance with the procedure laid down in the preceding paragraph. 7.6.2016 C 203/31 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN CHAPTER 7 Safeguar ds Article 77 In accordance with the provisions of this Chapt er, the Commission shall satisfy itself that, in the territories of Member States: (a) ores, source mat erials and special fissile mat erials are not diver ted from their intended uses as declared by the users; (b) the provisions relating to supply and any particular safeguarding oblig ations assumed by the Community under an agreement concluded with a third State or an international organisation are com plied with. Article 78 Any one setting up or operating an installation for the production, separation or other use of source mat erials or special fissile mat erials or for the processing of irradiated nuclear fuels shall declare to the Commission the basic technical charact eristics of the installations, to the extent that knowledg e of these charact eristics is necessar y for the attainment of the objectives set out in Article 77. The Commission must appro ve the techniques to be used for the chemical processing of irradiated mat erials, to the extent necessar y to attain the objectives set out in Article 77. Article 79 The Commission shall require that operating records be kept and produced in order to permit accounting for ores, source mat erials and special fissile mat erials used or produced. The same requirement shall apply in the case of the transpor t of source mat erials and special fissile mat erials. Those subject to such requirements shall notify the author ities of the Member State concer ned of any communications they mak e to the Commission pursuant to Article 78 and to the first paragraph of this Article. The nature and the extent of the requirements referred to in the first paragraph of this Article shall be defined in a regulation made by the Commission and appro ved by the Council. Article 80 The Commission may require that any excess special fissile mat erials reco vered or obtained as by products and not actually being used or ready for use shall be deposited with the Agency or in other stores whic h are or can be super vised by the Commission. Special fissile mat erials deposit ed in this way must be retur ned forthwith to those concer ned at their request. 7.6.2016 C 203/32 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN Article 81 The Commission may send inspect ors into the territories of Member States. Before sending an inspector on his first assignment in the territory of a Member State, the Commission shall consult the State concer ned; such consultation shall suffice to cover all future assignments of this inspect or. On presentation of a document establishing their author ity, inspect ors shall at all times have access to all places and data and to all persons who, by reason of their occupation, deal with mat erials, equipment or installations subject to the safeguards provided for in this Chap ter, to the extent necessar y in order to apply such safeguards to ores, source mat erials and special fissile mat erials and to ensure com pliance with the provisions of Article 77. Should the State concer ned so request, inspectors appoint ed by the Commission shall be accompanied by representatives of the author ities of that State; however , the inspect ors shall not thereby be dela yed or other wise impeded in the performance of their duties. If the carrying out of an inspection is opposed, the Commission shall apply to the President of the Cour t of Justice of the European Union for an order to ensure that the inspection be carried out com pulsor ily. The President of the Cour t of Justice of the European Union shall give a decision within three days. If there is dang er in dela y, the Commission may itself issue a written order , in the form of a decision, to proceed with the inspection. This order shall be submitted without dela y to the President of the Cour t of Justice of the European Union for subsequent appro val. After the order or decision has been issued, the author ities of the State concer ned shall ensure that the inspect ors have access to the places specif ied in the order or decision. Article 82 Inspect ors shall be recr uited by the Commission. They shall be responsible for obtaining and verifying the records referred to in Article 79. They shall repor t any infringement to the Commission. The Commission may issue a directive calling upon the Member State concer ned to take, by a time limit set by the Commission, all measures necessar y to bring such infringement to an end; it shall inform the Council thereof. If the Member State does not com ply with the Commission directive by the time limit set, the Commission or any Member State concer ned may, in derog ation from Articles 258 and 259 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, refer the matt er to the Cour t of Justice of the European Union direct. Article 83 1. In the event of an infringement on the part of persons or under takings of the oblig ations imposed on them by this Chap ter, the Commission may impose sanctions on such persons or under takings. 7.6.2016 C 203/33 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN These sanctions shall be in order of sever ity: (a) a warning; (b) the withdra wal of special benef its such as financial or technical assistance; (c) the placing of the under taking for a period not exceeding four months under the administration of a person or board appoint ed by common accord of the Commission and the State having jurisdiction over the under taking; (d) total or partial withdra wal of source mat erials or special fissile mat erials. 2. Decisions taken by the Commission in implementation of paragraph 1 and requir ing the surrender of mat erials shall be enforceable. They may be enforced in the territories of Member States in accordance with Article 164. By way of derog ation from Article 157, appeals brought before the Cour t of Justice of the European Union against decisions of the Commission whic h impose any of the sanctions provided for in paragraph 1 shall have suspensor y effect. The Cour t of Justice of the European Union may, however , on application by the Commission or by any Member State concer ned, order that the decision be enforced forthwith. There shall be an appropr iate legal procedure to ensure the prot ection of interests that have been prejudiced. 3.

The scope of and procedure for the safeguards and the powers of the bodies responsible for their application shall be conf ined to the attainment of the objectives set out in this Chap ter. The safeguards may not extend to mat erials inten ded to meet defence requirements whic h are in the course of being specially processed for this purpose or whic h, after being so processed, are, in accordance with an operational plan, placed or stored in a militar y establishment. 7.6.2016 C 203/34 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN Article 85 Where new circumstances so require, the procedures for applying the safeguards laid down in this Chapt er may, at the request of a Member State or of the Commission, be adapt ed by the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament. The Commission shall examine any such request made by a Member State. CHAPTER 8 Proper ty ownership Article 86 Special fissile mat erials shall be the proper ty of the Community . The Community's right of ownership shall extend to all special fissile mat erials whic h are produced or imported by a Member State, a person or an under taking and are subject to the safeguards provided for in Chap ter 7.
