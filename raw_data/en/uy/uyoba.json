Even today, botany remains the basis of many medical research projects. Plants are both ancient remedies and very modern health resources. FOR A LONG TIME This herbal medicine has been used for more than 6,000 years. It is the oldest medicine used by man and animals. Phytotherapy is widely used on all continents. Since the 19th century, scientists have identified the active ingredients present in plants, i.e. substances that have active properties on the organism. These substances have been isolated and transformed into chemical drugs (aspirin, cortisone, antibiotics...). The appearance of these drugs heralded the decline of herbal medicine in the West. It was only in 1970 that the undesirable effects of chemical molecules were highlighted and the population redirected towards natural solutions. In addition to their effects, which have now been widely demonstrated through scientific studies, plants offer the immense advantage of acting smoothly, with a minimum of negative effects. These characteristics of phytotherapy give it a privileged place in the treatment of many common diseases. THE SCIENTIFIC SIDE A team of passionate scientists is at the heart of the Tilman laboratory. They engage in research and formulate new solutions. They strictly follow the regulations. They are responsible for checking the correct composition of the ingredients before going into production. At each stage, they then check the content of active ingredients and the characteristics of the products. This ensures that the quality of the products is always equal and safe. PLANTS ARE CONSUMED IN MANY FORMS: Infusion Boiling water is poured over the plant, which then rests for 3 to 10 minutes. Decoction The plant is boiled for 5 to 10 minutes, then cooled and filtered. Maceration The plant is kept in cold water for a few hours to a few days, depending on the type of plant. TOTAL POWDER It is produced by grinding the dried plant. The powder obtained is generally put into capsules. MOTHER TINCTURE It results from the maceration of the dried plant in alcohol at 40\u00b0, 60\u00b0, or 80\u00b0. STANDARDIZED EXTRACT It is a concentrate obtained by concentrating a macerate prepared from the plant. This makes it possible to extract most of the useful components and to always control the content of active ingredients. This method allows us to always offer the same quality of the product. The extract can be maintained in liquid form: we speak of fluid extract. Fluid extracts are used in syrups and creams. The extract can also be evaporated and dried: this results in a dry extract. Dry extracts are mainly used in capsules and tablets. "}
