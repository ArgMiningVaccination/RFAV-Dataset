She struggled to find effective products that were free from harsh chemicals, synthetic fragrances, and harmful toxins. She was inspired to create safe, non-irritating products that would not challenge the immune system and created products for herself made from the most potent, organic, and wild-harvested botanicals available. Beneath Your Mask's Hero product, Vegan Heal Whipped Skin Souffl\u00e9 came from humble beginnings in Dana's own kitchen, loved dearly by friends and family, then practically blossomed with popularity overnight into an intentional line of multi-purpose and non-toxic products that are as luxurious as they are pure and effective.
