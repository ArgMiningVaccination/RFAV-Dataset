Community 4Baylor Scott & White Health mission Our commitment to the communities we serve As the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in T exas and one of the largest in the United States, Baylor Scott & White Health was born from the 2013 combination of Baylor Health Care System and Scott & White Healthcare. T oday, Baylor Scott & White includes 51 hospitals, 1,100 access points, more than 7,300 active physicians, and over 49,000 employees and the Baylor Scott & White Health Plan. Baylor Scott & White Health is a leading T exas healthcare provider with a proven commitment to patient and community health. Baylor Scott & White Health demonstrates this commitment through periodic community health needs assessments, then addresses those needs with a wide range of outreach initiatives. These Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) activities also satisfy federal and state community benefit requirements outlined in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the T exas Health and Safety Code. Baylor Scott & White Health conducts a thorough periodic examination of public health indicators and a benchmark analysis comparing communities it serves to an overall state of T exas value. In this way, it can determine where deficiencies lie and the opportunities for improvement are greatest. Through interviews, focus groups and surveys, the organization gains a clearer understanding of community needs from the perspective of the members of each community. This helps it identify the most pressing needs a community is facing and develop implementation plans to focus on those prioritized needs. The process includes input from a wide range of knowledgeable people who represent the myriad interests of the community in compliance with 501 (r)(3) regulations. The CHNA process overview can be found in Appendix A. The CHNAs serve as the foundation for community health improvement planning efforts over the next three years, while the implementation plans will be evaluated annually.Health Experience Affordability Alignment GrowthFounded as a Christian ministry of healing, Baylor Scott & White Health promotes the well-being of all individuals, families and communities.

High demand for primary care and a limited number of primary care providers lead to difficulty accessing primary care. In the prioritization session, the hospital leadership noted that even though the community has resources, there is a need for better coordination of the services in order to address the issue of access to care. McKinney Health Community 10Priority 2: Access to Mental Healthcare (Providers/Resources) The following data indicates greater need for access for the population to one mental healthcare provider. The indicator is defined as the ratio of population to mental health providers and is based on data from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps; CMS, National Provider Identification Registry (NPPES).

The group anticipates further growth and increased severity of mental health in the future due to patients being underserved during COVID, which can only widen the access gaps that exist. In the prioritization session, the hospital and community leaders agreed that access to mental healthcare is an issue for the entire population. There is a lack of mental health providers in the community, and the need for these providers is exasperated by the pandemic. McKinney Health Community 11Priority 3: Preventive Screenings - Chronic Diseases The following indicates a need in the areas of obesity, diabetes and cancer.

They anticipate that the problem will only worsen due to patients being underserved during COVID. They also added that although food banks and Meals on Wheels are available to the community, the chronically ill are not helped by these sources because they lack the options for restricted diets, such as low sodium, etc., that these conditions require. In the prioritization session, hospital leadership felt that cancer diagnoses are increasing due to the lack of preventive cancer screenings brought on by the circumstances of the pandemic. They note that patients presenting to the emergency department for other health issues are receiving late-stage cancer diagnoses. They further elaborated that the root causes of many conditions, including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc., are a lack of\u2014or a perceived lack of\u2014 access to primary care, not following medical advice from primary care physicians and delaying preventive screenings. They agreed that a concerted effort in educating and promoting yearly in-person preventive screenings is the key to addressing adult obesity and other chronic health conditions. McKinney Health Community 13Priority 4: Treatment Resources for Behavioral Health/Substance Abuse The following indicates greater need in the areas of binge drinking, drug poisoning deaths and opioid involved accidental poisoning death. Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Health behaviors Binge drinking Negative life habits (smoking, drinking, etc.) The pandemic increased substance abuse The binge drinking indicator is defined as the percentage of a county's adult population that reports binge or heavy drinking in the past 30 days and is based on data from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps; The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

Greater or lesser need than state greater need same level of need or NA lesser need The key informants of the focus group recognize that there are gaps in substance abuse services, and therefore, these patients do not have a resource to seek help. They noted that the pandemic widened the gap as the number of substance abusers increased. In the prioritization session, the hospital and community leaders cited that illicit drug use decreased in the first part of the pandemic but increased in the second. Alcohol use is more prevalent, and the delivery of alcohol to homes has contributed to this issue. They noted that binge drinking and substance abuse are coping mechanisms for underlying mental health issues and strongly felt that without preventive mental health services, patients will turn to other means to self-treat, contributing to the physical effects of mental health conditions and substance abuse (self-harm, suicide attempts, alcohol-related injury, etc.).

It can be accessed 24/7 at BSWHealth.FindHelp.com. Next steps BSWH started the Community Health Needs Assessment process in April 2021. Using both qualitative community feedback as well as publicly available and proprietary health indicators, BSWH was able to identify and prioritize community health needs for their healthcare system. With the goal of improving the health of the community, implementation plans with specific tactics and time frames will be developed for the health needs BSWH chooses to address for the community served. McKinney Health Community 18Appendix A: CHNA requirement details The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires all tax-exempt organizations operating hospital facilities to assess the health needs of their community every three (3) years. The resulting Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) report must include descriptions of the following: The community served and how the community was determined; The process and methods used to conduct the assessment, including sources and dates of the data and other information as well as the analytical methods applied to identify significant community health needs; How the organization used input from persons representing the broad interests of the community served by the hospital, including a description of when and how the hospital consulted with these persons or the organizations they represent; The prioritized significant health needs identified through the CHNA as well as a description of the process and criteria used in prioritizing the identified significant needs; The existing healthcare facilities, organizations and other resources within the community available to meet the significant community health needs; and An evaluation of the impact of any actions that were taken since the hospital's most recent CHNA to address the significant health needs identified in that report. \u00b0 Hospitals also must adopt an implementation strategy to address prioritized community health needs identified through the assessment. CHNA process BSWH began the 2022 CHNA process in April of 2021. The following is an overview of the timeline and major milestones: Define the community Assess the community Identify \"significant needs\" and \"prioritize\" Document in written report CHNA board approvals Make CHNA widely available on website Written implementation strategy Implementation strategy board approval Make implementation strategy widely available on website Act on strategy, measure and report McKinney Health Community 19Consultant qualifications IBM Watson Health delivers analytic tools, benchmarks and strategic consulting services to the healthcare industry, combining rich data analytics in demographics, including the Community Needs Index, planning and disease prevalence estimates, with experienced strategic consultants to deliver comprehensive and actionable Community Health Needs Assessments. Health needs assessment process overview T o identify the health needs of the community, the hospitals established a comprehensive method using all available relevant data including community input. They used the qualitative and quantitative data obtained when assessing the community to identify its community health needs. Surveyors conducted interviews and focus groups with individuals representing public health, community leaders/groups, public organizations and other providers. In addition, data collected from public sources compared to the state benchmark indicated the level of severity. The outcomes of the quantitative data analysis were compared to the qualitative data findings. These data are available to the community via an interactive dashboard at BSWHealth.com/ CommunityNeeds. Data gathering: quantitative assessment of health needs - methodology and data sources The IBM team used quantitative data collection and analysis garnered from public health indicators to assess community health needs. This included over 100 data elements grouped into over 11 categories evaluated for the counties where data was available. Recently, indicators expanded to include new categories addressing mental health, healthcare costs, opioids and social determinants of health. A table depicting the categories and indicators and a list of sources are in Appendix B. A benchmark analysis of each indicator determined which public health indicators demonstrated a community health need. Benchmark health indicators included overall US values, state of T exas values and other goal-setting benchmarks, such as Healthy People 2020. According to America's Health Rankings 2021 Annual Report, T exas ranks 22nd out of the 50 states in the area of Health Outcomes (which includes behavioral health, mortality and physical health) and 50th in the area of Clinical Care (which includes avoiding care due to cost, providers per 100,000 population and preventive services). When the health status of T exas was compared to other states, the team identified many opportunities to impact community health. McKinney Health Community 20The quantitative analysis of the health community used the following methodology: The team set benchmarks for each health community using state value for comparison. They identified community indicators not meeting state benchmarks. From this, they determined a need differential analysis of the indicators, which helped them understand the community's relative severity of need. Using the need differentials, they established a standardized way to evaluate the degree that each indicator differed from its benchmark. This quantitative analysis showed which health community indicators were above the 25th percentile in order of severity\u2014and which health indicators needed their focus. The outcomes of the quantitative data analysis were compared to the qualitative data findings. Information gaps In some areas of T exas, the small population size has an impact on reporting and statistical significance. The team has attempted to understand the most significant health needs of the entire community. It is understood that there is variation of need within the community, and BSWH may not be able to impact all of the population who truly need the service. Community input: qualitative health needs assessment - approach T o obtain a qualitative assessment of the health community, the team: Assembled a focus group representing the broad interests of the community served; Conducted interviews and surveys with key informants\u2014leaders and representatives who serve the community and have insight into its needs; and Held prioritization sessions with hospital clinical leadership and community leaders to review collection results and identify the most significant healthcare needs based on information gleaned from the focus groups and key informants. Focus groups helped identify barriers and social factors influencing the community's health needs. Key informant interviews gave the team even more understanding and insight about the general health status of the community and the various drivers that contributed to health issues. Multiple governmental public health department individuals were asked to contribute their knowledge, information and expertise relevant to the health needs of the community. Individuals or organizations who served and/or represented the interests of medically underserved, low-income and minority populations in the community also took part in the process. NOTE: In some cases, public health officials were unavailable due to obligations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospitals also considered written input received on their most recently conducted CHNA and subsequent implementation strategies if provided. The assessment is available for public comment or feedback on the report findings by going to the BSWH website (BSWHealth.com/CommunityNeeds) or by emailing CommunityHealth@BSWHealth.org. McKinney Health Community 21Approach to prioritizing significant health needs On January 14, 2022, a session was conducted with key leadership members from Baylor Scott & White along with community leaders to review the qualitative and quantitative data findings of the CHNA to date, discuss at length the significant needs identified, and complete prioritization exercises to rank the community needs. Prioritizing health needs was a two- step process. The two-step process allowed participants to consider the quantitative needs and qualitative needs as defined by the indicator dataset and focus group/interview/survey participant input. In the first step, participants reviewed the top health needs for their community using associated data-driven criteria. The criteria included health indicator value(s) for the community and how the indicator compared to the state benchmark. High data/ Low qualitativeHigh data/ High qualitative TIVE QUALIT A TIVEDATAHigh data and high qualitative: The community indicators that showed a greater need in the health community overall when compared to the state of T exas comparative benchmark and were identified as a greater need by the key informants. High data/ Low qualitativeHigh data/ High qualitative TIVE QUALIT A TIVEDATAHigh data and low qualitative: The community indicators showed a greater need in the health community overall when compared to the state of T exas comparative benchmark but were not identified as a greater need or not specifically identified by the key informants. High data/ Low qualitativeHigh data/ High qualitative TIVE QUALIT A TIVEDATALow/no data and high qualitative: The community indicators showed less need or had no data available in the health community overall when compared to the state of T exas comparative benchmark but were identified as a greater need by the key informants. Participants held a group discussion about which needs were most significant, using the professional experience and community knowledge of the group. A virtual voting method was invoked for individuals to provide independent opinions. This process helped the group define and identify the community's significant health needs. Participants voted individually for the needs they considered the most significant for this community. When the votes were tallied, the top identified needs emerged and were ranked based on the number of votes. High data/Low qualitative High data/High qualitative Data compared to state benchmark indicates need by a greater magnitude BUT T opic was not raised in interviews and focus groupsData compared to state benchmark indicates need by a greater magnitude AND T opic was a frequent theme in interviews and focus groups Data compared to state benchmark indicates need by a lesser magnitude AND T opic was not raised in interviews and focus groupsData compared to state benchmark indicates need by a lesser magnitude BUT T opic was a frequent theme in interviews and focus groups Low data/Low qualitative Low/no data/High qualitative High data = Indicators worse than state benchmark by greater magnitude High qualitative = Frequency of topic in interviews and focus groupsQualitative QualitativeData Data McKinney Health Community 22Prioritization of significant needs In the second step, participants ranked the significant health needs based on prioritization criteria recommended by the focus group conducted for this community: Root cause: The need is a root cause of other problems. If addressed, it could possibly impact multiple issues. Feasibility/cost: Is the problem amenable to interventions? Is the problem preventable? What technology, knowledge or resources are necessary to effect a change? Is it too expensive for the community to tackle? Severity (outcome if ignored): The problem results in disability or premature death or creates burdens on the community, economically or socially. The group rated each of the five significant health needs on each of the three identified criteria, using a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high). The criteria score sums for each need created an overall score. They prioritized the list of significant health needs based on the overall scores. The outcome of this process was the list of prioritized health needs for this community. Priority Need Category of need 1 Access to primary healthcare Access to care 2 Access to mental healthcare Mental health 3 Preventive screenings - chronic diseases Conditions/diseases 4 Treatment resources for behavioral health/substance abuse Mental health 5 Transportation Environment McKinney Health Community 23Appendix B: key public health indicators IBM Watson Health collected and analyzed fifty-nine (59) public health indicators to assess and evaluate community health needs. For each health indicator, a comparison between the most recently available community data and benchmarks for the same/similar indicator was made.

The CNI takes into account vital socio- economic factors, including income, culture, education, insurance and housing, about a community to generate a CNI score for every population ZIP code in the US. The CNI is strongly linked to variations in community healthcare needs and is a good indicator of a community's demand for a range of healthcare services. Not-for-profit and community-based hospitals, for whom community need is central to the mission of service, are often challenged to prioritize and effectively distribute hospital resources. The CNI can be used to help them identify specific initiatives best designed to address the health disparities of a given community. The CNI score by ZIP code shows specific areas within a community where healthcare needs may be greater. McKinney Health Community The overall CNI score for the McKinney Health Community is 2.80. The difference in the numbers indicates both a strong link to community healthcare needs and a community's demand for various healthcare services. In portions of the community, the CNI score was greater than 4.5, indicating more significant health needs among the population.Composite CNI score 2.80 T exas CNI score 3.85 US composite CNI score 3.00 Barrier State US Income 3.0 3.0 Culture 4.7 3.0 Education 3.5 3.0 Insurance 4.3 3.0 Housing 3.9 3.0Composite CNI: high scores indicate high need.

Social determinants of health are the structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. All of which can greatly impact healthcare utilization and play a major role in the shifting healthcare landscape. Social determinants, such as education, income and race, are factored into Inpatient Demand Estimates and Outpatient Procedure Estimates utilization rate creation methodologies. Inpatient demand estimates Inpatient demand estimates provide the total volume of annual acute care admissions by ZIP code and DRG Product Line for every market in the United States. IBM uses all-payor state discharge data for publicly available states and Medicare (MEDPAR) data for the entire US. These rates are applied to demographic projections by ZIP code to estimate inpatient utilization for 2020 through 2030. The following summary is reflective of the inpatient utilization trends for McKinney Health Community. T otal discharges in the community are expected to grow by 17.6% by 2030, with pulmonary medical, general medicine, cardiovascular diseases and orthopedics projecting the largest growth.

Procedures are defined and reported by procedure codes and are further grouped into clinical service lines. The McKinney Health Community outpatient procedures are expected to increase by over 38% by 2030 with the largest growth in the categories of labs, general & internal medicine, physical & occupational therapy, hematology & oncology and psychiatry.

IBM uses an extensive supply of proprietary claims, public claims and federal surveys to construct population-based use rates for all payors by age and sex. These use rates are then applied to demographic and insurance coverage projections by ZIP code to estimate ED utilization for 2020 through 2030. Visits are broken out into emergent and non-emergent ambulatory visits to identify the volume of visits that could be seen in a less-acute setting, for example, a fast-track ED or an urgent care facility. In addition, visits that result in an inpatient admission are broken out into a third, separate category. In the McKinney Health Community, ED visits are expected to grow by over 20% by 2025.

IBM uses public and private claims data as well as epidemiological data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) to build local estimates of heart disease prevalence for the current population. County-level models by age and sex are applied to the underlying demographics of specific geographies to estimate the number of patients with specific types of heart disease. In McKinney Health Community, the most common heart disease is hypertension at 73.6% of all heart disease cases.
