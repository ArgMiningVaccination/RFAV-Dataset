We describe the safety and durability of the immune responses following two primary doses and a homologous booster dose of an investigational DNA vaccine (INO-4800) targeting the full-length spike antigen. Methods: Three dosage strengths of INO-4800 (0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, and 2.0 mg) were evaluated in 120 age-stratified healthy adults. Intradermal injection of INO-4800 followed by electroporation at 0 and 4 weeks preceded an optional booster 6-10.5 months after the second dose. Results: INO-4800 appeared well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events. Most adverse events were mild and did not increase in frequency with age and subsequent dosing. A durable antibody response was observed 6 months following the second dose; a homologous booster dose significantly increased immune responses. Cytokine producing T cells and activated CD8+ T cells with lytic potential were significantly increased in the 2.0 mg dose group. Conclusion: INO-4800 was well tolerated in a 2-dose primary series and as a homologous booster in all adults, including the elderly. These results support further development of INO-4800 for use as a primary vaccine and as a booster. Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; to COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2[1]. The urgent 3 need remains for additional safe and effective vaccines that are affordable, scalable, and can be 4 distributed to countries where the infrastructure may not be supportive of ultra-cold chain 5 transport and storage. 6 Attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to host cells is mediated by binding of the viral spike (S) protein to 7 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on host cells[2]. Humoral responses against 8 the spike protein prevent the virus from accessing host cells[3], and this strategy has led to the 9 development of several vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 (reviewed by[4, 5]). 10 INO-4800 is an investigational optimized DNA vaccine, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein[6], 11 injected intradermally followed by in vivo electroporation[7]. This approach potentially offers 12 several advantages, including induction of humoral and cellular immunity, favorable tolerability 13 and thermal stability profiles, and ease of manufacture[8, 9]. Plasmid DNA-based products in 14 development by this sponsor have been shown to be stable at 2-8\u00b0C for 3-5 years, at room 15 temperature (25\u00b0C) for least 1 year, and at 37\u00b0C for 1 month (unpublished data), and is in line 16 with earlier reports on the stability of pharmaceutical grade plasmid DNA[10]. 17 Preclinical studies have shown INO-4800 to be immunogenic[6], with durable cellular and 18 neutralizing antibody responses[11]. INO-4800 provided protection against viral challenge in 19 non-human primates with no evidence of vaccine-enhanced disease[12], and elicited 20 neutralizing antibodies reactive against multiple variants of concern (VOCs)[13]. 21 The preliminary safety and immunogenicity of INO-4800 in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical 22 studies have been previously reported[14, 15]. The earlier analysis[14] demonstrated that two 23 $FFHSWHG\u00030DQXVFULSW 7 doses of INO-4800 administered one month apart were well tolerated in 38 healthy participants 24 18-50 years of age and induced neutralizing antibodies and/or T-cells. Here we describe the 25 durability of that response at 6 months following the second dose, as well as the safety and 26 immunogenicity of the 2-dose regimen in older and elderly participants, including following a 27 subsequent homologous booster dose. 28 29 Methods 30 Trial Design and Participants 31 This Phase 1, open-label, multi-center trial (NCT04336410) evaluated the safety, tolerability, 32 and of INO-4800 injected intradermally (ID) followed by electroporation (EP). A 33 total of 120 healthy participants without a known history of COVID-19 were assigned to receive 34 a 0.5mg, 1.0mg, or 2.0mg dose of INO-4800 in a 2-dose regimen (weeks 0 and 4) and a 35 subsequent optional booster dose no earlier than 8 weeks after dose 2. An equal number of 36 participants were enrolled in each dose group (n=40) and further stratified by age groups [18-50 age; n=20, 51-\u0019\u0017\u0003\\HDUV\u0003RI\u0003DJH \u0003Q \u0014\u0013\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003\u0095\u0019\u0018\u0003\\HDUV\u0003RI\u0003DJH \u0003Q \u0014\u0013@\u0011 38 The trial was approved by the institutional review board of each clinical site, all participants 39 provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. The trial was conducted under current 40 Good Clinical Practices (GCP). 41 42 DNA Vaccine INO-4800 43 INO-4800 was previously described[6, 14] the SARS-44 CoV-2 spike glycoprotein derived from the Wuhan strain based on an optimized synthetic 45 $FFHSWHG\u00030DQXVFULSW 8 sequence created using a proprietary algorithm. The final vaccine drug product, manufactured 46 under Good Manufacturing Practices, was formulated at 10mg/mL in saline sodium citrate 47 buffer. 48 INO-4800 is injected ID followed by EP using the CELLECTRA\u00ae 2000 device that generates a 49 controlled electric field at the injection site to enhance the cellular uptake and expression of the 50 DNA plasmid as previously described[16, 17]. The device delivers a total of four electrical 51 pulses per EP, each of 52 msec in duration, at current of 0.2 Amp and voltage of 40-200 per 52 pulse. 53 Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine 57 &OLQLFDO\u00037ULDO\u00b4\u0003LQFOXGLQJ\u0003IUHTXHQF\\\u0003DQG\u0003VHYHULW\\\u0003RI\u0003LQMHFWLRQ\u0003VLWH\u0003UHDFWLRQV\u0011\u00033ULPDU\\\u0003LPPXQRORJLFDO\u000358 endpoints included the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein antigen-specific 59 binding antibodies as well as the measurement of antigen-specific cellular immune responses 60 by IFN-J, ELISPOT and flow cytometry assays. Endpoints reflected in this publication are 61 inclusive of 6 months after second dose (non-boosted participants) and, when applicable, 2 62 weeks after booster dose. 63 64 Trial Procedures 65 Vaccine was administered in 0.1 ml ID injections in the deltoid followed by EP at the injection 66 site. At each dosing visit, either a single injection for 0.5mg and 1.0mg dose groups or two 67 injections for 2.0mg dose group were given, one in each deltoid. 68 $FFHSWHG\u00030DQXVFULSW 9 Forty participants 18-50 years were enrolled sequentially into 1.0mg and 2.0mg dose groups 69 with a safety run-in period[14]. The trial design was expanded to include older participants in all 70 dosing groups (including a 0.5mg dose level). Upon favorable safety assessment review by an 71 independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of Week 1 data for 0.5mg dose group 72 participants aged 51-\u0019\u0017\u0003\\HDUV\u0003DQG\u0003\u0095\u0003\u0019\u0018\u0003\\HDUV\u000f\u0003HQUROOPHQW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003FRUUHVSRQGLQJ\u0003DJH\u0003VWUDWD\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u000373 1.0mg and subsequently 2.0mg dose groups was initiated. 74 Participants were assessed for safety (complete blood count, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), 75 including local and systemic AEs, at screening, Week 0 (Dose 1), next day phone call, and 76 Weeks 1, 4 (Dose 2), 6, 8, 12, 28, 40 and 52. Blood immunology collections occurred at all clinic 77 visits except Week 1. After the Week 12 visit, participants who consented to the optional booster 78 dose were transitioned to an extended schedule of events to include the booster dose (Dose 3) 79 and subsequent visits for safety at 2, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks following the booster dose with 80 blood immunology collections at all clinic visits except 36 weeks. 81 The DSMB reviewed laboratory and AE data for the participants up to 24 weeks after the 82 second dose (non-boosted) and 2 weeks after booster dose. 83 84 Protocol Eligibility 85 Key inclusion criteria included: healthy adults aged at least 18 years; and Body Mass Index of 86 18-30kg/m2 at screening. Key exclusion criteria included: individuals in a current occupation with 87 high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2; previous known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or receipt of 88 an investigational product for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19; autoimmune or 89 immunosuppression as a result of underlying illness or treatment; hypersensitivity or severe 90 $FFHSWHG\u00030DQXVFULSW 10 allergic reactions to vaccines or drugs; and medical conditions that increased risk for severe 91 COVID-19. 92 93 Immunogenicity Assessment Methods 94 Samples were collected at timepoints described above with screening and pre-dose 1 samples 95 considered baseline. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected as previously 96 described[14]. After isolation, PBMCs were stored in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer 97 until analysis, while serum samples were stored at -80\u00b0C. Eight participants were excluded from 98 the immunogenicity analyses due to a positive ELISA titer to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, 99 suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection 100 SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay: Serum samples were measured using a 101 pseudovirus neutralization assay as described previously[15]. Data was reported as ID50, which 102 is the reciprocal serum dilution resulting in 50% inhibition of infectivity by comparison to control 103 wells with no serum samples added. Supplementary methods show additional information. 104 SARS-CoV-2 Spike Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA): Binding antibodies to 105 protein were measured by ELISA as described previously[15]. SARS-CoV-2 106 spike antibody concentrations were determined by interpolation from a dilution curve of SARS-107 CoV-2 convalescent plasma with an assigned concentration of 20,000 Units/mL. Supplementary 108 methods show additional information. measured as described previously[14]. Values were reported as the mean 111 spot-forming units per million PBMCs across three triplicate wells after background subtraction 112 using DMSO-only negative control wells. Supplementary methods show additional information. 113 $FFHSWHG\u00030DQXVFULSW 11 INO-4800 SARS-CoV-2 Spike Flow Lytic Granule Loading (LGL) 115 was performed as previously described[14]. The LGL assay was also performed as reported 116 previously[18] following stimulation with overlapping peptides to the full-length spike protein to 117 measure CD8+T cell activation and capacity to produce lytic proteins. 118 Statistical Analysis 119 No formal power analysis was applicable to this trial. Descriptive statistics were used to 120 summarize the safety endpoints based on the safety population: proportions of participants with 121 AEs, through 6 months following dose 2 (non-boosted participants) or 2 weeks following booster 122 dose. The safety population included all participants who received at least one dose of INO-123 4800 and were grouped by age and the dose of INO-4800. Post-hoc within subject analyses of 124 post-vaccination minus pre-vaccination paired differences in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and 125 ELISA spike responses (on the natural log-scale, with a paired t-test), ELISpot responses (with 126 Wilcoxon signed-rank tests), and flow assay responses (with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) were 127 performed. 128 129 Results 130 Trial Population Demographics 131 Between 06 April 2020 and 07 July 2020, 154 participants were screened and 120 enrolled into 132 the trial (Figure 1). The median age was 50.5 years (range 18 to 86 years). Participants were 133 57.5% female (69/120) and 42.5% male (51/120) (Table 1). Most participants were white 134 (94.2%, 113/120). 135 $FFHSWHG\u00030DQXVFULSW 12 136 Vaccine Safety and Tolerability 137 A total of 117 of 120 (97.5%) participants received both doses. One participant in the 2.0 mg 138 group discontinued trial participation prior to receiving the second dose solely due to lack of 139 transportation to the clinical site. Two participants in the 0.5 mg group did not receive the 140 second dose due to exclusionary eligibility criteria (hypertension) having been determined 141 following Dose 1; (Figure 1). 142 Ninety-nine of 120 (82.5%) participants consented to and received the booster dose, 143 approximately 6 to 10.5 months following the second dose. Reasons for not receiving booster 144 dose included receipt of another SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (available under Emergency Use 145 Authorization), new medical condition precluding participation (having had COVID-19, 146 pregnancy or hypertension), or loss to follow-up. 147 A total of 34 treatment-related local and systemic AEs were reported by 18 participants. Thirty-148 one AEs were Grade 1 (mild) in severity and comprised mostly injection site reactions. Three 149 treatment-related Grade 2 (moderate) AEs were reported as lethargy, abdominal pain, and 150 injection site pruritus. There were no febrile reactions reported. No participants discontinued due 151 to AEs. No treatment-related SAEs were reported. There were no abnormal laboratory values 152 that were deemed treatment-related and clinically significant by the Investigators. There was no 153 increase in the number of participants who experienced related AEs in the 2.0 mg group 154 (12.5%, 5/40), compared to that in the 1.0 mg group (15%, 6/40) or the 0.5 mg group (17.5%, 155 7/40). In addition, there was no appreciable increase in the frequency of AEs with the second or 156 booster doses when compared to the first dose (Figure 2). A decrease in frequency of 157 treatment-related AEs in the older and elderly age cohorts was observed when compared to the 158 younger age group (Supplementary Table 4). 159 $FFHSWHG\u00030DQXVFULSW 13 160 INO-4800 induces durable humoral immune responses capable of being boosted: Induction of 161 antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 following vaccination with INO-4800 was measured from sera. 162 The functionality of antibodies was assessed using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. All dose 163 groups induced neutralizing antibodies that peaked two weeks post second dose (GMTs- 14.9, 164 19.1, 54.1 in the 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg dose groups, respectively) (Figure 3A, left panel, 165 Supplementary Table 1). These increased responses were statistically significant over 166 baseline in the 2.0 mg dose group for each time point through study week 28, approximately 6 167 months after dose 2 (Figure 3A, table). Following administration of a booster dose, statistically 168 significant increases over pre-boost titers were observed in all dose groups (GMTs- 58.7, 76.1, 169 100 in the 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg dose groups, respectively; all P<0.001) (Figure 3A, right 170 panel, Supplementary Table 1). The 2.0 mg dose group had a 12.8 (95%CI 6.3, 26.0) 171 geometric fold rise (GMFR) over pre-boost titers, the highest of any dose group. Neutralization 172 titers by participant age are shown in Supplementary Figure 1A; GMTs were numerically lower 173 in the older age groups but statistically significantly higher than baseline at week 6 in the 2.0 mg 174 dose group. Plasma samples from convalescent samples had a GMT of 922 and ranged from 175 10 to 13,249 (Supplementary Figure 2A). 176 Antibodies to the spike trimer protein were measured in a binding ELISA. All three groups 177 exhibited binding antibodies that peaked four weeks following dose 2 (Geometric Mean Titers, 178 GMTs- 428.5, 595.9, 678.0 in the 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg dose groups, respectively) (Figure 179 3B, left panel, Supplementary Table 2). Increases over baseline were observed in all 180 participants who received the 2.0 mg dose, but not in all participants in the other groups, and 181 GMTs were statistically significantly higher than baseline 6 months following dose 2 (GMTs- 182 250.1, 215.3, 407.2 in the 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg dose groups, respectively; all P<0.026). 183 Following administration of a booster dose, statistically significant increases over pre-boost 184 $FFHSWHG\u00030DQXVFULSW 14 titers were observed in all dose groups (GMTs- 1963.8, 3685, 5953 in the 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 185 2.0 mg dose groups, respectively; all P<0.007) (Figure 3B, right panel, Supplementary Table 186 2). The 2.0 mg dose group had a 20.8 (95%CI 13.9, 31.2) GMFR over pre-boost titers which 187 was the highest of any dose group. ELISA binding titers by participant age are shown in 188 Supplementary Figure 1B. Plasma samples from convalescent samples had a GMT of 19,444 189 and ranged from 330 to 247,200 (Supplementary Figure 2B). 190 INO-4800 induces cellular immune responses capable of being boosted 191 Interferon-gamma (IFNJ) ELISpot was performed on PBMCs. Increases in spot forming units 192 (SFU) per million PBMCs over baseline are shown in Figure 4A, left panel. Magnitudes of IFNJ 193 peaked at week 6 for the 0.5 mg and 2.0 mg dose groups (median 19.4 and 43.3, respectively) 194 and at week 8 for the 1.0 mg dose group (median 17.8). Six months following dose 2, 195 magnitudes remained high in the 2.0 mg dose group (median 19.6). Of note, magnitudes in the 196 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg dose groups were statistically significantly increased following the booster 197 dose (P=0.018 and P=0.008, respectively) (Figure 4A, right panel). The 2.0 mg dose group 198 had a difference in medians of 10 following the booster, resulting in the highest post-boost 199 increase of any dose group. ELISpot responses by participant age are shown in 200 Supplementary Figure 3A. 201 INO-4800 induces cytokine producing T cells and activated CD8+T cells with lytic potential 202 The contribution of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was assessed by intracellular 203 cytokine staining (ICS) on participants following 2 doses, Figure 4B-C. The median frequency 204 of CD4+T cells producing IFNJ increased following vaccination in all three dose groups of INO-205 4800, and the frequency of CD4+T cells producing TNFD was statistically significantly increased 206 in the 2.0 mg dose group (P<0.001) (Figure 4B). The frequency of CD8+T cells producing 207 TNFD was statistically significantly increased following vaccination in all three dose groups of 208 $FFHSWHG\u00030DQXVFULSW 15 INO-4800 (All P<0.041) (Figure 4C). The 2.0 mg dose group had the highest difference in 209 medians for CD8+T cells producing any response, IFNJ and TNFD (0.066, 0.026, and 0.011 210 respectively). Responses by participant age are shown in Supplementary Figure 3B-C. 211 SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+T cells were also characterized on a subset of participants with 212 remaining sample following 3 doses by a flow cytometry assay that included activation markers 213 CD69 and CD137. The median frequency of CD8+CD69+CD137+ cells increased following 214 immunization with 2.0 mg of INO-4800, with a difference in the medians of 0.072 (Figure 5A, 215 left panel). Further characterization of these activated cells, including the co-expression of 216 proteins utilized in cytolytic killing (granzyme A, granzyme B, perforin or granulysin) revealed a 217 statistically significant increase in both the 1.0 mg (P=0.008) and 2.0 mg (P=0.003) dose groups 218 (Figure 5A middle and right panels). The 2.0 mg dose group had a difference in medians of 219 0.085 in the CD69+CD137+ population co-expressing perforin and granzymes A and B and 220 0.054 in the population co-expressing granulysin. CD8+T cells expressing the activation marker 221 CD38 and proliferation marker Ki67 were also assessed (Figure 5B and C, respectively). The 222 frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD38+CD8+T cells statistically significantly increased 223 following 2.0 mg of INO-4800 (P=0.016), with a difference in medians of 1.45 (Figure 5B, left 224 panel). CD38+CD8+T cells with lytic potential (Figure 5B middle and right panels) statistically 225 significantly increased following 2.0 mg of INO-4800 (P<0.001). Following immunization with 2.0 226 mg of INO-4800, the mean frequency of activated CD8+T cells expressing granzymes A and B 227 and perforin was 1.7% with a difference in medians of 0.710 and those expressing granulysin 228 was 1.8% with a difference in medians of 0.433 (Figure 5B middle and right panels). 229 Statistically significant increases in the frequency of these CTL phenotypes were also observed 230 in the 1.0 mg dose group (P<0.012) (Figure 5B middle and right panels). The 2.0 mg dose 231 group had the highest frequencies of CD8+T cells expressing Ki67 with a difference in medians 16 Ki67+ populations were statistically significantly increased in the 2.0 mg dose group (P<0.001; 234 Figure 5C). The 2.0 mg dose group consistently showed the highest median responses across 235 all phenotypes assessed compared to the other groups. 236 237 Discussion 238 This report provides results for the expansion of a Phase 1 trial to include older and elderly 239 participants and an optional booster dose with the aim to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 240 immunogenicity of INO-4800, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine encoding the S protein[14], including the 241 immune responses 6 months following dose 2 and 2 weeks following the optional booster dose. 242 INO-4800 appeared to be well-tolerated at all three dose levels, with no treatment-related 243 serious adverse events (SAEs) reported. Most AEs were mild in severity and did not increase in 244 frequency with age and subsequent dosing. These results are consistent with the severity of 245 AEs and lack of treatment-related SAEs observed in the U.S. Phase 2 trial comparing the 1.0 246 mg and 2.0 mg doses of INO-4800 in approximately 400 subjects[15] and those studies 247 conducted outside the U.S. by Inovio collaborators (International Vaccine Institute, Advaccine \u00b1 248 manuscripts in preparation). The lower frequency of treatment-related AEs reported by older 249 and elderly participants in our study is consistent with findings of other studies evaluating 250 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines[19, 20]. Weaker inflammatory reactions consequent to 251 immunosenescence may explain the lower incidence of AEs among elderly participants[21, 22]. 252 Induction of both humoral and cellular responses were observed across all three dose groups, 253 inclusive of binding and neutralizing antibodies and cytokine producing T cells as well as 254 exhibiting lytic potential. Immunization with the 2.0 mg dose resulted in the highest GMTs of 255 neutralizing and binding antibodies as well as the highest magnitudes of IFNJ production to 256 $FFHSWHG\u00030DQXVFULSW 17 SARS-CoV-2 of any dose in all age groups tested, and the increases in antibody levels were 257 statistically significant above baseline at 6 months following dose 2. Importantly, increases in 258 both humoral and cellular immune responses were statistically significant following the booster 259 dose. 260 The contribution of the CD8+T cell response to vaccine efficacy has become increasingly 261 recognized as they have been detected early after vaccination[23] and due to their role in 262 controlling infection[24, 25]. Specifically, it has been established that CD8+T cells expressing 263 cytokines such as IFNJ and TNFD as well as markers involved in activation status and 264 proliferation such as CD38 and Ki67 contribute to limiting disease severity during SARS-CoV-2 265 infection[24]. Additional studies have identified the expression of CD69 and CD137 on SARS-266 CoV-2 specific CD8+T cells being associated with less severe disease[25]. This expanded 267 Phase 1 trial demonstrates that immunization with INO-4800 induces SARS-CoV-2 specific 268 CD8+T cells exhibiting these specific characteristics, suggesting the induction of a vaccine-269 induced cellular response that has potential to protect against severe COVID-19. As VoCs 270 continue to emerge, the generation of cross-reactive activated CD8+T cells with lytic potential is 271 likely to play an important role in preventing severe disease. We have previously demonstrated 272 that vaccination with INO-4800 induces T cells and neutralizing antibodies that are active 273 against the parental SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 VoCs[26]. We 274 acknowledge limitations to this trial that include the relatively small study population and the 275 limited number of PBMCs available for testing across more than one assay. This trial was not 276 powered to formally compare immune responses between dose groups or age stratifications. In 277 addition, due to different immune assays and methodologies employed by various groups, it is 278 not possible to directly compare immune responses observed in this trial to those elicited from 279 other vaccine platforms or to determine if the magnitudes observed in this trial are sufficient to 280 confer clinical benefit. 281 $FFHSWHG\u00030DQXVFULSW 18 The immune responses observed in the current trial and in our larger Phase 2 trial[15] support 282 advancing the 2.0 mg dose of INO-4800 to a Phase 3 efficacy evaluation. This dose has elicited 283 the highest binding and neutralizing antibody titers, the highest T-cell cytokine production from 284 both CD4+ and CD8+T cells, and the highest expression of markers associated with attenuation 285 of severe COVID-19 on CD8+T cells. 286 This trial demonstrated that immune responses elicited by a 2-dose primary series of INO-4800 287 could be boosted by a third dose without safety or tolerability concerns and positions INO-4800 288 as an important candidate for continued development as a stand-alone SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 289 as well as for continued examination in combination approaches. The potential ability to 290 administer INO-4800 multiple times, with high tolerability, along with its ease of scalability and 291 thermostability, contribute to its potential value in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. 292 $FFHSWHG\u00030DQXVFULSW 19 Declaration of Interests KAK, EB, JA, MG, DA, ACQ, NL, VA, AS, MPM, JDB, MPM, Jr. report grants from Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, during the conduct of the trial; other from Inovio Pharmaceuticals, outside the submitted work.
