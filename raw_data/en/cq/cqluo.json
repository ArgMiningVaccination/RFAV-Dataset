It's purported to offer several health benefits, such as refreshing and stimulating the skin and lymphatic system and releasing accumulated toxins. Read on to learn more about where this centuries-old ritual came from, its benefits and how to practice it. What Is Dry Brushing? \"Dry brushing has its origins in many ancient cultures, from Ayurveda to traditional Chinese medicine,\" says Sanober Pezad Doctor, M.D., an integrative and holistic dermatologist in Dallas, Texas. Traditional Chinese practices used dried fibers from a gourd fruit and Ancient Greeks and Romans used a bronze instrument and oil to remove dirt before bathing. Benefits of Dry Brushing Although there are no clinical trials to validate the benefits of dry brushing, experts agree that when done correctly, dry brushing is a healthy practice. Moreover, dry brushing is relatively safe and inexpensive\u2014the only cost is purchasing the brush. According to experts, benefits of dry brushing include the following: Exfoliation: \"The main benefit of dry brushing is exfoliation of dead skin cells,\" says Hyemin Pomerantz, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist in Wellesley, Massachusetts. \"The top of the skin is covered with a layer of dead skin cells called stratum corneum. If this layer of the skin becomes thicker, the skin feels rough,\" explains Dr. Pomerantz. Gentle dry brushing makes the skin appear smoother and more radiant. Opens pores: Dry brushing opens the pores, allowing the skin to better absorb a facial moisturizer or topical prescription as there are less dead skin cells to penetrate, adds Dr. Pomrenatz. Detoxification: \"Dry brushing helps to detoxify the body by stimulating the lymphatic system,\" explains Renee Kindler, a board-certified nurse practitioner, functional health consultant and CEO of Aonani Functional Medicine in Garden City, Idaho. The lymphatic system is a fine-meshed structure that includes lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes and certain organs. A well-functioning lymphatic system is essential to the immune system and is also interrelated to the body's fluid balance and digestive system. Supports immune system: \"The lymphatic system is a collection of organs and tissues with one way valves that move fluids, including white blood cells and waste products through our body,\" notes Kindler. \"Good lymphatic flow is important to support good immune system health as it is one way our body 'takes out the trash,'\" she says. \"Removing the 'trash' from our body is one way we detox our system, supporting good immune system function. The light pressure of dry brushing can help stimulate our lymphatic system and support this movement,\" she explains. May improve cellulite: Research suggests stimulation of the lymphatic system, utilizing specific manual and mechanical techniques, can reduce cellulite, according to a small, 2011 study published in Clinical, Cosmetic, and Investigational Dermatology [[1]](#footnote_1). Though the study refers to lymphatic drainage methods other than dry brushing, Dr. Doctor notes the treatment and its findings serve as a basic principle for dry brushing and its benefits. Relaxation: \"The mechanism of touch and taking time for [self-care](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/mental-self-care/) support the calming of the vagus nerve,\" says Kindler. Originating in the brain and extending down to the abdomen, the vagus nerve is the longest nerve in the body and contains sensory and motor fibers that branch out into the major organ systems. A major function of the vagus nerve is to help the body \"rest and digest\" by promoting cardiac relaxation. Stimulates energy and circulation: \"One way dry brushing stimulates energy is through the mechanism of improved self care,\" says Kindler. \"Spending time to care for your body in a relaxing environment before a bath is calming and can help activate your parasympathetic immune system,\" she notes. Dr. Doctor adds that dry brushing immediately after waking up in the morning helps improve circulation, which can help make you alert, while promoting feelings of relaxation. How to Practice Dry Brushing If you're interested in adding dry brushing to your weekly wellness regimen, consider the following steps for proper tools and techniques. Choose the Right Dry Brush Selecting the appropriate bristle type is an important first step in dry brushing. Experts recommend a brush made of natural bristles. Avoid synthetic bristles as they can be rough on the skin. Natural bristles are commonly made of the following materials: - Wool - Raw silk - Cotton - Vegetable fibers - Boar bristles - Sisal fibers from agave plant Bristle strength is important to consider as well. \"This should be an experience of self-care, so it's best to pick a brush that does not cause pain,\" advises Dr. Pomerantz. A brush with medium to firm bristles works best on the body, according to Dr. Doctor. If dry brushing the face, she recommends using a separate brush made with softer bristles. \"Keeping a separate brush for the face is useful from a hygienic standpoint,\" she adds. The length of a brush's handle can also impact your practice. \"Somewhere between 6 to 12 inches is ideal,\" notes Kindler. Longer brushes (typically 16 inches in length) may be suitable for taller individuals or harder to reach areas, such as the back. Dry Brushing Technique Experts recommend dry brushing before showering or bathing. This helps wash away dead skin cells, says Dr. Pomerantz. Dry brushing done early in the day after waking improves circulation and can keep you alert. \"This promotes the feeling of happiness and a possible energy boost,\" notes Dr. Doctor. \"[It is] important to know the order and direction of dry brushing [since] lymph travels just beneath the skin in a very specific directional pattern,\" she adds. To properly dry brush your body, get undressed and follow these steps in your bathroom before entering the bathtub or shower: - Start dry brushing at the feet and move upwards towards the heart. Use circular motions at the ankles and knees. - Move in long strokes upwards from the feet and legs, always moving in the direction of the heart. - Apply gentle pressure where the skin is thin, such as the underarms, and firmer pressure where the skin is thick, such as the soles of the feet. - Working your way up the body, dry brush the abdominal area, low back, buttocks and hip joint in a clockwise motion. - Brush from the hands to the shoulder using short strokes. At the wrists and elbows, use small, circular motions. - Brush the neck and shoulders using short strokes. Use circular motions on the chest area. - If you're dry brushing your face, be gentle and use a separate brush made with softer bristles. Lightly dry brush the face, including the ears, using small circular motions, moving from the center outwards. Use very light, gentle pressure in this area. - After dry brushing, shower or bathe, and then apply moisturizer to the skin. Dry brushing should take about five to seven minutes, according to Dr. Doctor. Keep in mind, brushing for a longer period may irritate the skin, so be sure to only practice for as long as is appropriate for your body. To clean your dry brush, wash it with warm soapy water, rinse and let it air dry in the sun. Kindler recommends beginners start dry brushing one to two times per week, eventually working their way up to three to four times a week. Is Dry Brushing Safe? Dry brushing is relatively safe for most people, according to experts. However, if done too often or too vigorously, the practice may cause irritation. \"If you experience irritation or redness, it's a cue to reduce the intensity and frequency of your strokes,\" says Dr. Doctor. Some people can have an adverse reaction to the release of toxins from dry brushing, depending on their overall health, says Kindler. \"[This] can include general fatigue, aches, acne or eczema flare up, headache or digestive issues,\" she adds, suggesting people monitor themselves after dry brushing. \"If you feel unwell after dry brushing, then decrease the frequency or check in with your holistic care provider for additional support,\" she says. Kindler recommends dry brushing one to two days a week to begin, and monitoring for any reaction before increasing the practice. Risks of Dry Brushing Experts recommend people with the following conditions avoid dry brushing: People with darker skin tones and those who are prone to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (a common sin condition that occurs after damage, injury or inflammation to the skin) need to be more careful with dry brushing, says Dr. Doctor. Those with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can develop macular amyloidosis, a condition in which abnormal proteins (amyloids) build up between the top two layers of skin. Before adding dry brushing to your wellness routine, speak to your health care provider, an esthetician or a holistic doctor to determine if dry brushing is right for you. "}
