The immune system can be a rather abstract part of our health. But you must look after it. The immune system is your body's natural defense system. It's a network of organs, tissues, and cells that fight back against harmful substances that invade your body. Your immune system protects you from the deleterious effects of: Bacteria Parasites Fungus Viruses And more The immune system works by creating a sort of barrier to block these things from entering the body. If one of these substances manages to get past the barrier, then the immune system creates white blood cells to attack and destroy it. A healthy immune system does all of this more effectively. Having one will help you to both keep harmful substances from entering your body and destroy them when they slip past your body's defenses. How do essential oils build immunity? To understand this, you need to first understand what essential oils are. They're highly concentrated versions of plants. So, they enable you to access whatever is in a plant in a more concentrated form. Certain plants contain naturally-occurring immunostimulatory properties. In other words, some plants contain nutrients, which will help your immune system function better. Some examples of this include echinacea, eucalyptus, tea tree, and bergamot. Essential oils are created out of plants that naturally support a healthier immune system. When you use these, you get access to a highly-concentrated version of those beneficial nutrients. That's how essential oils help you to build up your immunity. What essential oils are good for immunity? Here are four of the best essential oils for immunity. Eucalyptus Eucalyptus essential oil offers a clean, crisp scent that sometimes features a touch of lemon or peppermint. The oil is extracted from the leaves of eucalyptus trees. It's known to both support the immune and respiratory systems. You can use eucalyptus essential oil as both a preventative measure and to reduce inflammation at the onset of an infection. Tea Tree Tea tree essential oil has a pungent scent that packs several health-supportive benefits. It can be used to improve your recovery from infection and to ward off the next one thanks to its powerful antibacterial and antiseptic qualities. Bergamot Bergamot essential oil has a bright, citrusy scent that brings to mind a summer day. It's not only uplifting and relaxing but will also help to regulate and balance your body's systems. It can be used to relieve a bad mood and improve the symptoms of anxiety and depression as well. Thyme Linalool Thyme linalool essential oil is a dark oil with a herbaceous scent. It features the naturally-occurring health benefits of thyme, which include: Antiseptic support Respiratory aid Bacteria elimination Immunity reinforcement Can essential oils kill germs? Absolutely! A number of studies have independently concluded that essential oils can be an effective way to destroy several bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. You can even use essential oils to create your all-natural cleaning products by purchasing one of our Wellness Maker Kits. But not all essential oils offer these benefits. If you'd like to use essential oils to kill germs, then make sure that you use one of the following types: Tea tree Eucalyptus Lemon Lavender Peppermint Cinnamon What is in immunity blend essential oils? Some people choose to mix multiple essential oils to access several different health and wellness benefits with a single application.

Creating essential oils blends is as easy as mixing the oils that you want in the blend together with one another. It can be helpful to follow recipes to make sure that you get the proportions of your blend right. But even that's not necessary. The one thing that we will note is that you need to keep yourself safe while you make these blends. Essential oils are highly concentrated and will damage your skin if you're not careful. So make sure that you're wearing gloves while you create. Similarly, it's a good idea to wear pants and a shirt with long sleeves just to make sure that you don't inadvertently splash some of your mixtures onto your skin somewhere. What essential oils should you avoid when focusing on immunity? There aren't any essential oils that you need to avoid while focusing on your immune system. All essential oils can be a healthy addition to your body. You would just want to use more of the essential oils that support your immune system when you want to focus on immunity. But there are a variety of other things that you should avoid while working on your immune system's health. Certain foods and drinks can seriously inhibit your immune system's ability to protect itself from harmful substances. For example, soda and alcohol should both be avoided while you focus on this part of your health. Soda has been linked to weight gain and obesity, which puts a person at risk for suppressed immune function. Some studies have linked alcohol to negative immune system responses. You should also try to avoid any foods that consist primarily of sugar, could lead to weight gain, or could prevent you from getting any sleep at night. Each of these things can inhibit the efforts that you're making to improve your immune system's health. How do you use essential oils for immunity? There are several different ways that you can use essential oils. The most common method is to diffuse them through the air via a process called aromatherapy. This spreads the essential oil throughout the air and enables you to benefit from it by simply breathing. We have a beautiful waterless essential oil diffuser and a handy car diffuser in our shop if you need one. Some people prefer to apply essential oils directly to their skin. You can do this but the oil that you use needs to be diluted with a carrier oil. These prevent the essential oils from doing any damage to your skin. One popular example of this method is the rollerball technique. Rollerballs are small devices that are filled with a combination of carrier oils and essential oils. They allow people to apply this mixture directly to their temples, wrists, or another pulse point on their body. Rollerballs are convenient because they can be taken with you everywhere you go. How do I find what I need? If you're serious about boosting the strength of your immune system with essential oils, you need the right products to achieve the results you're after. You'll find those in the Nourished Essential shop. We sell essential oils, carrier oils, and tools to maximize the impact of your oils.
