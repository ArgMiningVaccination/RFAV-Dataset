Time and time again, we have stressed that optimal health is never only physical but rather mental, emotional and spiritual. My guest who will explain all about our soul's spiritual healing is none other than Spiritual Healer, Medium, Animal Communicator, Medical Intuitive, Eternal Psychologist, Author, and Natural Born Exorcist Eric Thorton. Discovering His Gifts Eric Thorton grew up with people telling him his gifts are \"on.\" To them, he was a Master, referring to his innate ability like spiritual healing. He was born with the ability to see, hear, experience, communicate with things that are beyond human sight. \"We all see things at the corner of our eyes. And we see a flash, but there's nothing there,\" said Eric Thorton. \"I get to feel it right in front of me. But I learned at a young age not to talk about these things. Because people didn't want to hear it.\" When Eric Thorton would see a physical problem, he gets information primarily on anything he concentrates on. As he got older, Eric Thorton went into construction and used his gift on his work. Physical Experience When his brother got the flu, Eric Thorton would feel his flu and get the flu. His brother, on the other hand, would feel better. Because of that, people thought that Eric Thorton was sickly when in fact, he absorbed his brother's illness. \"I'd resist the healing energy and cause heat in the palm of the hand and bottoms of feet. And then because you are resisting, your pancreas drains all your blood sugar, and you get this pain in your side,\" explains Eric Thorton. He adds, \"I keep my hands and feet covered. And I get these dark red marks till they turn brown. I kept my hands to myself and didn't share it with anybody.\" Brother's Illness When Eric Thorton was ten, his 12-year-old brother had terminal cancer. A day before surgery, Sister Denise who was a friend of his mom, came to the hospital. She knew Eric Thorton was a healer and could do spiritual healing. Sister Denise told Eric Thorton to put his hand on his brother and join them in prayer. His brother went into surgery the next day, and the cancer was gone! \"I started healing 30 years later when Sister Denise got me into this full-time. People feel odd around it, and they will feel special things. It's an ongoing thing throughout my life. I can turn it off so to speak now. It can be overwhelming,\" Eric Thorton said. Healing A Friend Eric Thorton had a client from his construction business who was dying from cancer. He was a psychiatrist. His wife called Eric Thorton one day, to tell him her husband was in the hospital to die, and she was asking for a healer with spiritual healing capabilities. After a little prodding, Eric Thorton went with Sister Denise, and upon putting his hand over his client, Eric Thorton felt this tremendous energy come over himself. The whole process took an hour and drained Eric Thorton physically. His client had a demon inside of him which was making him sick. Eric Thorton believes the demon probably got into his son who was three to four years old. His son had instant pneumonia when Eric Thorton went home from the hospital. They prayed and went to the hospital where his son was diagnosed with double pneumonia. The next day, his son got better. Realizations Eric Thorton soon realized that if he was to help people, he can't get sick. He had gifts. However, no books were written about people like him. \"Gift of faith, not in a church, but in what you are experiencing. Gift of command, the gift of second sight, second knowledge, and hearing,\" said Eric Thorton. He added, \"We are souls, and our body is temporary. But we have a soul experience. It is experiencing growth and other beings. I've learned that's what we are. We identify with the body. And we identify with the body; we get things like allopathic medicine.\" But Eric Thorton also says allopathic medicine is not good at the difficult things or the things that get us ill. So, he is forced to listen to the guides, angels and other beings about what is going on with the individual and why they have the illness. An Exorcist Eric Thorton explains an exorcist removes energy. It can have a life of its own, or it can be in another being's life. It can be dramatic, but most of it isn't. He learned over the years that we label different types of energy and beings. And labeling makes it more difficult to come to a neutral state in the energetic field. \"I'm constantly learning new types of energy like though forms. Thought forms can appear,\" reveals Eric Thorton. \"People can see them as a being or in the more intense as someone thinks of something, the thicker that energy gets. It can control the behavior of people that contribute or part of that culture. And it tells you when you are within the culture and when you are leaving that culture.\" So, with people who have cancer, people like Eric Thorton disconnects them from their thought forms. They see some positivity. Through the years Eric Thorton also learned what questions to ask and raise the questions. He looks at where the symptoms come from. Spiritual Healing and Energy To understand spiritual healing, we must first know that we are spiritual beings having a physical experience. The energy is where everything we do affect us. Everything is in everything we do. Every intention, every thought and it affects our mental, spiritual and physical health. \"I work with a lot of doctors. We can clarify what's blocking. What I learned through the years is that like energy comes together. The power of positive thinking is amazing,\" said Eric Thorton. \"And the power of negative thinking hits us first. It comes from a past life; it comes from this life, it comes from attitude we get from childhood. We all experience it.\" Understanding Anger Angry people don't hang out with people who are not angry. Eric Thorton says, on the other hand, positive people don't want to hang out with someone who is negative. \"Angry people draw angry situations to them. They draw angry words, behavior, actions, and angry entities. And it is designed that way to make us grow,\" Eric Thorton explains. He adds, \"Anger is a primary emotion. Our primary emotion is safety. Everything relates to safety. Even getting married or falling in love relates to safety. Because we do things better in numbers.\" Understanding Emotions According to Eric Thorton, secondary emotion is things borne out of frustration. Frustration and love have to do with you being safe. While anger comes when you are frustrated, unheard and unrecognized, that's why he says anger is a tertiary emotion. It's a reaction to a reaction. \"A soul doesn't have emotions. The soul could learn emotions, and the soul looks at anger as amazing. It's an opportunity for growth,\" said Eric Thorton. \"So, we look at anger, negative emotion, and positive emotion as an opportunity.\" And Eric Thorton adds that if we all look into opportunity, we won't try to get away from it. We wouldn't deny it. But we would go through with the emotion. So, he advises looking at every emotion as an opportunity. Anger turns into positive searching. In the same way, that frustration is an opportunity for conversation. Room For Growth Eric Thorton looks at entities as something to learn from, grow from and then it can be removed from the energy field. He believes that if it is commanded out of someone's energy, you do not hear anything. \"You're still leaving that negativity in that person. And that energy will come back and fill the space. That's why a typical exorcism is so difficult,\" Eric Thorton said. When Eric Thorton was growing up, he got to see the psychology of what he was seeing energetically and watch it unfold physically. Then he started learning about this balance between spiritual energy and physical. Eric Thorton then began to understand what was going on. And that works with animals as well. \"We grow from our past life. And we bring that into this life in the form of things that we're good at and things that we have fears of. So, we bring those things forward. Our past life gives us most of our innate abilities. Most of it is positive,\" said Eric Thorton. Making a ChiBall Eric Thorton says making a ChiBall is mostly intention. Just do it. You experience it in your body; you have a reaction and channel that through the third chakra. \"It comes out and creates this massive energy in front of you. Put your hands above your belly button,\" Eric Thorton said. \"Start thinking, and you can push at this space, so your hands are split apart. And you push together as you're pushing this opportunity. You can feel resistance.\" Feeling Your Way Through For the sake of the energy exchange, Eric Thorton says you don't have to go through that extent. But it's good practice to that extent, to start feeling it. And realize that something is happening here. Everybody can feel it. \"Medicine men and women don't participate in the drama of their clients. They have compassionate detachment, so they can have a way more compassion,\" Eric Thorton said. \"If you have compassion attachment, your body gets overwhelmed, and you get sick.\" He adds, \"But if you have compassion detachment, compassion is wonderful. You get to help people without being harmed in the short run or the long run.\" Bio A session with Eric Thorton internationally recognized metaphysical counselor, exorcist, psychic, healer, and author of Educating the Soul, Spiritual Healing, and Our Eternal Psychology\u00ae can awaken the spirit within you.
