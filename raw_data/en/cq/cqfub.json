Before busting the myths around the benefits of Borax, let's understand what it is. Have a look: Borax Borax, also known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or disodium tetraborate, is an important boron compound, a mineral, and a salt of boric acid. Powdered borax is white, consisting of soft colorless crystals that dissolve easily in water. It is believed that it improves the natural ability of the human body to absorb calcium and magnesium. Borax is commonly used as a natural cleaning agent. Fruits like apples, oranges, red grapes, pears, plums, kiwis, sultanas, dates, as well as certain vegetables, avocado, soybeans, and nuts are rich sources of boron. Other notable sources of Boron are chickpeas, hazelnuts, currants, peanut butter, red kidney beans, tomato, lentils, olive, onion, potato wine, and beer. Popular Myths Around Health Benefits of Borax Prevents Arthritis Boron is a treatment option for arthritis, because of its anti-inflammatory powers. Some people believe that those with arthritis have lower boron concentrations in their bones along with synovial fluid, and femur heads. Thus use of Boron can stem this. Boron ensures that calcium levels are maximized and used effectively, thus preventing arthritis. Heals swollen Throat, Mouth, And Tongue Sores Boron is a remedy that is used as a topical treatment for certain health problems like sores on the tongue or mouth, as well as swelling in the throat. It can cause toxins to disperse from the affected area, bringing down swelling. Borax also eases pain linked to swelling or sores. This remedy includes the application of a paste made by combining borax with Cinnabaris, Borneolum, and Natrii Sulfas Exsiccatus. Relief from Painful Swollen Red Eye Borax is paired with Calamina, Borneolum, and Natrii Sulfas Exsiccatus to create eye drops. These are used to soothe the eye when it is red and swollen. Boron protects the eye from a host of parasitic attacks and other nasty fungal infections. Solves Menstrual Problems Boron helps ease menstrual problems in women. Some believe it helps with the maintenance of normal uterine and menstrual function. This makes it beneficial to women with dysmenorrhoea or amenorrhoea, commonly referred to as irregular or absent periods. It is believed that its use along with other herbs can help treat PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome or PCOS. Boron can also cure the symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats that are typically associated with menopause, clotted menstruation, painful menstruation, and it ensures that the mineral level remains at appropriate levels since post-menopausal women often suffer from hormonal imbalances that can skew many of the body's most important systems. Cures Urinary Infections Borax acts on the urinary bladder, uterus, and stomach, besides the lungs. Its antimicrobial benefits can therefore be tapped to cure urinary infections. Some people suggest borax for those with cystitis, a condition that causes a sharp pain in the urinary opening and a general ache in the bladder that gives you a feeling of urine being retained. Enhances Testosterone Levels Boron is able to enhance the testosterone level in males; this quality is increasingly taken advantage of by male bodybuilders and athletes. Although some weightlifters prefer to take its supplements to enhance their testosterone levels, there has been no concrete evidence or explanation of the mechanism by which it helps to make them any more successful. Enhancement of female libido It is believed that a quarter of a teaspoon of borax added to one quart of drinking water sipped throughout the course of a day while taking magnesium supplements can reverse male impotency. This can be attributed to the many effects of borax on the human body. Borax stabilizes calcium and magnesium in the blood. It stimulates hormone production. Toxic states of hyper fluoride accumulation, internal fungal growth, and dangerous microbe production are normalized by borax consumption. Cures Womb Inflammation Women suffering from womb inflammation are recommended to soak in lukewarm bathwater with borax twice a day. If women displayed profuse, egg-white-like discharge or leucorrhea, they were told to douche with borax and lukewarm water solution three to four times per day. Other symptoms that can be alleviated by borax and water exposure include painful sexual intercourse, blood-streaked vaginal discharge, abdominal distention, and false signs of pregnancy. Despite these popular beliefs, there are not enough medical studies available to support these claims. Hence, it is highly recommended to use borax only if your doctor prescribes. Uses of Borax - Borax is used in various household laundry and cleaning products, including the '20 Mule Team Borax' laundry booster, 'Boraxo' powdered hand soap, and some tooth-bleaching formulas. - Borate ions (commonly supplied as boric acid) are used in biochemical and chemical laboratories to make buffers, e.g. for gel electrophoresis of DNA and RNA, such as TBE buffer or the newer SB buffer or BBS buffer in coating procedures. - Borate buffers are also used as a preferential equilibration solution in dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP) based crosslinking reactions. Borax alone does not have a high affinity for hardness cations, although it has been used for water-softening. - A mixture of borax and ammonium chloride is used as a flux when welding iron and steel. It lowers the melting point of the unwanted iron oxide, allowing it to run off. - Borax is also used mixed with water as a flux when soldering jewelry metals such as gold or silver. It allows the molten solder to flow evenly over the joint in question. - Borax is also a good flux for 'pre-tinning' tungsten with zinc - making the tungsten soft-solderable. Borax is often used as a flux for forge welding. - Borax is replacing mercury as the preferred method for extracting gold in small-scale mining facilities. A rubbery polymer sometimes called Slime, can be made by cross-linking polyvinyl alcohol with borax. - Borax is used as an ingredient in enamel glazes. It is used as a component of glass, pottery, and ceramics. - Borax is Pulverized for the prevention of stubborn pests in closets, pipe and cable inlets, wall paneling gaps, and inaccessible locations where ordinary pesticides are undesirable. - Other uses of Borax includes; curing agent for snake skins, curing agent for salmon eggs, for use in sport fishing for salmon, as a micronutrient fertilizer to correct boron-deficient soils. Borax is also used for stopping car radiator and engine block leaks and are used by blacksmiths in forge welding. Side-Effects & Allergies of Borax Borax, also known as sodium borate or sodium tetraborate, is a naturally occurring mineral often used in various household cleaning products, pesticides, and as a laundry detergent booster. When taken properly and in moderation, it is widely regarded as safe, however there is little evidence to back up this assertion. However, excessive or improper use of borax can lead to severe side-effects. Some potential side effects of borax exposure include: - Skin irritation: Borax can irritate the skin and produce redness and itching, especially in people with sensitive skin. - Eye irritation: Borax dust or solution exposure can cause eye discomfort and redness. - Respiratory issues: Borax dust can aggravate the respiratory system, resulting in coughing, throat irritation, and breathing difficulties. - Gastrointestinal effects: Borax can cause gastrointestinal problems such nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, and diarrhea when consumed in large doses. - Allergic reactions: Borax can cause allergic responses in certain people, leading to signs including rash, hives, and swelling. - Hormonal disruption: Borax contains boron, and excessive exposure to boron may lead to hormonal imbalances in the body. - Reproductive and developmental concerns: Studies on animals have suggested that high doses of borax can be harmful to reproduction and fetal development. As a result, pregnant women should avoid unnecessary exposure to borax. - Environmental impact: Borax can have negative effects on the environment, particularly aquatic life, if used excessively or disposed of improperly. It's important to note that most reported side effects are associated with high levels of exposure or misuse. The broad consensus is that borax is safe for use in typical household applications when used correctly and in compliance with safety requirements. However, it is essential to keep borax products away from children and pets and avoid excessive contact or ingestion. Get medical help right away if using borax causes any negative side effects. Always follow product instructions and take necessary precautions to minimize potential risks. References - Weir Jr RJ, Fisher RS. Toxicologic studies on borax and boric acid.
