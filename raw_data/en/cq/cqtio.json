Several laboratory studies this week suggested the variant, first identified in Botswana and South Africa last month, [could dodge the protection of a primary course of vaccination](https://www.politico.eu/article/first-global-studies-suggest-omicron-escapes-vaccine-immunity-boosters-show-promise/). Omicron has now spread across dozens of countries, including the majority of EU countries. Now, real-world evidence from South Africa's hospitals appears to indicate that vaccines do protect against hospitalization from Omicron, with South Africa's Health Minister Joe Phaahla saying today that initial reports indicate around 70 percent of people admitted are unvaccinated. Evidence indicates vaccines provide \"very strong\" protection against severe disease, said Phaahla, and that those who are vaccinated are \"much better protected\" than those without a jab. You may like While hospitalizations are on the rise, Phaahla said this could be \"largely due to overall big numbers of infections.\" Early data indicates there was a lower proportion of people being hospitalized for severe disease than in earlier coronavirus waves. Many people in hospital with positive cases were also incidentally infected, as they were admitted for other illnesses, he added. The health minister admitted, however, that it would take \"some weeks\" to fully answer the question of severity. Experts have cautioned that even if the variant is less severe, if it is much more transmissible than previous variants \u2014 which it appears to be \u2014 it could put hospitals under immense pressure.
