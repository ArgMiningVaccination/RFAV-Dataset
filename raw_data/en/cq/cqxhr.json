Her approach to client care incorporates her extensive use of the clinical knowledge she has gleaned over her many years in practice, along with a deep desire to help her clients experience the transformation God offers them. When Carolyn originally began her work as a Traditional Naturopath, practitioners of the healing arts were far and few between in Indiana. However, greater awareness of the healing powers of nature has created a shift in the landscape of the hearts and minds of individuals today. As a result, practitioners of holistic wellness are becoming a familiar fixture on the landscape of today's modern society. Additionally, individuals are taking greater control over their own health and well-being by making conscious decisions to support the needs of their physical bodies through natural measures. This is all great news! However, as Carolyn likes to say - \"We are more than our physical body.\" Body, Heart, and Soul Human beings are complex creations created in the image of a Triune God. The needs of our physical, emotional, and spiritual bodies all present opportunities that play a part in our journey into greater wholeness and transformation. If we remain fixated on our physical body, trying to find healing with the usage of Naturopathy (or any other type of care), and neglect the needs of our emotional and spiritual body we will see ourselves short! New science consistently points to the primacy of the body-spirit connection in healing. Further, advances in the study of the correlation between emotions and disease demands that we take a serious look at the \"elephant\" in the room. And we have all heard about the power of prayer! Yes, there is more than meets the eye when it comes to healing. Instead of beginning by addressing the needs your physical body exclusively, Carolyn begins by examining the needs of your physical, emotional, and spiritual body. She then comes up with a plan to help you reach your goals of health and happiness. Experience has taught her that optimal transformation begins with a close initial examination of your total self; body, heart, and soul. Sometimes the physical body is the place we need to start; however, this is not always the case. Other times, powerful emotional or spiritual wounds exist and they demand primacy over the of your physical body. Why Begin This Way? Experience has taught Carolyn that once the spiritual and emotional needs are addressed the needs of the physical body tend to markedly diminish. Why? Well, because the physical stress born out of spiritual and emotional disruption wreak havoc on the physical body! The best diet, the best remedies, and the best lifestyle are no match for those buried, and not so buried, wounds creating an unhealthy physiology. Other times the physical body is overly burdened with the plethora of interferences that exist in our modern world. In this case, we need to nourish the physical before we can move forward. Your first session with Carolyn will be the beginning of a journey the two of you will embark upon for quite some time. During your Initial Session she will tap into her skill-set as a Traditional Naturopath to assess the needs of your physical body. Additionally, she will utilize The LIVE Method to uncover the primary emotional and spiritual blocks to wholeness. She will make remedy and lifestyle recommendations during your Initial Session as well as apply techniques from The LIVE Method. You will walk away with a clear plan to follow. What is Naturopathy? So what is Naturopathy? Naturopathic medicine (also known as Naturopathy) is a school of medical philosophy and practice that seeks to improve health primarily at the physical level. It approaches disease chiefly by assisting the body's innate capacity to recover from illness and injury. Carolyn personally includes a broad array of different modalities in her practice as a Traditional Naturopath, including homeopathic remedies, whole food supplements, botanical medicine, nutritional guidance, and dietary and lifestyle changes.
