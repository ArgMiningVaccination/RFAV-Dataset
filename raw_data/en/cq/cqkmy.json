Wardle ,David W. Sibbritt andJon Adams Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine (ARCCIM), Faculty of Health, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia Aim: This study examines GP perceptions, attit udes and knowledge of complementary medicine (CM), and to understand contextual factors that in fluence these perceptions, atti- tudes and knowledge. Background: CM use is increasing, and its in fluence on primary care becoming increasingly signi cant. Although general practiti oners (GPs) often have central primary care gate-keeper roles within heal th systems, few studies have looked speci cally at GPs 'perceptions, attitudes and knowledge of CM. Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to all 1486 GPs registered as practicing in non-metropolitan areas of New South Wales. The survey included one free-text qualitative quest ion, where respondents were invited to high- light issues associated with CM in their own words. Free-text responses were analyzed qualitatively using thematic analysis. Findings: In total, 585 GPs responded to the survey (adjusted response rate 40.1%), with 152 (26.0%) lling in the free-text question. Central themes which emerged were risk as a primary c oncern; opposition to, resistance to and the inappropriateness of complementary therapi es; struggles with complexity and ambivalent tolerance. Conclusion: GPs in Australia have a wide varie ty of perceptions toward CM. A minority of GPs have absolute views on C M, with most GPs having numerous caveats and qualications of individual CM. Ef cacy is only one aspect of CM critically evaluated by GPs when gauging support for individual therapies -risk, alignment with medical principles and an openness to exploring new avenues of treat ment where others have failed, all appear to be equally important considerations when GPs form their views around CM. Key words: primary care; complementary medicine; interprofessional care; general practice; survey Received 14 July 2016; revised 13 September 2017; accepted 16 September 2017; rst published online 8 February 2018 Introduction The past few decades have seen a surge in the interest in, and utilization of complementarymedicine (CM) by the public (Adams et al., 2014). CM includes a vast range of self-directed and practitioner-led health practices (eg, meditation, yoga, chiropractic, naturopathy) and products(eg, herbal medicine, nutritional supplements and homeopathy) that are not traditionally considered part of conventional care or the medical curriculum(Adams et al., 2014). Large-scale population-based survey ndings highlight signi cant use of CM in Australia and internationally (Harris et al., 2012;Correspondence to: Dr J.L. Wardle, Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine (ARC-CIM), Faculty of Health, University of Technology Sydney,235-253 Jones St, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia. Email: 19:246 -255 RESEARCHdoi:10.1017/S1463423617000664 \u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2018 https://doi.org/10.1017/S1463423617000664 Published online by Cambridge University PressAdams et al., 2013; World Health Organization, 2013; Reid et al., 2016). In Australia the role of CM in the contemporary health system is of particular and increasing signi cance, with CM utilization being among the highest in the developed world (Bodeker and Burford, 2007; Reid et al., 2016). The estimated numbers of consultations with CMproviders in Australia are similar to those of con- ventional providers (69.2 versus 69.3 million), with reported out-of-pocket expenditure on CM pro-ducts estimated to be over $4.1 billion annually(US$3.8 billion) (Xue et al., 2007). The therapeutic footprint of CM practitioners in Australia is also substantial, with CM practitioners outnumberingconventional primary care providers in some areas (Wardle et al., 2011). Although general medical practitioners (GPs) often have central primary care gate-keeper roles within health systems, relatively few studies have looked at the practice patterns, attitudes and per-ceptions of GPs as a speci c sample group in relation to CM (Wardle et al., 2013a). High use and support of complementary medicine (CM) by GPshas been observed in Australia (Cohen et al., 2005; Pirotta et al., 2010; Janamian et al., 2011) and internationally (Amster et al., 2000; Corbin et al., 2002; Hamilton, et Cocconi et al., Poynton et al., 2006; al., 2006; Godin et al., 2007; Al Shaar et al., 2010). Although these studies appear to show broad support forCM by GPs in most nations -with similar factors underlying this support -it is also important to recognize signi cant differences across country borders. For example, homeopathy appears to bemore popular and publicly accepted in European nations and New Zealand than in other countries, whereas chiropractic and naturopathy seem morepopular and publicly accepted in Australia and parts of the United States than in other regions (Bodeker and Burford, 2007). Exploring the practice patterns, attitudes and perceptions of GPs as a speci c practitioner group in relation to CM is also particularly important, asstudies of Italian and Korean physicians have indicated there do appear to be differences between groups with reference to CM use, atti-tudes and provision between primary care physi-cians and specialist or academic physicians (Cocconi et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2011). In a country such as Australia, where GPs as primarycare physicians have an of cial 'gate-keeper 'capacity to a variety of both medical and non- medical services, the attitudes and perceptions of GPs are likely to have particularly signi cant practice and policy impact. However, while general practice is one branch of medicine where CM has long made an impact (Adams and Tovey, 2000; Wardle et al., 2013a), this group has not gained as much research atten- tion as specialist medical professions on this topic. Data from Australian and international studiesdemonstrate signi cant levels of interaction -via utilization and referral -between GPs and CM practitioners (Pirotta et al., 2002; Cohen et al., 2005; Poynton et al., 2008; Pirotta et al., 2010; Perry et al., 2014). Given these high levels of interaction, the attitudes, perceptions and knowl-edge of primary care physicians toward CM deserve careful consideration. To provide addi- tional insights into the attitudes, perceptions anduse of CM by GPs practicing in rural and regional areas of Australia 's largest State, the free-text open-ended questions relating to attitudes, per-ceptions and knowledge of CM in a survey of allGPs practicing in non-metropolitan Divisions of General Practice in New South Wales, Australia were analyzed. Methods A questionnaire was mailed to all 1486 GPs regis- tered as practicing in rural and regional GeneralPractice Divisions of NSW, with a reminder card sent after two months. The questionnaire was adapted for rural and regional use from previousAustralian surveys of GP attitudes, use and prac-tices of CM (Pirotta et al., 2002; Cohen et al., 2005). Thenal survey questionnaire contained 27 items and one free-text qualitative question, whererespondents were invited to highlight issues asso- ciated with CM in their own words. Results from the quantitative parts of the survey have beenpublished elsewhere (Wardle et al., 2013c; 2013d; 2014). This study reports ndings from qualitative analysis of the free-text comments. Results from free-text responses were tran- scribed and entered into an Excel spreadsheet. The text responses to the open-ended questionwere then analyzed qualitatively using thematicanalysis, with initial codes then being used to createPrimary care practitioner perceptions and attitudes of CM 247 Primary Health Care Research & Development 2018; 19: 246 -255 https://doi.org/10.1017/S1463423617000664 Published online by Cambridge University Presshigher order categories in a cumulative manner (Liamputtong and Ezzy, 2005). Analysis was con- ducted by health services researchers in a public health faculty, with backgrounds in nursing, naturo-pathic medicine, sociology and public health. To reduce potential in fluence of pre-existing attitudes or experiences of CM, the method of researcher trian-gulation was also employed with each member of the research team providing independent analysis of selections of the data and comparing results afterward(Patton, 2002). Quotations are used to illustrate thethemes generated by this analysis, to demonstrate interpretations made. Participant labels were assigned on the order of data entry of the open-ended variable. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the School of Population Health Research Ethics Committee of the School of Population Health,University of Queensland and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Newcastle. Results A total of 585 questionnaires were returned com- pleted, with 49 questionnaires returned incom- plete as 'no longer at this address; 'giving an adjusted response rate of 40.7% for the entire survey. A total of 152 (26.0%) respondents had lled in the free-text question. The respondent proles of both the questionnaire as a whole and the free-text question were similar, with no sig- nicant differences in respondent demographics. Respondents had an average age between 45 and54 years and were 53.5% male. Over three- quarters of respondents (77.8%, n=456) had completed their medical training at an Australianuniversity. The respondent pro le was broadly representative of the GP community in the study area, apart from a slight over-representation ofwomen (Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee, 2005). Many of those who responded had de nite views about CM, which were thematically coded individually with the results listed in Table 1. The central themes which emerged were risk as a pri-mary concern; opposition, resistance and theinappropriateness of complementary therapies; struggles with complexity and ambivalent toler- ance. Sub-categories observed within these themesare also listed in Table 1.Risk as a primary concern Risk was a major theme in many of the open- text responses, with participants often framingtheir personal attitudes and perceptions toward CM in relation to risk management rather than other factors such as patient preference or ef cacy. Both direct (eg, drug -herb interaction, adverse events) and indirect risks (eg, delayed diagnosis) were identi ed by respondents, though indirect risks were generally seen as being more in fluential in clinical practice. CM practitioner (or product) variability or potential monopolization of care by CM provides was highlighted as a major issue thatincreased potential risks to patients. For many GPs, it was this risk, rather than risk of ineffective therapies, that was of most concern to them asclinicians, as the following quote demonstrates: 'They all [treatments] work sometimes -it's just a matter of using them judiciously. I don 't think [CM] is the problem per se, ratherTable 1 Main themes and sub-categories of responses to free-text questions Themes Category ( n) Risk as a primary concern Monopolization of care, use as an alternative ( n=42) CM practitioners exploiting patients ( n=41) Risky for GPs to integrate from medico-legalperspective ( n=27) Opposition, resistance and the inappropriatenessof CMPseudoscienti c(n=38) Has no evidence base ( n=37) CM not conducive to medical practice/principles ( n=21) Struggles with complexity Do not have time to learn more about CM ( n=39) Do not know enough about CM to comment or prescribe (n=39) CM too broad a generalization ( n=34) Ambivalent tolerance I have to be tolerant to retain patients ( n=38) Some CM are useful, other are rubbish ( n=37) It is hard to distinguish good and bad CM ( n=37) We do not know medicine.248 J.L. Wardle, D.W. Sibbritt Research & Development 2018; 19: 246 -255 https://doi.org/10.1017/S1463423617000664 Published online by Cambridge University Pressthat practitioners and patients tend to think their pet therapies will x everything and anything '. (GP 152) Concerns around the risks associated with the regulatory vacuum that often surround CM pro-ducts and services were raised by many respon- dents, amongst both supporters and detractors of CM. Most respondents held that the risks of CMwere maximized due to the variability and hetero- geneity in standards, practices and treatments, which in their opinion was related in a large part tothis regulatory vacuum. The risks from integrating or utilizing CM were not seen to be limited to patients, but also to the GPsthemselves. For some GPs, resistance to furtherintegration of CM was not necessarily due to their own perceptions on whether integration was appro- priate based on patient risk, but rather perceived as a product of external factors, particularly legislative and regulatory concerns that were risky to GPs themselves. As the following response indicates, thiscould lead to GPs resisting referral, even in instances where they would otherwise be supportive: 'Fear of litigation over risks associated with cervical manipulation stop me referring to chiropractors or osteopaths on paper. I dobelieve they have great success with certain conditions '. (GP 80) Opposition, resistance and the inappropriateness of complementary therapies Some respondents relayed their concerns about CM purely in evidence-based terms, stating that the only issue they had with most CM was that it did not abide by the principles of evidence-basedmedicine, and as such, was by default not appro- priate for practice or integration into medical practice. The following quote illustrates the atti-tude presented by many respondents: 'There is only evidence-based medicine and non-evidence-based medicine. If you can show me the evidence for it I would even start using crystal therapy tomorrow '. (GP 110) For others, the opposition to CM ran deeper, indicating that even if some CM disciplines were toadopt evidence-based principles of practice, the historical roots of such CM in pseudoscience and unorthodox philosophy should disqualify them from further integration, as demonstrated by thefollowing illustrative quote: 'Homoeopathy is bunk. Acupuncture is grossly overrated, and is not popular in China. TCM [Traditional Chinese Medicine]is only used by the poor in China. Nutriceu-ticals [sic] is a scam. Chiropractic is trying to position itself as more scienti c but histori- cally it 's based on pseudoscience '. (GP 78) Respondent opposition to CM sometimes resulted in refusal to discuss CM with patients. Some respondents suggested that discussion of CM in a conventional medical consultation maygive CM an undeserved imprimatur. For other GPs, their opposition to CM simply meant that CM was a topic to be 'kept off the table, 'as illu- strated by the following quote: 'Ind if I don 't ask patients about their [CM] they won 't tell me about it. This suits me ne. I don 't want to know what they 're using as it 's all garbage, and they know I 'll just tell them to stop it anyway '. (GP 11) For some GPs, opposition to CM was absolute and was not solely directed at those that were trained in CM disciplines. Even conventionallytrained practitioners drew the ire of some of their colleagues if they dabbled in CM provision, as the following quote demonstrates: 'Unfortunately CM practitioners aren 'tt h e only charlatans out here. I know of many doctors who practice questionable therapies and I 'm never ceased to be amazed by the rubbish that pharmacists have the gall to puton their shelves. It 's the opium for the masses '. (GP 117) Some stated opposition appeared to be asso- ciated not with open resistance to CM, but frus-trations among GPs that many CM practitionerswere free of the accountability and scrutiny that occurred in general practice. It was felt by many participants that CM therapists practiced in aregulatory vacuum (and were therefore able toPrimary care practitioner perceptions and attitudes of CM 249 Primary Health Care Research & Development 2018; 19: 246 -255 https://doi.org/10.1017/S1463423617000664 Published online by Cambridge University Presspractice without restrictions on autonomy), and had a patient-base that was more forgiving and less critical of their practice than was observed in gen- eral practice, as evidenced by the following quote: 'Locally, patients expect orthodox medicine for free but pay for quackery and unproven therapy. They don 't question ridiculous claims that are unproven. Yet question much of whatI and other orthodox medicine offer '. (GP 82) Struggles with complexity For many GPs, CM use among patients was acknowledged as being a practical modern reality, irrespective of whether they personally perceivedmerit in the individual CM practiced. CM was perceived as being both too prevalent to ignore, but also too large a eld to fully embrace or eval- uate. As such, CM use was considered to be a matter for patients and CM practitioners, rather than the respondents themselves: 'I assume all my patients are using [CM] and pragmatically don 't mind as if they get ben- et that 's great. However, I 'm not interested in learning more as I already have enough trouble keeping up to do date with orthodoxmedicine '. (GP 22) For some GPs, the diversity of CM was said to be overwhelming, and in some instances may result in them not using CM, or feeling uneasyabout using CM, even in clinical scenarios where they thought it appropriate, as can be observed in the following quote: 'I know too little to be con dent about pre- scribing or recommending something '. (GP 29) Part of this complexity was the fact that there was little distinction among respondents of medi- cines, therapies and practitioners when construct- ing personal de nitions of CM. However, many GPs did note the fraught nature of referring to CM as a homogenous entity: 'Some [CM] are good, some are not. There 's too much variability to term everythingunder the one moniker '. (GP 34)Some respondents highlighted that the com- plexities of CM not only affected their perception of individual CM therapies, but also changed their support for a speci c CM in differing contexts, where even CM that was generally poorly per- ceived by GPs could be deemed appropriate in speci c circumstances: 'My opinions on what is effective in CM are hard to generalize into categories. I nd some herbal remedies effective, many are rubbish. Likewise I disagree with the general principles of homeopathy but have recommended rescueremedy before. I believe increased commu- nication between practitioners of CM and GPs should be encouraged. It seems slow-going '. (GP 69) Other GPs were concerned about the practical implications of such broad CM categorization. Many explained the inclusion of well-accepted or perceivably feasible CM with fringe modalities aspotentially dangerous, and as a way of giving some CM undeserved legitimacy. This interpretation is demonstrated in the GP quote below: 'Involving all \"alternative medicine \"under one umbrella such as [CM] is an attempt togive some sham modalities such as homeop- athy credibility by attempting comparison to massage/meditation etc '. (GP 83) Ambivalent tolerance Few GPs expressed complete support for inclusion, or further integration of CM. Many GPs did offer supportive statements, though these were often couched with caveats or caution. As such,many respondents exhibited a form of ambivalent - sometimes belligerent -tolerance to CM use, whereby the validity of CM use was still questioned, but respondents adopted a morepragmatic view of CM, one which was neither wholly positive nor negative. Pragmatism (in flu- enced by patient beliefs), rather than explicitsupport for CM often engendered a tolerant or open attitude toward CM for many GPs, as the following quote illustrates: 'My community is very alternative. It is important to be open and not judgmental toensure compliance and openness in patients.250 J.L. Wardle, D.W. Sibbritt and J. Adams Primary Research & Development 2018; 19: 246 -255 https://doi.org/10.1017/S1463423617000664 Published online by Cambridge University PressThey will choose the [CM] practitioner over me if there was any hint of judgment or hostility '. (GP 43) In some instances some GPs rejected the notion that some aspects of CM were in fact 'alternative ' or'complementary 'at all, but a part of medicine and wanted these differentiated from other CM modalities and practices that they deemed morefringe or unorthodox. Nutritional medicine was often an example given, as indicated in the quote below: 'Nutritional medicine is part of proper medi- cine, not complementary. Some [CM] thera-pists go \"too far \", even if they do have useful skills. There needs to be adequate regulation as there is a lot of difference between prac-titioners and groups '. (GP 35) Other practitioners relayed the potential for CM to be used as placebo in practuce, particularly in the case of 'heart-sink 'patients who were unable to be helped by more conventional treatments. As the following quote demonstrates, in this sense they often supported CM use in speci c circum- stances, even when they had less positive viewsabout CM more generally: '[CM] can be useful to generate a placebo response that the GP cannot ethically pre- scribe -e.g. often useful for anxiety/depres- sion of mild variety. But some of the guff that gets referred back \"the naturopath wants you to test/treat my yeast infection \"etc. are both aggravating and entertaining '. (GP 6) Discussion This study provides interesting contextualization of previous descriptive survey ndings around medical practitioner utilization and integration of CM practices and offers new insights to comple- ment other work regarding GPs 'perceptions of CM and the interface with primary health care. Such work has focused largely on quantitative reporting of gures support for, referral to and practice of individual CMs (Wardle et al., 2013b; 2013c; 2013d; 2014). Findings from this studysuggest that there are few default positions of GPs relating to CM. GP perceptions toward CM appear to be accompanied by a number of caveats and qualifying statements, and there is signi cant diversity of view among GPs on most issues relating to CM. The only group of GPs in this study which appeared to hold de nitive views on CM was the minority of GPs who ideologically opposed CM on all levels, who suggested CM was pseudoscienti c and incompatible with medical practice. GPs who supported CM, or GPs whostated they could support it in speci c contexts, usually only did so conditionally (eg, using it as a benign placebo, rather than being convinced of itseffectiveness). For most respondents their atti- tudes and perceptions of CM in speci c circum- stances was framed in a discourse of risk, with riskminimization being seen as more important than maximizing bene ts of CM use, possibly due to an overarching skepticism of CM ef cacy. Ef cacy seems to be only one aspect of CM critically eval- uated by GPs when gauging their support for individual CM therapies -risk, alignment with medical principles and openness to exploring newavenues of therapies where others have failed, all appear to be equally important considerations. However, most contemporary commentaryaround the issues surrounding CM and primary practice appears to focus on whether CM is effec- tive enough to integrate into medical practice(Ernst, 2016). Findings from this study suggest that more nuanced discussion relating to the policy and practice interface between CM and primary care isnecessary to ensure it adequately re flects the issues experienced at the coalface of primary care practice. Thendings from this study seem broadly con- sistent with other studies of Australian GPs, which show generally high levels of support for CM, yet also show a signi cant minority of GPs har- boring negative attitudes or heightened skepticism toward CM (Easthope et al., 2000; Hall and Giles- Corti, 2000; Cohen et al., 2005). The prominence of risk as a factor in attitudes and perceptions of CM in practice in our study is also supported by ana- lysis of Australian biomedical journal content onCM, which showed that most CM content pub-lished in those journals was framed under a dis- course of risk (Lewis, 2013). Our work adds clarity and context to these previous studies, by offeringinsights into the factors that underpin varyingPrimary care practitioner perceptions and attitudes of CM 251 Primary Health Care Research & Development 2018; 19: 246 -255 https://doi.org/10.1017/S1463423617000664 Published online by Cambridge University Presslevels of support for CM. The quali cations and caveats around issues such as ef cacy, for example, the support for CM use by skeptical GPs in 'heart- sink 'patients where other options have failed, or that ef cacy may not be the primary concern in relation to CM, also mirrors earlier international qualitative work of CM in general practice, whichuncovers a similarly nuanced approach to CM integration (Adams, 2003; Brien et al., 2008; Jarvis et al., 2015). Just as there may be no such thing as a 'typical 'GP, these ndings would also suggest that there appears to be no such thing a 'typical 'GP view of CM. These ndings, and the reasons that underlie such differing views, suggest that infor-mation tools and strategies to encourage GP discussion around CM may need to be tailored to a wide variety of views, rather than assuming a'one-size ts all 'strategy. This would necessitate a variety of communication and dissemination strate- gies for GP CM education, rather than the devel-opment of resources aimed at a single GP market. Such development should also account for the signicant heterogeneity of CM. Although often dened as a discrete and homogenous group, there is signicant heterogeneity in CM approaches, which according to participants in our study included therapies identi ed as 'fringe 'or'pseudoscienti c'as well as therapies and practices that are considered relatively mainstream in Australia (eg, chiropractic is covered by the Australian public health insurerMedicare upon referral by a GP). There may also be signicant regional differences in CM utilization and prevalence that in fluence GP perceptions. However, relatively few respondents in our study acknowl-edged this heterogeneity, often discussing CM as a homogenous entity. Non-disclosure of CM use in general practice was identi ed as a signi cant issue in our study, which may pose potential direct and indirect risks to patient care (Wardle and Adams, 2014). Aninternational review of CM disclosure to conven- tional medical practitioners found that, although risks of non-disclosure are known to be signi cant, patients are generally hesitant to disclose CM use to medical practitioners, even when prompted, and medical practitioners routinely do not initiate dis-cussion around CM use in their patients (Robinsonand McGrail, 2004). Our study suggests simply highlighting well-known risks of non-disclosure to those GPs opposing CM appears not to encouragediscussion of CM use with patients, even whenthose GPs may acknowledge the importance of understanding CM use to ensure optimal patient care, and as such offers insights into why addres- sing CM non-disclosure between GPs and patients remains dif cult. Our study suggests CM use by patients may be perceived by some GPs to be an issue best ignored due to it being 'too complex ' or not being as important as other general practice issues. This suggests that not only does CM information for GPs need to be tailored for a widevariety of views, but it also needs to be presentedin an accessible and clinician-friendly manner. Development of tailored and flexible CM information and clinical tools may assist GPs tobetter navigate the interface between CM and general practice, but current tools do not appear to be ful lling this role. Additionally, highlighting the ways in which encouraging CM discussion can be important in improving patient care beyond reducing direct risks (eg, using CMdiscussion to establish trust), may also help to reduce the rate of non-disclosure of CM use in general practice. The large and varied study area was chosen to be broadly representative of Australian general practice demographics. Nevertheless, the location of the GPs in this study should be considered whengeneralizing the study 's results to the broader Australian or international general practice popula- tion, or to other medical specialties. The non-metropolitan nature of respondents may impact the ndings of this study, given that CM use is observed to be highest in rural and regional areas in Australia(Wardle et al., 2012). Further research in other settings is warranted, particularly given the continued signi cance of CM in primary care prac- tice, and the relative paucity of recent studies inthis area. Other limitations of the study include self- selection which may have resulted in a responsebias, due to CM being a controversial issue in general practice, and those with particular strong views may have been more likely to participate.This effect may be particularly pronounced in the free-text response section which required additional respondent effort beyond other ques-tions in the survey (Rich et al., 2013). The response rate is typical for large-scale GP surveys on CM conducted in Australia over the past decade, which have reported response rates of between 29and 58% (Cohen et Wardle, D.W. Sibbritt and Adams Primary Research & Development 2018; 19: 246 -255 https://doi.org/10.1017/S1463423617000664 Published online by Cambridge University PressJanamian et al., 2011), and compares well with general surveys of Australian GPs, which routinely have dif culty receiving response rates of over 30% (Bonevski et al., 2011). While the free-text nature of this survey cannot replicate depth of more-focused qualitative exploration, the broad range of perspectives gathered from thisopen-ended question nested within a larger quan- titative survey represent an important series of insights which may otherwise have not beenexposed. Conclusion GPs in Australia have a wide variety of percep- tions toward CM. Only a subset of those GPs whooppose CM have absolute views toward the topic, with most GPs having numerous caveats and qua- lications of individual CM. Ef cacy seems to be only one aspect of CM critically evaluated by GPs when they gauge their support for individual therapies -risk, alignment with medical principles, and an openness to exploring new avenues of treatment where others have failed, all appear to be equally important considerations when GPsform their views around CM.
