Form I-693 reports results of an immigration medical examination to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). USCIS requires the examination to establish that applicants who are seeking immigration benefits are not inadmissible to the United States on health-related grounds. You can find a list of the health-related grounds in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 212(a)(1). The list is also available in these Instructions in the Frequently Asked Questions section, Item Number 9. The results of your immigration medical examination are confidential, and USCIS uses them primarily for immigration purposes. When required by law, the civil surgeon may share your results with public health authorities. USCIS will generally not discuss your medical issues with other individuals, such as your attorney or BIA-accredited representative, immigration officers, or other government officials, unless they have a need to know the information. NOTE: If you are applying for adjustment of status as a refugee, a derivative of an asylee, or a K nonimmigrant visa holder, before reading any further, see the section titled Frequently Asked Questions, Item Numbers 2. - 5., of these Instructions.

Who must submit Form I-693?Most applicants filing for adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident must submit Form I-693 completed by a designated civil surgeon. Certain other applicants may also be required to submit Form I-693 completed by a civil surgeon. 2. What if I am a refugee and already completed an immigration medical examination abroad? If you are now applying for adjustment of status under INA section 209 one year after your first admission as a refugee, then you only need to repeat the entire immigration medical examination if the panel physician found a Class A medical condition during your examination. If the panel physician did not find a Class A medical condition and therefore, you do not need to repeat the full immigration medical examination, then you must still comply with the vaccination requirements. This means you only need to submit Part 10. Vaccination Record and Parts 1. - 5., and Part 7. of Form I-693. Contact your state or local refugee health coordinator to find out whether a state or local health department can complete Part 10. of Form I-693. The health department must also complete Part 7. of the benefit request. 3. What if I am a K nonimmigrant visa holder and already completed an immigration medical examination abroad? If you were admitted as a: A. K-1 fianc\u00e9(e) or a K-2 child of a K-1 fianc\u00e9(e); or B. K-3 spouse of a U.S. citizen or a K-4 child of a K-3 spouse of a U.S. citizen; and C. You received a medical examination prior to admission, then: (1) You are not required to complete another immigration medical examination as long as you file your Form I-485 within one year of an immigration medical examination completed outside the United States; and (a) The panel physician did not find a Class A medical condition during your imigration medical examination; orDraft Not for Production 02/08/2023 Form I-693 Instructions 03/09/23 Page 8 of 12 (b) The panel physician did find a Class A medical condition, you received a waiver of inadmissibility, and you have complied with the terms and conditions of the waiver. (2) Even if a new immigration medical examination is not required, you must still show proof that you complied with the vaccination requirements. If the vaccination record (DS 3025) was not properly completed and included as part of the original medical examination report completed abroad, you will need to have the Part 10. Vaccination Record completed by a designated civil surgeon. In this case, you must submit Parts 1. - 5., 7., and 10. of Form I-693. 4. What if I am an asylee derivative applying for adjustment of status and already completed an immigration medical examination abroad? If you were admitted to the United States as an asylee derivative, you generally do not need to repeat, at the time you submit Form I-485, the entire immigration medical examination provided that: A. The panel physician found no Class A medical condition during your immigration medical examination completed outside the United States; and B. You are applying for adjustment of status within one year of becoming eligible to file. You must, however, comply with the vaccination requirement and submit Part 10. Vaccination Record and Parts 1. - 5., and 7. of Form I-693 with your Form I-485. 5. What if I am an Afghan national who entered the United States under Operation Allies Welcome (OAW), am applying for adjustment of status, and already completed an immigration medical examination abroad? If you are an Afghan national applying for adjustment of status who entered the United States under OAW, you do not have to repeat the immigration medical examination by submitting Form I-693 if: The results of the immigration medical examination completed outside the United States by a panel physician are in your A-File and do not report a Class A medical condition; The panel physician completed the immigration medical examination no more than 4 years before the date you file to adjust status; and No evidence suggests that you have acquired a Class A medical condition after entry into the United States. 6. May any doctor perform the required immigration medical examination? Only a doctor who was designated by USCIS as a civil surgeon may perform the medical examination (except for limited exceptions for military and health department blanket designated civil surgeons). USCIS will not accept a Form I-693 completed by a doctor who is not a currently designated civil surgeon. 7. How do I know if a doctor is a designated civil surgeon? Doctors found through the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov or through the USCIS Contact Center are generally current in their designation as civil surgeons. Applicants who are unsure should ask doctors to confirm their status as a civil surgeon. 8. Who pays for the immigration medical examination? You, the applicant, must pay all costs of the immigration medical examination, including the cost of any follow-up tests or treatment that is required. Make payments directly to the civil surgeon or other health care provider. 9. What are the health-related grounds of inadmissibility? U.S. immigration law divides the health-related grounds of inadmissibility into the following four general categories: A. Communicable diseases of public health significance; B. Lack of proof of having received required vaccinations; C. Physical or mental disorders with associated harmful behavior or a history of associated harmful behavior; andDraft Not for Production 02/08/2023 Form I-693 Instructions 03/09/23 Page 9 of 12 D. Drug abuse or addiction. See INA section 212(a)(1)(A). HHS regulations classify these and other medical conditions into class A or B medical conditions. Class A medical conditions result in inadmissibility while Class B medical conditions do not. See 42 CFR 34.2(d) - (e). Medical Evaluations 1. Communicable Diseases of Public Health Significance The civil surgeon is required to perform specific tests for tuberculosis, syphilis, and gonorrhea. The medical examination also requires the civil surgeon to evaluate for other sexually transmitted diseases and Hansen's disease (leprosy). If you have a communicable disease of public health significance, the civil sur geon will advise you on how to obtain treatment. USCIS will inform you of whether you also need to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility. To learn more about this waiver, visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov. A. Testing for Tuberculosis All applicants two years of age and older must be tested for tuberculosis (TB) with an initial screening test. Civil surgeons may require an applicant younger than two years of age to undergo testing if there is evidence of contact with a person known to have TB or other reasons to suspect TB. Testing must be completed per CDC guidelines, which can be found on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/civil-surgeons/tuberculosis.html. If that test is positive, the applicant is required to have a chest X-ray and if that is abnormal and suggestive of TB, the applicant must be referred to the health department. B. Testing for Syphilis (See CDC's Syphilis Technical Instructions for Civil Surgeons for required testing ages.) Civil surgeons must consult the latest version of CDC's Technical Instructions for Civil Surgeons (https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/civil-surgeons/syphilis.html ) to ensure they are testing the currently required age ranges, using an approved type of test and following appropriate screening and testing procedures. Civil surgeons may require testing for applicants outside the CDC specified age ranges if there is reason to suspect infection with syphilis. C. Testing for Gonorrhea (See CDC's Gonorrhea Technical Instructions for Civil Surgeons for required testing ages.) Civil surgeons must consult the latest version of CDC's Technical Instructions for Civil Surgeons (https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/civil-surgeons/gonorrhea.html ) to ensure they are testing the currently required age ranges, using an approved type of test, and following appropriate screening and testing procedures. Civil surgeons may require testing for applicants outside the CDC specified age ranges if there is reason to suspect infection with gonorrhea. 2. Physical or Mental Disorders This category of physical or mental disorders includes any diagnosis of substance-use disorders that involve any substance that is not listed in Schedule I, II, III, IV , or V of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (for example, diagnosis of an alcohol-use disorder). Mental disorders are diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or by another authoritative source as determined by the CDC director. Physical disorders are diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria in the most recent edition of the World Health Organization's Manual of the International Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (ICD) or by another authoritative source as determined by the CDC director. See the CDC's Technical Instructions for Civil Surgeons for more information.Draft Not for Production 02/08/2023 Form I-693 Instructions 03/09/23 Page 10 of 12 The presence of a physical or mental disorder alone does not make you inadmissible on health-related grounds. The civil surgeon must also determine that there is behavior associated with the disorder that is harmful to you, to others, or to property. USCIS will only consider you inadmissible if there is a current associated harmful behavior or a history of associated harmful behavior that is likely to recur. The civil surgeon will ask you general questions during the medical examination to determine whether you have such a condition. The civil surgeon may refer you to a specialist for further evaluation, if necessary. If the civil surgeon finds that you have a physical or mental disorder with associated harmful behavior, you may apply for a waiver. If the waiver is granted, you may be subject to terms, conditions, and controls as determined by USCIS in consultation with HHS. For more information about these waivers, visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov. 3. Drug Addiction and Drug Abuse HHS sets the medical guidelines for determining drug abuse and drug addiction. The terms are defined at 42 CFR 34.2(h) and (i). The civil surgeon will review your medical history during the medical examination and ask you questions necessary to determine whether you are currently using any drugs or other psychoactive substances or have used them in the past. \"Drug abuse or drug addiction\" is \"current substance use disorder, mild, moderate, severe\" but only with respect to substances listed in Schedule I, II, III, IV , or V of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act. The diagnosis is made according to the diagnostic criteria in the most current edition of the DSM or by another authoritative source as determined by the CDC Director. If the civil surgeon determines you have a substance-related disorder, you are not eligible to apply for a waiver unless you are applying for adjustment of status one year after you were admitted as a refugee or granted asylum.You will no longer be inadmissible based on drug abuse or drug addiction if, after a later medical examination by a civil surgeon, the civil surgeon finds your drug abuse or addiction is in remission. The diagnosis of remission is made according to the diagnostic criteria in the most current edition of the DSM or another authoritative source as determined by the CDC director. Vaccination Requirements All applicants for adjustment of status must present documents showing they were vaccinated against a broad range of vaccine-preventable diseases. The civil surgeon will review your vaccination history with you to determine whether you have had all the required vaccinations. Make sure you take your vaccination records with you to your appointment with the civil surgeon. NOTE: With the exception of those required to get the COVID-19 vaccine, you should not attempt to meet the vaccination requirements before the civil surgeon evaluates you in case any of the required vaccines are not medically appropriate for you. However, completing the COVID-19 vaccination process before your appointment with a civil surgeon will expedite the immigration medical examination process. For more information about the COVID-19 vaccination requirements, see https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/civil-surgeons/covid-19-technical-instructions.html . You can find information about other required vaccines at https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/civil-surgeons/vaccinations.html . If you never received certain vaccines, or you are unable to prove you received them, the civil surgeon can provide them to you. You also have the option to ask your family doctor to administer those vaccines to you after your evaluation by the civil surgeon. If you choose that option, show the records to the civil surgeon to note on Form I-693. If you initially did not have documents proving you received all the required vaccines, but later submit those documents, USCIS may grant you a waiver based on the civil surgeon's certification on Part 10. Vaccination Record of Form I-693. USCIS may also grant you a blanket waiver if the civil surgeon indicates that you may be eligible for blanket waivers for some vaccines but have otherwise completed all other medically appropriate and available vaccination requirements.Draft Not for Production 02/08/2023 Form I-693 Instructions 03/09/23 Page 11 of 12 HHS has determined that a vaccine is \"not medically appropriate\" if: 1. The vaccine is not recommended for your specific age group; 2. There is a medical reason why it would not be safe to have the vaccine (for example, you are allergic to eggs and/or yeast or you had bad reactions to prior vaccines); 3. You are unable to complete the entire series of a required vaccine within a reasonable amount of time; 4. For the influenza vaccine, it is not available in the location where the civil sur geon practices; or 5. For the COVID-19 vaccine, it is not routinely available in the location where the civil surgeon practices. If you object to required vaccinations because of sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions, you may apply for a waiver of these requirements. If you hold these objections, inform the civil surgeon that you will apply for a waiver. If USCIS denies the waiver application, we may also deny the immigration benefit that you are seeking.
