Allopathic medicines only focus on a part that is infected or affected by any foreign substance. Allopathic medicines do not give a permanent treatment to the cure, it just works on the symptoms and gives temporary relief. On the other hand, Ayurvedic medicine is of a holistic approach to the treatment. Ayurvedic medicines use only natural Herbs and its medicine manufacturing and give a permanent solution by focusing on the root cause of the disease Ayurvedic medicine focuses on the three doses of our body. In allopaths, they don't have a permanent cure for all diseases such as cancer, kidney chronic disease, stones, etc. but Ayurveda has a cure for all diseases from fever to chronic kidney disease. Allopathic medicines have side effects on other organs of the body i.e. if you are taking medicine for fever and these medicines can harm the liver, lungs, or other crucial organs of the body but ayurvedic medicines don't have any side effects to any organ of the body. Another difference between allopathic and ayurvedic medicines is that if one is taking allopathic medicine continuously then his body will become habitual of it but one cannot become habitual of Ayurvedic medicines if taking from the long period of time "}
