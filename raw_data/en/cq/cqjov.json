A super-concentrated broccoli extract encourages healthy estrogen metabolism and promotes healthy cell division. Estrogen for Women Benefits - Supports healthy estrogen metabolism - Helps relieve common discomforts of menopause such as hot flashes & night sweats - Contains phytonutrients to support against unwanted effects of estrogen What is dong quai? Dong quai is an herb with estrogen-like effects. It is thought to help maintain menstrual health and lessen menopausal discomforts. Why did we add broccoli extract? Broccoli contains health-promoting compounds like glucosinolate and myrosinase that protect your cells and encourage healthy cellular function. We start with a standardized soy isoflavone extract and calcium because soy compounds called phytoestrogens offer a variety of health benefits. And as you age, calcium intake is important. But Estrogen for Women is much more than just a soy or calcium supplement: It is potent, focused nutritional support for women during menopause and beyond. Supports against hot flashes and discomfort Estrogen for Women now contains Estro8PN\u00ae, an ultra-concentrated hops extract, as well as licorice root and Norway spruce lignan extracts to help support against hot flashes, night sweats and other discomforts of menopause. Hops extract has been shown to support against the frequency of hot flashes. Hops contain 8-PN, a potent phytoestrogen compound to support menopause symptom relief. Licorice extract supports against the severity of hot flashes and flaxseed lignans have been shown to support against hot flash frequency. Promote healthy estrogen metabolism Estrogen for Women contains a super-concentrated broccoli extract to encourage healthy estrogen metabolism. Dong quai, an herb with estrogen-like effects used in traditional Chinese medicine, is thought to help maintain menstrual health and lessen menopause discomfort. And evidence suggests that chasteberry (Vitex agnus-castus) might help support female hormone balance and mood\u2014both important factors when it comes to menopause discomfort relief.
