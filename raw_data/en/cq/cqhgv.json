Probably the majority of women I see in their first trimester come because they are suffering from morning sickness. Symptoms can range from mild nausea to excessive vomiting and despite it's name, 'morning sickness' can be experienced at any time of day or night. According to TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) there are a number of reasons you may experience morning sickness. Our diagnosis may sound a little different than a traditional western diagnosis. We might say something like, you have \"Liver Qi invading the Stomach\" or \"Spleen Qi Deficiency.\" Our diagnosis is also different for each patient and so is the treatment. It makes sense that while some person's nausea is helped by ginger tea, others might find relief from lemon water. According to TCM, they probably have a different pattern of imbalance. In addition to acupuncture treatment, I have seen homeopathy help with morning sickness. If you are suffering from excessive vomiting, please contact your physician to ensure you are not suffering from dehydration. Homeopathy for Morning Sickness Like acupuncture, homeopathic remedies differ based on how someone is experiencing their symptoms. Here is a list of popular ones and how you might use them. Primary Remedies Asarum This remedy is indicated when a woman feels very ill, with constant nausea and retching. She is extremely sensitive to everything\u2014especially noise, which can aggravate the nauseous feelings. She feels best when lying down and resting. Cool drinks or food may help, but it is hard for her to even think of eating. Kreosotum When this remedy is indicated, the woman may salivate so much that she constantly swallows it, becoming nauseous. She may also vomit up food that looks undigested, several hours after eating. Lacticum acidum This remedy is indicated for \"classic morning sickness\": nausea worse immediately on waking in the morning and on opening the eyes. The woman may salivate a lot and have burning stomach pain. She usually has a decent appetite and feels better after eating. Sepia Gnawing, intermittent nausea with an empty feeling in the stomach suggests a need for this remedy. It is especially indicated for a woman who is feeling irritable, sad, worn out, and indifferent to her family. She feels worst in the morning before she eats, but is not improved by eating and may vomit afterward. Nausea can be worse when she is lying on her side. Odors of any kind may aggravate the symptoms. Food often tastes too salty. She may lose her taste for many foods, but may still crave vinegar and sour things. Tabacum This remedy can be helpful to a woman who feels a ghastly nausea with a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach. She looks extremely pale, feels very cold and faint, and needs to lie very still and keep her eyes closed. If she moves at all, she may vomit violently\u2014or break out in cold sweat and feel terrible. Other Remedies Colchicum Horrible nausea that is worse from the sight and smell of food (especially eggs or fish) often indicates this remedy. The woman retches and vomits, and has a sore and bloated feeling in the abdomen. She has trouble eating anything \u2014 although she often craves things, when she tries to eat them they make her sick. She is likely to feel ill from many smells that others don't even notice. Ipecacuanha This remedy is indicated for intense and constant nausea that is felt all day (not only in the morning) with retching, belching, and excessive salivation. The woman may feel worse from lying down, but also worse from motion. Even after the woman vomits, she remains nauseous. Nux vomica Nausea, especially in the morning and after eating, may respond to this remedy\u2014especially if the woman is irritable, impatient, and chilly. She may retch a lot and have the urge to vomit, often without success. Her stomach feels sensitive and crampy, and she may be constipated. Pulsatilla This remedy can be helpful if nausea is worse in the afternoon and evening (often in the morning, as well). The woman is not very thirsty, although she may feel better from drinking something cool. She can crave many different foods, but feels sick from many things (including foods she craves). Creamy foods or desserts may be appealing, but can cause discomfort and burping or bring on vomiting. A woman who needs this remedy usually is affectionate, insecure, and weepy\u2014wanting a lot of attention and comforting. Homeopathy Dosage Directions Select the medicine that most closely matches the symptoms. In conditions where self-treatment is appropriate, unless otherwise directed by a physician, a lower potency (6X, 6C, 12X, 12C, 30X, or 30C) should be used. In addition, instructions for use are usually printed on the label. Many homeopathic physicians suggest that medicines be used as follows: Take one dose and wait for a response. If improvement is seen, continue to wait and let the medicine work. If improvement lags significantly or has clearly stopped, another dose may be taken. The frequency of dosage varies with the condition and the individual. Sometimes a dose may be required several times an hour; other times a dose may be indicated several times a day; and in some situations, one dose per day (or less) can be sufficient. If no response is seen within a reasonable amount of time, select a different medicine. There are many things which acupuncture can be helpful for during pregnancy. [Click on this link "}
