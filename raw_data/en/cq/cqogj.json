Like many of you, the Banyan team is constantly striving to balance the demands of work and family while still maintaining a healthy, active lifestyle. We eat wholesome foods, practice yoga, meditate, and do seasonal cleansing and rejuvenation. Yet we still often experience times of fatigue and stress where we could use some additional support, something that increases our prana and gives us that extra boost to be energized and aware for our everyday activities. We wanted it to be caffeine-free and to make use of some of our glorious herbal allies. 7-Herb Energy is the offspring of this desire. It combines the traditional Ayurvedic powerhouses [ashwagandha](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/shop/category/herbal-tablets/ashwagandha-tablets-10), [gokshura](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/shop/category/bulk-herbs-spices-formulas/gokshura-powder), and [brahmi](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/shop/category/bulk-herbs-spices-formulas/brahmi-gotu-kola-powder) with the classic adaptogens American ginseng and red Chinese ginseng. We love and benefit from its empowering effects and we hope you will too.* Ayurvedic Contraindications: Do not take during pregnancy. Keep out of reach of children.
