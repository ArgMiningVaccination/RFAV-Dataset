Testimonials KS I am amazed on a number of levels. I have considered myself to have a fairly healthy diet, but I was not prepared for the difference in the way that I felt and the increase of energy I tapped into. BF Now I know how good it feels to eat what I now call \"properly\". I have more energy. I feel better after my unexpected benefit of losing 25lbs. I'm grateful for the access and the opportunity to have gone through this process with Katy. DM The workshop and workbook were filled with information on how to cleanse, how it works, and wonderful recipes. I also enjoyed the group meetings. "}
