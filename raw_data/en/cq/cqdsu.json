For thousands of years, tulsi (holy basil) has been grown for spiritual purposes in the backyards of most Indian homes. Its branches are sanded into beads and worn to enhance spiritual progress. Its fragrance is used to purify temples and the leaves are used in sacred ceremonies to honor God and heighten one's awareness. Tulsi (Holy Basil) is named after these spiritual attributes and commonly called sacred holy basil and botanically named Ocimum sanctum. What is not commonly known about the tulsi plant are its best kept secrets. Called the Queen of Herbs, The Incomparable One and The Mother Medicine of Nature, tulsi is as powerful a medicine as it is spiritual and holy.

As a kapha-reducing herb, along with its immune-supportive properties, tulsi is famous for supporting respiratory health. While tulsi (holy basil) balances vata (cold and dry qualities) and kapha (warm and moist qualities), and in excess it can increase pitta (hot and fiery qualities), it can be used in any season for all types. As a kapha-reducing herb, tulsi supports the healthy expectoration of mucus from the lungs and respiratory tract as well as any excess mucus in the digestive tract.
