Although it was originally considered an Eastern philosophy, it has recently become more mainstream in the west as well. Still, there is a lot of confusion about what the term \"energy healing\" actually means. Is it a valid treatment plan? And, more importantly, is it one you should consider? At its foundation, energy healing is a form of alternative medicine. It is based on the belief that a person (with the help of a healer or counselor) can channel positive energy to improve their mental, physical, and spiritual health. To some, energy medicine sounds too mystical to be taken seriously. But there is credibility to the idea that our bodies and minds are instilled with an energetic life force. When our fields of energy become blocked or imbalanced, poor health is the result. Whether you fully buy into the idea of an energetic life force or not, energy medicine has proven results. At Neal Psychological Specialties, we believe that people who are experiencing [anxiety](https://www.nealps.com/specialties/anxiety), [depression](https://www.nealps.com/specialties/depression), PTSD, divorce recovery, and more can find improvement through energy healing. In fact, we often recommend it in conjunction with other types of treatment as it can be easily integrated into any therapy plan. Energy healing is based on the idea that our brains and nervous systems are powered through a system of interconnected energy pathways. These pathways are in constant flux because they are affected by our physical, emotional, and spiritual experiences. Ideally, our energy pathways are left wide open to promote a free flow of healing energy. When this is the case, we feel healthy, happy, and well-balanced. When negative experiences create roadblocks within this free-flowing system, discomfort, pain, and disease can be the result. Energy healing is a non-invasive way to reopen blocked pathways and get your system back on track. When you find yourself searching for an \"energy healer near me,\" you can turn to NPS for a variety of energy healing therapies. Each of these therapies can be combined to create a personalized treatment plan that works for you. Energy healing is vastly different from the majority of western-based therapies. For many, this makes it a foreign and little-understood technique. What you need to know, as someone who is interested in energy medicine, is that the philosophy of Eastern medicine or Traditional Chinese Medicine is supported by Western science. Quantum Science helps us understand that the smallest molecule, when broken down to its smallest structure, is in fact, no longer physical matter. Instead, the core is a whirling vortex of energy. This energy is often referred to as vibrations. Energy healing uses techniques that interact with these \"vibrations\" to bring alignment and balance to that part of the body, creating balance or what science refers to as homeostasis. This brings healing whether it is physical or emotional. In fact, some of the nation's top hospitals are currently hiring energy healers to provide patients with yoga therapy, Reika, acupuncture, massage therapy, and more. Reiki, in particular, has been proven to reduce pain. It also has a history of reducing [depression](https://www.nealps.com/specialties/depression) and [anxiety](https://www.nealps.com/specialties/anxiety), boosting self-esteem, and improving a person's quality of life. In our clinic, we offer two separate energy healing techniques. You can try Reiki or chakra balancing therapy (or both) with the help of our therapist, [Maria Mangiardi](https://www.nealps.com/about-us/meet-our-team/maria-mangiardi). Here is a brief overview of what you can expect from each technique: The purpose of Reiki healing is to promote relaxation and reduce stress through the use of gentle touch. With the use of her hands, our Reiki therapist delivers positive energy to improve the flow and balance of your energetic systems. Reiki healing originated in Japan over one hundred years ago. These days, it's used in hospitals, clinics, and hospices all over the United States. If you are interested in incorporating Reiki healing into your therapeutic routine, we can help. Like other patients, you may find that it ultimately stimulates your immune system, relieves feelings of pain and tension, and fosters physical and emotional healing. Chakra therapy is the practice of balancing the seven chakras of the body. If you attend a yoga class or have any previous experience with \"New Age\" medicine, you've likely heard of at least a few of the core chakras. They include: As many of these names suggest, each chakra is located in a different area of the body. When the seven chakras are aligned, the body's energy system is able to stay balanced and promote general well-being. When they are not aligned, pain, stress, and other unfortunate consequences can affect a person's wellness. Fortunately, our therapist can align your chakras through the following techniques: With chakra therapy, we can help you identify the areas of your body that need energy balancing. As we work to fill your other therapeutic needs, we can incorporate one or more of the above-mentioned techniques to help you get back into balance. We hope we've convinced you of the validity and effectiveness of energy healing. But how do you know if it's a practice you could benefit from personally? There are a lot of warning signs that our therapists can help you identify, but here are a few symptoms to watch out for. Remember that energy healing is designed to help you reach a higher level of well-being. Essentially, that means it can be used to treat both physical and emotional issues. One of the best parts about energy healing is that it doesn't require the use of medication. If you are interested in a natural path to healing, it's worth looking into whether Reiki or chakra balancing might work for you.
