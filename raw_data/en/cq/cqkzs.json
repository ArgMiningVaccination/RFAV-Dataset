Ear seeds are small seeds used to stimulate pressure points in your ear. They're a type of auriculotherapy, which refers to acupressure or acupuncture focused on the ear. They're based on the same general principles as acupuncture. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), your health depends on the flow of qi (energy) in your body. According to TCM, this energy travels along invisible pathways, known as meridians. Meridians are found throughout your body, including your ears. Ear seeds are placed on certain points, usually along meridian lines, to help clear up any qi blockages. In TCM, resolving these blockages may help with a variety of health conditions. "}
