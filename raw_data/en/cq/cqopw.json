Homeopathic remedies are made from all things found in our universe and have been used for over 200 years. They cause no side effects and at one time were more widely used than allopathic medicine. Homeopathy can aid with both emotional and physical issues. There has been a great resurgence in the use of these marvelous remedies because the current system of working with these issues has failed so many. We look forward to helping you learn more about Homeopathy and what it can do for you! Aromatherapy has been around almost since the beginning of time. It is usually the first modality that many try when wanting to change how they address health issues. There is a lot of misinformation about how to use essential oils and herbals and we can teach you how to use them safely and effectively. Synde Rogers, CA, NCS, PHom Synde began searching for alternative ways to help her heal from various health issues and multiple surgeries. She never got the results she had hoped for from past medical therapies and suffered for many years. She first began her journey using food to heal and became a member of the Weston A. Price Foundation. With much success that led her to become a Certified Aromatherapist and ultimately a Certified Practical Homeopath. She has since helped many clients live better lives using diet, Aromatherapy and Homeopathy. Synde Rogers CA, NCS, PHom is not a physician and the relationship between Synde and her clients is not of prescriber and patient, but as educator and client. It is fully the client's choice whether or not to take advantage of the information Synde presents.
