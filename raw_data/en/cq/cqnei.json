However, Paxlovid has complex [drug-drug interactions](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/statement-on-paxlovid-drug-drug-interactions/), primarily due to the ritonavir component. Paxlovid became the first orally administered coronavirus-specific investigational protease inhibitor authorized under Emergency Use Authorization ( [EUA](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization)) for certain adults and children by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19)) on Dec. 22, 2021.

PAXLOVID SARS-CoV-2 Sublineages Current coronavirus [variants](https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants) can be resistant to treatments and vaccines that work by binding to the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. PAXLOVID, however, works intracellularly by binding to the highly conserved Mpro (3CL protease) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inhibit viral replication. Nirmatrelvir has consistently shown in vitro antiviral activity against the following variants: Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron. The U.S. NIH OpenData Portal reports [nirmatrelvir](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2118542) (Paxlovid's main ingredient), excluding [ritonavir](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a696029.html), in vitro [ Therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus variants, as does the U.K.'s [CoVariants](https://covariants.org/?s=03). On March 29, 2023, Science published a [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade8778?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) that found multiple single amino acid changes in Mpro confer resistance to nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid), and encourages the monitoring of resistance variants and the development of additional protease inhibitors and other antiviral drugs with different mechanisms of action and resistance profiles for combinatorial therapy. PAXLOVID Rebound The [JAMA Network](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2799218) published a study based in Japan on December 6, 2022, focused on the Incidence of Viral Rebound After Treatment With Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir, which found viral rebound was uncommon in adults with COVID-19 after treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. A total of 13 studies involving 186,306 patients were identified in the [final analysis](https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(22)00557-6/fulltext) published on Sept. 30, 2022. This research shows that the overall Odds Ration of rebound among COVID-19 patients in the Paxlovid vs. control group was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.28-3.57; I2 =59%), P =0.99.
