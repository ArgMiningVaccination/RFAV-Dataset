All statements are merely the opinion of the writer(s). We recommend that individuals follow their doctor's guidance in regard to energy drinks C4 is a popular energy drink brand. The company sells both canned drinks and pre-workout powder, and claims that their product line \"fights fatigue with clinically studied ingredients.\" But does C4 contain ingredients shown in research studies to improve energy levels, or are these just marketing claims? Does the brand use any potentially unhealthy additive ingredients? What do medical experts have to say about energy drinks? And how do real users rate and describe the effects of C4 energy drinks? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more as we analyze the ingredients in C4 based on medical studies to give our take on whether or not the popular energy drinks are bad for you. We'll share YouTube videos on C4 from credentialed medical professionals, and feature unsponsored customer reviews. Ingredient Analysis The ingredients in C4 Original, Frozen Bombsicle flavor are shown above. Caffeine is one of the most effective compounds for enhancing energy, and is included in most commercial energy drinks. C4 contains 200 milligrams (mg) of caffeine, which is an effective dose. Caffeine is clinically shown to improve both mental and physical energy ( [source 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912474/), [source 2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34291426/)). Beta-alanine was shown in a [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22777329/) to reduce fatigue, although the dose doesn't appear to be published on C4's website. Betaine was shown to improve muscular endurance in a 2009 [clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2651845/), which suggests that it supports physical energy improvements. While there are some research-backed ingredients in C4 for supporting energy, there are also some inactive ingredients that may be questionable from a health perspective. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener that was shown to worsen insulin function in a [clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155288/) published in the Nutrition Journal. Citric acid can cause whole-body inflammation in some individuals, as documented in a [medical review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6097542/) published in the Toxicology Reports journal. Natural flavors may be a healthier alternative to artificial flavors, but we still consider it to be a questionable ingredient given the current state of research, as we discussed at length in our [Energy Renew reviews](https://illuminatelabs.org/blogs/health/energy-renew-review) article on another energy supplement containing this ingredient. Potassium sorbate is a preservative, and acesulfame potassium is another non-caloric sweetener. Overall, we consider C4 likely to improve energy levels, and from a strictly energy perspective, it's a great formulation. Most energy drinks that we've reviewed on Illuminate Health contain only one active ingredient supporting energy (typically caffeine), while C4 contains several. We don't necessarily consider C4 to be bad for you in moderation, but we would not call this drink healthy, given the additive ingredients highlighted above. But do medical experts consider energy drinks to be dangerous? We'll discuss that and more in the next section. Are Energy Drinks Dangerous? A popular YouTuber and doctor named Sten Ekberg has a video on the health effects of energy drinks with over 190,000 views: A YouTube video from the \"Buzzfeed Multiplayer\" channel tested the effects of three popular energy drinks on reaction time and more to see if they actually work: Is C4 Healthier Than Other Energy Drinks? C4 has a somewhat similar formulation to other energy drinks we've recently reviewed. The ingredient list for Red Bull is shown below: We consider C4 to be healthier than Red Bull because it's sugar-free and free of artificial dyes. Another huge benefit of C4 over other energy drinks we've reviewed is that the brand is [NSF Certified for Sport](https://www.nsfsport.com/). This certification program ensures that products are accurately labeled and free of contaminants. For this reason alone, we consider C4 to be healthier than pretty much any other commercial energy drink, because we have not come across any with third-party certifications for product purity.
