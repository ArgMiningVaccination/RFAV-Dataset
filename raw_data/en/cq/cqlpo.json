Raw Pu'er is naturally fermented and in its younger phase it is sweet and clean, reminiscent of a green or light oolong tea, but with more body and vigor. With time, the tea is transformed into a dark, rich, smooth, and earthy brew. Raw pu'er tea cakes are a great option for tea collectors because they age beautifully. Dark Pu'er cakes are aged in a special chamber that speeds up the fermentation process, simulating the process that naturally occurs over time with raw pu'er. This lets you enjoy pu'er tea as if it were decades old. While you can continue to age dark pu'er tea at home, you will not notice such a dramatic effect as with the raw pu'er.

Located on the far eastern edge of the Himalayan uplift, the land is mountainous and the climate is temperate, making it ideal for tea. Processing Pu'er tea is derived from the area's indigenous broad leaf variety of the tea plant, camellia sinensis. These larger, tender leaves are essential for the complex notes found in a good cup of pu'er. The microbial fermentation and oxidization the tea leaves undergo after they are sun dried and rolled gives pu'er tea a distinct flavor and texture. The fermentation process also alters the chemical makeup of the resulting brewed liquor, subsequently enhancing health benefits.

Unlike most monoculture tea farms, Liji cultivates its tea trees in a biodiverse tea forest.
