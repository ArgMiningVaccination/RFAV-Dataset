And if you do get the flu, having been vaccinated can decrease the severity of your illness. Flu shots also reduce your risk of hospitalization and death from the flu\u2014this is particularly helpful for older adults and high risk individuals with existing health conditions. Is the flu shot safe? In the last 50 years, hundreds of millions of Americans have safely received the flu shot. The flu shot reduces your chances of catching the flu and spreading it to others. Common side effects include soreness, redness or swelling at the injection site, headache, nausea, and muscle and body aches. When should I get a flu shot? It's best to get a flu shot in September or October. It can still be beneficial to receive later in the season, but you have a higher chance of being exposed before the shot can become effective. In other words, don't wait too long! Who should get a flu shot? [The CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm) an annual flu shot for most people 6 months of age and older, including pregnant people. If you've ever had a [severe allergic reaction](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm) to the flu shot, you have an egg allergy, a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, or you are feeling unwell, talk to your provider before you get a flu shot. What are the different types of flu shots? The CDC recommends any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine without preference for one over the other\u2014including injectable vaccines and nasal spray vaccines. However, the [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm) that adults 65 years and older get an injectable vaccine, and high-dose formulations are available for this age group. It's important to note that there are two types of flu vaccinations: [trivalent and quadrivalent](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm). Trivalent vaccines protect against 2 strains of influenza A and 1 strain of influenza B, whereas quadrivalent vaccines protect against 2 strains of influenza A and 2 strains of influenza B. All of the flu vaccines in the [ 2021-2022 season](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm) are of the quadrivalent variety, and are safe for individuals over 6 months of age with a few exceptions. Can you get the flu shot at the same time as a COVID-19 vaccine? Although data on receiving the COVID vaccine at the same time as the influenza vaccine is limited, [the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm) advises that it's safe to do so. Research is ongoing, but one [study](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm) among healthcare workers found that the flu shot offered some protection against severe forms of COVID-19. But because they are [ two different viruses](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm), you should be vaccinated against each one to be fully protected. Getting the flu shot will not interfere with the effects of the COVID-19 vaccine, and you don't have to disclose whether you've been vaccinated for COVID-19 if you don't want to. In the instance that you're experiencing flu symptoms or you've tested positive for COVID-19, you should [wait until recovering and completing your isolation period](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm) before getting a flu or COVID-19 shot.
