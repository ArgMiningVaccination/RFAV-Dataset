I know the Gregorian calendar observed the new year on January 1, 2014; and the Chinese new year was observed on January 31, 2014. However, I think of a new year beginning when I can see buds on the apple trees, flowers pushing skyward from the soil, and green leaves, herbs and grasses emerging. During the early months of spring I start new herbs and grasses in the safety and warmth of my home. I begin planning and preparing new garden plots before the snows completely melt. Spring is a time to think and dream of possibilities! Spring seems to symbolize new beginnings and change, not just for plants and animals, but also for humans. Spring is typically a time when new marriages begin and babies are born. Spring is also a time of new growth for plants and animals. It can also be a time to start new growth or change for ourselves: physically through exercise and/or diet change; spiritually by seeking or following new spiritual paths; and intellectually by expanding our knowledge bases. This spring I am going to increase my knowledge of plant medicine. I have already composed a list of books I want to read on aromatherapy and herbalism. I believe the two practices compliment each another quite nicely. They both honor and respect plants. They both acknowledge the benefits of plants to our well being. Additionally, aromatherapy and herbalism practice many of the same methods: tinctures, hydrosols, infusions, flower essences', etc. My hunger for knowledge seems to indicate a new beginning for me, personally and professionally. What will this spring/new year bring to you? What will your new growth entail? In this edition of the NAHA Aromatherapy Journal we are fortunate to have several of the speakers for the World of Aromatherapy VII Conference as contributors. You will find a wonderful interview with Dr. Florian Birkmayer by Sharon Falsetto and articles written by Juliet Blankespoor, Cathy Skipper, and Kelly Holland-Azzaro. The interview and articles provide nice introductions to the conference speakers. We hope you enjoy this spring edition of the NAHA Aromatherapy Journal. - Haly JensenHof, MA, RA Editor's Note 4Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAThe World of A romatherapy VII Beyond Aromatics - Exploring Holistic Approaches to Self-Care and Professional Practice September 12 - 14, 2014 Bastyr University, Seattle, WA Conference Website Now Open! www.nahaconference.com The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy www.naha.org French Style, British Style, Global! Contemporary Aromatherapy: a Status Report French and British Style aromatherapy are the two most immediately recognizable variants of aromatherapy. The differences between the two have given rise to many ongoing controversies. Matters became even more complicated by the entry of America's entrepreneur spirit, which mixed up the venerable European concepts with homegrown business acumen. As a result there is plenty of discussion about which is the right way to use essential oils. The status update will try and separate facts from marketing rhetoric, giving special attention to the cultural aspects that often inform our belief in science on the one hand, and our position vis-\u00e0-vis traditional knowledge on the other. Speaker Announcement: Gabriel Mojay Aromasophia: the symbolic meanings and traditional medicinal uses of key aromatic plants; the aromatherapeutic value of such study Among plants with a rich history of cultural and numinous symbolism, a remarkable proportion are aromatic in nature. An association so pervasive will of course have many explanations \u2014 not least their traditional domestic, culinary and medicinal im - portance in daily life. This said, the German ethnobotanist Heinrich Marzell (1885-1970) attributed plants perennial role at pivotal life moments - birth, marriage and death - to their spiritually protective symbolism. We observe, therefore, that aromatic plants and their extracts were favoured both as fumigating guardians against infectious disease, and as guardians of the soul's thresholds. The profound psycho-neuro-endocrinal interface between aroma, mood and memory represents yet another dimension to the link between fragrant botanicals and momentous events \u2014 both heightening and deepening consciousness at life's rites of passage. 6Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHABeauty and Self care A Year with Morphology ~ Using Plant Signatures to Inspire Aromatic Blending by Katie Vie Morphology is my thing. I love it. I resonate with it. And I apply it to every blend that I concoct. For those of you who read my Seasonal Self Care column in the Aromatherapy Journal last year, you know that I will draw upon metaphor, analogy and all manner of rhetorical figures of speech whenever possible. Morphology is the perfect marriage of biology and meaning-rich language, an irresistible branch of Aromatherapy. To be specific, Morphology is an approach to blending based upon the part of a plant from which the aromatic substance is extracted, and the meaning prescribed to that plant part. This approach to blending was developed by Jade Shutes over 20 years ago and I learned it from her during my studies of aromatherapy. Morphology is poetic and interpretive, but also a beautiful way to stay in touch with biology; the fact that these aromatic liquids come from plants, rather than little bottles. Morphology lends itself best to blends that address emotional, spiritual, energetic and \"Path\" related concerns. For example, someone who has just lost their job and feels disoriented, or has just experienced a profound loss/gain, or is having trouble integrating something new into their lives, or is needing support/ validation around a \"way of being\"--these are ideal cases in which to apply Morphology. When blending with Morphology think in terms of \"plant parts,\" specifically seed, leaf/needle, resin, wood, root, flower, fruit and herb. Each of these plant parts has an \"expression,\" or a way that their existence alone has profound meaning. For instance, take these three aromatics: neroli, petitgrain and bitter orange. Energetically and aromatically they are different, right? And yet, each of these aromatics is from the plant Citrus aurantium : bitter orange is extracted from the peel of the fruit; petitgrain extracted from the leaf; and neroli is extracted from the flower. As an Aromatherapist, to suggest that a client uses Citrus aurantium oil is not specific enough. Aside from the physical actions of each of these oils, which \"energy\" do you want - leaf, peel or flower? Throughout the year I will cover all of the plant parts, according to seasonal appropriateness. Since it is spring, I am going to focus on seeds. It's spring! The ground has begun to transform from a white blanket of snow, or a rich layer of leaves, to a light, ephemeral shade of green. The many seeds and bulbs that have waited through the dark winter have been coxed forth by longer, warmer days. It brings hope, doesn't it? It's a little magical, isn't it? How many of us as children (or adults) have patiently watered some seeds laid across a paper towel in a window sill waiting for the smallest sign of life. We have faith, so we wait. And when we finally see a sprout, it's triumphant. Here we begin to define \"seed\" in Morphological terms; what do seeds do, when do they do it and how do they make us feel? Ultimately, seeds are potential. Seeds are protected, perfectly timed, perfectly contained life forms. They must have ideal conditions before they reveal what they contain. Some need cold and darkness, others need a forest fire. Some need to travel the length of a bird's digestive tract. Seeds can be patient. Seeds are also about proliferation: birth, growth, reproduction and expansion. There is also an aspect Katie Vie shares her passion for designing and creating aromatic products based upon the Morphology Blending Technique as developed by Jade Shutes.7Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAof survival; thriving against challenges, overcoming things that are far bigger, and beating the odds. As humans, when we plant a seed there is faith that it will grow. There is patience, expectation, hope and excitement. We rely on seeds to eventually grow into food that we need for survival. We all have our own experience and interpretation of \"seed.\" So, when you are implementing Morphology into your blending techniques you are weaving information like this into the chemistry, actions, indications and protocols that you already use. Morphological information is largely intuitive and experience based. You must rely on your own personal associations with each plant part, more so than locating this information in a book. Now, back to seeds. Let's look at some aromatics that are seed based, meaning that the essential oil is found exclusively within the seed of the plant. Angelica ( Angelica archangelica technically a fruit, it acts like a seed with an affinity with the digestive system.) While these are all effective and fantastic oils, I want to spot light these three: black pepper, fennel and cardamom. These three oils have some things in common. They are all used, and often combined, for digestive health. These three oils are all stimulating, and helpful in moving all types of stagnation. They are also all delicious when eaten in their seed form. I like to categorize these three \"seed oils\" in morphological terms as, \"emotional digestivos,\" botanicals that can help us digest and assimilate information, experiences and emotion just as effectively as they help us digest food. Let's look at a case study. A middle aged woman is disappointed with her life. She has not met the goals she set, she feels unaccomplished, and a little lost. She has recently retired and feels bored. She wonders, does she stay on the path she's on, using her decades old skill set, or does she learn a new skill? This woman also talks endlessly, and exclusively, about her perceived failures and disappointments, churning it over and over without resolution. She also has insomnia, dull skin and a weakened immune system. In designing an aromatherapy program for her we would want to include: ~ A nervine/sedative/relaxant to address the insomnia. ~ A restorative/circulatory stimulant/tonic to address the dull skin. ~ A tonic/detoxicant/depurative to address the weakened immune system. In terms of Morphology we will look at some key points: ~ She seems to suffer from \"emotional indigestion,\" in that she is not reaching resolution to her issues. ~ She seems to be at the end of one cycle and unsure about how to start another. ~ She seems stagnant and in need of a fresh start.- A Year With Morphology continued - 8Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHA~ She seems exhausted and worn down by life and her own expectations. Continuing on with the Morphological information, you can see how a \"seed oil\" would be indicated here. She needs the quiet rest that a seed takes while it patiently awaits the ideal condition to sprout. She needs faith that if she takes this rest new life will stir. She needs strength to overcome the challenges ahead. She needs to feel protected, rather than vulnerable, as she waits. She needs an \"emotional digestivo\" to help digest and assimilate her emotional churning so she can move on. Now, cross reference the Morphological information with the actions and indications. Are there seed- extracted aromatics that are: seed-extracted aromatics are \"emotional digestivos?\" With all of this information woven together her initial aromatherapy program might look like this: Once daily massage oil/abhyanga with essential oils of: angelica seed (Angelica archangelica ), lemon (Citrus limon), and black pepper (Piper nigrum) blended into carrier oil (incidentally, many carrier oils are also seed extracted). Aromatic spray throughout the day with essential oils of: lavender ( Lavandula ) blended into salts. Once daily facial steam with essential oils of: carrot seed (Daucus carota rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis ) dropped into steaming water. I would also guide this client through visualizations of seeds in all of their forms: being produced by the parent plant, waiting to sprout, identifying the perfect - A Year With Morphology continued - About Katie Vie Katie Vie has been immersed in the fragrant world of aromatherapy nearly half of her life. She lives in the mountains of Western North Carolina with her dog and a Pirate. Currently Katie designs and blends a product line called River Island Apothecary.

Once this client has noticed positive results from this aromatherapy program I would meet with her again to re-evaluate her situation. For the summer issue of the journal I'll discuss flowers and maybe fruits. Until then, I hope you will find your own inspiration from the mighty seed, and enjoy weaving it into blends for your self-care practice and your work with your clients.

All geranium essential oils, regardless of origin, are produced from the following two main hybrid species (Weiss 2000): 1. Pelargonium capitatum (L.) L'H\u00e9rit. x P. radens H.E.Moore; this hybrid is the source of the so-called Bourbon type of geranium oil (Bourbon refers to the Isle de Bourbon, i.e. La R\u00e9union, originally the most important production center in the world). 2. Pelargonium capitatum (L.) L'H\u00e9rit. x P. graveolens L'H\u00e9rit. ex mobile pale yellow-green liquid with an intense rosy-sweet, warm, somewhat green- fruity odor; the odor varies with the exact botanical cultivar. The Bourbon type of geranium in particular has a mild musky overlay to it. Perfumery status: A heart note of high intensity and medium persistence. Extraction: Steam distillation of the fresh herb in flower, at many times throughout the year, depending on the location, but usually in spring and autumn; distillation usually takes about four hours. 1 kg oil yield from: 500-700 kg of the fresh herb (a fairly poor yield). Production areas: R\u00e9union, Madagascar, Egypt, Morocco, China, India. Although South Africa is the native habitat of all geraniums, Grasse in South France, in the early nineteenth century, began the first commercial cultivation of geranium for oil production. From here, oil production spread to the French Colonies, notably La R\u00e9union in the 1870s, then Algeria, Morocco and Egypt soon after.

Feeding an ever more thirsty perfume industry in Grasse, the Isle de Bourbon, now known as La R\u00e9union, has been the epicenter of geranium essential oil production since the 1870s - to the point of lending its name to the Bourbon cultivar grown on that French island colony. Although the taxonomy of geraniums has virtually everyone confused, the good news is, as far as therapeutic usage is concerned, the two main types of rose geranium oils are completely interchangeable. Warm, rich, rosy sweet in fragrance, geranium oil's deeply balancing and relaxing effects have been - Geranium Essential Oil Profile continued -12Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHArecognized by aromatherapists for many years. In terms of aroma energetics, this quintessentially sweet oil provides the perfect example of what it means to possess the sweet fragrance energy. In three words: nourishing, balancing and calming. These are the three big interwoven themes that underpin most of geranium's superb versatility in clinical practice. Geranium, \"helps us to reconnect us to our feeling life, to our emotional sensitivity\" (Mojay 1996). Inhaling geranium is truly a litmus test for the balance in our emotional bank account. Any deficit; loss, insecurity or neediness in our feeling for life can be registered with great sensitivity in the presence of its deeply supportive and nurturing aroma. As geranium also supports our inner strength, as well as security, it is also applicable to individuals chronically ridden with low self-esteem and feelings of guilt, especially in introverted personalities. Emotional balance, stability and calm are truly key words for geranium. As a key oil for bracing emotional instability, geranium can be helpful for moodiness and mood swings and, by extension, addiction disorders, especially food addictions. Its closely related calming effect has shown good results in states of depression with anxiety, and with negative, distressed feelings in general. Interestingly, geranium is also known to exert a relaxant action on the nervous system to the extent that it is absorbed internally. Geranium's physiological actions will engage to the extent that systemic internal absorption occurs, and therefore strongly depends on the delivery method chosen. Here, geranium as an aromatic remedy is essentially regulating, restorative and decongestant. It is nothing less than a deep metabolic regulator and restorative in dysregulated, weak and congestive conditions. Acting on the pivotal axis of liver, pancreas, adrenal cortex and spleen, geranium essentially re-creates proper cycles and timing among these hormone-secreting organs/glands. This establishes its status as the premier essential oil for virtually all conditions of metabolic dysregulation. This applies equally to dysregulated liver glycogen cycles, dysregulated blood-sugar levels and dysregulated adrenocortical hormone levels. The only herbal remedy to come close to this profile is yarrow ( Achillea millefolium ). The clinical evidence for geranium's unfailing ability to treat hyper and hypo-glycemia - dysglycemia in short - is overwhelming. To regulate blood sugar, the oil seems to reduce insulin resistance at the cellular level, although we can only conjecture as to the mechanisms involved. Likewise, geranium evens out and regulates cortisol and DHEA levels in conditions of adrenal dysregulation, as seen in their adaptive phase of resistance to stress. And last but not least, geranium's ability to regulate menstrual cycles, regardless of which hormone is deficient, is long established. Peri- menopause is also a strong indication for this remedy because of its adrenocortical restorative action. In this respect, geranium's important components, geraniol and nerol, very likely act as weak estrogens (Harris 2007).- Geranium Essential Oil Profile continued - 13Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAGeranium has been dubbed a woman's oil for many of these reasons - and they do not stop there. This oil shows significant fluid decongestant and detoxicant actions that work in tandem on the liver, kidneys, uterus and the whole lymph- and venous blood-filled pelvic basin. When any of these organs are congested and burdened with metabolic toxins, geranium is the remedy of choice. It turns out, then, that we are looking here at an important liver, venous and lymphatic decongestant and detoxicant with a good diuretic action to match. Noteworthy is the experimental success of the oil's key component, geraniol, in detoxifying the liver and mildly reducing blood cholesterol, as well as suppressing the growth of aggressive cancers (Broadhurst & Duke 1997). In terms of microbial conditions, geranium is decidedly antifungal in action for a broad array of fungal infections, while being less effective as an antibacterial. These actions support its application for damp types of conditions of the digestive tract, such as intestinal dysbiosis and candidiasis. Geranium's versatility in treating a variety of different skin conditions, for both medical and cosmetic purposes, is well known. It pivots on its rich combination of actions on physical tissue, foremost of which are its excellent skin regenerating and anti-inflammatory actions. These reasons establish geranium as a premier aromatic remedy for tissue trauma both acute and chronic. Selective References: Bowles, E. Joy. The Chemistry of Aromatherapeutic Essential Oils.

What is better than that first feeling of spring in the air after a long cold winter? Nature transforms from the dark cold months of winter slowly opening up to the light airy feeling of warm, blossoming spring, and much needed sunshine. Regardless of where you live spring is a time of cleansing and renewal. In many ancient traditions \"spring cleaning\" was a time to meticulously clean the home, and in some cases redecorate in preparation for a holiday, as in the Jewish tradition of Passover, or just cleansing the house for the New Year. In many Native American cultures spring is a time for fasting in order to remove all the toxins and heavy foods built up in the body during the winter months. In parts of North America the winters are cold and everyone is indoors. Houses can get musty and dusty, so spring is the time to open the windows and let the stagnant air out and invite positive fresh energy into your home. This same principle applies to mind and body. A reassessment of our emotions, diet and lifestyle are necessary at least once a year. It's the opportunity to ask yourself, not only is your diet nourishing to your life, but are your relationships and thoughts also nourishing to your life? Diet and lifestyle are intertwined so you can't assess one without the other. Many of us start the New Year with a promise to lose weight, which is great because late winter or early spring is an ideal time to move from heavy foods to lighter fare. Moving to a lighter diet keeps us in rhythm with nature which makes for an easier transition from one season to another. Solstice celebrations are a time to welcome and honor the new season, and remind us that we are connected with nature and ancient traditions. In the Indian tradition of Ayurveda, the spring is a time of bitter foods since they promote the release of bile via the liver and the gall bladder. The liver and gall bladder are equally as important in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The liver is responsible for filtering the blood and detoxifying harmful substances. The bile it produces is needed to breakdown fats in the body so they can be absorbed in the small intestines. There are various methods of detoxing or cleansing. Juice cleanses and fasts are two such ways. If you choose to fast, talk to your doctor first. I recommend working with a practitioner who can support you throughout a fast. Both juice detoxes and fasting are not easy. Many people get discouraged, give up, and run for the fried foods and sweets. I prefer a 21 day detox using whole organic fruits, vegetables and herbal teas. In Ayurveda, it is believed it takes 21 days to make lasting changes. Detoxing by eating organic fruits and vegetables makes it easier to stick with because it still allows the motion of chewing, and for someone who has never experienced a detox before it's a familiar way to ease into it. Once this initiation phase is over, and if you still want to fast, it will be less traumatic for your body and mind. For the 21 day cleanse it's important to eliminate dairy, gluten, soy, sugar and meat. After 21 days you can gradually start bringing back small amounts of one food group each week. Going forward from this point, try to replace as much red meat as possible with cold water fish. Fish have the least amount of toxins and are high in omega three fatty acids (which calms inflammation in the body). Make sure all your fruits and vegetables are organic. In trying to free your body of toxins you don't want to add more. HOliStic nutritiOn Spring Forward by Maria Tabone Expand your knowledge of holistic nutrition with certified plant-based nutrition expert Maria Tabone.16Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAThe foods listed below are detoxing to the body and can be eaten cooked, raw or juiced during a cleanse. If you have digestive problems do not eat anything raw. You can lightly saut\u00e9 vegetables with olive oil (Olea europaea ), coconut oil (Cocos nucifera ), or ghee (which is clarified butter). Ghee is very good for digestion. Start each day with a 12 ounce cup of warm water. Do not drink cold beverages or anything with ice as it extinguishes the digestive fire needed for proper absorption of nutrients. Artichokes (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus) Artichokes are rich in antioxidants, especially silymarin, which helps detoxify the liver. They also help the liver breakdown fats. Avocados (Persea americana ) Avocados are a form of healthy fats. They cleanse the colon and provide much needed fiber. Sprinkle a little kelp on them in a salad. Beets (Beta vulgaris) Beets are a root vegetable that are full of vitamins and minerals. They purify the liver and blood by flushing out toxins, as well as being cancer fighters. Don't forget to eat the greens of the beets! I cook - Spring Forward continued - them with some organic extra virgin olive oil ( Leafy VegetablesGreen leafy vegetables contain chlorophyll, which feeds good bacteria in the gut, so eat plenty of kale (Brassica oleracea leaf (Lactuca sativa ). The more color there is in your lettuce, the more nutrients. Dandelions (Taraxacum officinalis ) are a great liver detoxifier. You can eat the greens and drink dandelion tea. Herbs and Spices (Allium cepa) contain vitamins and minerals, and all help with detoxification. Taking a \u00bc teaspoon of cinnamon a day may also help reduce blood sugar levels. Oil: Only use extra virgin olive oil ( Olea europaea ), ghee (which is clarified butter) or oil (Cocos nucifera ). 17Aromatherapy Journal Maria Tabone Maria Tabone is a Holistic Health Educator, Ayurveda Nutritionist, Registered Yoga Teacher and Author.

They not only help cleanse heavy metals from the body, but they also contain iodine, which is essential for thyroid function. Fruit Eat all the colors of the rainbow when it comes to both fruits and vegetables. Berries are good antioxidants. Pineapple (Ananas comosus ) contains bromelain, which helps digestion and is good for cleansing the colon. Apples (Malus domestica ) contain pectin, which is a soluble fiber that aids in the removal of heavy metals and toxins from the body. Beverages All herbal teas are fine to drink. Have a cup of milk thistle each day. Both are beneficial to liver function and detoxification. Lots of good quality filtered water is essential. However, make sure it's warm. Stay away from caffeine and sugared drinks. Detoxing also includes the mind. Take a break from using social media, TV and phones as much as you possibly can. Give silence a chance, and try meditation by simply sitting in silence and paying attention to the in-flow and out-flow of your breath. Proper breathing both detoxes and calms the body.

At the time, I was working as a waitress in London, whilst at the same time studying to be a drama teacher. One evening, before work, one of the other waitresses presented me with the list and uses of the Bach Flower remedies. My first reaction was, \"Yes I need them all!\" I began using Bach Flower remedies straight away and carried on doing so for many years. Throughout the years, I am sure their subtle but effective action on my emotional and mental states have played a crucial role in my own healing journey. Since then I have gone on to discover other flower essence makers, and now many of the essences I use I make myself. Dr. Edward Bach was a homeopath who believed that the cause of disease was emotional; a conflict between soul and mind that needed spiritual and mental effort to eradicate. He speaks in his work, \"Heal Thyself,\" about his belief in the existence of the soul, and how the root of disease and unhappiness is often linked with conflict from either the material world or other people, leading one away from the soul's real path. The second major theme that Dr. Bach relates to health is that of unity and interrelatedness. He outlined some of the human defects he believed to be adverse to unity such as pride, cruelty, hate, self-love, ignorance and greed; stating that illness sets in if one continues in these defects after knowing they are wrong. I have met flower essence practitioners who will only work with the 38 Bach Flower remedies; believing that Dr. Bach created a range of remedies that were complete, and that there is no need to diverge from them. I personally believe that the system and remedies that Dr. Bach offered to the world in the 1930's had, and still have, their work to do. But there is absolutely no reason why his system shouldn't be used to experiment with other plants and continue to add to what is now becoming a vast information base of flower essences. There are as many essences out there as there are plants. By making one's own essences, herbalists and practitioners will find the flowers that speak to them personally, and through this relationship be able to hear when it is the right time to suggest one to a client. What are Flower Essences? Flower essences are the vibrational message of a flower transmitted to water by solarization, and the vibrational resonance of the flower is memorized by the water. Today in my work as an herbalist, I make flower essences to use with clients. A certain plant will attract my attention and I may feel drawn to make an essence. Just before, or during, the process, I sit with the flower and listen and meditate (over the years I have learned to listen and not get way-laid with mental doubts or questioning); I jot down in my notebook what comes to mind. I will later trial the essence myself, and ask colleagues to trial it too, in order to build a picture of the plant's message and how it can be used in herbal practice. As herbalists (and aromatherapists) we are more often than not confronted by clients who are already showing physical signs of illness or disease. It is these physical signs that motivate them to come and see us in the first place. Although it would be advantageous to see clients at the first signs feature cOlumn Making and Using Flower Essences by Cathy Skipper Discover how to make your own Flower Essences. 20Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAof emotional or mental imbalance, most clients wouldn't think about visiting an herbalist before being physically ill. However, once a client comes to an herbalist for a physical disorder I believe that it is beneficial to try and work on several levels of healing: the removal of physical symptoms in order to relieve the client of pain and discomfort, the lifestyle changes necessary to avoid the problem repeating itself, and the emotional and mental issues that may be underlying the illness. Generally, I have found that the more a plant preparation is concentrated, the more likely it is to work on a deeply physical level; and the more a preparation is diluted, the more likely it is to shift things on a more subtle level. This does not mean that concentrated plant medicines do not have an effect on emotions, or vice versa. For example; if I want to zap an infectious bacteria, I am more likely to use an essential oil with high phenol content over a flower essence. If I am looking for direction in line with one's higher self, flower essences would be my choice. How to Make Flower Essences Making flower essences is an extremely simple procedure; however, to obtain a quality remedy a certain frame of mind, and attention to detail is needed. I love the way that toxicity is not an issue with flower essences. If you find yourself attracted to a certain flower, go ahead and make an essence with it. No molecular trace of the plant will be found in the finished essence. Having said that, when one of the young botanists at the herbal school where I teach decided that he wanted to make a range of essences with extremely toxic we guided him away from this idea. Although the flower essences would not do any harm physically, energetically he was - Making and Using Flower Essences continued - 21Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAdefinitely not ready to work with this type of plant, which could have dangerous emotional implications if used without care, experience, and respect. Although flower essences do not demand any particular skill in order to make them, one definitely needs to be ready for this type of medicine making. An understanding and awareness of an intuitive nature is necessary. Materials Needed A small glass bowl, which should be used uniquely for essence making. Fresh spring, or mountain stream, water collected in a glass container if possible. It is great if you can get fresh, wild water that comes from near to where the flowers you are using grow. This is not always possible. So either collect spring water from somewhere else, or if all else fails, buy spring water in a bottle. I do not advise using tap water, as it will be full of fluoride etc. A funnel (a glass one if possible) A dark glass bottle (125ml is a good size). Organic grain alcohol (at least 40%, such as vodka). Directions Before picking the flowers, use your intuition to feel whether or not you have their permission. Flower essences are made on sunny days, as the sun's rays shining through the flowers, help transmit the message to the water. This is known as solarization. 1. Fill the bowl with spring water and put it in the sun, preferably among the flowers the essence is being made from. It is the vibrational imprint of the flowers that is going to be memorized by the water, not the vibrational imprint of the essence maker. In order to put the least possible of one's own energy into the essence, consciously distance yourself from the action. By this, I mean, when collecting the flowers imagine you are just an instrument, try and remain neutral. 2. Gently drop the flowers onto the surface of the water. This is not an infusion so they do not need to be immersed. Cover the surface of the water with flowers. 3. Leave in the sun for at least two hours where there is no risk of shadows falling on the bowl. 4. Come back to the bowl, and with the help of a couple of twigs or leaves, (so not to touch the water) remove the flowers from the bowl. 5. Using the glass funnel, pour the water into the glass bottle until it is half full. Fill the bottle to the top with the alcohol. This is the \"mother essence\" or \"mother tincture,'' and it is from this bottle that the drops will be taken to make the \"stock bottle.\" Once back inside, take seven drops from the mother tincture and put them into a bottle (20 ml. bottle). Fill the bottle with alcohol. This is the stock bottle. It is from this bottle that the medicine is made. Put two to seven drops into a small dropper bottle and fill - Making and Using Flower Essences continued - 22Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAwith alcohol. Label the bottle. The essence is now ready for the client. Dosages I tend to advise clients to take a couple of drops in water, or directly under the tongue, when they think about it, preferably as far away from meals as possible. Many people carry the small dropper bottle with them at first and take the essences regularly. When they start to forget, it is usually because the essence has done its job, and there is less need for it. However, as their action is subtle, I do try and encourage clients to take essences for at least twenty-one days, and depending on the issues being dealt with, for up to three months. It is possible to blend essences, and each practitioner has his/her own techniques. I tend to go for one essence at a time, and would advise not to blend any more than three at a time. Once things have started to shift, a change of essence can be helpful as the next emotional layer is revealed.- Making and Using Flower Essences continued - Last May, whilst staying in a family house in the Ardeche region of France, I came across the most beautiful field, full of wild flowers and orchids. I had been thinking about making a wild orchid essence for some time, but as orchids usually grow alone or in tiny communities, the opportunity had not arisen. (Saskia, from Saskia's Flower Essences, later told me that you can actually make essences without picking the flowers but just by leaving the bowl of water nearby). Straight away I knew it was an invitation to make some flower essences, and maybe even an orchid essence. I organized all the supplies I would need, and set three days aside during the following weekend to come back alone, especially for this purpose. The first day I spent getting rid of emotional stuff that was bothering me, meditating and getting in tune with myself, in order to be in the right frame of mind. The second and third day I spent essence making. The field was teaming with wild flowers and two species of orchids; heath spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza maculate) in abundance, and burnt orchid (neotinea ustulata), that was nearing the end of its vegetative cycle. Following my instinct and meditating with the flowers of each essence I made, I spent two days making the following essences. (The descriptions next to them are the notes I took during the process). Jersey thrift ( Armeria arenaria ) - helps the sense of community, working for the whole, service, fluidity and moving together in the same direction. Oxeye daisy ( Leucanthemum vulgare) - total opening without fear, no holding back, confidence in being oneself, honesty, simplicity, innocence, \"What you see is what you get,\" giving freely, being able to receive, joy, open heart. Dog rose (Rosa canina) - soft, gentle, loving, caring, motherly, warming caressing, holding you, tender, feminine, generational healing. Wild sage (Salvia pratensis ) - force, power, defense, strength, be in the here and now, leadership 23Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAqualities, balanced energies. \"To have backbone,\"' linking earth and sky energy. Heath spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata) - subtle energies, high resonance, a teacher in fine-tuning, spiritual connection, guiding, unconditional love, an aerial for global love/universal love, leading us into the future. It is only now, writing out these notes, that I notice fully how much these essences seem to be right for the needs of today. I would have loved to make an essence from the burnt orchid but there were not many left, and I knew that even by taking just a few flowers from each flower head it was not right. I decided therefore, to just sit with it. What happened next has no words to describe, and there is no need, as each one of us builds our own unique relationship with the plants we spend time with. It is sufficient to say that the tiny burnt orchid backed up the information I had already learned from the heath spotted orchid. That is, orchids are not just highly evolved botanically, but they are also highly evolved beings, here to guide us in this time of planetary change. The orchid essence I made that day is very powerful. I have been trailing it, as has my flower essence maker friend, Saskia. The conclusion we have come to is: this particular essence is, at the moment, working on the level of \"healing the healer,\" rather than the client. - Making and Using Flower Essences continued - About Cathy Skipper Cathy Skipper is originally English but has been living in France for over 25 years, after spending many of those years living close to the land and farming (vines, blue-berries and medicinal plants) she now teaches herbalism at the Ecole Lyonnaise de Plantes M\u00e9dicinales.

If you are making bath and body care products, this column is a must read! Record keeping is, or should be, an integral part of any business. If you are making and selling aromatherapy products you should have written procedures in place, and detailed records documenting when and how those procedures were followed. It's more than just a, \"good idea,\" it is required according to good manufacturing practices guidelines. In a previous article in the Aromatherapy Journal, Autumn 2013.3 I covered what records are recommended under good manufacturing practices guidelines. \"In the United States, good manufacturing practices are defined in regulation for drugs, nutritional supplements and food. For cosmetics, the FDA has published guidelines in the form of an inspection checklist. 1 In addition, the International Standards Organization has published a standard for cosmetic GMPs (ISO 22716:2007). In June, 2013, the FDA released a draft update to their existing Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Guidelines/Inspection Checklist which incorporates many aspects of ISO 22716. As of this date, there are no GMP regulations or guidelines that are specifically for aromatherapy products. The determining factor as to what GMP applies for aromatherapy products would be how the product is classified based on its intended use.\" In this article we will look at the different ways those records might be kept. Recommended Formats In the United States, the existing cosmetic Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines2 do not specify what format is required for records. The draft guidance 4 (currently non-binding recommendations) state that paper or electronic formats are acceptable. The International Standards Organization (ISO) 22716 GMP Guidelines3 also state that hard-copy papers or electronic data processing records are acceptable. So, from the standpoint of good manufacturing practices recommendations and guidelines, either paper or paperless record keeping is acceptable. The question is, \"which works for you, and for which types of documents?\" Types of Documents In general, there are three types of documents you need to keep for good manufacturing practices. These are: Logs & Lists Reference Documents Checklists Logs & Lists Logs and lists are summary sheets which generally list all of the items within a particular group. For example, you could have logs or lists of:26Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHA- Record Keeping continued - Suppliers Ingredients Packaging Items Ingredients & Materials Received Master Formulations Batch Records Standard Operating Procedures Generally, logs or lists include the item, an identifying number, a date and some descriptive information about the item. Where there is a related electronic file, the location (even as a link) could be included. For example; a list of ingredients might include an identifying number, the name of the ingredient, the preferred supplier, location of the specification sheet, and the date you started using the item. Lists and logs are easy to create on paper. Lined binder paper or a lined notebook, with columns drawn in, and you are ready to go. If you are seeking to go paperless using a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or Open Office makes it easy to create the log or list. These programs also allow sorting or searching the content, which can come in handy when the list becomes very long. Reference Documents Reference documents are documents that are written out, used for reference, and are not often changed. Typically your reference documents might include: Master Formulas Ingredient/Material Specifications Standard Operating Procedures In this day and age most of these documents will be created using a word processing or spreadsheet program. Those who prefer paper could keep a binder or notebook with printed copies available for easy reference. In fact, good manufacturing practice guidelines recommend having all the necessary Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on hand and easily accessible. Over time there may be a need to revise a reference document. In such a case, the newly revised document should be made available for use, and the original unrevised document should be saved and archived. Checklists While reference documents tend to state what should be done, checklists document what was actually done. Many reference documents will have accompanying checklists. For example; Master Formulas have related Batch Records (a type of checklist), Ingredient/Material Specification Sheets have related Incoming Material Checklists (to verify the quality of the incoming materials), and SOPs frequently have checklists to record the completion of the steps of the SOP. Checklists are most likely to be in electronic format having been created in a word processing spreadsheet or other computer program. Since the whole point of a checklist is that it is completed at the time (not after the fact), printing a paper copy of the checklist is the most common approach. Alternatively, a totally paperless approach would involve completing a checklist on a tablet or other device as it is being done, in which case you wouldn't need to do anything with paper at all. Once completed your paper checklist has original information which is important and should be kept. It may be needed to verify what happened if an ingredient turns out to be bad or a batch fails. In a paperless system the checklist should be scanned into an electronic format retaining all of the original data and notations made to it. In addition, you could type the details into an electronic version of the form. Provided the paper document has been scanned into your electronic device, and the contents are completely readable, the paper document can then be destroyed. In a paper-based filing system the completed checklist should be filed appropriately. Backups and Offsite Storage All records should be regularly backed up with a copy of the backup stored off-site.

Many of these exuberantly abundant herbs are maligned as \"weeds.\" The mere sight of their presence inspires farmers and homeowners alike to reach for the herbicide. I propose that our culture radically alter our perception of plants. These edible weeds are a huge untapped resource in cities, home gardens and farms. Many people living in urban areas do not have access to fresh vegetables, and they could learn how to use these free-for-the-picking wild foods and medicines. In this article, I chose to explore two of these common springtime weeds with you, based on their easy identification and usefulness as food and medicine. In the early spring chickweed (Stellaria media, Caryophyllaceae) and violet (Viola spp., Violaceae) can be found throughout most of North America. Chickweed is one of my oldest green friends. We became acquainted over two decades ago, and I am still enamored. This weed is beloved among wild foods enthusiasts for its succulent mild flavor, which lends itself nicely to salad, pesto, and as a garnish. It is also a gentle medicinal plant, safe for babies and elders alike. I will begin with its identification, characteristics and habitat. Chickweed is a low-growing annual, which bears smooth paired leaves (botanically called opposite leaves) with no teeth. The leaves are generally as big as a pinky nail but, given enough nitrogen and moisture, they can grow much larger. Chickweed hugs the soil or clambers over rocks and neighboring plants. Its stem is green or reddish and never woody, as it is an annual. The flowers grow in small clusters and resemble diminutive white stars. They appear to have ten petals; however, they are actually made up of five petals so deeply cleft that they give the appearance of ten separate petals. Chickweed also has a unique identification clue; hold a bit of chickweed up to the sunlight and you Herbalist Juliet Blankespoor shares the beauty of chickweed and violet during the spring months. 30Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAwill see a single line of white hairs traveling up the stem. You may need to twirl the stem a bit to see this characteristic. Notice how the hairs travel in a straight line along the stem in between the leaves. However, the line switches positions on the stem at the leaf juncture, giving the hairs a spiraling or candy-cane-like appearance. It sounds more confusing than it really is. If possible, go have a look at a chickweed stem and it will become crystal clear. Note that this line of hairs is unusual, but there are undoubtedly other plants bearing this trait. It is imperative to combine all of the above characteristics for proper identification. Chickweed's close relative, the mouse-ear chickweed (Cerastium fontanum , Caryophyllaceae), is quite similar in appearance, grows in similar habitats, and can be found throughout the United States. Mouse-ear chickweed is hairier and coarser than chickweed. It is also edible, although not as tasty. The two can readily be told apart by the fact that mouse-ear chickweed has stems that are completely surrounded by hairs. Chickweed is often found growing with the non-edible Persian speedwell (Vernoica persica , Plantaginaceae), and many people confuse the two. Speedwell has blue flowers with four petals, coarsely toothed leaves, and stems that lack the single line of hairs. To my knowledge Persian speedwell is not edible. Another look-alike is arvensis , Myrsinaceae), which has peach-colored flowers, and also lacks the telltale single line of hairs. It is imperative to properly identify any plant before you harvest it for food or medicine. If in doubt, do not harvest! Consult your local extension agent, master gardener, or trusted herbalist if you need help with identification. Chickweed can be found in old manure and compost piles, gardens, sidewalks, and along trails. It grows in full sun or partial shade, depending on the season and bio-region. Chickweed is native to temperate Eurasia and is accustomed to cool moist weather. It shies away from full summer sun in hotter climates. In milder regions chickweed can be found throughout the winter or in very early spring. Here, in the southern Appalachians, chickweed has two major appearances; early spring and fall. Take care to harvest it only where you know no one has sprayed herbicide. It is also important to avoid gathering plants near roads and railroads, as the surrounding soil is typically contaminated with lead and other toxins. If you live in the city consider visiting a local organic urban farm or community gardens, where you are likely to find an abundance of chickweed (and some of the other herbs in this article), along with gardeners who are happy to share the bounty. I harvest chickweed with scissors, cutting back the top few tender inches, which will generally include some leaves, flowers, flower buds and stem, all of which are edible and tasty. After receiving a \"haircut,\" the plant will grow tender new shoots, making it possible to repeatedly cut chickweed until it gets too leggy and chewy. It is important to not cut below the top few inches, as these lower portions are quite fibrous\u2014eating them will force your jaws into working overtime and leave you feeling like a cow. Look for densely growing patches of chickweed. The neighboring stems hold each other up, making the \"haircut\" harvesting method much easier and quicker than harvesting lone plants which have a more splayed, low-growing habit. Once in the kitchen the greens can be rinsed and chopped coarsely - stems, leaves, and flowers alike. Chickweed is tasty enough to use as a salad base, or it can be added to lettuce with other wild greens, - Chickweed and Violet continued - Chickweed, Stellaria media31Aromatherapy Journal Spring officinale , Asteraceae). I use the chopped greens in lieu of lettuce on sandwiches and in wraps. One of my all- time favorite ways to enjoy its tender tasty leaves is in pesto. Try substituting chickweed for basil in your favorite pesto recipe. We use this wild pesto to dress up pizza and pasta. Additionally, we enjoy it as a dip for raw veggies and crackers. I make a big batch and freeze the excess in ice cube trays so we can enjoy chickweed pesto year-round. Because chickweed's flavor is so mild, it makes an excellent base for more pungent or bitter greens, such as garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata , Brassicaceae) and dandelion greens. You can steam or saut\u00e9 chickweed, but I generally enjoy it raw as it cooks down substantially. Here is my recipe for a pesto made with creasy greens, wild turnip and chickweed Ingredients: Half of an onion ( cloves of garlic (Allium sativum 4 cups of washed raw coarsely chopped chickweed (Stellaria media ) tops 4 ounces virgin oil ( Olea europaea ) Sesamum indicum ) butter Half cup of freshly whole pecans (Carya illinoinensis ) 3 ounces of Feta cheese Salt to taste Sautee the onions and two cloves of garlic in olive oil until the onions begin to turn translucent. Add the greens and saut\u00e9 until the greens are tender. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Add the chickweed, pecans, olive oil, tahini, and feta to the blender or food processor. Add one to two cloves of garlic, depending on your love of garlic, and then add the greens after they have cooled a bit. Blend by slowly adding the greens. Blend and add more greens until your pesto is coarsely ground. Feel free to add more olive oil for a creamier consistency. If you've ever blown the motor in a blender you know how important it is to not stress the blender to overheating. This pesto has a pungent flavor reminiscent of arugula or wild mustard. If that's not your cup of tea try cucumber sandwiches. Seriously, you can mellow the flavor by adding more chickweed and less of the mustard greens. Serve as a dip with crackers and veggies, or as a spread on a pizza crust or flat bread. Another option is to toss over pasta or veggies. Feel free to substitute other nuts for the pecans, and seasonal wild or cultivated greens for the greens featured in this recipe. Chickweed is easy to digest and high in vitamins and minerals; and thus, it is often prepared as a first food after a long illness or stomach flu. It also has a reputation as a diet herb, and many people swear by it as an ally in weight loss. It is typically eaten or prepared as a tea for this purpose, although some - Chickweed and Violet continued - 32Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHApeople have reported good results with the tincture. In any case, the fiber is a welcome addition to most Americans' diet. Like all leafy greens, chickweed bulks up a meal, while adding very little calories. According to John Kallas, of the Institute for the Study of Wild Plants, chickweed is higher in iron and zinc than any of the commonly cultivated greens such as spinach, collards and kale. Medicinally, chickweed is cooling, soothing and anti-inflammatory. It is used topically in salves, herbal oils, poultices and compresses. Internally, it can be used as a tea or in capsules. Some of chickweed's nutritive qualities are wasted in tincture, as the alcohol doesn't effectively extract minerals or mucilage. For this reason I generally don't recommend chickweed tincture. It is considered a blood cleanser and tonic strengthening herb, especially after a long convalescence. The high levels of iron in chickweed make it a powerful ally in iron-deficiency anemia. It can be ingested liberally as a food or in tea to help build blood. Chickweed tea is often recommended as a daily tonic, along with red clover (Trifolium pratense, for acne, psoriasis, and eczema. With its soothing cooling nature it is a common ingredient in herbal heartburn remedies, and equally beneficial for sore throats. Topically, chickweed is applied as a poultice or compress for conjunctivitis, rashes, chicken pox, poison ivy, contact dermatitis, and eczema. One of chickweed's frequent companions is the common blue violet ( Viola sororia , Violaceae), which is native to most of central and eastern North America. It is a common sight in lawns, gardens, trail sides and sidewalk cracks. The common blue violet is typically considered a \"weed\" because of its relative ease in adapting to human disturbance, but it is actually native to North America. The leaves and flowers of the common blue violet are edible and medicinal. The \"confederate violet\" is a cultivar (cultivated variety) of Viola sororia. It has white flowers with blue streaks and is a common inhabitant of lawns in the southeastern United States. The Viola genus contains around 550 species, mostly found in the temperate climates of the world. Many species of violet are used similarly to the common blue violet. Most wild foods authors report that the blue and white flowered species of violet are all edible, but not the yellow flowered species. Other authors write that all species are serviceable. I notice that the leaves of some of the wild violets have an unpleasant soapy flavor, which leaves a funny feeling at the back of my throat; this is most likely from high levels of saponins. I avoid these plants, and instead go for the milder tasting species. Some woodland species of violet are rare and should not be disturbed. A good course of action might be to identify the common species of violet in your area and then research their edibility and/or traditional medicinal usage. The sweet violet (Viola odorata , Violaceae) is the principal medicinal and culinary species used in Europe. It has escaped cultivation in many locales, as it is popularly planted for its fragrance. Much of the American use of violets stems from the European's herbal tradition. Interestingly, most violet species in North America lack the signature aroma of sweet violet. Violet's heart-shaped leaves and characteristic irregular flowers are a familiar sight to most people. Children seem to have a special affinity for this charismatic group of plants; perhaps its bright flowers are well within their reach. Violets actually - Chickweed and Violet continued - 33Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHA- Chickweed and Violet continued - have many look-alikes, many of which are inedible or poisonous, so only harvest them when the flowers are present and you are 100% sure you have a violet. See the comments in the chickweed section above, regarding general cautions on harvesting and proper identification, applicable for all wild plants. Violet is cooling and moistening, and is used internally as a blood cleanser and lymphatic stimulant. It is taken as a tea or syrup and can also be eaten for its medicine. The exact dosage is not especially important since it can safely be consumed in large quantities. As a gentle food herb, violet is generally safe for elders, youngsters, and people who are taking pharmaceuticals. Violet has a rich tradition in Europe, where it has been used for centuries as a pulmonary remedy for a dry, hacking cough. It is often recommended for bronchitis and whooping cough, along with the roots of can also be used as a tonic for chronically swollen lymph nodes. Topically, violet is used as a poultice, compress, infused oil and salve in the treatment of dry or chaffed skin, eczema, varicose veins and hemorrhoids. It is cooling, soothing and anti-inflammatory. I enjoy violet leaves and flowers in salad, pesto and in sandwiches and wraps. The roots of most violet species can cause nausea and vomiting and should not be eaten. The leaves can be harvested with scissors, as described earlier for chickweed. Violet can be harvested multiple times throughout the spring until the leaves become too fibrous. It will often make a comeback in the fall with a flush of tender new growth. Violet leaves can be saut\u00e9ed or steamed. Add them to soups as a nutrient-dense thickener. The flowers make a lovely garnish\u2014we sprinkle them on salads and add them to cakes and pancakes. Violet flowers are often candied or frozen into ice cubes. Violet leaves contain a good amount of mucilage, or soluble fiber, and they are helpful in lowering cholesterol levels (similar to oatmeal). Soluble fiber is also helpful in restoring healthy populations of 34Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHA Primary instructor: Juliet Blankespoor828.683.5233 www.chestnutherbs.comDistance Learning Course A diversity of online modules with innovative video, full color photography, herbal recipes & raucous humorRoots of Herbalism 100 hours April to October.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine, spring is the time of the Wood element. Spring's Wood qualities are vision, new growth, and expression of life. Anger is the emotion of the Wood element. Wood's sound is shouting. The Wood organs are the liver - whose function is strategic planning - and the gall bladder, which helps us make decisions. If our vision and plans come up against obstacles, anger arises. When the Wood element is in balance, we feel more stability, and less frustration. 1 When the liver is fatigued by sleep deprivation, insufficient nutrition, lack of physical exercise, or emotional strain, the liver's vital energy becomes constrained. Spring allergies can emerge from irritability and over-reactivity of the emotions, and of the immune system. 2 How can we support our clients whose Wood is out of balance? Here are three glorious essential oils that can bring balance, and support a harmonious springtime seasonal transition, by reducing the release of histamine in the body and soothing inflammation. Be sure to do a patch test if you suspect your client, or you, may be allergic to an essential oil. Essential oil of blue tansy (Tanacetum annuum ), a North African flower from the daisy family, is a strong choice for treating allergies and inflammation that result from vital energy (Qi) constraint. 3 Blue chamazulene is the chemical constituent that gives Tanacetum annuum its anti-inflammatory characteristics. turmeric (Curcuma longa ) have been under study for many years. 4 A turmeric CO2 extract, at a 4% dilution with carrier oil, may help suppress histamine production when massaged into the feet daily. 5 Take caution with turmeric oil; it is a photosensitizer, which makes the skin more sensitive to UV light. The heady scent of linden blossom CO2 ( Tilia properties. Linden blossom is also used to treat headaches. Linden blossom CO2 extract needs to be warmed to become liquid. A safety issue to be aware of with linden blossom is that it could cause low blood pressure. For a client who is stubborn or overly-attached, acupuncturist Neil Gumenick says the acu-point (LV2) Liver 2, \"Walk Between Fire Point,\" can be integrated into a massage treatment to bring flexibility with the good humor of fire along with love integrating arOmatHeraPy witH maSSage Spring Season by Lisa Mertz, LMT, PhD A Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approach to the season of Spring. 37Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAand compassion to the client's plans.1 Liver 2 is located on the dorsum of the foot, between the big toe and the second toe, a half thumb width from the margin of the web. Massaging an essential oil on an acu-point can enhance treatment effects. Apply the oil with light pressure at first, allowing for deeper pressure as you feel receptivity. Be cautious with essential oils; use a 5% dilution, which is approximately one Tablespoon of carrier oil, such as jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis ) with ten drops of the essential oil. For the whole body massage, use a blend that includes the oil, or oils, you chose for points. Limit the number of the oils you use, and make sure they work together synergistically. Also, it's best not to overwhelm the client by diffusing oils in the room when using blends for your massage. Helpful springtime herbal teas to choose from for your massage space include: Stinging Nettle helps thin inner fire; and Eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis ) helps watery eyes and runny noses. As we make the transition through springtime, the season of passionate new growth, we prepare for the emergence of summer's fiery joy.References: 1.

Coconut is used in Hindu religious and wedding ceremonies (the flowers and oils are used for anointing the bride and groom). In South Asia the tree was called Sriphala or Fruit of the Gods. The Portuguese named the coconut 'coquo,' which means 'goat kid'. This name was applied due the nut's outer appearance; two eyes and a small mouth combined with the fibrous type shell resembling that of a goat's face and fur. 2 Coconut trees originated from the islands of the Indian Ocean, and are cultivated in Indonesia, Malaysia and the West Indies. Later they were introduced into Africa, Brazil, and Mexico, and introduced even later to the warmer American States of Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Southern Florida. The tree grows well in hot humid climates near the seaside tropics and within rainforests. The tree can grow as high as 50 to 80 feet with a beautiful towering canopy of long featherlike leaves that provides shade. One tree can take about a year to mature, and is most productive between the ages of 10 to30 years old. Coconut trees can produce up to 50 nuts per season, and begin to lose productivity as they age, at approximately 50 years old. Many of the Asian coconut trees were planted just after World War II and are now losing their ability to produce coconuts. 4 The tree bears a fruit (about 15 to18 inches in length) in the form of a large ovoid nut with a thick husk-type shell that contains a white 'coconut meat' known as copra inside the seed. The cavity inside the shell contains coconut water or coconut milk. This milky-water is bacteria-free and sterile to drink. Coconut tree nuts should be harvested when they are between the ages of 2 to 20 months. Coconut meat is traditionally used in dessert and candy making, the milk is often used to make sauces, and the processed oil is used in the making of cosmetics and detergents. Yet, overtime, with advances in research and ongoing education for natural health resources and uses, the coconut has come a long way from its typical, \"fun-in-the-sun tropical beach,\" background. It is now seen as a valuable and arOmatHeraPy and yOur animal friendS The Health Benefits of Coconut Oil for You and Your Animal Friends by Kelly Holland Azzaro, RA, CCAP, CBFP, LMT In this article we will explore the many healing benefits of coconut oil from the Tree of Life.42Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAnatural resource that offers many health benefits for both people and their animal friends. Methods of Extraction: Cold-Pressed, Expeller- Pressed, Centrifuged, Dry or Wet Process There are different forms of coconut oil depending on the process and extraction method(s) that are used. These extraction methods will produce a creamy-buttery type consistency when solid, that is white in color with a mild coconut aroma. Depending on the extraction method, the taste will vary from very mild to a slightly toasted nutty flavor. Due to the coconut's high saturated fat content, the oil can last a very long time without becoming rancid. Read the labeling to verify if the coconut oil you are buying is cold-pressed or refined, derived by an expeller- pressed method or centrifuged method, and with or without added chemicals. The basis for making coconut oil comes from either a dry or wet process. The Dry Process involves drying of the coconut meat (removed from the shell) using one of these drying sources: fire, sunlight or kilns to produce copra. The copra is then processed by an extraction method (with either the pressing method or with the use of solvents). The Wet Process involves the processing of the raw coconut (not dried copra) and the liquid it contains, via separating the liquid contained in the raw coconut meat. Wikipedia: \"A thousand of mature coconuts weighing approximately 1,440 kilograms (3,170 lb) yield around 170 kilograms (370 lb) of copra from which around 70 liters (15 imp gal) of coconut oil can be extracted .\" 5 Cold-Pressed Method: No use of chemicals, and low heat (below 115 degrees), for first press, via an expeller press of fresh/raw coconut meat, resulting in a liquid emulsion that is then put through a centrifuge and spun to remove excess water. This method is used to produce virgin and extra-virgin coconut oil, which has a stronger coconut aroma and taste compared to the refined oil. This method helps to preserve the enzyme, mineral and vitamin content of the oil, and to avoid oxidation of fatty acids. Both expeller-pressed and centrifuged methods are used in making cold-pressed virgin coconut oil. Expeller-Pressed Method: Expeller-pressed, via mechanical extraction, is used to press liquid from the coconut meat. This method uses a mechanical expeller press to produce pressure and friction to extract the oil from raw materials. This method does not use any additional heat source beyond the natural heat process that occurs due to friction during the expeller-pressing of the solid material, which can reach from 120 to 210F in temperature. Depending on the type of material, harder nuts require higher pressure during the expeller process. The leftover material forms a hardened 'cake' used by some cultures as a food source for humans and animals. 6 Centrifuged Method: The centrifuged method does not use as much heat as the expeller-pressed method, and therefore will produce a milder tasting coconut oil. The centrifuge uses centrifugal force to separate liquids, such as water from oil, via a - The Health Benefits of Coconut Oil continued - 43Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAspinning motion, which generally requires five to six passes through different centrifuges. A vacuum is then placed over the oil product to remove any remaining traces of moisture. This process is similar to a dairy cream separator. Types of Coconut Oil: Virgin (VCO), Refined, Highly Refined (RBD), Fractionated & Hydrogenated Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO): Derived from the cold-pressed method, via either a screw-press or manual press extraction method, and without the use of chemical solvents such as hexane. VCO is considered the 'healthier' type of quality oil to use as a natural food source, and for topical application to the body. Because VCO is comprised of Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT's), mostly in the form of lauric acid, it may not contain the risks associated with other saturated fats. 7 Refined Coconut Oil: Found in two forms, via expeller-pressed or centrifuged (with the use of distilled steam or a filter-aid of diatomaceous earth verses chemicals) in the cleaning process of the final product. 8 This type of oil is usually sold in a glass jar and used for cooking stir-fry meals and dessert baking. It does not offer all of the same health benefits as the virgin coconut oil, but it does contain the Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT's). This type of oil may also be used topically and for making body care products, such as balms and salves, and as an ingredient in soap making. Highly Refined Coconut Oil: (RBD): RBD stands for \"Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized,\" and is derived from an expeller-pressed method along with the additional use of chemical solvents such as; hexane, lye and even bleach to deodorize the final product. Highly refined forms of coconut oil can be found in many cosmetics, soap and detergent, and even dry coconut flakes for consumption in baking/ desserts. Some refined coconut oils are further processed. This process creates synthetic trans-fats to produce either a partial or full hydrogenated form of coconut oil. Fractionated Coconut Oil: This is another highly refined form of coconut oil which lacks the full components of the real coconut. This oil is termed 'fractionated' because the different Medium Chain Fatty Acids (MCFA's) are removed for repurposing. The lauric acid that is removed is used for industrial and medical purposes. Fractionated coconut oil is often used in some spa and massage therapies since it does not go rancid, and it can easily be washed out of massage linens without any residue buildup. Most clients like the feel, and lack of scent, of this lighter type oil. For most clients this form of oil also does not cause any skin reactions such as itching or rashes, which can occur with other nut- type oil bases. Most coconut oil is organic and free from pesticide use. The trees are pretty hardy and do not require any treatment with pesticides or fertilizers, etc. However, depending on the tree's location: ants, spiders and the infamous 'palmetto bug,'aka the Florida woods cockroach (Eurycotis floridana), often seek shelter within the outer tree trunk husk and leaves. These insects are not able to penetrate the actual coconut meat within the nut's shell husk. Coconut oil's composition is approximately 90% saturated fat. Its 'good' fats are identified as Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT's) or Medium Chain Fatty Acids (MCFA's). The main component of these MCFA's (approximately 50%) is made up of the following; lauric acid, capric acid, capryllic - The Health Benefits of Coconut Oil continued - 44Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAacid, myristic acid and palmitic acid. The lauric acid content of coconut oil aids in its use as an antibacterial and antifungal. This chemical composition is what gives coconut oil it's following therapeutic properties: antibacterial antifungal anti-inflammatory antimicrobial antioxidant antiviral What to look for when purchasing pure coconut oil: Virgin or extra Virgin Cold-pressed Organic Non-GMO Hexane-free, Bleach-free and Deodorizer-free (just coconut oil...period) Sustainable Source* *Many suppliers work directly with the growers and small companies based on chemical-free processing of the coconut and ethical standards for farm workers and families who harvest the tree's bounty. Coconut oil is moderately priced and can be found in most health-food stores, natural pet supply stores and through online resources; though, due to its gain in popularity as a 'health food' the price is steadily increasing. Coconut oil usually does not go rancid when stored properly. Store the oil out of direct sunlight and away from heat sources. Keep the glass jar of coconut oil in a cabinet and label with date of use. When using food-grade coconut oil for internal consumption, as well as for topical skin care application, it is always best to use high quality fresh oil verses stock-piling too many jars at one time. Use a stainless steel measuring spoon to remove solidified oil from the jar. TCM Theory: When considering the use of coconut oil based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, coconut could be viewed as having both Yin and Yang energetics and is useful for Yin and Yang balance. The outer protective husk is Yang and the inner coconut meat is Yin and Yang balance, with its liquid milk being more Yin. Coconut oil's therapeutic properties offer Yang energy with its actions and uses as a healing application for bacterial, fungal, parasitic and viral infections. Its soothing feel and texture, when applied topically to the skin, allows for the Yin energy to be nourished and protected. With additional properties now being studied for use in supporting healthy function of the brain, metabolism and joint mobility (mostly due to decreasing internal inflammation) coconut also offers a balance of Yin and Yang. Doctrine of Signatures (DOS): By looking at the actual coconut itself, and applying the thought of Doctrine of Signatures, it can be easy to visualize how the outer protective husk resembles the outer skull protecting the inner white meat (DOS: brain) and liquid milk (DOS: brain fluid). One could also look at the shell's outer husk fiber (DOS: skin) as a rough-type texture, which offers a softer inner texture via its liquid and coconut meat, which is useful for the body's outer skin by helping to soften rough skin and dry hair, as well as support the healing of wounds. Consider what the many healthy uses of coconut oil may have to offer for both you and your animal companions. Coconut oil is a natural, affordable, and easy-to-use option that offers many health benefits, including the following uses: Skin & Coat Support: Skin Issues: cracked, dry, itchy and flaky skin, rashes and hot spots. Parasites & Allergies: fleas and sand flea disease9, lice, seasonal pollens. Hair/Fur Support: reduce dander and dryness, greasy and stinky skin/coat, reduce hair damage and protein loss.10 - The Health Benefits of Coconut Oil continued -45Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHA Antifungal Promote infections: bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic. Apply topically to help promote healing of: cuts/scrapes, dry and hot spots, cracked and dry skin, pimples, minor wound care and fungal issues. Digestion & Immune Support: Digestion: improve and support overall digestive system. Gum and mouth health. 11 Decrease internal inflammation. Support immune health. Aid in the elimination of hairballs. Giardia parasite infection.12 Possible uses: (no published research data to date): arthritis, thyroid and metabolism balance, and for use with parasites. Additional research: there is individual research and reports, but no actual published research studies at the time of this article, on the use of coconut oil for: Alzheimer's Disease Anxiety Depression At the time of this article, I had recently attended a continuing education class, \"Food for Thought: How Nutrients Affect Mental Health and the Brain,\" presented by Dr. Michael Lara, MD (Diplomat, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology). The class included information on internal inflammation and how this affects the body, brain, and overall physical and mental health. Among the many different nutrients, supplements and dietary data outlined, a portion of the class was devoted to the Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCT's) available in coconut oil, its use as treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and as a medical food product in the treatment of Alzheimer's. 13 Possible use of coconut oil for MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Currently there is no published research on actual MRSA case studies that include the use of coconut oil for the super bug know as MRSA, but as a professional clinical aromatherapist, I would consider using coconut oil for MRSA skin infections/sores. Due to its antibacterial properties and skin care uses, coconut oil may offer some benefit for MRSA infections in people and pets. Animals can also become infected with MRSA. Animals that work as service companions in a clinical setting (hospital, hospice and nursing homes), live with a human who is infected with MRSA, or live with a health care professional who works with patients infected with MRSA, are at a higher risk of becoming infected with MRSA themselves. They are also at a higher risk of possibly transmitting the MRSA (via colonization in the nasal cavity/mucus membranes) to patients or to their caregiver. 14 Coconut oil could be a useful carrier base, as plain oil, or as an ingredient in a balm or salve combined with essential oils for topical application to MRSA skin sores. Since coconut oil has a creamy thicker texture it may also prove beneficial as a protective barrier when applied to sores that may be easily irritated and inflamed. Coconut is truly a versatile and multi-faceted gift. It offers an affordable and natural option for self care for people and their animal friends. Coconut Oil Use for Pets and People: Food grade pure coconut oil can be added to food sources. For your pet, add the coconut oil to their meal(s), divide the recommended dosage in half and feed twice a day. When first introducing coconut oil to your pet's diet, start off with half of the suggested amount once per day, and observe to see if there is any progress or any negative reaction (such as loose stool, diarrhea or vomiting). Though it is not common to see a negative reaction from the use of coconut oil, it is always best to use common-sense caution when introducing any new food item into the diet. If the individual has a known allergy to coconut, then avoid use. Coconut oil is considered a non-toxic food source for use with humans, cats and dogs. Consult with your health care practitioner and your pet's veterinarian before starting any new diet or supplement if you, or your pet, have any - The Health Benefits of Coconut Oil continued -46Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAhealth issues/conditions, are taking medications, are prone to food allergies, or have any dietary restrictions due to high cholesterol or fatty liver disease. Common-sense guideline for dosage if the amount per product labeling: One teaspoon for each ten pounds of body weight. Example: a ten pound dog should receive one teaspoon total of coconut oil per day. Start off with \u00bc of the suggested amount for one week. Topical applications: use a small amount, approximately \u00bc teaspoon, for localized spot areas as needed. For our best friend Mia, a 70 pound Pit Bull, I give her one Tablespoon of coconut oil (food-grade, organic, cold pressed) twice a day in her feed. She no longer sheds too much hair, and prior to using coconut oil she would shed a lot of hair for a pit bull breed. She also tends toward easy weight gain, even with smaller amounts of food, and with regular exercise (a five mile walk and extra play time everyday). With the use of the coconut oil we have noticed her weight has balanced out and her appetite is not as intense (we're talking about an 'obsessed with food' pup). I use coconut oil topically for any rashes and itching that Mia has experienced, due to grass and airborne pollens during the spring and summer. I use coconut oil for self-care as a daily topical application after my morning shower and for dry skin brushing. I also use it as an ingredient in making a natural deodorant cream, and for brushing my teeth and gums (Mia's teeth too!). For use when brushing teeth and gums, apply a small amount of coconut oil to a toothbrush and gently massage into gums, and brush onto teeth. The temperature inside the mouth will quickly help to melt the solid coconut oil for easy application. You can do the same for your canine friends too. Coconut oil is also part of our morning breakfast, mixing one Tablespoon into our warm oatmeal, or spread onto a rice cake...very yummy!Aromatherapy Blend with Coconut for People and Pets: Coconut Skin Balm (for people and pets) Yield for approximately a four ounce sized jar. \u00bc cup Coconut Oil (Cocos nucifera ) cup Olive Oil (Olea europaea ) organic, virgin. 2 to 4 teaspoons of Beeswax (non-vegan) or for a vegan option try: Candelilia wax ( Euphorbia antisyphillitica ).

Dr. Birkmayer will be one of the speakers at the NAHA World of Aromatherapy VII Conference at Bastyr University, Seattle, WA September 12 - 14, 2014. I would personally like to thank Dr. Birkmayer for taking the time to answer the questions put to him in this interview, and hope that you, the reader, can draw both knowledge and inspiration from Dr. Birkmayer's answers! 1. Who inspired you to start your journey with essential oils?The first time I encountered essential oils was when I was a young boy. My grandfather in Austria shared with me a mixture of essential oils called, \"Japanese Healing Plants Oil,\" that he had obtained in Switzerland. I was intrigued with the aromas and how he used it, and other essential oils, for his own well being. While in medical school, where nothing was taught about essential oils, I explored essential oils more and found they helped me study better. I was impressed with their healing powers, especially when compared to allopathic medicine. But, of course, medical training is a powerful indoctrination and I didn't feel comfortable incorporating essential oils into my psychiatric practice until I met Connie and Digby Henry. They mentored and encouraged me to incorporate the use of essential oils.2. Who have been the most influential people in your life with regard to this journey?There have been several influential people who have guided me on this journey. First and foremost, Connie Henry and her late husband, Digby Henry, have gently guided and encouraged me as I evolved from an allopathically trained psychiatrist to a holistic psychiatrist - or as Digby put it, \"He jumped out of the allopathic window.\" I have taken several aromatherapy certification classes with them, and I am currently being intensely mentored by Connie Henry. The Henrys have taught me deep love and respect for the wisdom and intelligence of healing plants. I have also been blessed to be taught by John Steele about the spiritual and magical uses of essential oils, going all the way back to ancient Egypt, and also about the \"terroir\" of small batch essential oils compared to mass produced oils. I was honored to host a seminar by John Steele in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 2012. Another great teacher has been Robert Tisserand, who has encyclopedically gathered research on essential oils, and who I've been grateful to take a class with. The information, with regard to the emotional and psychological uses of essential oils, has been hard to find in one place, but Sylla Sheppard-Hanger's book, \"The Aromatic Mind,\" has been an invaluable starting point. With regard naHa cOmmunity Interview with an Aromatherapist: Florian Birkmayer, M.D. by Sharon Fa lsetto Interview with an Aromatherapist is a new feature of the NAHA Journal. In each issue, Sharon will introduce you to a different aromatherapist, herbalist or professional in the field in order to give you an insight into the working lives of others in the field of holistic health. 52Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHAto teaching aromatherapy, Cynthia Brownley and Joy Mussacchio of Stillpoint Aromatics are the best teachers I have met. Last but not least, I am most grateful to my patients for their willingness to indulge me when I start to discuss essential oils, and for allowing me to witness their healing journeys. 3. How do you use essential oils in combination with the other therapies and services which you offer?My basic approach to holistic psychiatry is to, \"meet the client where they are at,\"' and remind them of their self-healing abilities. For some, that means working with psychiatric medications, since that is what they are willing to trust; but then clients may express curiosity about essential oils - and that can be an opening into the use of essential oils. Some clients want to stop taking psychiatric medications and I assist them with that, often using essential oils for the withdrawal symptoms, as well as to address the underlying symptoms. I use essential oils for both 'medication management' and also for psychotherapy; especially for the latter. Essential oils can calm people when they are triggered by traumatic memories or get anxious during the sessions. Or, essential oils can remind them of calm or soothing memories, and create a calmer state overall. Essential oils allow people to access their spirit and inner wisdom. I also do equine assisted therapy, mostly for people with trauma and addiction issues, and aromatherapy can also be very helpful with these matters. The combination of horses and essential oils thrills me because it combines two of my greatest passions. 4. Do you find that people are open to trying an unconventional therapy (i.e. aromatherapy) in conjunction with, or instead of, more conventional medicinal methods? How do you combine the two modalities? I think the biggest barrier was my own shyness about sharing my passion with my clients because, I'm \"supposed\" to be, or act, a certain way as a psychiatrist (I think this is a big barrier for many allopathically trained providers). I think that when I approach it from a perspective of meeting the client where they are, and presenting it as another tool for self-healing, most people are very open to trying essential oils. For most people, as soon as we've smelled a few essential oils together, their faces light up and they get really excited about coming up with a custom blend. It's particularly rewarding when, at the next appointment, they tell me how they've used it and how it's helped them in their everyday life. 5. Tell us a little about your Institute and some of the people you help through it. Do you have a particular passion for any group of people?I founded the Birkmayer Institute in 2009 after being frustrated with the way psychiatry was being practiced in the big institutions around me (and around the country), which turns people into, \"professional patients,\" and really feed a patient's self-stigmatization i.e., \"there's something wrong with me that I can't fix,\" and \"I need to be on meds on for the rest of my life.\" My intention was, and continues to be, patient-centered. To remind my clients of their own self-healing abilities and to witness their healing journeys. My main focus has been on people struggling with substance abuse, which is the archetypal illness of modern life, as well as people with trauma-related illnesses, but I see a wide range of other patients too. I also see a lot of wounded healers, e.g. physicians, therapists, body workers, and healers of all types, because when I am able to help them, they are able to help many more people (their clients). We are all wounded healers. My approach combines judicious medication management (because they help some people), a Jungian approach to honor everyone's individuation process, equine assisted therapy and aromatherapy. 6. Do you have a favorite essential oil? What are your recommended uses for this essential oil?My favorite essential oil changes with time. In the recent past my favorites have been palo santo (Bursera graveolens ) and melissa ( Melissa officinalis ), which are great for getting people out of traumatic dissociative states, as well as to protect themselves from intense psychic energies, and for clearing spaces of negative energies (e.g. my office). Recently, I've had to deal with a lot of grief in my own life, and in my patients' lives. For this, frankincense (Boswellia sp.) is my new best friend. It is extremely powerful for grief and shock. I've also used frankincense to treat shock in a horse that had fainted from being stuck upside down. - Interview with Aromatherapist: Florian Birkmayer, M.D. continued -53Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2014.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2014 NAHA 7. Why is it important for people to know and understand the source of their essential oils? Unfortunately, most people don't understand that essential oils should have \"terroir,\" which are unique characteristics due to the specific growing conditions of a particular place. Most people wouldn't drink wine from cartons, but then they buy mass-produced oils that have lost all terroir, or worse still, have been adulterated. Essential oils are the living spirit molecules of the plants that gave themselves for our healing. This gets lost with mass produced oils. There is much misinformation out there, such as the false idea of, \"therapeutic grade,\" which is just a marketing ploy. Talk to the seller, or even better the producer of the oils, and learn how they made them. Don't be afraid to ask for certificates of analysis. You can learn a lot about a seller of oils by the \"creative\" answers they give to avoid providing a certificate. 8. Do you have any advice for those considering a career in aromatherapy?Let the whole plant be your teacher. Many people who talk about essential oils forget the plants the essential oils came from. Get information from as many different people and sources as possible, and don't let anyone tell you their way is the only way. Remember the old story of the blind men and the elephant - each of us glimpses only a small part of the whole picture.- Interview with Aromatherapist: Florian Birkmayer, M.D. continued - Birkmayer, M.D. Florian Birkmayer, M.D., founded the Birkmayer Institute in 2009 to offer holistic person-centered psychiatry and addiction medicine, as well as to offer seminars and workshops on a wide range of holistic topics to facilitate self-transformation and continued self-development. This approach has been inspired by C.G. Jung's ideas on Individuation, which is the journey of the limited ego to the Higher Self. Dr. Birkmayer's emphasis in holistic psychiatry is on Equine-assisted therapy, person-centered psychotherapy and holistic medication management, including aromatherapy. He views himself as a bridge-builder between different medical worlds, and he works closely and respectfully with a wide range of healers. A native of Austria, Dr. Birkmayer received his B.A. degree From Princeton University and his M.D. from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. He completed his psychiatry residency at the University of New Mexico.
