Academic Calendar General Information6 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Financial Aid Approximately 70 percent of students attending the University of Washington Tacoma receive federal, state or institutional financial aid to help them pay for their education. There are four basic types of aid: Grants: Federal, state and institutional grants do not require repayment. Loans: Must be repaid, generally beginning six to nine months after a student graduates or leaves school. Loans require repayment with interest (interest rate and when interest accrual begins varies depending on the program). Work-Study: Students can be employed either on or off campus, with the primary focus being that students enhance their field of study by working part-time in a career-related position. Scholarships: Awards are based on financial need, academic achievement and in some cases the quality of the personal essay that is submitted as part of the scholarship application process. What is Financial Need? For most aid programs, financial need is defined as the difference between what it costs to attend school and what the student can afford to pay. The amount a student should be able to pay is determined by a standard, federally mandated need-analysis method. The method establishes whether a student is financially independent (unmarried students under the age of 24 years may be considered dependent and in that case must provide parent information) or financially dependent on his or her parents and takes into account past earnings and benefits, a percentage of net assets and all other sources of support. There is no income standard or other simple method of determining whether a student will qualify for need-based financial aid. Any student who thinks he or she needs help should apply.If a student has additional medical, transportation, child-care, or other unusual expenses not covered by the living allowance, the student may, by submitting a revision request with documentation (physician's statement, child-care or baby-sitter bills, etc.), ask the Office of Student Financial Aid to consider the additional costs in his or her budget. Eligibility for Financial Aid To qualify for federal financial aid, a student must: Be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident or other eligible noncitizen Be admitted to the university in an approved program and meet minimum enrollment requirements (most distance learning, correspondence and nonmatriculated students are not eligible for financial aid) Not be in default on a previous student loan or owe a repayment on a grant or loan for which the student was not eligible Be registered with the Selective Service (if required) Maintain satisfactory academic progress based on federal, state and institutional requirements. Provide financial information (including parents' information, where required) Be free of any federal or state drug- related convictions while you were receiving federal student aid Eligible students are considered for funding based on three things: need, class level and state residency status. Need determines priority for those programs within the class level. Students with the fewest resources are given first priority for all aid funds.Application and Important Dates The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the basic application for most types of financial aid. Students must complete and submit their FAFSA information directly to the federal processor online. Students must apply for a personal identification number (PIN) in order to complete the online FAFSA. PINs can be obtained by registering through www.pin.ed.gov. To access FAFSA on the Web, go to www.fafsa.ed.gov. Applications are also available from the Office of Student Financial Aid. Students should complete their FAFSA for the upcoming year (defined as summer through spring quarters) beginning January 1. A student who wishes to apply for financial aid to support study during summer quarter must submit a separate application. *Students who are not eligible to complete the FAFSA due to their immigration status may still be eligible to apply for the Washington State Need Grant by completing the Washington Application for State Financial Aid (WASFA). Priority dates For priority consideration, the FAFSA must be received by the federal application processor by February 28 of each year. Students who submit their FAFSAs after the priority date, fifth-year students and part-time students may be eligible to borrow funds through the Federal Stafford Loan or the Federal PLUS Loan Programs. Undergraduates may qualify for a Federal Pell Grant. Because the priority date falls before the income tax deadline, students and parents can use estimated income figures if their tax information is not prepared. Tax and asset documents may be requested at a later date to verify information provided on the initial application. Students who apply for financial aid should remember to keep copies of financial documents used in completing the FAFSA, continuously monitor their UW email Financial Aid7 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma account for official correspondence from the Office of Student Financial Aid, and notify the Office of the Registrar of any change in address. Consortium Agreements UW Tacoma students will occasionally need to enroll at a community college to complete admission deficiencies. The credits at the community college may be counted toward the student's total quarter enrollment credits using a financial aid consortium agreement. Both UW Tacoma and the community college must approve consortium agreements. If approved, consortium agreements enable the student to receive financial aid based on the total credits being taken at both institutions. Agreements must be submitted to the Office of Student Financial Aid no later than three weeks prior to the start of the quarter. Scholarships Consideration for need-based scholarships is given based on information received on the FAFSA (on-time applicants only). Scholarship lists are available through the Office of Student Financial Aid and at websites listed later in this section.UW Tacoma offers several scholarships available to fund study only at UW Tacoma. For information on scholarship opportunities, contact the Office of Student Financial Aid at 253-692-4374 or check online at tacoma. uw.edu/finaid.

This information includes data for use in claiming educational tax credits and deductions that you have paid for tuition and fees. In addition, the UW provides information to help you determine if your scholarships, fellowships, grants or tuition reductions are taxable. The UW cannot provide individual tax advice. If you have questions, you should consult your tax advisor about your specific circumstances. Scholarships, fellowships, grants and tuition reductions are not considered taxable income if they are used solely for qualified educational expenses. Any amount used for personal or non-qualified expenses are subject to tax. For more details refer to the IRS Publication 970: Scholarships and Fellowships. Washington State's Guaranteed Education Tuition (GET) program is a 529-qualified tuition program according to IRS regulations. This program allows individuals to prepay for students' college educational expenses. Funds from the GET program are used to reduce qualified educational expenses. The amounts used to pay these expenses are not taxable or reported to the IRS on the 1098T forms that the UW provides students for filing their tax returns. Go to f2.washington.edu/fm/sfs/tax to find links to the following topics: Education tax credits and tax deductions (IRS Form 1098T) Print your 1098T information Nonresident alien student tax (IRS Form 1042S) Employees' tuition exemption tax withholding Canadian tax information For questions, please email taxquest@u.washington.edu or call 206-221-2609 for assistance. Financial Aid8 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Tuition and Fees The amount charged for resident undergraduate tuition and fees is set by the state of Washington and is indexed to the cost of instruction. Tuition and fees for non-residents and graduate students are set by the University of Washington Board of Regents. Tuition charges are based on the student's classification (undergraduate or graduate) rather than on course level. See chart on next page for tuition rates. Rates are subject to change without notice. Tuition and Fee Payment Students incur an obligation to pay tuition and fees in U.S. dollars when they register. Students receive email notification once tuition charges are available on MyUW . No matter which payment option the student chooses, payment in full of tuition is due by 5 p.m. on the third Friday of the quarter. Nonpayment of tuition and fees by the due date results in a charge of $50 for balances of $50 to $250 and $120 for balances in excess of $250. Students with an overdue balance will not be allowed to register for the next quarter. Options for Tuition Payment Web check Tuition and related charges may be paid online by web check from a checking or savings account. This service is accessible from the Tuition Charge Statement on MyUW . A bank routing number, account number and UW student ID number are required to complete the transaction. Payments post immediately and there is no fee for this service. Check or money order (in-person) Payment may be made by personal check or money order to the UW Tacoma Cashier or mailed to the UW Tacoma Cashier's Office, Campus Box 358433, 1900 Commerce Street, Tacoma, W A 98402. Payment may also be placed in the drop box located next to the Cashier's Office. Checks should be payable to \"UW Tacoma\" and include the student's ID number in the memo field.Credit card Credit card payments may be made online only through MyUW . Sign in at MyUW and select the \"Credit Card Payment\" option. There is a convenience charge assessed when using this option; credit cards cannot be used to pay tuition in person at the Cashier's Office. Tuition installment plan The tuition payment plan allows students to pay their quarterly tuition in three installments. There is a $10 service fee for participating that is due with the first payment. Students must enroll for this option each quarter with the UW Tacoma Cashier during the first week of the quarter. One third of the tuition plus the $10 service charge is due by the first Friday of the quarter. The remaining balance of tuition is due in two equal payments on the third and fifth Fridays of the quarter. To qualify for the installment plan all payments must be made on time. The second and third payments are subject to late fees as shown on page 12. Payments must be made by check or money order to the UW Tacoma Cashier in person on through the drop box outside the Cashier's Office. Specifying Payments When the payment received is not in conformance with the tuition and fee billing, specific instructions on how the payment is to be applied must accompany the payment. In the absence of instructions, the university makes a reasoned interpretation of the student's intent and accounts for the funds accordingly. The student number must be specified on all payments. Tuition Forfeiture When students drop or withdraw from courses after the first week of the quarter and the drop results in lower tuition, the university reserves the right to collect one-half the tuition through the 30th calendar day of the quarter for the dropped course or courses and full tuition after the 30th calendar day of the quarter. In some circumstances students may petition the registrar to have the tuition forfeiture waived. Details are available in the Office of the Registrar (see Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees, this page). Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees If a student feels that he or she has been charged a tuition forfeiture or registration fee in error or wishes to contest a forfeiture or fee, he or she may complete a request to waive tuition forfeiture or registration fees form. Failure to check your tuition balance on MyUW does not nullify a student's responsibility for payment by the tuition due date and is not an acceptable justification for a waiver. Please refer to the form for appropriate guidelines for granting these requests. Significant documentation is required. Tuition and Fee Refund When a fee payment is made by check, a waiting period is required before a refund can be authorized. An application for refund may be refused unless it is made during the quarter in which the fees apply. A student who withdraws for disciplinary reasons forfeits all rights to refund or cancellation of any portion of his or her fees. Other Fees Explanation of fees where necessary follows. All fees are subject to change without notice. Application Fees There is no reduction in fees for auditors.

Duplicate diploma with paper cover ............................................. $ 10 Replacement of Student ID Card ........ $ 20 Transcript (Official) ............................... $ 9 Special Course and Laboratory Fees Some courses have additional expenses associated with them and, in such cases, the university may charge course fees in amounts that approximate the added instructional or laboratory costs. Technology Fee This fee is to recover, in whole or in part, the costs of providing and maintaining services to students that include, but are not limited to, the following: access to the Internet, email, computer and multimedia workstations and laboratories, computer software and dial-up telephone services. Part-time students (those paying less than full-time tuition) are charged on a prorated basis. The fee is included on the quarterly tuition billing.University Y Student Center Fee Effective Winter 2015, this fee will be assessed to fund the newly built University Y Student Center. All students who are enrolled for credit and charged tuition will be assessed this quarterly fee and will have access to the University Y Student Center as well as other YMCA facilities in Pierce and Kitsap counties. This fee, voted on and approved by students, is included on the quarterly tuition billing. Financial Obligations The Office of Student Fiscal Services is authorized to place an administrative hold on the records of any student who fails to pay amounts due to the university. Until this hold is cleared, the university does not release the student's record or any information based on the record, does not prepare transcripts or certified statements, and denies registration as well as graduation from the university. Tuition and fees (including parking and library fines) not paid by the end of the academic quarter are subject to an interest charge of 1 percent per month, or fraction thereof (12 percent APR), beginning the month following the end of the quarter. An administrative hold also may occur when a student has not complied with university rules, followed university procedures or satisfied student obligations. The hold may be placed on the student's record by the authorized university office responsible for enforcement of the rule, procedure or obligation involved. The student is not permitted to register for any subsequent quarter or to obtain a transcript of his or her record or a certified statement except on the written release of the office that placed the hold. Tuition Exemption Eligible university and state of Washington employees may enroll for and receive a tuition exemption for up to six credits each quarter, provided they enroll on a space-available basis. Eligible students are allowed to enroll for more than six credits and will be charged tuition accordingly for the additional credits. All students participating in the tuition-exemption program will be assessed a quarterly $30 registration fee and must pay other applicable fees, including the technology fee. A participating student may not register for any course, including the credits beyond six that the student will be paying for, prior to the student's assigned space-available registration day, or the exemption will be canceled. Matriculated students desiring a higher registration priority to facilitate course enrollment may choose to cancel their exemption for the quarter, register early and pay regular tuition rates. Space availability applies to degree programs as well as courses, and fully enrolled programs may not have space to accommodate students using the tuition exemption. Eligible students must hold one of the following statuses on the day the exemption form is approved, and must be in that status on the first day of the quarter for which the exemption was granted. To be eligible a student must be: A University of Washington employee: permanent classified or contract classified staff who are employed half-time or more with six months or more of continuous service prior to the first day of the quarter and faculty/ professional staff employed half-time or more on the first day of class. A non-University of Washington permanent classified or contract State of Washington employee employed half- time or more. A permanent classified or exempt paraprofessional employee of a technical college employed half-time or more. A non-academic employee or member of the faculty or instructional staff employed half-time or more at a state institution of higher education other than the University of Washington. K-12 instructors qualified to teach or seeking valid endorsement and assignment in a state-identified shortage area. A note of caution: A UW employee pursuing a graduate program or graduate-level course work claims the amount of the quarterly exemption as income on the federal income tax return unless his or her supervisor has certified that the program or course work is job related. If it is determined that the course is not job related, the value of the exemption will be considered income and subject to withholding. Qualifying Courses Courses that involve intensive one-on-one interaction between faculty member and student (such as independent study, research and some fieldwork courses) do not qualify under the definition of \"space available. \" Tuition-exempt students may be required to pay full tuition to enroll in these courses. See the quarterly Registration Guide for details. All 600- and 700-level courses are excluded from the tuition exemption program. Tuition and Fees11 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Admission Status Individuals who wish to participate in the tuition exemption program must apply for admission to the University of Washington Tacoma. Applicants are subject to the same priority application dates as other new students. Individuals wishing to apply as matriculated students or as graduate nonmatriculated students to a UW Tacoma academic program, should contact the specific program office for details regarding the application process and space availability in the program. New nonmatriculated students should submit applications online for admission to the Office of Admissions. Because tuition exempt paperwork must be received no later than two weeks prior to the start of the quarter, new applicants are encouraged to submit their tuition exemption paperwork regardless of their pending application status. Program participants who are former UW Tacoma students returning in the same classification or as nonmatriculated students should submit their application online at tacoma.uw.edu/apply. Tuition and FeesRegistration and fees The Office of the Registrar accepts tuition exempt paperwork for the next quarter beginning the Monday after the 10th day of the current quarter. Paperwork must be submitted each quarter and must be received no later than two weeks prior to the first day of the quarter in which attendance is planned. UW Tacoma strictly adheres to this deadline. Paperwork must be complete, including required signatures, or it will be returned. Paperwork that has been returned must be completed by the same deadline noted above. Actual registration for courses begins through MyUW on or after the appropriate eligibility dates. Registration dates are posted on the Registration Guide website at tacoma. uw.edu/register. Under the tuition exemption program, tuition-exempt students must pay the quarterly technology fee. They will be billed this fee, and any other applicable fees, plus the $30 tuition exemption registration fee once they have registered for a course. UW faculty/staff ID cards may be used for library services. Participating state of Washington employees may obtain student ID cards for library services from the Office of the Registrar. More information and the quarterly required tuition exemption form are available on our website or in the Office of the Registrar.12 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Registration Registration Eligibility Continuing University of Washington Tacoma students who remain in good scholastic standing are guaranteed the opportunity to register each quarter at UW Tacoma as long as they maintain continuous enrollment (excluding summer quarter) or satisfy the guidelines of the quarter-off policy. Continuation must be in the same classification (undergraduate, post-baccalaureate or graduate) and at the same campus. After a student has earned a baccalaureate degree, he or she must apply for readmission as a post-baccalaureate, nonmatriculated or graduate student before being allowed to register. Newly admitted students and students readmitted to the same or a new classification (undergraduate, post-baccalaureate or graduate) or admitted to a different university campus are eligible to register during a specified time period. See Registration Periods on page 13. Exceptions to the guarantee of registration eligibility include students under disciplinary action, students with a financial hold on their records and students failing to meet conditions of admission or not meeting program or university satisfactory progress policies. Additionally, continuing students who withdraw during the first week of two consecutive quarters (summer quarter not included) will not be eligible to register as continuing students for the third quarter and must reapply as former students returning to the university. If an undergraduate does not enroll for two or more quarters (not including summer quarter), he or she must reapply as a returning student using the online application process through the Office of Admissions. Quarter-Off Policy Undergraduate students who have completed a quarter at the University of Washington Tacoma, may take the following quarter off and remain eligible to register during Registration Period I for the subsequent quarter without reapplying as a returning student. Any quarter from which a student has completely withdrawn does not constitute a completed quarter. Summer quarter enrollment is not required to maintain continuous registration eligibility. The quarter-off policy is not available for graduate students; please see Graduate Student On-Leave Status. Graduating Senior Priority Graduating seniors or post-baccalaureate students who have submitted a graduation application may register on the first day of Period I for their final two quarters. Students who postpone their graduation may save their priority quarters by not registering before their regular senior or post-baccalaureate priority day. When students have used their graduating senior priority for two quarters, their registration priority reverts to the regular senior or post-baccalaureate schedule. Students may not register for classes in any quarter beyond the quarter for which they have applied to graduate (except summer quarter). Veterans Registration Priority Continuing students with veteran status may register on the first day of Period I registration. Students who are not currently receiving veterans benefits will need to provide proof of veteran status to the Office of Veteran and Military Services. Registering at Other UW Campuses Undergraduate students who have completed at least 15 credits and freshmen who have completed at least 25 credits at the Tacoma campus are eligible to register for up to five credits per quarter at one of the other UW campuses during Registration Period II. Eligible students may register cross-campus using MyUW . Undergraduate students are limited to a total of 45 credits through cross- campus registration. For more information on cross-campus registration, please go online to: www. washington.edu/uaa/advising/registration/ ccregi.phpDropping a Course Students dropping a course during the first two weeks of a quarter shall have no entry on their permanent academic transcript unless they do a complete withdrawal from the university. If a student drops all his or her courses, a complete withdrawal date is recorded on the transcript. A course drop made during the third through the seventh week of the quarter will be recorded on an undergraduate student's transcript with a W grade and a number designating the week of the quarter in which the course was dropped. Students may drop only one course each academic year (autumn through summer quarters) from the third through the seventh week of the quarter. This is referred to as the \"annual drop\" To drop a course officially, a student must complete the transaction electronically using MyUW or submit a drop card in the Office of the Registrar. A student who drops a course unofficially (only through the instructor or advisor, for example) is given a grade of 0.0. Students receiving or applying for financial aid should check with the financial aid counselor or veterans benefits advisor before dropping a class because it may affect financial aid eligibility. Students should be aware that dropping a course may affect their student account. Please see the Tuition and Fees section of this catalog. During summer quarter, the timeline for dropping a course is abbreviated due to the shortened session. Please consult the Important Dates page on the Registration website for specific dates at tacoma.uw.edu/ register . Hardship Withdrawal Policy Students may petition the UW Tacoma registrar in writing for a hardship withdrawal if they are unable to complete a course due to physical or mental debilitation or unusual or extenuating circumstances beyond their control that may have arisen and prevented them from dropping the course by the seventh week. Petitions must be filed promptly after the occurrence of the event that gave rise to the need for dropping, preferably prior to the Registration13 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma end of the quarter. Only in rare circumstances will petitions be accepted after the close of the quarter in which the withdrawal is being petitioned. Students who have completed the requirements for the course are generally not eligible for a hardship withdrawal. The petition for hardship withdrawal should be completed by the student and submitted to the UW Tacoma registrar. Significant documentation is required for hardship withdrawal consideration. Supporting documentation as detailed on the petition form must accompany the petition. The registrar reserves the right to verify the authenticity and details of the documentation. Petitions will not be accepted for coursework that is more than two years old. Complete Withdrawal from the University for a Registered Quarter (dropping all courses for the quarter) It is the student's responsibility to withdraw from all courses if he or she is unable to attend. Students may withdraw on MyUW through the unrestricted drop period. Beginning with the third week of the quarter, official withdrawals must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar. An official withdrawal is effective the date of the last drop made electronically, the date it is received in the Office of the Registrar, or if submitted by mail, the date of the postmark. Tuition owed will be based on the date the complete withdrawal is received. Withdrawals are NOT accepted after the last day of instruction for the quarter. The tuition forfeiture schedule for complete withdrawal from the university is as follows: Students who withdraw on or before the seventh calendar day of the quarter do not pay tuition. Students who withdraw after the seventh calendar day through the 30th calendar day continue to owe one half of their tuition. Students who withdraw after the 30th calendar day continue to owe full tuition. The following principles apply to complete withdrawal from the university: Courses dropped as part of a complete withdrawal from the university during the first two weeks of a quarter are not recorded on the student's UW transcript; however, the date of the complete withdrawal is recorded. A recipient of veterans benefits should immediately notify the Office of Veteran and Military Services of withdrawal. A student with a scholarship or loan awarded through the university should notify the Office of Student Financial Aid of withdrawal. Withdrawal for Military Service Students who are called to active military duty may withdraw through the end of the seventh week of instruction and receive a full refund but no academic credit. A copy of the student's military orders is required. If a student withdraws after that date, the student may receive either a full refund or academic credit and no refund. Students who withdraw for military reasons will be allowed to return to the university without having to pay another application fee. Documentation in the form of military orders will be required. Please consult with the Office of the Registrar for complete details.

See the important dates page on the registration website for specific dates each summer. Registration15 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Academic and University Policies Academic Policies UW Tacoma uses a numerical grading system. Instructors may report grades from 4.0 to 0.7 in 0.1 increments and the grade 0.0. The number 0.0 is assigned for failing work or unofficial withdrawal. Grades in the range 0.6 to 0.1 may not be assigned. Grades reported in this range are converted by the registrar to 0.0. Numerical grades may be considered equivalent to letter grades as shown in the chart at right. Some instructors use their own grade scale which they include in their course syllabus. The following letter grades may also be used: CR: Credit awarded in a course offered on a credit/no-credit basis only or in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 and 800. The minimum performance level required for a CR grade is determined, and the grade is awarded directly by the instructor. CR is not computed in GPA calculations. NC: Credit not awarded in a course offered on a credit/no-credit basis only or in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 and 800. The grade is awarded directly by the instructor and is not included in GPA calculations. S: Satisfactory grade for courses taken on a satisfactory/not-satisfactory basis. An S grade is automatically converted from a numerical grade of 2.0 or above for undergraduate classes and 2.7 or above for graduate classes. The grade S may not be assigned directly by the instructor, but is a grade conversion by the Office of the Registrar. Undergraduate students may elect this option only for free electives and cannot be used to satisfy a university, college or department course requirement. With the approval of their program advisor, graduate students may elect to be graded S/NS in any numerically graded course for which they are eligible. Depending on the program, up to 25 credits of S/NS grades may be applied to an undergraduate degree. S is not computed in GPA calculations. There is no limit on the number of S credits that can be applied to a graduate degree. Undergraduate Graduate Letter Grade Point Letter Grade Point Grade Equivalent Grade Equivalent A 3.9 - 4.0 A 3.9 - 4.0 A- 3.5 - 3.8 A- 3.5 - 3.8 B+ 3.2 - 3.4 B+ 3.1 - 3.4 B 2.9 - 3.1 B 2.9 - 3.0 B- 2.5 - 2.8 B- 2.5 - 2.8 A minimum of 2.7 is C+ 2.2 - 2.4 required in each course C 1.9 - 2.1 that is counted toward C- 1.5 - 1.8 a graduate degree.

No credit earned. NS: Not Satisfactory grade for courses taken on a satisfactory/not-satisfactory basis. A grade less than 2.0 for undergraduate classes and 2.7 for graduate classes is converted to NS. NS is not included in GPA calculations. No credit is awarded for courses in which an NS grade is received. I: Incomplete given at the discretion of the faculty only when a student has been in attendance and has done satisfactory work until within two weeks of the end of the quarter and has furnished proof satisfactory to the instructor that the work cannot be completed because of illness or other circumstances beyond the student's control. To obtain credit for the course, an undergraduate student must convert an Incomplete into a passing grade no later than the last day of the next quarter. The student should never re-register for the course as a means of removing the Incomplete. For undergraduate students, an Incomplete grade not made up by the end of the next quarter is converted to a grade of 0.0. An instructor can assign an Incomplete grade that a grade other than 0.0 should be recorded if the incomplete work is not completed. The Incomplete is not removed from the permanent record and appears on the transcript with the completed grade. An instructor may approve an extension of the Incomplete removal deadline by contacting the Office of the Registrar no later than the last day of the quarter following the quarter in which the Incomplete grade was assigned. Extensions, which may be granted for up to three additional quarters, must be received before the Incomplete has been converted into a failing grade. In no case can an Incomplete received by an undergraduate be converted to a passing grade after the lapse of one year. For graduate students, an Incomplete grade does not automatically convert to 0.0 but remains a permanent part of the student's record. To obtain credit for the course, a student must successfully complete the work and the instructor must submit a grade. In no case can an Incomplete received by a graduate student be converted to a passing grade after a lapse of two years or more. W: Official Withdrawal or drop from a course from the third through the seventh week of the quarter for undergraduates. A number designating the week of the quarter Letter Grade Equivalents Academic and University Policies16 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma is recorded with the \"W\" when a course is dropped. It is not computed in GPA calculations. HW: Hardship Withdrawal grade assigned when a student is allowed to withdraw from a course after the 14th calendar day of the quarter (see Hardship Withdrawal Policy on page 12). It is not computed in GPA calculations. N: Indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress and a final grade will be given at the end of the quarter the work is completed. Used only for hyphenated courses (courses not completed in one quarter) and courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 or 800. Grade point average (GP A) The cumulative GPA includes credits granted for courses taken in residence at all campuses of the University of Washington and those with a \"DL \" (Distance Learning) suffix taken through UW Educational Outreach (UWEO). The UW transcript also reflects grades for other UWEO courses that are not residence credit and grades for credit by examination. These latter grades do not affect the student's UW cumulative GPA. Computation of GPA The grade point average for graduation is computed by dividing the total cumulative grade points by the total credits attempted for courses taken in residence at the university. Grade points are calculated by multiplying the number of credits by the numeric value of the grade for each course. The sum of the grade points is then divided by the total credits attempted. Courses elected on an S/ NS basis are counted as follows: Satisfactory grades are printed on the permanent record as an S and do not count in the quarterly or cumulative grade point average, but they do count as credits earned toward graduation. Not-satisfactory grades (NS) do not count in the quarterly and cumulative grade point averages and do not count as credits earned toward graduation. Example 1: Grade Course Credits Grade Points TIAS 498 3 x 0.0 = 0.0 TSMIN 300 5 x 2.9 = 14.5 TCSIUS 445 5 x 3.2 = 16.0 30.5 Total credits earned toward graduation: 10 Total graded credits attempted: 13 Grade point average = 30.5 \u00f7 13 = 2.35The total graded credits attempted, not the credits earned toward graduation, are used in computing the GPA.Example 2: Grade Course Credits Grade Points TBUS 300 5 x 2.3 = 11.5 TBUS 310 5 x 2.9 = 14.5 TBUS 320 5 x I = 0.0 26.0 Total credits earned toward graduation: 10 Total graded credits attempted: 15 Grade point average = 26.0 \u00f7 10 = 2.60 The student attempted 15 credits, but only 10 are graded; the I is not computed in the grade point average. If the work in TBUS 320 is not made up by the end of the quarter, the I will convert to a numeric grade of 0.0 and the grade point average will be recomputed. When the grade of 0.0 is received, it is computed in the grade point average, but no credit is awarded toward graduation. Repeating Courses With the approval of the academic program offering the course, a student may repeat a course once. Both the original grade and the second grade will be computed in the grade point average, but credit will be allowed only once. Veterans receiving benefits must receive approval from the veterans coordinator in the Office of Veteran and Military Services before a course is repeated. Duplicate Courses To protect the student's investment of educational effort and the value of the degree, UW Tacoma will not award credit for courses that repeat work done elsewhere. It is the responsibility of students who have earned credit at other colleges for determining whether courses they plan to take at UW Tacoma would duplicate any previously earned credit. Duplicate credit will not be awarded for courses that are equivalent to courses previously passed. Students who are in doubt should consult an advisor before registering. Class Attendance The University of Washington Tacoma reserves the right to drop students who have not attended class during the first week of the quarter to make space for other students waiting to enroll. However, students should not assume that they will automatically be dropped from a course if they do not attend. It is the student's responsibility to drop the course through MyUW . Students who are registered for a course section but do not attend will be assigned a failing grade by the instructor. Students may not attend a course in which they have not been officially registered after the first two weeks of the quarter. An instructor may allow a student to attend his or her class only if the student's name appears on the official class list from the Office of the Registrar. Other faculty members may attend informally with the approval of the instructor. Grading Procedures Change of grade Except in case of error, an instructor may not change a grade that he or she has submitted to the registrar. A student who finds administrative omissions or errors in a grade report must make application for a review not later than the last day of the student's next quarter in residence. Grades used to meet graduation requirements cannot be changed after the degree has been granted. Students are not automatically notified of grade changes posted after the first of the quarter. Grade appeal procedure A student who believes he or she has been improperly graded first discusses the matter with the instructor before the end of the following academic quarter. If the student is not satisfied with the instructor's explanation, the student may submit a written appeal to the director or the dean of the program that offered the course, with a copy of the appeal also sent to the instructor. This must be done no later than 10 class days after his or her discussion with the instructor. The director/dean consults with the instructor to ensure that the evaluation of the student's performance has not been arbitrary or capricious. Should the director/dean believe the instructor's conduct to be arbitrary or capricious and the instructor declines to revise the grade, the director/dean, with the approval of the voting members of his or her faculty, shall appoint an appropriate member, or members, of the faculty of that program to evaluate the performance of the student and assign a grade. The UW Tacoma vice chancellor for Academic Affairs and the University of Washington provost should be informed of this action. Once a student submits a written appeal, this document and all subsequent actions on this appeal are recorded in written form for deposit in the student's file. Grade Reports The University of Washington does not mail grade reports. Students access their grades online using MyUW . Academic and University Policies17 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Transcripts Official transcripts are available from the Office of the Registrar. Transcripts may be ordered on MyUW for current students or by using a request form completed by the student. Because the signature of the student is required, email requests cannot be accepted. Payment of $9 per transcript is required at the time of the request. Current students may have the charge added to their student account. The transcript request form is available online at www.tacoma.uw.edu/ ordering-transcripts. Allow three to five working days for processing. Same-day requests are available for an additional $15 fee. Transcripts may be picked up in the Office of the Registrar with picture identification or mailed to a third party, per student request. Each transcript will include all course work taken at the University of Washington, with indication of the campus where the credits were earned. Students can print out an unofficial transcript online at myuw.washington.edu . Scholarship Academic Standards Students are expected to meet the traditional standards of honesty and truthfulness in all aspects of their academic work at UW Tacoma. In particular, all work submitted to an instructor in fulfillment of course assignments, including papers and projects, written and oral examinations, and oral presentations and reports, must be free of plagiarism. Plagiarism is using the creations, ideas or words of someone else without formally acknowledging the author or source through appropriate use of quotation marks, references and the like. Student work in which plagiarism occurs will not be accepted as satisfactory by the instructor and may lead to disciplinary action against the student submitting it. Any student who is uncertain whether his or her use of the work of others constitutes plagiarism should consult the course instructor for guidance before formally submitting the work involved. Satisfactory Progress The university requires students to declare a major by the time they have earned 105 credits. Students are urged to meet with an advisor to determine a major. A registration hold may be placed on students who have reached 105 credits and not declared a major. In rare cases, a student who has met with an advisor will be granted a pre-major extension. The university's satisfactory progress policy requires that students complete their undergraduate degree within 30 credits beyond the minimum required for the degree. Because most degrees require 180 total transfer and UW credits, students generally must complete their programs by the time they earn 210 credits. Undergraduates who have completed more than 210 credits will be notified by the end of the third week of the quarter that a block is being placed on their registration due to lack of satisfactory progress. Students are encouraged to meet with their academic advisors to prepare a graduation plan or complete a graduation application. Low Scholarship Academic warning An undergraduate student whose grade point average falls below 2.00 in his or her first quarter at the university receives an academic warning. If a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00 for courses earned in residence at the university is not achieved by the end of the next quarter, he or she is placed on academic probation. Academic probation and dismissal for low scholarship An undergraduate student is placed on academic probation at the end of any quarter (except for the first quarter at the university, when an academic warning is issued) in which his or her cumulative grade point average falls below 2.00. Once on probation, the student must attain at least a 2.50 for each succeeding quarter's work until the cumulative grade point average is raised to a 2.00 or the student is dropped for low scholarship. Reinstatement An undergraduate student who has been dropped for low scholarship will be readmitted to the university only at the discretion of the pre-major reinstatement committee or if in a major, the student's academic program. In some cases, a student may be required to sit out one quarter. A student readmitted after being dropped under these rules reenters the university on academic probation. The student's GPA is the same as when dropped from the university, and the student may not use grades from other colleges or universities to raise his or her UW grade point average. A readmitted student is dropped if he or she fails to attain either a 2.50 grade point average for the following quarter's work or a cumulative UW grade point average of 2.00 at the end of that quarter. The student is removed from probation at the end of the quarter in which a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 or better is reached. The petition for reinstatement form is available from the online through the Office of the Registrar or the student's academic program.Please note: The University of Washington transcript is comprised of course work and grades from all three campuses. Students who are dropped for low scholarship from one campus and reinstated at another will remain on academic probation until their cumulative grade point average reaches 2.0. Senior in final quarter A senior who has completed the required number of credits for graduation, but whose work in what would normally be his or her final quarter places him or her on probation does not receive a degree until removed from probation. Dean's List Quarterly dean's list The quarterly high scholarship list includes the names of matriculated undergraduate students who have attained a quarterly grade point average of 3.50 in the final grades for at least 12 graded credits. Appropriate high scholarship entries are made on the student's permanent academic record. Annual dean's list The yearly award for high scholarship is recorded on the academic transcript of undergraduate students enrolled for three quarters of the academic year (summer through spring) and who earned a quarterly GPA of 3.50 in 12 or more numerically graded credits each quarter. It is also recorded for students enrolled for four quarters who met the standard just mentioned and also earned a quarterly GPA of 3.5 or better in the fourth quarter if enrolled for 10 or more credits. Annual dean's list certificate Annual Dean's List certificates are awarded to students in the senior class who have high scholastic records for their junior year. The honors committee on the University of Washington Seattle campus determines the grade point average required for the awarding of certificates. Students receive a certificate and a letter of congratulations from the UW Tacoma chancellor. Baccalaureate Honors Baccalaureate honors (summa cum laude, magna cum laude, cum laude) are awarded only to recipients of a first baccalaureate degree.

Our admission process is both competitive and holistic, giving each applicant an opportunity for a comprehensive and individual review. Applicants who apply early have the best chance for full university and program consideration. For information about application deadlines, including priority scholarship deadlines, please visit our website: tacoma.uw.edu/ admissions/important-dates. Freshman Admission Requirements College Academic Distribution Requirements (CADRs) Students are required to complete a minimum level of preparation in six subject areas in high school. More information about each of these requirements is available online at tacoma.uw.edu/freshman/cadr Minimum CADRs SUBJECT REQUIREMENT English ........................................... 4 credits Mathematics ............................... 3 credits* Social studies ................................ 3 credits World language ............................. 2 credits Lab Science ............................... 2 credits** Fine, visual, performing arts .... 0.5 credits Academic electives .................... 0.5 creditsUsing College Course Work to Complete CADRs Almost all applicants will have satisfied these requirements through high school course work, which is generally defined as that completed in grades 9-12. However, there are several ways to satisfy CADRs at the college level. In general, five quarter credits (or three semester credits) at the college level equals one credit of high-school study. If you completed a portion of these requirements in high school, you can pick up in college where you left off in high school. For example, if you completed three credits of English in high school, you can use one college English composition or literature course to bring your total to four credits. For details, please see tacoma.uw.edu/freshman/cadr. Test Scores Scores from the SAT or ACT Plus Writing are required for admission. Test scores are valid only if they are sent directly from the testing agency to the UW . Test scores reported on high school transcripts are not considered official. Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT I) \u2014 UW Tacoma Institutional Code: 4445 American College Test (ACT) \u2014 UW Tacoma Institutional Code: 4493 Grading Restrictions To satisfy the college academic distribution requirements, a passing grade, including a D, is acceptable in either high school or college work for most courses. Intermediate algebra taken at the college level must be completed with a C (2.0) or better.If you are completing CADRs through college course work, you are strongly encouraged to take courses for a letter/numerical grade, because you may later want to apply this course work towards requirements, for which grading restrictions pertain. Submission of Final High School Transcript Newly admitted freshmen are required to submit their official final high school transcript no later than July 1. Failure to successfully complete course work reported in the application for admission or dramatic changes in reported GPA could cause your offer of admission to be revoked. Dual Enrollment The University of Washington Tacoma has partnered with Tacoma Community College to offer a Dual Enrollment program. Students can attend both schools at once, and it's easy to gain access to a wide variety of degree and certificate programs. On campuses just six miles apart, students will benefit from coordinated advising to help them make the best choices to meet their educational goals. Students enjoy a seamless transition between lower- and upper-division course work on the path to earning their bachelor's degrees. The dual enrollment program allows eligible Tacoma Community College students to take up to 25 credits at the University of Washington Tacoma before submitting a complete UW Tacoma application. To Undergraduate Admissions*All applicants must complete either three years of high school mathematics through intermediate (second-year) algebra or complete intermediate algebra or higher in college with a 2.0 grade or better. Higher-level mathematics, specifically pre-calculus, calculus or business calculus completed with a passing grade will also fulfill this requirement. Note: During the senior year of high school, students must also earn a credit in a math-based quantitative course. This may be met through enrollment in one of the three required math courses listed; or by completing a math-based quantitative course like statistics, applied math or an algebra-based science course. The senior-year math requirement does not mean a fourth credit of math is required. Exception: Completion of higher-level math prior to the senior year exempts students from the senior-year quantitative course requirement (e.g., pre-calculus, math analysis, or calculus). **One lab science credit must be an algebraic-based science.20 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma be eligible, you must first complete 15 transferable, college-level credits at TCC with a 2.75 GPA or higher and complete a college- level English composition course with a grade of 2.0 or higher. Current UW Tacoma students who wish to take a course at TCC may also participate in the dual enrollment program For more information go to tacoma.uw.edu/ admissions/dual-enrollment-program or call the Dual Enrollment advisor at 253-692-4742 or 253-460-4468. Transfer Admission Requirements Students who have attended college or university after graduating from high school may be admitted to the University of Washington Tacoma as transfer students. Applicants who have completed fewer than 45 transferable academic college-level credits are required to submit their high school transcripts and standardized SAT or ACT test scores and meet the minimum CADR (for details see tacoma.uw.edu/freshman/ cadr ). The minimum cumulative grade point average for all college course work must be at least 2.0 for admission consideration. Additional university requirements are outlined below. Transfer students may apply to a school or program at the same time they apply to the university or at a later quarter. Note that not all majors admit for all quarters. Whenever students choose to apply to a school or program, they must meet the program's application deadline and admission requirements. Admission to some programs is selective and not all qualified students will be accepted. General University Admission Requirements Note: Transfer applicants who have fulfilled either the intermediate algebra or the world language requirement while in high school, are required to submit an official high school transcript at the time of application. World Language All applicants must complete instruction in a single World Language, either through two sequential years of high school or through the second-quarter level of college coursework (e.g., Spanish 102). The study must be devoted to a single World language and must be in sequence, with no repetition of any prior term of study. Any world language other than English that has been formally studied may be used to satisfy this requirement, including languages no longer spoken, such as Latin and ancient Greek. American Sign Language (AMESLAN, the language of the deaf community in America) will also meet this requirement. However, other forms of deaf signing and computer languages are not acceptable. The world language requirement will be considered satisfied for applicants who had instruction through seventh grade (outside the United States) where English was not the language of instruction. Mathematics All applicants must complete either three years of high school mathematics through intermediate (second-year) algebra or complete intermediate algebra or higher in college with a 2.0 grade or better. Higher- level mathematics, specifically pre-calculus, calculus or business calculus will also fulfill this requirement. Guaranteed Admission through the Direct Transfer Agreement (DTA) UW Tacoma guarantees general admission to Washington state residents who earn an approved transfer degree at a Washington state community college with at least a 2.75 GPA and meet admission requirements. To qualify for guaranteed admission, students must meet all of the following criteria: Complete the transfer application by the application deadline for the quarter. Eligible students who apply after the application deadline will be admitted on a space-available basis until transfer admission is closed for the quarter. In the event that space is not available, students eligible for Guaranteed Admission may be admitted for a future quarter as designated by the Office of Admissions. Earn an approved transfer degree, as determined by UW Tacoma's Office of Admissions, at a Washington state community college. Have a cumulative 2.75 GPA or better in all transferable academic course work (at all colleges attended). Transfer directly from a Washington state community college. Be a Washington state resident. The Direct Transfer Agreement (DTA) ensures admission only to pre-major status and does not promise admission to any school or program nor to any particular major within the university. Additional program or university requirements must be met for completion of a baccalaureate degree. Students are responsible for checking specific program requirements. Y ou may apply to a school or program at the same time you apply to the university or in a later quarter. Whenever you choose to apply to a school or program, you must meet the program's application deadline and admission requirements. Admission to some programs is selective and not all qualified students will be accepted. Undergraduate Transfer Credit To students pursuing a first bachelor's degree, UW Tacoma awards transfer credit according to the guidelines listed below. It reserves the right to accept or reject credits earned at other institutions of higher education. In general, it is university policy to accept credits earned at institutions fully accredited by the regional accrediting association provided that such credits have been earned through university- level courses (see exceptions below) and are appropriate to the student's degree program. For courses taken at a Washington state community college, UW Tacoma follows the list of transferable courses published in the UW Equivalency Guide for Washington Community and Technical Colleges (admit.washington.edu/Requirements/Transfer/Plan/ EquivalencyGuide ). Notable Restrictions on Transfer Credit Lower-division college credit At the time of admission, a maximum of 90 lower-division (100- or 200-level courses) quarter credits can be awarded toward the student's degree. Depending on the degree program, students may be allowed to petition the academic program for additional lower- division credit. Under no circumstances will students be awarded in excess of 135 lower-division credits. Some transfer courses labeled 100 and above are not actually college-level and will not be accepted for credit (e.g. Math 100 is developmental math on many campuses). Upper-division credits (300- or 400-level courses) from other four-year institutions may apply to some program requirements. For some programs, there is a seven-year limit on upper-division transfer credits that are applied toward required core or concentration courses. Please consult with an advisor for details. UW Extension distance learning If permitted by the degree program, up to 90 credits earned in correspondence courses offered by the Distance Learning division of UW Extension may be applied toward a UW degree. However, 45 of the student's final 60 credits must be taken in residence at UW Tacoma to meet the final-year residency requirement (see page 26). Undergraduate Admissions21 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Extension credit from other schools No more than 45 credits earned as extension credit from other schools may be applied toward a UW degree. Military credit and CLEP , discussed below, is included in the 45 extension credit limit. Military/ROTC credit Credits earned in Armed Forces Training Schools (AFTS) and through USAFI and DANTES may not exceed 30 and are included in the 45 extension credit limit. Official transcripts or DD-214 or DD-295 forms must be submitted. Scores received in such course work are not included in the transfer GPA. Out-of-sequence courses Credit is not awarded for prerequisite courses completed after a more advanced-level course has been completed. For example, students will not be awarded credit for Spanish 102 if it was taken after Spanish 103. Physical education No more than 3 quarter credits will be allowed for physical education activity courses. Restricted courses A maximum of 15 transfer credits will be awarded for a wide range of college-level courses that are vocational-technical, rather than academic, in content (e.g., bookkeeping, electronics, physical therapy technician). These credits may apply only to the elective component of a baccalaureate degree and are not included in the transfer GPA. College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) The College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) is a nationwide program that allows students to earn college credit by examination. The academic programs have authorized the use of these examinations and determined the scores necessary to receive college credit. CLEP examination equivalencies are determined by UW Tacoma faculty and course credit is available in a wide range of lower-division courses. CLEP examinations cover material taught in courses that most students take as requirements in the first two years of college. The amount of credit usually equals the amount of credit earned by someone successfully completing the course. Y ou can receive credit for CLEP tests after we receive your official scores and credit is awarded based on type of test and score earned. No more than 45 total quarter credits (including all other extension and military credits) is allowed. CLEP credits count toward graduation but do not count as final-year residence.Courses Receiving No Credit Courses receiving no transfer credit include (but are not limited to): Courses below college level (usually numbered below 100) Repeated or duplicate courses Course work taken at an institution that is not accredited by the regional association Courses that provide instruction in a particular religious doctrine Mathematics courses considered below college level, including basic math, business math, beginning and intermediate algebra Courses offered for non-credit continuing education units Remedial English (e.g., reading, vocabulary development, grammar, speed reading, or any courses that are preparatory to an institution's first English composition course) Courses providing instruction in English as a Second Language (100-level or above) Remedial courses in any academic discipline Applicability of Transfer Credit to Degree Requirements The Office of the Registrar has the authority to make decisions approving transfer credit to the university and application of transfer credits to fulfill university requirements. The individual academic program offices have the authority to determine application of transfer credits to fulfill major requirements. By the first quarter of enrollment, a student should meet with an academic advisor in the Academic Advising Center to plan a program of study. Quarter vs. Semester Credits Colleges and universities that operate on a semester system award semester credit. The University of Washington Tacoma awards quarter credit. One semester credit is equivalent to 1.5 quarter credits; one three- semester-credit course is equivalent to 4.5 quarter credits. Sixty semester credits are equivalent to 90 quarter credits. Transfer GPA In calculating the transfer GPA, the following guidelines apply: Grades from all transferable academic courses attempted, from all accredited colleges the student has attended, in which the student has received grades between 0.0 and 4.0 on a 4.0 grading scale are included in the calculation. To protect the students' investment of educational effort and the value of the degree, UW Tacoma will not award credit for courses that repeat work done elsewhere. It is the responsibility of students who have earned credit at other colleges to determine whether courses they plan to take at UW Tacoma would duplicate any previously earned credit. Duplicate credit will not be awarded for courses that are equivalent to courses previously passed. Students who are in doubt should consult an advisor before registering for a UW Tacoma course. All transferable academic credit from two-year and four-year colleges is included in the calculation, even if it exceeds the 90 credits awarded. Transfer course work completed after a student matriculates must be graded on a numerical or letter-grade basis. The following are not included in the transfer GPA: Courses considered by UW Tacoma to be below college level Math courses equivalent to MATH 098 (formerly MATH 101 Intermediate Algebra) Certain religion courses that teach from a particular doctrinal perspective or that teach preparation for the ministry Developmental or remedial courses Courses in study skills English as a Second Language courses Vocational/technical courses Courses recorded with a grade of Incomplete Courses recorded with a grade of Pass or Satisfactory P .E. activity credits in excess of 3 quarter credits Other Admission Types Post-baccalaureate students Post-baccalaureate students are those who have completed one or more bachelor's degrees and are working toward another bachelor's degree or completing prerequisite courses for a graduate program. Post- baccalaureate is a matriculated status at the University of Washington Tacoma. The Office of Admissions does not award transfer credit to post-baccalaureate students. Any application of a student's previous course work toward graduation requirements will be determined by program faculty and academic advisors. Undergraduate Admissions22 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Nonmatriculated students A student attending the University of Washington Tacoma as a nonmatriculated student cannot earn a degree. However, a grade is earned and full credit is awarded and recorded on a UW transcript. The credits earned as a nonmatriculated student usually transfer to other institutions. If a student later applies and is accepted as a matriculated student, up to 45 credits earned as a nonmatriculated student may be applied towards an undergraduate degree with some restrictions. Students attending as nonmatriculated may accrue no more than 45 credits in that status (some exceptions may be allowed). The number may vary by program. A nonmatriculated student who wishes to become a degree-seeking student must submit a regular undergraduate admission application, as well as all required transcripts and test scores. Students considering applying as a matriculated (degree-seeking) student are encouraged to do so as soon as possible, as 45 of the last 60 credits of a baccalaureate degree must be earned as a matriculated student in residence at University of Washington Tacoma. Non-UW Tacoma students applying to the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Nonprofit Management certificate programs should apply as nonmatriculated students. Please review the program requirements for guidance in making a successful application and completing additional program application requirements (www.tacoma.uw.edu/gis). Undergraduate AdmissionsReturning former students A UW Tacoma undergraduate student who has not been enrolled for more than one quarter (not including summer) is required to submit a Returning Student Application and pay a $60 application fee by the application deadline. Returning students who left in good academic standing and wish to return must return to the same academic program they were enrolled in when they left. Students who wish to apply to another major may do so after re-admission by submitting a change of major form. Auditors An individual who wishes only to audit university courses should apply as a nonmatriculated student. Attendance in courses as an auditor is by consent of the instructor and only as space permits. Permission to audit is ordinarily granted for lecture classes only. An auditor may not participate in class discussion or laboratory work, and the auditor's registration may be canceled at the discretion of the instructor. No record of audited courses is kept. Regular tuition and fees are charged. To receive credit for an audited course, the student must register for the class for credit and complete the course requirements in a subsequent quarter.23 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma International Student Admissions Students who require a student visa (F-1 or J-1) to study in the U.S. are considered international students for admission to UW Tacoma.

It encourages students to think critically, seek out resources, and develop action steps. Advisors help students to set and achieve academic goals, acquire relevant information and services, and make viable academic decisions consistent with strengths, interests, goals, and degree requirements. Through academic advising, students are empowered to become responsible consumers of their own education. Admission Deficiencies Any student who is admitted to the University of Washington Tacoma with an admission deficiency is required to complete that deficiency within one year of being admitted. Students who fail to do so may have a hold placed on their registration. Students who fail to complete an admission deficiency cannot receive a UW Tacoma degree. Class Standing A student's initial class standing is determined by the total number of transfer credits awarded by the University of Washington Tacoma, not by the number of years of college study or completion of an associate degree. The following table lists the required credits for each class: First-year .......................... fewer than 45 credits Sophomore ................... 45-89 credits Junior .......................... 90-134 credits Senior .......................... 135 credits or more Students should note that satisfying UW Tacoma graduation requirements depends not only on the number of credits completed (a minimum of 180) but also on completion of all program requirements.Declaring a Major A major is the academic discipline, such as business or environmental science, to which an undergraduate student formally commits. Successful completion of the courses prescribed in an academic major, general education requirements and elective courses for a minimum of 180 credits qualifies a student to apply for an undergraduate degree. Y ou can find the admission and graduation requirements for every major the UW Tacoma in the appropriate academic section of this catalog. The process for declaring a major varies depending on the major chosen. Once the major is finalized a change of major form or notification by academic program is made to the Office of the Registrar. Students are encouraged to declare or change a major as soon as possible. Failure to declare a major before a student has accumulated 105 credits will result in a hold being placed on their registration. Students who haven't yet decided on a major and need guidance can consult the Academic Advising Center for assistance. Changing a Major Students can change their majors at any time using the same process as declaring a major. Students should meet with an advisor first. Double Major or Double Degree Students may complete the requirements of two majors as either a double major or a double degree. Students who complete the requirements of two majors and accumulate a minimum of 180 credits will be awarded one bachelor's degree with two majors, called a \"double major. \" Students who complete the requirements of two different degrees and accumulate 225 credits (180 + 45) will be awarded two bachelor's degrees, called a \"double degree. \" The student will receive two diplomas. If the two degrees are offered by different schools (i.e., the Milgard School of Business and IAS) or if one of the majors is a B.A. and the other is a B.S, the student must complete a double degree. Degrees with two majors The student's application for a baccalaureate degree with two majors must show both majors and be approved by the advisors of each programs. Requirements of both majors must be met and each major will appear on the transcript. Second baccalaureate degree A second baccalaureate degree may be granted, upon readmission, but a student must earn a minimum of 45 credits beyond the number required for the first degree. These credits must be earned in residence. The student must achieve no less than a 2.0 cumulative grade point average in the credits required for the second degree. Students completing a second baccalaureate degree are not registered in the Graduate School, but in the academic division of the university with jurisdiction over the degree sought. Two baccalaureate degrees concurrently Students who complete 225 credits and complete the requirements of two majors will be awarded two bachelor's degrees only if the actual degree is different. For example: A student with a major in psychology and a major in social welfare will receive one Bachelor of Arts degree with a double major. A student with a major in psychology and a major in finance will receive a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration because the two degrees are different. Undergraduate Policies and GraduationUndergraduate Policies and Graduation26 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Declaring a Minor A minor is an optional program of study (usually 25 to 35 credits) built around a particular subject or discipline. Minors can be helpful by allowing students to focus their degree by choosing a minor related to their major or to broaden their degree by taking an unrelated but complementary minor). The minor will also appear on the student's transcript. Students in a major with at least 45 credits can declare a minor by completing and submitting an add or drop a minor form to their advisor. Minors do not have prerequisites and do not require any additional application materials. Students are eligible to complete as many as three minors while earning their first undergraduate degree. More information on minors available at UW Tacoma can be found beginning on page 147. Completion of a Minor A minor must be awarded at the same time the student's first bachelor's degree is awarded. This means: A student who doesn't graduate cannot be awarded a minor. A student cannot earn a minor after graduation. University Graduation Requirements for the Baccalaureate Degree To graduate with a bachelor's degree, a student must meet minimum general education and basic skills requirements in addition to the requirements of their academic program. This section outlines only the general education and basic skill requirements. Graduation requirements for the individual degree programs are explained in each program's section in this catalog. Students must earn a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 for all work done in residence at the university. The graduation grade point average is computed when the student has completed all work for the degree and includes only credits earned while in residence at the university. UW Seattle credits are not considered residence credits. Students must complete a minimum of 180 academic credits in the following areas: General Education No fewer than 40 credits of general education courses, to include a minimum of 10 credits in each of three areas of study: Natural World, Individuals and Society and Visual, Literary and Performing ArtsWriting/Composition A minimum of 15 credits of writing to include 5 credits of English composition and 10 credits of writing-intensive courses Quantitative/Symbolic A minimum of 5 credits of Quantitative/ Symbolic Reasoning course work World Languages College-level study through the 102 level in a single world language (or two years in high school) either through two sequential years in high school or through the second-quarter level of college coursework prior to applying for graduation. Diversity A minimum of 3 credits in Diversity coursework; designated courses which focus on the sociocultural, political and economic diversity of human experience and help students develop an understanding of the complexities of living in increasingly diverse and interconnected societies. (For students admitted as of Autumn 2014.) Final-Y ear Residency Requirement Students are required to complete 45 of their final 60 credits as matriculated students in residence at UW Tacoma. Some degree programs may have stricter residency requirements. To seek an exception to the residency requirement the student needs to submit a graduation petition to the UW Tacoma Registrar for review by the Academic Policy and Curriculum Committee. See details in the \"Waiver of Graduation Requirements\" section. If an exception is granted, the student still must present a minimum of 45 credits taken in residence as a matriculated student to be awarded a UW degree. Catalog for Graduation Requirements With advisor approval, a student may choose to graduate under the requirements of either the current catalog or the catalog in effect at the time he or she entered the program from which he or she is to graduate. If the student graduates more than 10 years after enrolling in the program, the current catalog must be used for graduation purposes. Exceptions to this rule cannot be made without official approval by the academic program.Waiver of Degree Requirements To request a waiver of graduation degree requirement a student must submit a petition to their academic program. Students should confer with their advisor before completing the petition. Review is done by the academic program faculty committee or director/dean, as procedures specific to each academic program dictate. If the student is requesting to waive a university requirement (e.g., residency or the minimum grade for composition), the petition will be submitted to the registrar for review by the Faculty Assembly's Academic Policy and Curriculum Committee. Once a determination has been made by the committee, the registrar will notify the student and the graduation specialist. To ensure a determination is made in time for graduation, petitions must be submitted at least one quarter before the student's graduation date. The decision of the Academic Policy and Curriculum Committee is final. An exemption from a university graduation requirement becomes void at the end of two calendar years from the date the exemption was granted if all degree requirements have not been completed by that date. Filing a Graduation Application The student must make an appointment with her or his advisor to complete an application for graduation. The application may be filed as early as three quarters before the expected date of graduation. The absolute deadline for filing an application is the Friday of the second week of the quarter in which the student intends to graduate. Students who will complete their degree requirements in summer quarter but wish to participate in the preceding spring commencement must adhere to the spring deadline. It is the student's responsibility to apply for a degree; degrees are not automatically awarded when requirements have been satisfied. If a student declared a minor but it does not appear on the graduation application, the graduation specialist will remove it. On the other hand, if a student does list a minor on the degree application, the student must complete that minor or drop it officially, or she or he will not graduate. This protects the student from being graduated when the actual intent is to continue on in order to complete the minor. Undergraduate Policies and Graduation27 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Adding minors after applying to graduate A student who wants to add a minor after the graduation application has been submitted must see his or her advisor, who will update the application and notify the graduation specialist in the Registrar's Office. Commencement Formal Commencement exercises are conducted at the close of spring quarter, on the second Friday in June. Information on participating in Commencement is posted on the UW Tacoma website at tacoma.uw.edu/ commencement . Students who graduated during the previous Autumn or Winter quarters and those who anticipate graduating in Spring or Summer quarters of the current year are eligible to participate if they have filed a graduation application. It is the student's responsibility to apply for graduation by the deadline (see Filing a Graduation Application). Diploma distribution Diplomas are produced approximately 8 - 12 weeks after the end of the quarter in which they are earned and are mailed directly to the graduate. Students do not receive their diploma at the Commencement ceremony. Undergraduate Policies and Graduation28 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma CONTACT INFORMATIONThe Office of Undergraduate Education offers undergraduate students the opportunity to discover their intellectual, creative and professional passions by introducing them to many interconnected areas of knowledge. Through special initiatives such as the Freshman Core, the Summer Bridge Program, the Expedition Fellows, and the Undergraduate Research Scholar Award Program, our office works with the academic programs and other campus partners to provide students with a comprehensive four- year undergraduate experience. Undergraduate Education Initiatives Core Learning Community The Core Learning Community prepares students for success at the upper division level by focusing on campus-wide learning goals: communication and self-expression, civic engagement, critical inquiry, global perspectives, diverse cultural views and the ability to solve problems. Summer Bridge Program Summer Bridge provides incoming freshmen with tools for success as they navigate a new academic environment and face the personal and academic challenges of being a first-year student. Sophomore Summit A summer workshop to assist UW Tacoma sophomores in identifying their strengths and learning about internships, majors and potential careers. Expedition Fellows This international immersion experience is designed exclusively for freshmen and sophomores at a very low cost. Undergraduate Research Scholar Award Program The Chancellor's Undergraduate Research Scholar award is designed to provide financial support for research which engages undergraduate students in meaningful research experiences with faculty and other undergraduate scholars. Undergraduate Research Symposium OUE sponsors quarterly student showcases on campus and plans to host a campus-wide undergraduate research symposium on an annual basis. Office of Davenport Administrator: Julie BuffingtonTesting The Office of Undergraduate Education provides math placement and math proficiency testing, Spanish testing, and make-up tests for individual students. Core Learning Community UW Tacoma offers first-year students a Core curriculum that emerges from best practices across the country and research on what helps students succeed. According to this research, a \"cohort\" model results in higher academic achievement, a lower attrition rate, and greater student satisfaction than other models. In our expanded cohort model, under- graduates take courses with many of the same students throughout their first year. This helps students, faculty, advisors, staff and librarians create a learning community. Teaching and learning as a community (rather than with entirely different students in every class) means that students make friends faster and learn to work together as colleagues. Best practices and research also tell us that interdisciplinary core courses prepare first- year students for success. That is why one Core course often includes more than one field of study. Today's challenges, after all, are complex and require educated citizens to approach them from more than one perspective. In the first year, students meet many of their general education graduation requirements in classes with a student-to-faculty ratio of 25 to 1. Discussion, lectures, reading, writing and project assignments broaden students' perspectives, not only about what they are studying, but also about the world in which they live. Beyond the Core curriculum, students select courses each quarter from a range of electives that will allow them to explore and prepare for potential majors. Learning Objectives As the foundation of a student's academic career at UW Tacoma, the cohort model strives to foster the following learning objectives: Inquiry and Critical Thinking Inquiry and problem solving: collect, evaluate, and analyze information and resources to solve problems or answer questions. Office of Undergraduate Education29 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Research methods & application: approach complex issues by taking a large question and breaking it down into manageable pieces. Synthesis & context: make meaningful connections among assignments and readings in order to develop a sense of the 'big picture. ' Communication/Self-Expression Argumentation: formulate an original thesis-driven argument and sustain it in both written and verbal communication. Analysis: identify, analyze, and summarize/represent the key elements of a text. Disciplinary awareness: enter/place themselves into an existing dialogue (intellectual, political, etc.). Expression of ideas: express ideas clearly in writing and speaking in order to synthesize and evaluate information before presenting it. Global Perspective/Diversity/ Civic Engagement Disciplinary perspective: understand events and processes as 'disciplinarily' situated. Global perspective: interact with concepts, ideas, and processes related to the interdependences between personal, local, and global relationships. Diversity: think outside of cultural norms and values, including their own perspectives, to critically engage the larger world. Civic engagement: interact with concepts, ideas, and processes related to civic engagement. Quantitative Literacy Use quantitative evidence (including statistics, graphs, etc.) in support of an argument. Analyze and evaluate a chart or graph and interpret it (through discussion, a written assignment, etc.). Find quantitative data to support an argument. Areas of Knowledge (AoK) Core courses are designed to fulfill the general education requirements set forth by the UW . Within the first academic year, full-time first-year students can expect to earn approximately 45 credits towards the university's distribution requirement, including 15 - 20 credits earned within the Core program. The AoK are as follows and provide foundational learning for all academic majors and programs: 15 credits in writing to include no fewer than 5 credits in English composition [C] and 10 additional credits in writing- intensive [W] courses 5 credits in quantitative/symbolic reasoning [Q] 40 combined credits of areas of knowledge that include no fewer than 10 credits in each are of study: Visual, Literary and Performing Arts (VLPA) [V] Individuals and Societies (I&S) [I] Natural World (NW) [N] Courses taken to fulfill the writing [W], reasoning [Q] and academic major requirements may also apply to the areas of knowledge requirements. Advising Academic advisors work in partnership with students throughout their UW Tacoma journey. First-year Core students are required to meet with an academic advisor each quarter before registering for courses. Research supports that if you meet with an advisor throughout your college career, you are more likely to achieve success in college and graduate in a timely manner. Course Descriptions Below are sample course descriptions. Core courses change based on the faculty teaching each quarter. For information on Core courses currently being offered, check the online Time Schedule. TCORE 101 Service Learning for Social Justice Students will explore the theme of social justice through service learning. Along with writing on particular topics related to this theme, they will do research about the issue of volunteerism and civic responsibility in conjunction with the particular project they pick, such as working with Habitat for Humanity. The goal of the class is to put academics into action, so that students will understand that what they learn can be applied in the real world. TCORE 113 Business and SocietyBusiness and Society is designed to facilitate a better understanding of the complex relationship between private enterprise and society at large; how business influences society and is influenced by society. The course will focus on the obligations business has to its nonmarket stakeholders. TCORE 114 The King of Pop: Reading Michael Jackson No matter what you may think of Michael Jackson, he is one of the most recognized and celebrated global icons in the world. This course will explore why through examining his popular cultural context: Jackson the boy and the man, his artistic and cultural influences and his impact/legacy, as well as the corresponding affect fame seems to have had on him. \"Don't stop 'til you get enough!\" TCORE 122 Where the Water Meets the Road: Examining the Environmental Impacts of Urbanization on Aquatic Ecosystems. How do your actions impact the aquatic organisms living in Puget Sound? As the human population continues to climb, more and more people are migrating to urban areas. This in turn imposes greater stresses on adjacent water bodies and other natural resources. This class seeks to explore the growing urban centers around the world and their associated environmental impacts on neighboring aquatic ecosystems. We will also address practices that promote sustainable living in urban areas. Faculty While the faculty that teach Core curriculum courses come from a variety of academic programs on campus, they teach to a common set of student learning objectives with a developmental approach that emphasizes the foundational skills necessary to succeed in college courses. Faculty collaborate with others in the Core Learning Community to design and teach classes that build on the cohort model while introducing students to academic writing, the sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities.

There is an urgent need for specialists who develop new information technologies and systems. There is a high demand for professionals who understand the importance of information workflow: how to use existing systems and tools to gather, manipulate, store, retrieve and manage information in all types of settings. Information technology is the newest computing discipline recognized by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The Information Technology & Systems program differs from the existing Computer Science and Computer Engineering programs in the following ways: ITS places a greater emphasis on application, deployment, configuration and development than on the theory and principles of computing. The technology that manages information changes quickly as practitioners address real-world problems in industry, government and research. This program actively responds to the changes that reflect current trends in the information technology field. Our learning environment fosters independent critical thinking and problem solving skills, and emphasizes the need for the ability to analyze the impact of technology on individuals, organizations and society including ethical, legal and public policy issues. Every ITS graduate will gain valuable industry experience by participating in a mandatory internship. This provides students with real-world experiences of what to expect when they join the workforce and helps graduates \"hit the ground running. \" The ITS program seeks students who are active learners, passionate about current trends in technology, and capable of achieving the goals of managing and supporting information technology systems. Mission The mission of the Information Technology and Systems program is to educate students to analyze, design, integrate and manage information systems using information technology. The ITS program will prepare graduates for meaningful professional careers to serve their local, state and national communities. Educational Objectives The Information Technology and Systems program will produce graduates who are able to achieve the following objectives: (a) Gain fundamental knowledge regarding technical concepts and practices in information technology and information systems. (b) Gain a broad background across fundamental areas of information technology along with a depth of understanding in a particular area of interest within the domain of information systems. (c) Demonstrate independent critical thinking and problem solving skills, with an ability to analyze the impact of technology on individuals, organizations and society including ethical, legal and public policy issues. (d) Collaborate in teams to accomplish a common goal by integrating personal initiative and group cooperation (e) Gain skills to communicate efficiently with technical and nontechnical people in the information technology field using written and oral communication as well as gain skills and strategies for facilitating group projects and activities in collaboration with peers. INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY BACHELOR OF SCIENCE Information Technology and Systems (f) Identify and evaluate current and emerging technologies and assess their applicability to address the users' needs and recognize the need for continued learning throughout their career. (g) Determine how information is inferred from data, and how decisions are made rationally on the basis of that information and ensure that data integrity and privacy is maintained as the organization processes information and acts on it. (h) Prepare for graduate studies in information security, information systems, telecommunications, and other related information technology areas.

Major in Arts, Media and Culture This major focuses on how the broadly defined fields of art and media operate within culture, as well as how they transform it. Students study formal, aesthetic and sociocultural ways of understanding literature, arts, and media in cultural and historical contexts. Students are introduced to a range of fields and gain experience working in both American and international frameworks, while at the same time specializing to some degree in a particular field such as visual and performing arts, film/media, literature or comparative arts. Arts, Media and Culture prepares students for a range of careers including publishing, the arts, media, museum work, public relations, and public history. It is also appropriate for students pursuing broad cultural literacy, as well as for those students planning to continue on to advanced study in performing and visual arts or the humanities. Student learning outcomes Cultivate the insight unique to human beings, and be able to identify and explain interrelations among texts of apparently disparate discourses: literature, film, visual arts, and media. Acquire the interpretive skills necessary to analyze individual texts of various kinds\u2014literary, filmic, art, televisual, musical\u2014closely and critically. Students will be not just literate but visually or audiovisually literate. Understand the importance of history and culture as they shape and are in turn shaped by arts and media. Gain practical experience in the creative processes of one of the arts or media studied in the major. Be able to express the knowledge and experience described in the items listed above in clear, concise and persuasive writing.

the mass media through an interdisciplinary and multicultural curriculum. Students will learn about the social, cultural, economic, political and historical context within which media operate. This major focuses on the full range of communication media \u2014 including radio, television, newspapers, magazines, film, advertising, public relations and the Internet\u2014and how it pervades every aspect of our society. Students will study the considerable power media wield in mobilizing public opinion, in cutting across the boundaries between private and public life, and the strong role they play in national development. Students have the option of a Research track or a Professional track. Under the Research Track, students take a series of courses in U.S. and international media theory. Under the Professional Track, students take a series of courses in either print or broadcast media. Given the Communication major curriculum, transfer students should anticipate needing two years to complete all requirements. The most recent course lists are available at: tacoma.uw.edu/interdisciplinary-arts-sciences/com-degree-requirements. Prerequisites Students wishing to declare the Comm-unication major must first complete one of the following 5-credit courses with a minimum grade of 2.0: TCOM 201 Media and Society TCOM 230 Media Globalization and Citizenship Graduation requirements Requires 60 credits total including 30 credits of upper-division course work in major. Professional Track The Print and Television options of the Professional Track take an integrated approach to the study of media criticism and media writing and production. They are predicated on the belief that the development of the practical skills needed to produce and write materials for media outlets such as television, newspapers, magazines, and public relations firms is enhanced through a critical examination of cultural products and an understanding of multiple theoretical frameworks. At the same time, the ability to critique cultural products is furthered through the development of practical skills, since this advances an understanding of various factors that influence how media products are developed and distributed.

The TCOM 490 Communication Capstone Internship has two main components: students perform a 5-credit internship in the communication industry and write a 10-15 page academic paper. The project is designed to allow senior professional track students to gain needed professional experience while placing this professional experience in a broader theoretical framework. Senior project internships and academic paper topics will vary and must have faculty advisor approval. Research Track The Research Track, through courses on media criticism and methods, media ethics, media law and regulation, media history, political economy of mass media, international and development communication, film studies, and cultural studies, provides a critical overview of the political, economic, historic, social, and cultural contexts of the mass media. In each course, students are encouraged to interrogate the relationship among media, culture, and power, and think critically about the correspondence between processes of media production and consumption. The Research Track prepares students for further graduate studies or for careers in media research; the wealth of theoretical courses in this track is an asset to any student interested in communication theory or practice.

Major in Environmental Studies For information on the bachelor of science degree in Environmental Science, please see page 88. The bachelor of arts in Environmental Studies offers students an interdisciplinary perspective on environmental problems. While receiving a strong background in environmental science, students will be exposed to a broad range of interdisciplinary course work that examines the legal, economic, social, literary, historical and philosophical perspectives on both local and global sustainability issues. This major will prepare students interested in pursuing diverse and contemporary careers such as environmental law, policy, management, planning and teaching in the public, private, academic and nonprofit sectors. An important component of the Environmental Studies major is a capstone experience that emphasizes service to the community while exposing the student to potential future employers and positions. Two required \"bookend\" seminars, taken by entering juniors and graduating seniors, introduce students to scientific research, writing and funding processes. The senior capstone experience allows students to get practical experience in individual or team research or internship positions. Preparatory courses 25-28 credits depending on where credits were earned. These can be taken at UW Tacoma or transferred from another school.

Major in Hispanic Studies Students in the Hispanic Studies major will be able to develop intercultural competence necessary to participate in a diverse and increasingly complex world. Hispanic Studies is interdisciplinary in focus, with a strong emphasis on the contemporary culture of Latin America, and it offers practical skills-based language classes for students who want to pursue careers in a variety of fields. The Hispanic Studies major was developed using guidelines from the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL). The Hispanic Studies major includes the five domains of knowledge as: (1) Communication in a language other than English; (2) Knowledge and Understanding of another culture; (3) Interdisciplinary focus; (4) Insights into the comparative nature of language and culture; (5) Participation in multilingual communities at home or around the world.In addition to teaching and translation/interpretation, graduates with a Hispanic Studies major are employed by businesses, government and non-profit agencies, social welfare and law enforcement groups, insurance companies, law offices, health care services, human resources, immigration offices, and communication and media groups. Student Learning Objectives Students who major in Hispanic Studies will: Develop oral, writing, and reading proficiency in Spanish at the Advanced Level as defined by American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) standards. Become knowledgeable about the complexity of cultures in the Spanish- speaking world and be able to engage in ongoing critical debate about them. Acquire proficiency in the 5 Cs (communication, cultures, connections, comparisons, communities) for language studies in Spanish as defined by the National Foreign Language Standards. Learn terminology and concepts from at least two of these fields: literature and literary criticism; film and film criticism; cultural studies and cultural theory, and be able to apply the terminology and concepts to the critical analysis of works from Spain, Spanish America, and US Latinos. Become global citizens, able to interact compassionately, intelligently, and insightfully with other cultures, particularly those of the Spanish-speaking world, and to engage in the scholarship and activism that constitute Hispanic Studies in the U.S. Acquire competence necessary for employment in a variety of fields related to the Spanish language and literary and cultural studies, and/or a graduate program in Spanish or Latin American Studies. Prerequisites for the Hispanic Studies Major For acceptance into the major, students must demonstrate through a placement exam or coursework proficiency at the 300-level in the Spanish language. Students interested in pursuing a Hispanic Studies major are strongly encouraged to take a variety of interdisciplinary courses dealing with Spanish and Latin American culture in preparation for the major. The most recent course lists are available at: tacoma.uw.edu/interdisciplinary-arts-sciences/ hisp-degree-requirements. Graduation Requirements The Hispanic Studies major consists of 60 upper division credits, in addition to other university requirements for graduation. Of these 60 credits, 35 are core requirements, and 25 credits are required 300-400 level electives from Spanish language and Hispanic culture classes in Spanish. Core Classes (Minimum of 35 credits) TSPAN 301 Spanish Grammar and Lexicon* (5 credits) (or TSPAN 311 for Heritage Speakers**) TSPAN 302 Spanish Conversation*** (5 credits) (or TSPAN 312 for Heritage Speakers) TSPAN 303 Spanish Stylistics and Composition (5 credits) (or TSPAN 313 for Heritage Speakers) TSPAN 351 Intro to Hispanic Literary Studies (5 credits) TSPAN 352 Intro to Hispanic Cultural Studies (5 credits) Study abroad or Experiential LearningTSPAN 299, 393 or 496 Foreign study/ Experiential Learning or Internship (10 credits) We define a native speaker of Spanish as a person who learned Spanish at home as his or her first language, and who lived in a Spanish-speaking home for the first six years of childhood. In Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences*We recommend that students take TSPAN 301, 302 and 303 in sequence, but it's not obligatory. A student can begin 300-level coursework in 302 or 303, as long as he/she has reached that level of proficiency via placement exam or coursework prerequisites. **TSPAN 311, 312 and 313 are courses that are under development.**TSPAN 302 is not open to NATIVE speakers or HERITAGE speakers of Spanish. See definitions provided above. Native and Heritage Speakers can substitute any other Spanish class at the 300- 400 level in place of 302. Only majors with senior status can enroll in the TSPAN 492 internship. The study abroad option can be taken during the summer or during the academic year, at any point in the student's program of study for the major.81 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma addition, a native speaker has some formal instruction (at least through 7th grade) in schools where Spanish was the primary language. (Example: A person who was born in Mexico to Mexican parents, who lived in Mexico until age 14, and completed 7th grade there, is a native speaker of Spanish.) We define a heritage speaker of Spanish as a person who was raised in a home where Spanish was spoken at least 50% of the time during that person's childhood and adolescence. Heritage speakers may not have had formal instruction in Spanish, but they are to some degree bilingual in both Spanish and English. The Foreign Study credits must be in a program that offers at least 50% of the instruction in Spanish in a Spanish- speaking country. Students may combine credits from two programs, if desired. The Experiential Learning must be in a Spanish-speaking community, where at least 50% of the work the student does is in Spanish. Required Electives (Minimum of 25 credits of 300-400 level Spanish courses) At least 5 credits from List A must be at the 400-level At least 5 credits from List B must be at the 400-level List A: Spanish Language classes (300- and 400-level) 5 credits (minimum) at 300 level 5 credits (minimum) at 400 level Total 10 credits (minimum) TSPAN 315 Business Communication in Spanish TSPAN 335 Spanish Linguistics TSPAN 348 Writing and the Research Process TSPAN 420 Advanced Spanish Grammar TSPAN 425 Advanced Communication Skills.

Major in History The History major provides a foundation in American and world history along with options in U.S. History, European History, Asian History or in a Self-Designed History track. Students will learn how to gather information from primary and secondary sources, cull and analyze that information and identify its most significant aspects, reach conclusions based on that analysis, and produce well-written narratives and oral presentations relating the contents and results of their work. History teaches basic comprehension of chronology and cause and effect reasoning, and is thus a discipline that students need to succeed in all fields of research. As Pierce County and the entire South Sound region continue to grow, individuals with training in History will find increasing opportunities in the fields of education, records management, museum curation, government service, heritage tourism, journalism, and other professions. History also provides an excellent foundation for graduate study in law, education and many other areas. The most recent course list is available at: tacoma.uw.edu/interdisciplinary-arts-and- sciences/hist-degree-requirements. Graduation Requirements The History BA degree requires 60 credits. These will include Core courses and courses in one of four selected History tracks with elective options. Reminder: 45 upper-division credits and 45 credits of IAS courses are required for graduation from IAS. Note: IAS students may earn a maximum of 15 independent study (undergraduate research, directed reading, senior thesis or internship) credits. Internships may account for 10 of these credits.

The Nursing program focuses on the discovery and dissemination of knowledge that promotes health. The curriculum emphasizes and fosters the integration of teaching, inquiry and service within a community of learners. Partnerships with the community assist the program in providing learning environments in which learners build upon their skills and knowledge to strengthen their understanding of local, national and global health issues. Philosophy of Undergraduate Education The Nursing faculty believes that the purpose of university-based undergraduate nursing education is to prepare professional nurses whose practice is informed by theory and research. The philosophy of the undergraduate curriculum is rooted in values of excellence, diversity, community, social justice, integrity and creativity. Preparation for the various roles in practice requires knowledge of the arts and sciences, together with content and processes foundational to the discipline. An interdisciplinary emphasis engages students in a broad range of ideas and knowledge. Ultimately, professional nursing requires a commitment to scholarly inquiry, social equity, advocacy and life-long learning. Program Overview The BSN curriculum focuses on critical thinking, responses to health and human functioning, nursing intervention and person-environment interaction within a context of cultural diversity. The curriculum also includes all the essential elements of baccalaureate education for professional nursing practice as defined by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN). An interdisciplinary emphasis encourages an understanding of a broad range of ideas, knowledge and methods of study. Most students in the UW Tacoma Nursing program are employed in a variety of health- care settings, so courses are scheduled to enable students to continue employment while enrolled in the program of study. A BSN from UW Tacoma enhances the graduate's ability to contribute to his or her community's institutions and to the health of citizens of Washington state, particularly during this period of rapid change in health care. Accreditation As part of the top-ranked University of Washington School of Nursing at the Seattle campus, UW T acoma 's Nursing program shares accreditation by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE). Program Goals Opportunities are provided to enable the learner to develop professionally and to meet the Nursing program goals, which are for graduates to: Integrate concepts from the Arts and Sciences in promoting health and managing complex nursing care situations. Apply leadership concepts, skills, and decision making in the provision, and oversight of nursing practice in a variety of settings. Translate principles of patient safety and quality improvement into the delivery of high quality of care. Appraise, critically summarize and translate current evidence into nursing practice. Integrate knowledge, processes, and skills from nursing science; information and patient care technologies; and communication tools to facilitate clinical decision-making, and the delivery of safe and effective nursing care. Describe the effects of health policy, economic, legal, political, and socio- cultural factors on the delivery of and advocacy for equitable health care. Demonstrate effective professional communication and collaboration to optimize health outcomes.

This program takes an interdisciplinary approach to the social, economic, historical, environmental and political processes and issues affecting urban areas. Overview Accomplishing sustainable urban development is a crucial challenge for the twenty-first century. The University of Washington Tacoma is at the forefront of engaging and educating undergraduate students on this topic. The Sustainable Urban Development degree provides students with a critical and rigorous training in ecological, political, economic, and social aspects of urban development processes. Sustainability is often treated as a synonym for environmentalism...but that's not the whole story. Sustainability is not just about the environment; it is also about social equity and economic prosperity. The Urban Studies faculty invites you to learn how cities and urban regions are the key to true sustainability \u2014 for the planet and for the people who populate it. Students will learn how to understand, assess, and manage urban development processes through a carefully designed curriculum that includes urban policy, planning, and environmental science coursework. The degree provides students with a broad but concrete understanding of linkages between urban ecosystems, urban systems (planning, transit, energy, etc.), and the multi-dimensional problems of urbanization, especially as they relate to public policy and urban advocacy. As one of the first such degrees in the nation, students with a degree in Sustainable Urban Development will be prepared to address recent initiatives that have called for a significant \"greening\" of urban development, both locally and internationally. Graduates will be prepared for careers in planning agencies, corporations adhering to sustainability practices, consulting firms, nonprofit organizations, and environmental/resource related agencies at the local, state, and federal levels of government. The degree is also excellent training for further graduate study in fields such as urban planning, public administration and law. Educational Emphasis Urban Studies has built its curriculum around four program goals, which are to: Provide students with a broad understanding of the problems and prospects of our metropolitan areas Equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue careers related to the multi-faceted nature of urban studies Serve as a resource, through service and research, to communities in the South Sound region Guide students to effectively analyze the social and cultural worlds that constitute urban environments Overall objectives of the program: Provide an understanding of the form and function of cities Instill an awareness of problems and issues confronting metropolitan areas Provide an interdisciplinary curriculum that allows students to understand the complex interrelation-ships that make up the urban environment and permits them to approach problems from a variety of perspectives Equip students with the analytical skills needed to undertake research in an urban milieu Learning outcomes: Approach urban issues from an interdisciplinary perspective Apply analytic and quantitative skills to assess and develop strategies to analyze and resolve urban issues Compare and contrast approaches used in designing and undertaking research in urban studies Sustainable Urban Development140 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Demonstrate effective written and oral communication skills Demonstrate appreciation for the diverse nature of urban populations and the social justice issues many of these populations face Admission Requirements Students with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 and at least 40 college-level credits will be considered for admission.

Capstone Course (5 credits) T URB 492 Urban Studies Seminar156 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Graduate Credits Taken as an Undergraduate University of Washington students who are within six credits of completing their undergraduate work and who have met the requirements for admission to the Graduate School may register the quarter immediately preceding admission to the Graduate School for up to six credits in 500-level courses in addition to the last six credits they require of undergraduate work. For example, a student admitted for autumn quarter may take graduate credits during the preceding spring quarter. This registration and these arrangements must be approved by the graduate program that the student will enter. However, students so enrolling are not reclassified as graduate students until the baccalaureate degree has been granted and after their official admission. At that point, it is necessary to petition to permit the six credits to apply toward the master's degree. Only under these circumstances may graduate work taken as an undergraduate be applied toward an advanced degree. Further registration for graduate work is contingent upon completion of the requirements for the bachelor's degree. Graduate Nonmatriculated Students Graduate nonmatriculated (GNM) is a classification for post-baccalaureate students who are not seeking a graduate degree at the time of registration. While a student does not need GNM status to register for a graduate-level class, a student must have it in order to apply the credits to a graduate degree at the University of Washington should the student later be admitted as a matriculated graduate student. GNM status is granted by the individual graduate program. A minimum GPA of 3.0 in the last 90 quarter (60 semester) graded credits is required for consideration. A student who is later admitted to the Graduate School may apply a maximum of 12 applicable GNM credits (or any combination of GNM Graduate Policies and Graduation and up to six approved transfer credits, totaling 12 credits) toward a master's degree. Admission into the GNM status does not confer priority for or guarantee of later admission into the Graduate School to pursue a degree. Applicants for GNM status must contact the academic program directly for application information. Not all programs choose to offer GNM status. Programs will advise students regarding the status and provide instructions, application forms and program requirements to appropriate candidates. Failure to register for any quarter except summer quarter will result in loss of GNM status. Once GNM status has been lost, the application process must be repeated in order to be readmitted as a GNM student. The transcripts and other student records from the prior records can be forwarded to supplement the new application. GNM students pay fees and tuition at the regular graduate-student rate based on residency of the student including the Student Services and Activity Fee and the Technology Fee. GNM students are not eligible for financial aid because most financial aid is governed by federal regulations that require students to be enrolled in degree programs. Students will be assigned a UW student number and receive a student identification card that entitles them to all privileges and access to facilities that are extended to matriculated students. Visiting Graduate Students A student who wishes to enroll in a graduate program at the University of Washington Tacoma and who intends thereafter to return to another graduate school in which he or she is working toward an advanced degree may be admitted as a visiting graduate student. This admission is contingent on available space and facilities. Such a student must have been officially admitted to another recognized graduate school and be in good standing and currently pursuing a graduate degree. Admission to the University of Washington Tacoma, as a visiting graduate student does not guarantee admission to any particular course of study. A visiting graduate student is permitted to register only in those courses for which he or she is judged to be eligible by a faculty advisor or the instructor of the course and if space is available to accommodate registration. Further details regarding application and other relevant policies may be obtained from the appropriate program office at UW Tacoma or online at www.grad. washington.edu . Transfer Credit A student working toward a master's degree may petition the Dean of the Graduate School for permission to transfer to the University of Washington the equivalent of a maximum of six quarter credits of graduate level course work taken at another recognized academic institution. These credits may not have been used to satisfy requirements for another degree. The petition must include a written recommendation from the graduate program coordinator and an official transcript indicating completion of the course work. Transfer credits are not entered on the UW transcript. University of Washington students who are within six credits of completing their undergraduate degree and who have met the requirements for admission to the Graduate School may register the quarter immediately preceding admission to Graduate School for up to six credits in 500-level courses in addition to the last six credits they require of undergraduate work. The graduate program that has admitted the student must approve registration for the courses. The student, after admission to the Graduate School, must file a petition with the Dean of the Graduate School to transfer the six credits. The student must also provide a letter from the Office of Graduation and Academic Records stating that these credits have not been applied toward the undergraduate degree. Contact the specific program for details.

Under a thesis program, a minimum of 36 quarter credits (27 course credits and a minimum of nine credits of thesis) must be presented. Under a non-thesis program, a minimum of 36 quarter credits of course work is required. 2. At least 18 of the minimum 36 quarter credits for the master's degree must be for work numbered 500 and above. (In a thesis program, nine of the 18 must be course credits and nine may be for Master's Thesis [700].) 3. Numerical grades must be received in at least 18 quarter credits of course work taken at the University of Washington Tacoma. The Graduate School accepts numerical grades in approved 400-level courses accepted as part of the major and in all 500-level courses. The student must earn a minimum grade of 2.7 in each class in order for it to be counted. A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 is required for a graduate degree at the university. 4. The minimum residency requirement for matriculated graduate students is 30 credits. Full-time students achieve this by taking 10 credits per quarter and part-time students achieve this by adding credits from multiple quarters. A full quarter of residence is granted for any quarter in which at least 10 credits in approved courses, research, thesis, or internship are satisfactorily completed. Excess credits beyond 10 credits per quarter may not be added together to satisfy the residency requirement. 5. In a thesis degree program, a thesis, approved by the supervisory committee, must be submitted to the Graduate School. A student must register for a minimum of nine credits of thesis (700). With the exception of summer, students are limited to a maximum of nine credits per quarter of thesis (700). 6. A final master's examination, either oral or written, as determined by the student's supervisory committee, must be passed if it is a program requirement.7. Any additional requirements imposed by the graduate program advisor in the student's major department or by the student's supervisory committee must be satisfied. A master's degree student usually takes some work outside the major department. The graduate program coordinator in the major department or the student's supervisory committee determines the requirements for the minor or supporting courses. 8. The graduate student must apply for the master's degree within the first nine weeks of the quarter in which he or she expects the degree to be conferred. See Graduate Degree Application Process. 9. The graduate student must be enrolled for a minimum of two credits in the quarter in which the degree is conferred. A student who does not complete all degree requirements by the last day of the quarter must be registered for the following quarter. 10. All work for the master's degree must be completed within six years. This includes quarters spent on leave or out of status and applicable work transferred from other institutions. 11. A student must satisfy the requirements for the degree that are in force at the time the degree is to be awarded. Graduate Degree Application Process Students must submit master's degree requests on the web. Students may submit a request from the first day of the quarter they expect to graduate until the Sunday (midnight Pacific Time) of the ninth week of the quarter they expect to graduate. If degree requirements are not met in the requested quarter, they must submit another degree request for the quarter in which they expect to complete requirements. Master's degree request schedule Y our department may require an earlier request submission date, please consult your department. Autumn/winter/spring quarters: Weeks 1-9 are considered as filing the Request on time Weeks 10-11 the request system is closed and no requests are accepted. The next option is to graduate during the following quarter. Summer quarter: Weeks 1-7 are considered as filing the Request on time Graduate Policies and Graduation159 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Weeks 8-9 the request system is closed and no requests are accepted. The next option is to graduate during the following quarter. Completing the master's degree request When completing the master's degree request, the program will automatically run a degree audit to inform the students of any unsatisfied Graduate School requirements. Students will receive an email confirming receipt of their master's degree request and the students' departments are notified through MyGradProgram that a request has been submitted. Authorized departmental users enter department contingencies into MyGradProgram and can elect to send an email to the students to notify them of the departmental contingencies. Authorized departmental users will print the master's degree warrants and the warrants will be routed to the students' master's committees in a manner determined by the department. By signing the master's degree warrants, the students' committees certify that the students have met all departmental requirements for the degree (except the thesis if one is required) and the warrants must be placed in the students' department file. Once the warrants have been signed, the authorized departmental users will recommend whether or not the students are to graduate that quarter and these recommendations are conveyed to the Graduate School through MyGradProgram following the end of the quarter. Emails are sent to the students notifying them that their departments have made a recommendation on their request. Once the Graduate School receives the degree request recommendation, a final transcript audit and a review to determine if all Graduate School and department contingencies are met, will be completed by Graduate School staff. The Graduate School enters the final graduation decision into MyGradProgram, email notifications are sent to the students informing them of their graduation status, and authorized department users can view their quarter graduation list in MyGradProgram.

Through innovative research opportunities and partnerships with area companies, the Institute helps graduate students gain practical work experience and meets continually changing industry needs. The Institute also provides services to attract and support students from diverse local as well as international educational, economic and ethnic backgrounds. About the Degree Program The master's degree in Computer Science and Systems at University of Washington Tacoma is designed for advanced careers in the technology industry and to prepare students to enter a Ph.D. program in computer science. Those with a master's degree in computer science typically earn 25 to 30 percent higher starting salaries than those with bachelor's degrees, according to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The degree requires 40-45 credits, depending on the various degree options. The MSCSS program is a competitive program focusing on graduate level coursework in computer science through a variety of core courses and advanced electives. It serves a diverse population of students, from those with significant experience and degrees in the field, to those with non-computing-related undergraduate degrees augmented by the requisite undergraduate course work. By broadening this base of students eligible for the program, the Institute encourages a number of undergraduate students to continue their education at the graduate level. This attracts an increasing number of nontraditional students who have related work experience and a strong interest in computing, thereby providing a balanced blend of perspectives and learning experiences.Degree Options There are three options for completing the MSCSS degree: Thesis option Capstone project option Course-only option Thesis Option The thesis option is designed for graduate students who are prepared and want to engage in innovative research, working with one or more Institute faculty members. This research often results in one or more publications in journals or conference proceedings. Students who select the thesis option must work with a faculty advisor to produce a thesis proposal. The proposal, along with a Proposal to Enroll in MSCSS Capstone, is submitted to the Graduate Committee for approval. After the Graduate Committee approves the proposal, the student registers for TCSS 700. A total of 10 credits of TCSS 700 must be completed to meet the degree requirements. These units are typically taken in two quarters. TCSS 700 is graded credit/no credit; the course does not count toward the student's grade-point average. Capstone Project Option The capstone project option was designed for graduate students who want to work on a significant technical project as part of their graduate program. Capstone projects typically involve the design, implementation and testing of a moderate to large programming project. Students who select the capstone project option must work with a faculty advisor to produce a project proposal. The proposal, along with a Proposal to Enroll in MSCSS Capstone form, is submitted to the Graduate Committee for approval. After the Graduate Committee approves the proposal, the student registers for TCSS 702. A total of 10 credits of TCSS 702 must be completed to meet the degree requirements. These units are typically taken in two quarters. MASTER OF SCIENCE Computer Science and Systems Graduate Program Coordinator Ankur Teredesai Assistant Director of Operations Joel Larson Administrator Zaide Chavez M.S. in Computer Science and Systems169 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma TCSS 702 is graded the same way core and elective courses are graded, so the grades count toward the student's grade-point average. Course-Only Option Students may choose to take an additional three 500-level electives (15 credits) to satisfy their degree requirements in place of capstone course work. This option is provided for students who are primarily interested in a broader education in computer science. Ten credits of 400-level course work may be substituted for this option. Curriculum The courses a student may take to satisfy the requirements for the MSCSS degree fall into five categories: Prerequisite courses (required of students lacking the equivalent of an undergraduate degree in computer science) Core courses (required of all students) Elective courses (required of all students) Capstone course (required of thesis and project option students) Independent study Prerequisite Courses: Undergraduate Students who enter the MS program without a strong computer science background will be advised and required to take undergraduate computer science courses that will prepare them for graduate studies in the field. They will be advised on a case-by-case basis. In general, students should have adequate course work or work experience in the following areas before starting to take graduate-level courses in the MSCSS program: Object-oriented programming Discrete mathematics Data structures Analysis of algorithms Course work/experience in the following is also encouraged: Computer organization and architecture Database management systems Project management and software engineering Operating systems At the time of admission, students will be notified of any required prerequisite courses.Core Courses All graduate students are required to take three core courses: TCSS 543 Advanced Algorithms or TCSS 540 Theory of Computing TCSS 558 Applied Distributed Computing TCSS 598 Research Seminar (typically taken over three quarters) Core course are typically taken after any required prerequisites have been completed. Elective Courses The number of elective courses a student is required to take depends on the program of study the student has chosen. For students in the course-only option, 30 credits of elective courses are required. Students may request permission from the graduate committee to apply for independent study credit (TCSS 600) toward this total. Most electives will be taken at the 500-level, however, students in the course-only option may take 10 credits of approved 400-level courses and students in the project or thesis option may take five credits of 400-level courses. Graduate students should request prior approval from the Graduate Committee before registering for any 400-level courses. Independent Study (TCSS 600) After taking the core courses, a student may develop a strong interest in a specific area of computer science that is not covered in any elective course being offered. In this case, the student may propose to substitute an independent study course for an elective course. To do this, the student must first find a faculty member who will supervise the independent study and then submit the proposed plan of study to the Graduate Committee for approval in the quarter prior to being undertaken. Thesis and Capstone Project Courses (TCSS 700 and 702) Students enrolled in the thesis option are required to take 10 credits of TCSS 700 and students in the project option are required to take 10 credits of TCSS 702. These courses are taken in place of 10 credits of elective courses. If a student chooses to switch from the thesis or project option to the course-only option, the credits from 700 and 702 will not count as elective credits. Admission Requirements Admission to the master of science in Computer Science and Systems is competitive and based on acceptance by the UW Graduate School and the Institute of Technology graduate committee.

These individuals are frequently experts in their professional disciplines; however, today's leaders are required to exhibit skill sets and knowledge bases that extend beyond the professional master's degree. Today's leaders must possess experience and expertise in employing research to improve organizational outcomes, to ensure quality teaching for diverse learners, to effectively assess programs, and to lead local and national accreditation and accountability processes. They must be effective political advocates, and informed fiscal and human resource managers. These leaders must demonstrate emotional intelligence necessary to successfully lead a diverse workforce, as well as professional expertise and high standards of legal, moral, and ethical behavior. The University of Washington Tacoma addresses these needs with its practice doctorate degree, the Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in Educational Leadership, with three non-transcripted study options: P-12 Educator Leadership (with Superintendent Certificate option) Nursing Educator Leadership Higher Education Leadership Program design This is a 97-credit, three-year, cohort-based program. For those who wish to earn the P-12 Superintendent Certificate, six additional credits are required in order to meet all state competencies; therefore, 103 credits will be required. Conceptual Framework The program is designed to address conceptual issues of the roles educational leaders play in leadership, management/administration and political advocacy. In addition, the program will help students develop strength in the dimensions of leadership, diversity, accountability and learning.Interdisciplinary Learning The program is designed with a belief in interdisciplinary learning about educational leadership. The cohort will study collaboratively in areas in which the content knowledge is common, and in which students may learn from cross-disciplinary scholarly discussions, such as the leadership courses focused on systemic change, diversity, and instructional leadership. In areas where more specialized knowledge does not overlap, the groups will break into study options for courses or parts of courses, such as educational law or finance, which are quite different in law and policy for P-12 and higher education. Curriculum Coursework includes courses on leadership, specialty courses for the three study options, and courses in research and inquiry. Y ear Two Practicum During the second year of study, students will participate in a practicum for leadership development that is directly related to the context of their employment, or a related site. We will assist students to design practicum activities that will expand their leadership capacity. Y ear Three Capstone In the final year of study, students will complete a field-based capstone project, which is a year-long project in which they address an actual problem of practice. This must be a project outside of their normal work expectations. Specifically the project should demonstrate leadership at a higher level than that of the student's current employment. It must include components of: program evaluation, literature review of research and policy, data collection and analysis, proposal for program improvement or other solution to the problem, and implementation of proposed solutions. A comprehensive report including all of the above will be written and delivered to the University as well as to the employer in whose domain it was conducted. In addition, a manuscript for publication based on the problem of practice and solutions will OF EDUCATION Educational Leadership185 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Doctor of Education (Ed.D.)Student learning goals By the completion of the program, students will: Demonstrate competence in scholarly inquiry to address problems of practice related to educational leadership, policy, and learning. Apply theories of leadership to develop and maintain positive, successful, organization structures and cultures. Exhibit core professional values and guiding principles including commitments to ethical leadership, social justice, and respectful interaction with others of similar and diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Articulate and advance the mission and vision of the organization. Create, implement, and evaluate systems-level plans to create learning environments that advance student success. Model effective communication in the context of complex environments, changing policy environments, and diverse constituents, advocating for the organization in the community. Evaluate one's own and others' leadership and managerial skills and attributes to address problems of organizational improvement, financial and human resources management and resource allocation, and technology and information systems. Admission Requirements Applicants to the Educational Leadership doctorate must: Hold a master's degree from a regionally-accredited college or university in the U.S. or its equivalent from a foreign institution. Have earned at least a 3.0 or B grade-point average in the most recent 45 credits of study. Have significant professional experience in a relevant field, including evidence of demonstrated leadership ability or potential for leadership. P-12 candidates must be approved by employer for support of practicum in Y ear 2. For students in other study options, potential practicum setting(s) must be identified. Y ou will be advised by faculty on site selection criteria prior to and after admissions. The program will communicate with potential sites regarding field work as needed. Proficiency in English is required for graduate study at the University of Washington. Therefore, every applicant whose native language is not English must demonstrate English proficiency. No waivers of this English proficiency requirement may be given. Graduate School Memo #8 describes the relevant policy for English language proficiency.

The graduate courses offer opportunities to pursue questions of interest across a wide range of fields, spanning the humanities, social sciences and environmental sciences, with special emphasis on the relation of knowledge to public action. What are Interdisciplinary Studies? The concept of interdisciplinary studies is founded on a recognition that the experience of phenomena\u2014such as the public problems of poverty, violence, social justice or environmental degradation\u2014do not come in neatly bounded, disciplinary or professional packages. While disciplinary divisions of labor are convenient and necessary to the efficient pursuit of in-depth knowledge, the application of that knowledge in the sphere of public action requires its broader re- integration with the rich, multidisciplinary dimensions and complexities of actual, live situations. The structure of the master of arts program is highly flexible, building on the wealth of interdisciplinary expertise among members of the faculty. A required series of four core courses and a capstone course addresses issues of models, problem formation, evidence, and values. The core courses examine the basic foundations of knowing and acting, making them relevant to diverse areas of specific inquiry. Through electives and a thesis (or master's project), students are encouraged to apply the lessons of the core courses to their own chosen areas of interdisciplinary interest. A broad range of student interests can be accommodated due to the interdisciplinary nature of the program. The program integrates the sociology of knowledge, philosophy, social and political theory, history, cultural studies, anthropology and systems theory to shed light on domains of public action. Examples of possible areas of interest, broadly defined, might include the environment, education, ethnicity, gender, families, arts policy and administration, children and the media, human rights, labor, immigration, trade, development, urban studies, the role of state and local government or international non- governmental organizations.Degree Options There are three MAIS degree options: General MAIS Option The General degree option is a sustained investigation of factors that critically shape actions, procedures and outcomes. These factors provide foundations for knowledge and action in the public sphere. This degree option is well suited for entry into or advancement along community relations, public agency management, community organizing, facilitation, consumer advocacy, policy and/or decision making, political action and governmental relations. Students will learn: How alternative paradigms or models condition our knowledge of the world and how our choice of potential responses connects to how we perceive things to be organized. How to gain insight into the impact of culture and history on the way certain phenomena come to be defined in the public arena as problems, and how they are variously imagined to be caused or solved in relation to diverse professional and disciplinary claims of ownership over them. How evidence can be justified, generated, evaluated and used with varying degrees of validity within diverse frames of application. How to gain insight into the ways in which values are implicitly or explicitly present in every arena socially deemed to be problematic, and how it may be possible to facilitate communication, negotiations, or trade-offs among and across diverse value frames. How to gain experience in facilitating communication, negotiations, or trade- offs among and across diverse value frames. Community and Social Change degree The Community and Social Change degree option focuses on the integration of theory and practice to achieve economic, racial, gender, and social justice through the transformation of local communities. Coordinator Lawrence M. Knopp Graduate Program Advisor Kathryn AndersonMASTER OF ARTS Interdisciplinary Studies M.A. in Interdisciplinary Studies190 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma degree option offers students the knowledge and the development of strategies and skills to improve the lives of those who, historically, are most vulnerable and have been marginalized. This track is especially relevant for students looking to acquire practical skills that will help them become community leaders, policy analysts, and/or social justice practitioners. Students will learn: Assess socially meaningful identities in a variety of cultural and critical contexts, and to communicate across social boundaries in a multicultural world. Analyze and/or critique theories of race/ethnicity, social class, gender/ sexuality and how they have been put into practice to improve the lives of the most vulnerable in the past and in the present locally, nationally, and/or globally. Demonstrate comparative research and critical thinking skills for understanding the range of lived experiences in local and global communities and to understand how power operates in society. Evaluate various analytical and/ or rhetorical frameworks related to various areas of study within community studies, and relevant to the world of work, civic engagement, and community development. Non-Profit Management degree The Non-Profit Management degree option integrates: theory and research regarding organizational development; analyzes the social, cultural, economic and creative foundations of cultural management and policy; introduces the history, philosophy, organization, administration, and practice of museums; and provides an overview of the best practices, systems, and management principles underlying successful fundraising programs. This option requires students to develop a project during the internship. Students produce a demonstrable example of expertise and interest, such as a personnel manual, strategic plan, or annual fund development plan. Students will learn: Demonstrate leadership skills and knowledge in topics such as the management of human resources (both paid and volunteer), fundraising, program evaluation, fiscal management, and governance in nonprofit organizations. Design projects, programs and/or policies that address community issues; Negotiate the inevitable political and economic realities of providing social benefit to communities. Create outcome-based logic models that are required for foundation funding, with a special emphasis on the local/ regional level. What is Public Action? Public action entails a series of determinations that are reached as a result of the following considerations: What is the nature of the problem to be addressed? What mode of analysis is to be employed? What will count as evidence? What values are considered relevant or irrelevant? What options are included or excluded? What outcomes of the action are anticipated or unanticipated? By exploring these questions the master's program becomes a sustained investigation of factors that critically shape actions, procedures and outcomes. The factors to be investigated include: Conceptual models, or paradigms Social, professional and institutional cultures Various types of data used to support alternative perspectives and decisions How various value frameworks shape perspectives, decisions and actions These factors provide a foundation for knowledge and action in the public sphere. The core course of study in this program may therefore apply to virtually any profession or endeavor in our shared public life, whether one works in a large organization or a one- person shop, whether one seeks knowledge for utilitarian ends or to achieve a richer understanding of the world in which everyone must live and act.

M.A. in Interdisciplinary Studies191 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Core Courses The five core courses are closely integrated, constituting a single, extended investigation of how issues and problems are evaluated in the process of taking action. The courses examine analytical tools and how social and organizational cultures influence the work required in moving toward taking action. TIAS 501 Models and Critical Inquiry TIAS 502 Culture and Public Problems TIAS 503 Evidence and Action TIAS 504 Values and Action Approved Methods Course Capstone Course Students enroll in the capstone course (TIAS 505) after the completion of the core course series. The capstone provides a forum for re-integrating the separate themes of the four core courses and considering how they can be applied to the students' areas of interest. Area of Emphasis Students will work with a faculty advisor to develop a focus within the student's chosen area of interest. The required 10 credits of electives are to be chosen carefully in consultation with the academic advisor, as stepping stones toward the substance of the thesis or project. In addition to elective courses developed specifically for the master of arts degree, students can select from a wide range of courses offered at UW Tacoma, including some of those offered in other UW Tacoma graduate programs. Undergraduate courses appropriate to the student's thesis topic can be taken as graduate courses by enrolling in them as TIAS 590 Independent Study courses. This option requires completion of all the undergraduate requirements, as well as additional work to be negotiated with the instructor that will raise the course demands to graduate level. Thesis or Project The final product of the graduate program must be a thesis or a scholarly project that demonstrates a level of competence equivalent to a thesis. In consultation with faculty, students negotiate specific thesis questions and plans focused on their own chosen goals and areas of interest. It is the student's responsibility to recruit a thesis chair and at least one other reader to constitute a thesis committee. The chair may be the academic advisor or may be someone else whose area of expertise most overlaps with the focus of the thesis or project.Enrollment and Curriculum Sequencing Admission is competitive and is based on space availability in the core courses.

The curriculum emphasizes and fosters the integration of teaching, inquiry and service within a community of learners. Partnerships with community members assist the program in providing learning environments in which learners build upon their skills and knowledge to strengthen their understanding of local, national and global health issues. About the Degree Program The master of nursing program prepares registered nurses for practice in wide variety of settings including acute, long-term care, ambulatory, community, and education settings. The program offers the following curriculum options: Leader in Healthcare Delivery Nurse Educator The curriculum has a strong emphasis on mentoring, both in terms of preceptors in fieldwork placements and with faculty. The core courses for both options include research, health systems, health policy, leadership, and diversity and social justice issues related to health. All students engage in scholarly inquiry. Students complete a scholarly project or thesis or take additional course work to meet career and program goals. Two quarters of fieldwork provide students with an opportunity to participate in practice roles in the setting that assists them to meet their goals. The program is designed for both part-time and full-time students. The length of time required to complete the program varies from five quarters on a full-time basis to seven or more quarters on a part-time basis. While it is possible to enroll during any quarter, beginning in the autumn quarter is best for course sequencing. Leader in Healthcare Delivery The Leader in Healthcare Delivery curriculum option provides nurses with the skills and knowledge to become leaders and change agents in the evolving healthcare environment. The curriculum focuses on leadership, program development and evaluation and human and fiscal oversight to foster effectiveness, innovation and change. The curriculum prepares graduates to collaborate with healthcare professionals and members of the community to address the health care needs of a complex and diverse society. Graduates function as nurses in leadership roles to design, implement and evaluate interventions and programs based on assessed population, community, or group needs, as well as clinical nurses, managers or administrators in health care systems, governmental agencies or community organizations Nurse Educator The Nurse Educator curriculum option prepares nurses to teach in schools of nursing and continuing education programs, as well as staff development, clinical education or patient education roles. The curriculum focuses on learning theory, teaching methods, curriculum development, and evaluation. Fieldwork experiences are individualized and focus on the nurse educator role in community colleges or universities, hospitals, ambulatory care and community settings. Graduates function as educators and leaders in clinical education, academic institutions, health care settings and community agencies.

About the Degree Program The Master of Social Work (MSW) is considered the terminal degree in the social work profession. Content and course work in the MSW program will prepare graduates to function in professional social work positions in a wide variety of settings, including health care agencies, child and family services, public social service organizations, the criminal justice system and the public schools. The advanced curriculum provides an in- depth education, through the classroom and practicum, to prepare graduates for advanced, specialized practice. Topics include applied research, social policy and advanced content in social work practice models and methods. The intent of this graduate program is to enable learners to develop skills in the concentration area of Advanced Integrative Practice. This graduate program also prepares learners to collaborate with other human service professionals and with the community. Graduates from this MSW program will be prepared to address the social welfare needs of a complex society. The MSW program is designed as a part- time evening program and consists of two program options: a three-year MSW program, which is designed for graduates of baccalaureate programs in any major, and an Advanced Standing MSW program, which is designed for eligible graduates of baccalaureate programs in social work or social welfare. Advanced Standing allows students to enter the advanced level of the MSW curriculum. Pursuant to the achievement of the Social Work program's mission, the MSW program has been designed as a competency-based curriculum committed to preparing graduate students for practice. As a result of their class and field education, MSW graduates should be able to:1. Understand the values and ethics of the social work profession and practice accordingly, including mindful use of self and ongoing development of professional skills and knowledge. 2.

Understand and interpret the history of social welfare and its contemporary structures and issues. 4. Apply the knowledge and skills of a generalist perspective to practice with systems of all sizes. 5. Acquire and critically apply theoretical frameworks supported by empirical evidence to understand individual development and behavior across the life span and (or) the interactions among individuals and between individuals, and families, groups, organizations, and communities. 6. Articulate the role of policy in framing social work practice, understand the impact of major social welfare policies on those who are served by social workers, workers themselves, agencies, and welfare systems, and be able to advocate for just, effective, and humane policies and policy implementation processes. 7. Understand and critically analyze current systems of social service organization and delivery and be able both to practice within them and to seek necessary organizational change 8. Engender the empowerment of diverse and disadvantaged individuals, groups, and communities through effective, culturally and linguistically appropriate assessment, treatment/intervention and outcomes evaluation 9.

Admission to the MSW program is based on academic performance and potential, clarity and appropriateness of career objectives, understanding of social issues, knowledge of diverse populations and relevant experiences. Academic credit toward the MSW is not given for previous employment or life experience. Students are admitted to the three-year MSW program for autumn quarter only, and the Advanced Standing program for winter quarter only. Prospective students should consult the Social Work website at tacoma.uw.edu/social-work for the most recent application procedures. Selection is based on academic background and potential, match of student interests with faculty expertise, program resources or priorities, social/human service experience, appropriateness of professional goals and objectives, and experience with diverse populations. All applicants must meet basic qualifications to be considered for the MSW program. Those applicants considered among the most qualified, based on the assessment of their application materials, will be offered admission. There is an enrollment limit placed on the Social Work program, and typically there is not enough space available to accommodate all applicants who meet the basic qualifications for admission. Admission is competitive. Applying to the MSW Applying to the program involves submitting application forms for the UW Tacoma Social Work program and the UW Graduate School, an application fee, one set of transcripts from every college or university attended, admissions essay, three reference letters, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and Social Service Experience form. As part of the application screening process, applicants are asked to disclose any criminal/ conviction history. Therefore, students must submit the Conviction/Criminal History form and Authorization for Repeat Checks form as well. A thorough background check is a required part of the Social Work admissions process. If offered admission, students are required to submit to a background check using an online service, Verified Credentials, currently for a fee of $58. Note: When considering individuals for admission to the program, conviction/ criminal history records are reviewed as they relate to the content and nature of the curriculum and the safety and security of clients and the public. A conviction/criminal history record does not necessarily disqualify an individual for admission.The successful completion of an approved human biology course and a statistics course with a 2.0 (\"C\") grade or higher is also required prior to beginning the MSW program. [Note: Advanced Placement (AP) credit earned in high school may not be used to satisfy these requirements.] Specific time limits apply on course work. Review the program website for a list of approved human biology courses. Documentation verifying completion must be supplied prior to matriculation. All biology courses taken outside the state of Washington must undergo a syllabus review and approval by faculty in the UW Tacoma Social Work Program. The Social Work program requires strong academic preparation demonstrated by a candidate's grade point average (GPA), liberal arts or social welfare undergraduate training, and writing skill. Applicants must have a baccalaureate degree with a minimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale for the last 90 graded quarter credits (or 60 graded semester credits). Undergraduate preparation must include at least five credits in each of the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences and 60 credits of liberal arts. In addition to these general admission requirements, Advanced Standing applicants must hold a baccalaureate degree in social work or social welfare from an American program accredited by the Council on Social Work Education and have graduated within five years of entry to the MSW program. They must also have passed all social work core courses with a minimum grade of 3.0 or have a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher in their BASW major. Current knowledge of the social work profession is assessed by the candidate's use of illustrations and examples from his or her social-service background described in the admissions essay. UW Health Sciences Immunization Program (HSIP) Requirement The University of Washington Health Sciences Center requires that its students show documentation of protection against a number of vaccine-preventable diseases. The University of Washington Seattle School of Social Work falls under the umbrella of UW Health Sciences and therefore all UW Tacoma MSW students must comply. New students admitted to the MSW Program must submit appropriate documentation within a specific timeframe. New students will be advised of specific submission deadlines upon admission. No student will be permitted to begin practicum placements unless in compliance with HSIP vaccinations. Master of Social Work200 | 2014-2015 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Graduation Requirements Along with the Graduate School requirements, students must receive a passing grade (2.7 or higher or Satisfactory/S or Credit/CR) in the professional foundation and advanced curriculum courses taken to meet the credits required for the MSW . If a student does not pass a required course, the course must be repeated. Due to the sequential nature of the courses, students may need to extend the length of their program. Another selective may be substituted for a failed selective course. Students electing to take a course on a Satisfactory/Not Satisfactory (S/NS) basis must earn at least a 2.7 grade in order to receive a grade of \"Satisfactory. \" The 75-credit MSW program allows each student to determine which courses are taken to fulfill the 18 numerically-graded required credits.
