Whenever I learn something new about herbs and how they help with a particular health issue, I feel like I'm uncovering a piece of ancient wisdom that needs to be shared with everyone I know. And then I realize, that's exactly what I'm doing. Dating back to ancient times, herbal medicine is based on the premise that plants contain natural substances that can promote health and alleviate illness. Although consistently growing in popularity, herbs aren't fully mainstream yet and there's a lot we have to learn. Or more like relearn. Consumers in the United States [spent an estimated $9.602 billion on herbal dietary supplements](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/31/2086400/0/en/US-Herbal-Supplement-Sales-Increase-by-8-6-in-2019-Record-Breaking-Sales-Predicted-for-2020.html) in 2019, an 8.6% increase in total US sales from the previous year, according to the American Botanical Council's (ABC's) 2019 Herb Market Report. What's amazing about herbs is that they've been given to us by the earth. Herbs aren't man-made, they're not formulated in a lab and they contain all-natural properties that have the potential to renew, revitalize and restore the body, mind, and soul. There's not one person who's not interested in strengthening their immune system given all of the potential health threats we're facing today. To learn more about herbs and how they can help keep us healthy, I spoke with [Dana Hutchinson](https://www.wildflowerclinic.com/thepractitioner). Dana is a registered medical herbalist with the [American Herbalist Guild](https://www.americanherbalistsguild.com). She is a recognized herbal health educator in her field and teaches a variety of herbal courses, workshops, and classes across the USA and internationally. Currently, she specializes in Western Clinical Herbalism and Traditional Chinese Medicine at her apothecary and health center, the Wildflower Clinic, in Denver, Colorado. Dana formulates customized botanical medicine, offers flower essence emotional therapy, provides alternative lifestyle recommendations, and suggests comprehensive nutritional protocols to support a variety of health ailments for each of her clients. She is dedicated to the research and ongoing development of herbal medicine and advocates for the availability of natural health care alternatives for all individuals. The immune system can make someone a little tongue-tied trying to explain exactly what it is and what it does. How would you personally describe the immune system? In general, the immune system is a beautifully complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that together help to fight infections, diseases, and harmful substances. From the Traditional Chinese Medicine perspective, the body's natural resistance against pathogens and its ability to repair itself is labeled as the vitality of the flow of energy of the system or the person's Qi (vital force). If the Qi is strong, the immune system is strong, if the Qi is weak, the immune system will likely be weak and susceptible to infection. When a bacteria, virus, or pathogen invades the body, the immune system works together to trigger an immune response to attack, multiply, and destroy the harmful materials. When we have a weak immune system, there are likely deficiencies or abnormalities in one or more of the delicate parts of the immune system (blood cells, antibodies, complement system, lymphatic system, spleen and thymus, the bone marrow, or the innate or adaptive systems) that is hindering the system from expelling the body of the pathogen. What can indicate that you have a weak immune system? There are multitudes of symptoms that can indicate a compromised or weaker immune system in an individual. Things we always look out for at the clinic include autoimmune conditions, seasonal allergies, frequent colds and infections, recurring sinus infections, UTI's, yeast infections, anemia, acne, arthritis, slow healing processes, and generalized fatigue conditions. Usual causes for a weak immune system can include eating a standard American diet, eating food intolerances (inflammatory foods), exposure to environmental toxins (EMF radiation, pollution, chemicals etc.), leaky gut syndrome, taking over the counter medications, prescriptions medications (specifically birth control, SSRI's, Immuno-suppressants, etc.), or antibiotics, chronic use of stimulants (alcohol, drugs, caffeine), genetic predisposition (c-section baby), hormonal imbalances, and emotional conditions (PTSD, grief, trauma, depression, generalized anxiety disorders). Do you suggest drinking tea to boost immunity? If so, what kind? Absolutely! As an herbalist trained in the western vitalist traditions and Chinese medicine traditions, we are huge advocates for teas! All individuals will respond differently to various herbal formulas, so of course, it's always best to see a qualified & registered herbalist in order to determine what \"immune-boosting\" herbs would be best for your constitution, health symptoms, and goals. For general recommendations, our safety class A herbs (our \"safest\" herbs with the least amount of contraindications or medication interactions) for immune boosting could include a formula with would suggest about 3 tbsp. of each bulk dried herb, infused for 30 minutes in 32 oz. of hot water, and consumed daily. We formulate custom medicinal tea infusions for our clients at the clinic, which we wildcraft every summer from the Colorado foothills. Of course with all brands of teas over the counter, you want to ensure that the herbs are organic, locally sourced, and third-party batch tested for quality. If someone starts to feel a cold coming on, are there any herbs they can take to help alleviate symptoms and shorten the duration? When someone feels the development of a cold coming on, there are many therapeutics that can significantly improve the outcome of the longevity and severity of the cold; and possibly stop the formation of the illness altogether. We recommend taking echinacea purpurea (echinacea) tincture at the beginning stages of a cold and suggest taking 3 ML of a 1:4 echinacea tincture at about a 60% extraction rate 3 times a day until the cold has resolved or stopped its formation. We also recommend an immune broth with Lentinula and Dong Chong Xia Cao, (Cordyceps). These herbs help to strengthen the Wei Qi which is located on the exterior surface of the body and the system's first defense against pathogens. Most immune-stimulating herbs are contraindicated for folks taking immunosuppressant medications. What are the best 5 herbs for immunity? The fascinating thing about herbal medicine is that each client would likely receive a different set of 5 herbs to strengthen their own unique immune system. Each person has completely different health symptoms, diagnosed conditions, genetic history, toxin exposures, lifestyle choices, and temperament constitutions that would require a very different set of herbs for their system. If I had to explain 5 herbs that I absolutely love for immunity in general they would be: Astragalus (Huang qi): This fantastic immune herb historically has been used to increase both the specific and non-specific immune systems. It helps to fortify the lungs, strengthen the wei qi, and protects against pathogenic factors. There is significant evidence that this herb can increase white blood cell production and protect against tumor formation. Reishi Mushroom (Ling zhi): This herb has long been used to tonify the blood and increase the vital force of individuals who take this regularly. This herb is renowned for rebuilding someone with a weakened immune system. This herb also increases white blood cell production, inhibits the growth of pathogens like viruses and bacteria, and also increases our production of cytokines, T-lymphocytes, and macrophages, all responsible for the balance of the immune system. Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea): This herb is well known to have positive effects on the innate and adaptive immune system. Echinacea can be used to clear toxic heat from the body like infections, fevers, and inflammations. This herb has immune-enhancing effects, is anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiviral in nature. Use caution with this herb if you have autoimmune conditions, as it can potentially trigger autoimmune flares in some individuals. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium): This herb is an herb that is used for myriads of conditions in the herbal medicine world. Used as a diaphoretic when prepared as a hot tea infusion, this herb is renowned for reducing fevers and increasing blood circulation in weaker individuals. Yarrow proves effective for treating respiratory infections and inflammatory conditions of the GI tract. This herb is a useful ally for cold and flu conditions, strengthening the individual's condition and supporting organ systems that are weakened with viral and bacterial infections. Mullein (Verbascum Thapsus): The lung herb in our materia medica books! This fluffy green herb is a go to for any inflammations in the upper respiratory tract. Used historically for coughs, bronchial asthma, and the common cold and flu. This herb specifically relaxes and open the lung's airways, allowing for smooth breathing and relief from any spastic coughing symptoms. This herb is a favorite for springtime allergy symptoms and for tonifying the lung qi when entering the winter seasons.
