Braile Chiropractic of [Marietta, Ga](http://www.mariettaga.gov/). unites with Oklahaven during the season of love, Jan. 22 through Feb. 14, to raise funds for Oklahaven with the donation of x-rays proceeds with the \"Have a Heart\" campaign coupon. With the \"Have a Heart\" coupon, new patients will save 50% off the cost of their x-rays. The 50% paid will be directly donated to Oklahaven to support chiropractic services and the dream of a drug-free and healthy lifestyle for these chronically ill children. Oklahaven's creation started when six chiropractors visualized a center where children with debilitating arthritis, paralyzed limbs, limited mobility, or other chronic illnesses could attain health with chiropractic care. Oklahaven, located in Oklahoma City, Okla., is now directed by CEO and chiropractor, Dr. Bobby Doscher. The success stories of the children who reached optimum health with chiropractic care provided by Oklahaven testify for the effectiveness of chiropractic to give back the body's natural recuperative powers. Robert, a young boy diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, was brought by his mom to Oklahaven as a last resort after rejecting the chemotherapy prescribed for her five-year-old son. His mother describes a child wracked by pain, afraid of normal touches and hugs, and constantly crying. \"Even loving hugs and tickle fights he shied away from\u2014afraid of being hurt,\" Robert's mom said. Traditional medicine failed Robert as Robert lost his appetite and was nauseous from taking anti-inflammatory medications, causing him to lose weight. Medicine after medicine was tried as doctors hopscotched through the prescriptive medicine cabinet to find relief for Robert. When chemotherapy was prescribed, worries about the lasting effects of chemotherapy on Robert's immune system drove his mom to try chiropractic for Robert on the recommendation of a friend. Robert thrived with chiropractic care, changing from a crying, frightened child to a happy boy playing on the playground with the other children. Physical and emotional differences were noted as he became confident of his new body. By high school, Robert had learned to play the piano, guitar, and saxophone, and held down a job. Robert joined the high school band at the Tournament of Roses Parade, representing Oklahoma for the state's centennial and marching six miles while playing Oklahoma over 55 times. With chiropractic care, Robert had developed from a debilitated and fearful child into a strong and talented young man.
