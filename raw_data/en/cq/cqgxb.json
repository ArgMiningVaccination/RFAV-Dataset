This tape is of particular importance for training health professionals who will be developing patient care plans for elderly patients with physical limitations, to include the hospital discharge planning team and long-term care staff. [WB 320 G3689 v.4 Video]. [VHS]. Baltimore, MD: Video Services University of Maryland; 1989. 25 minutes.
