Stage 3: Formation of crusts and scabs from the vesicles, covering the broken blister which takes several days to heal. The infection usually lasts for about 5-10 days with new spots to appear for several days. All three stages of the rash - bumps, blisters and scabbed lesions may be seen on the second day of the rash. After infection, transmission of virus can occur up to 48 hours before the rash appears until all the crusts and scabs heal. The disease is generally mild in healthy children however in severe cases, the rash can spread to cover the entire body including throat, eyes mucous membranes of the urethra, anus and vagina.

Other antiviral drugs include valacyclovir (Valtrex) and famciclovir (Famvir), which have been approved for use only in adults. Chickenpox vaccine is also recommended in some cases after exposure to the virus. Any medication containing aspirin must not be taken during chickenpox infection as this combination has been associated with a condition called Reye's syndrome.
