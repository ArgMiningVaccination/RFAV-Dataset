We focus on applying traditional herbal knowledge to create products that not only enhance your skin's natural beauty but also inspire you with the raw power of nature. We do this by using only 100% pure natural ingredients. We got our start in 1989 when Dayu Suci and Melanie Templer saw a need to retain Bali's amazing herbal knowledge and traditions. This knowledge was being quickly lost with the advent of modern products containing dangerous chemicals. As demand for traditional remedies declined, the herbs and spices used in these remedies were quickly being lost - further perpetuating the cycle. Dayu, with her extensive knowledge of traditional Balinese remedies, and Melanie, with her never ending quest to discover the wonders of the natural world, quickly rediscovered the amazing benefits of essential oils and other natural ingredients. They started making natural facial care and [natural skin care](../body-care/) remedies by hand for their loved ones. We have continued their passion today in the hope of sharing their discoveries with you and your loved ones. Tri Hita Karana Philosophy and the Natural Beauty of Nature We started small and we like it that way. We adhere to the Balinese cultural concept of [Tri Hita Karana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri_Hita_Karana), which commits us to respecting and working harmoniously with humanity, nature and the divine. As a business we understand the importance of the individual to maintain the health of the global village, so we strive to lower our impact on the environment. We do extensive research to support the local natural resource base and to enhance local farming skills in such areas as organic farming, bee farming and seaweed farming. These farming communities produce the raw materials for every natural skin care product we create. If you wouldn't cook with it, you shouldn't put it on your body. Hand-made Natural Skin Care Products At Utama Spice we take pride in being a part of every natural skin care product we sell. From picking the ingredients for our teas to mixing our own bases, everything we do is to ensure the highest quality and purest product. Our factory is more like a kitchen with our production team taking on the role of chef. Every surface is stainless steal and sterile to avoid cross contamination. Our team is highly experienced with many being part of the Utama Spice family for over ten years, and are the total embodiment of our Tri Hitra Karana philosophy. As we are still small we are able to give our products the time and care needed to create well-made hand crafted natural beauty products. We have strict procedures that ensure the products and the raw materials are checked at every stage, guaranteeing the highest standard of quality control. Passion, care, and experience are essential in every stage of our production. The end result is a product so fresh and natural you might want to eat it! At Utama Spice we know that your skin is your body's biggest organ and should be treated as such. This is why when we make our products we think of it as making food for the skin. Our People As Utama Spice has grown throughout the years so has our need to employ more team members to help nurture our development. The majority of our team is made up of young, local, independent women from the surrounding villages. Many of our team members have been with us from the beginning and have an excellent understanding of our products and of Balinese herbal techniques. With the majority of the team being below the age of 30 Utama Spice hosts an exciting and dynamic work environment encouraging comments, feedback, and ideas from all members of the team no matter their position in the Utama Spice family. We have a very flat management structure with the team leaders often standing beside their team and getting involved. This ensures that they always understand the workplace through the eyes of all team members. "}
