Members genus gram-negative, highly infective facultative intracellular et al., 1999; Sansonetti, 2001). Shigella ranks third among the most common causes of bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States, following Salmonella, and Campylobacter, respectively (Gupta, et al., 2004). Infectious diseases are the invasion of host organisms, (microbes) which can be invisible to the eyes. The microbes are also known as pathogens. A microbe infects an organism (which is known as the host of the microbe). In a human host, the microorganism causes a disease by either disrupting an important body process or by stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. The pathogen, interferes with the normal functioning of the host and can lead to chronic wounds, gangrene, loss of an infected limb, and even death. The host's response to infection is inflammation. An interaction between parasite and host, whereby the relationship is beneficial for the former but detrimental to the latter, is characterized as parasitism. The fecal transplant added the healthy bacteria that was missing, back into the gut to help kill off the invading C. difficile infection. In week 1 the patient was feeling normal and healthy. Their gut contained all of the right bacteria they were supposed to have. L. reuteri (digestive and vitamin producing bacteria), B. fragilis (helps to produce immune cells), Prevotella (provides materials needed for growth and repair in the gut, keeping the gut lining healthy), B. animalis (prevents multiplying of infectious bacteria), and E. coli (take up extra space, preventing invasion of unhealthy bacteria). In week 3, the patient was feeling very sick, with vomiting, diarrhea and developing a fever. The bacteria in their gut looked the same, except In Jay Hardy article, \"Medical Wisdom Challenged by a Cocktail\" analyzes the discovery of the real cause of gastric ulcers. Also, he talked about Marshall's struggle trying to prove his theory in an outrageous way. Most scientists thought the cause of stomach ulcers before Warren and Marshall's discovery were stress, excess acid, and eating spicy food. However, German scientists researched that a spiral-shaped bacterium inhabited that was lining of the human stomach, but they couldn't culture the organism. So, the research on stomach ulcers were forgotten. In 1981,Barry Marshall had a theory for the cause of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Scientist didn 't believed him, so he decided to drink a bacterial cocktail to prove his theory was right. Although, he became very sick and severed from nausea, Marshall took an endoscopy which revealed inflammatory signs of gastritis and the presence of H. pylori. Marshall results proved that H. Each year, 48 million food and water borne illnesses will sicken the United States inhabitants, and an additional 3,000 people will die from those illnesses. Food and water safety is crucial to the public because it directly affects people's health, and without good hygiene diseases will spread quickly. It is also important to point out that many people live in conditions where they do not have access to resources necessary for human survival, and these are the ones that need the most assistance. For many, it is due to the carelessness of food and water distributors and lack of government intervention. For example, the Flint Michigan Water Crisis, a completely preventable occurrence. Due to negligence of state regulation of water, people have The year is 1778, the place is Valley Forge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. George Washington and many other revolutionary soldiers are here. I am one of them. Valley Forge is a Winter Camp we have built to keep an eye on the British. Life here is torture. Everyday I see my friends and fellow soldiers die. I have been here eight months with only one more to go. I cannot wait to leave this god-forsaken place. But George Washington and others would like me to stay to fight for what is right. I can not stay here, for it is unbearable. There is not enough food to go around, illness and disease are spreading like wildfire, and the living conditions are horrid. Objectives: Approximately 1 of 6 people in America get sick from eating contaminated food. Some people recover and few others may suffer from complication such as kidney failure, miscarriage or brain and nerve damage (10 Colorado winnable battles). In Colorado, there is at least 41% of foodborne outbreaks report and investigation each year. This is an enormous number that underscores the need for vigilance and highlights the importance of the food safety programs to identify foodborne illnesses (10 Colorado winnable battles). Crohn 's is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease that belongs to a larger group of illnesses called inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is associated with inflammation of the digestive tract, or gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which runs from the mouth to the anus, and includes the stomach and intestines. It more commonly affects the end of the small intestine and the large intestine. In the laboratory, identification of an unknown bacterium is often necessary. In the lab, a random sample consisting of three different bacteria was selected. The sample contained one gram-positive, one gram-negative paracolon, and one gram-negative coliform. The purpose of the experiment is to identify each of the three species that the mixture contained. After receiving an unknown mixture, the sample was streaked for isolation onto TSA, blood agar, and MacConkey plates. Each plate serves as a first step to identify the unknowns. The TSA (tryptic soy agar) can be used to do a gram stain, which differentiates gram-negatives from gram-positives, based on the structural make up of the cell wall (Carson, 2015). The blood agar plate is used to test for hemolytic activity, which is useful for distinguishing gram-positives. A MacConkey plate is selective by inhibiting the growth of gram-positives and differential due to the fermentation of lactose by certain gram-negative species. The article \"Cucumbers Recalled in Salmonella Outbreak\" was written by Ashley Southall and published in the New York Times in July 2015. The public health issue is the salmonella outbreak from contaminated cucumbers. Salmonella is an issue because this bacteria cause's people to become ill and some people may even die. The Center for Disease Control found out that the cucumbers came from Mexico and they were distributed by a produce company known as Andrew&William Fresh Produce. The cucumbers were distributed to 22 states, but 18 of them reported the infections, which included Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. People were instructed to dispose or return any cucumbers that were shipped under the company's Limited Edition. With attention to diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, Crohn's disease is one of the many common cases. Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disorder that both men and woman are equally susceptible too. This disease is often confused with other gastrointestinal disorders with similar symptoms. With this disease being a part of the GI tract, there are many signs that can lead up to Crohn's. An individual with Crohn's disease could have been obtained through genetics or the environment, which could lead to many other complications that can affect the entire digestive tract. Who does not have abdominal pain during childhood? predominantly, most people have this pain correspond to an infection. Many scientist and doctors count stress, increase the acidity, lifestyle, and spicy food as main causes of gastric infection while others relate it to bacteria. The first belief was the most supposed until two Australian physicians, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren before 1982 when bacterium was discovered, proved the opposite. They built a theory based on a specific type of bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) as one of results of stomach infection and they proved it. Later, it has classified as one of the most common human pathogens infect stomach. A variety of methods for the detection of H. pylori have been described shortly after the identification of this pathogen and they have been continually improved and extended over time. Diagnostic methods for H. pylori infection are usually classified as invasive and noninvasive. The invasive tests including histology, urease tests and culture, require upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for obtaining the diagnostic sample. On the other hand, non-invasive methods include the urea breath test, serology and stool antigen test .(12) The digestive system is a system consisting of the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, gallbladder, small intestine, large intestine, the rectum and the anus. The functions of the digestive system are: In a study by Vollard A.M., \"Risk Factors for Transmission of Food-borne Illness in Restaurants and Street vendors in Jakarta, Indonesia\", the risk factors of contracting food borne diseases were affected by poor hand washing hygiene of the food handlers (street vendors), further relating to the fact that the food handlers may come in direct contact with the food by using their bare hands when handling the food, and also their low educational level which hinders them from the basic knowledge of proper personal hygiene which led to faecal contamination of drinking water, dish water and ice cube.
