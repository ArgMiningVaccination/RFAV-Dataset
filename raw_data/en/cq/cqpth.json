Lecturer and Demonstrator on the Science. Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic.. The Moral and Religious Duty of a Chiropractor. The following has been sharply criticised by a few chiropractors, but not as severely, nor by as many as was my announcement of the moving of joints by hand. A part of this criticism was based upon rival jealousy, the balance because of wrong impressions. That which was on account of a lack of information discontinued as soon as the would-be critics were well informed. I have received greater applause at the close of the following lecture from my classes than from any other. Every important chiropractic idea that I have advanced has been bitterly assailed, yet, although somewhat.discouraged at times, I have not turned from that which I knew was correct. - The Constitution of the United States declares tht \"Congress shall makelno law respecting an established religion, or prohibiting the free exercise ( thereof.\" The great state of California has granted the same privilege in its '- medical act, by declarin g in Sec. 17, \"Nor shall this act be construed so as to discriminate against . . the practice of religion.\" It was quite mind\u00ad ful and generous of those who framed the California Medical Act to coin\u00ad cide with the Constitution of the United States in not allowing the Medical Act .to conflict with the Constitution of the United States nor intr\u00ad fere with the religious duty of chiropractors, a pri'llil.ege already conferred upon them. '\"\"I1: now becomes us as chiropractors to assert our religious rights. There could be no religion witliout science and pli1losophy. Other states than California, in their laws to- regulate the practice of medicine, have been mindful of religious conscience. Kansas. \"Nothing in this act shall be construed as interfering with any religious beliefs in the treatment of disease.\" Virginia. \"This act does not . . . interfere in any way with the prac\u00ad tice of religion.\" Washington. \"This act does not apply to . . . nor interfere in any- way with the practice of religion.\" Illinois. \"Nothing in this act applies to . . . any person who admin- isters to or treats the sick or suffering by mental or spiritual means without the use of any drug or material remedy.\" The new law of 1913 of the state of California says, \"Nor shall this act be construed so as to discriminate against . . . the practice of r eligion.\" Chiropractic is a science and an art. The philosophy of chiropractic consists of the reasons given for the principles which compose the science and the movements which have to do with the art. \" I 2 THE CHIROPRACTOR Science is accepted, accumulated knowledge , systematized and formulated with reference to the existence of general facts-the operation of general laws concerning one subject. Chiropractic is the name of a classified , in\u00ad dexed, knowledge of succ-essive sense impressions of biology-the scienc<! of life-which science I created out of principles which have existed as long as the vertebrata. Scien,ce is the knowledge of knowing. Scientifi c religion embraces a sys\u00ad tematic knowledge of facts which can be verified by conscious cerebration. Knowledge is superior to faith and belief. Faith is an inward acceptance of some personal act; we believe thon is trustworthy, therefore, we have faith. Faith is a union of belief and trust. Belief is an intellectual process, the acceptance of some thing as true on other grounds than personal observation and experience. Faith implies a trust in a person. We may believe in a proposition in which no person is implied or thought of. Knowledge is knowing, we know from personal evidence. That which may be evidence to you may not be to me. That which we may accept as evidence today may not appeal to us as such tomorrow. Our belief, faith and knowledge depend upon our education. Our education depends upon our environments. Art relates to something to be done. Chiropractic art consists in the apti\u00ad tude of .adjusting displaced vertebrae, of which art I am the originator. Chiropractic philosophy is the knowledge of the phenomena .of life, as explained by the-understanding of the .principles , of the science anil art. In m:, work on the Sc:ienic:e , Art and \u00b7Philosophy of Chiropractic I .\u00b7have ,given m1 extensive .explanation of the laws of life and the nature of disease. The practice of chiropractic includes a moral obligation and a -religiou s duty. To comprehen d these \u00b7 responsibilities it is absolutely necessary that the chiropracto r \u00b7 should 'be able to understand and define chiropractic sci\u00ad enee. He must know not only the basic principle upon which it is foundd and the constitutional parts which form its scientific structure, but, also, the philosophy of the scienC'e and art of vertebral adjusting . To absorb and digest these all important and essential ideas and make them a part of one's nry being, requires a close study of The Chiropractor's Adjuster. Chiropractic deals with biology. It is the only comprehensive system which answers the time-worn question \"what is life.\" Scientific chiropractors are versed in the principles of chiropractic. They live according to its rules. They philosophize on the art of relieving abnor\u00ad mal conditions by adjusting displaced bones. As Educated Intelligences, they relieve undue pressure on nerves in order that Innate may transmit and receive impulses to and from the various parts of the body in a normal man\u00ad ner. They desire to understand the nature of our physical existence an<l -assignnatural causes for both normal and abnormal functions. As a science chiropracti c explains local and general death to be but the result of law, a step on the road of eternal prog-ression; that any deviation from tone, the basis of chiropractic, is disease. The Moral and Religiou, Duty of a Chiropractor 3 As a philosophy it is the science of all s,ciences. It deals with subjec\u00ad tive, ethical religion-the science which treats of the existence, character and aUributes \u00b7of God, \u00b7the All-perva ding Universal Intelligence. Its possibili- ties will become unlimited, when Hi l;s-iria our -cfutie\u00b7s -as a segmented, r,ersonified, portion thereof, are scientifically understood . It will lessen dis-,. ;:_se, poverty and crime, e our jails, penitentiaries and in!a.lJt_!!YI and ) as$iSt us to prepare for the existence beyond the transition call.c.d death. It ex'iiiiiru why all persons al'e-lffifequal;\u00b7meniail y. ;d physially; or: if born i1like, why some become superior or inferior to others similarly situated, why certain individuals are not able to express themselves as intelligently as others, why some persons are not mentally and physically alike at all times 1 To make clear this difference I will give a case and its termination under chiropractic adjusting. Ed., seventeen years of age, was hemipleg ic in the left half of his bbdy since birth. He had not uttered a word that was under\u00ad stood by his parents or friends. Mentally he was that of a child three years of age. Six weeks of chiropractic adjusting caused the distorted sixth dorsal articulation to become normal in shape and to occupy its normal posi\u00ad tion, releasing a stretched condition on the sixth pair of dorsal nerves, creating :i normal tension of nerves and muscles, the usual force to impulses, arousing the normal amount of energy, consequently, the no al expression of ideas. In six weeks Ed's mentality and language was that of others o e age and environments.\u00b7 .Conation (desire and volition )was equal to. those of cogni\u00ad tion and feeling. He became subject to the law of duty, capabie-of acting through his moral sense of right-he was a moral agent... He was, alike, intellectual in each of the three great divisions of the mind. I had . per\u00ad formed a moral duty, as well as a religious dutt:., It points oat the condi\u00ad tions upon which both health ana disease depend. It-explains why md how one person becomes affected with disease while his .. associate or neighobr, apparently living under the same conditions, remains well Furthermore; it makes plain the reason why one, or more, of the bodily functions are per\u00ad formed in an excessive or in a deficient degree of frequency or intensity, dther of which condition is a form of disease. When Educated and Innate Intelligences are able to converse with each other, (a possibility which not a very distant future may disclose), we shall be able to make a correct diagnosis. Heretofore, these two intelligences .... have misunderstood ea.ch other concerning the laws which govern life. \\llv'hen the science of biology is correctly understood the span of life will be more than doubled. Chiropractic has pulled aside the curtain of ignorance which obscured the cause of disease; in time it will lift the veil of superstition which has obstructed our vision of the great beyond. In time,\u00b7 spiritual existence-wili 'be as well known and comprehended as that of the physical world. Chiropractic science in,cludes -biology-the science of lifein this world, and the recognition of a spiritual existence in the next. The principles which 4 THE CHIROPRACTOR ( compose it are substantive in their independence and incentive to human and spiritual progre5s. They originat in Divinity, the Universal Intelli\u00ad gence, and constitute the essential qualities of life which, having begun in this world, are never ending. It _i tional, scientific, religious _:Y o<:_!.at_}ts pra.c=tice, beuef and knowlege with that of religion. It imparts instruction relating Doth to this world and the one to come. upreme spiritual existence can only be obtained, through earthly experience. Chiropract ic sheds enlightenment -upon physical life and spiritual existence, the latter being only a continua\u00ad lion of the former. Chiropractic literature makes use of such techniical terms as are calculated to enlighten mankind in regard to the Universal Intelligence which the Chris\u00ad tian world has seen fit to acknowledge as God. It enables its disciples to recognize the above facts, and teaches them how to adjust their lives ac- cordingly . The casual thinker is obliged to admit that the universe is composed of intelligence and matter; that the latter is neither intelligent nor creative, while the former is omnipresent, filling all space; that this creative intelli\u00ad gence uses material substance for expression, and that life is the direct re\u00ad sult of this intelligence seeking advancement toward perfection by the use of visiblef corporea l organisms. Manis a dual enth:i, 'composed of intelligence and matter, spirit and material, the immortal and mortal, the everlasting. ad the transient. 'The manifestation of such an existence is intelligent action. Chiropractors, especially , are aiding in this great advancement by ad\u00ad justing the osseous structure, the position of which has to do with determin\u00ad ing normal and abnormal tension, for in whatever part function is abnormally performed tonicity is either lacking or excessive -Creative Intelligence is prevented from expressin g itself normally. Many a child has been injured at birth by a vertebral displacemen t which caused an impingement upon one or more of the spinal nerves, as they emanate from tlie spinal canal, the fibers of which are distributed to certain organs. \\ The result of this excessive ten- sion is physical or mental debility, often both, which, fro _ m a lack of c.al knowledge, may be lifelong; t_h m\u00ab:.ntal defect _tediri\\ even into the next, world ;. For we retain only that which bas been acquire3 unng in1s earthly, \"ireparatory exi tence. By neuroskeleton, these unfor\u00ad unates m e enab ed to acquire sufficient knowledge, rightfull y due them, to become useful members of society and enjoy life in this world and the one to come. The chiropractor who can accomplish the above desirable results .ind refuses to do so, as a religious duty, should be compelled to perform it as a moral obligation. Frank, a young man, twenty-one years of age, was brought to me for correction. Physically, he was a cripple in upper and lower limbs. His case was considered one of cerebral disease, an imbecile. An M. D. would The Moral and Religious Duty of a Chiropractor ay, his diseased condition wasongenital, acquired at the moment of birth,_ but, to a chiropractor it was acquired; in fact, all diseases are acquired, have their causes, whether before or after birth. In-this case it was- because of theith dorsal vertebra being displacd at birth. By daily adjusting the verteora whichh-ad become abnormally shaped, was grown to the normal ;md placed in the usul!J positio11, thereby enabling the- spiritto-perforlli it desired avocation of creating a normal physical and the accumulating of normal ideas which will last throughout eternity. By so doing I was per\u00ad forming a service, a duty, I assumed when I accepted the trust bestowed upon me. By so doing I was not only performing a normal obligation, but, ;.lso, a (subjective) religious duty. I hold it to be self-evident that all men and women who have acquired rnfficient knowledge and skill to remove the ne'rve tension which prevents phy\u00ad sical, mental anci' spiritual develop ment, are engage<l in a work of a higher an_ tha t_ ordina_rily equired of, and performed by, the physician They are practically the moral duties, and._ahligations gj religion and any attempt to prevent such acts by law is an unmitigated crime against humanity. Chiropractic science, its art and philosophy, deal with htiman and spiri\u00ad tual phenomena. The conscientious reverent acknqwle<lgement of the phenomena, in--ntiment and act, connects the spiritual with the physical, and constitutes in its fullest and highest sense a religion. The knowledge and pbilosop y given me by Dr. Jim Atkinson, an in\u00ad telligent spiritual being, together with explana tions of phenomena, principles resolved from causes, effects, powers, laws and utility, appealed to my reason. The method by which I obtained an explanation of certain physical phenomena , from an intelligence in the spiritual world,_ is' known in biblical language as ins-piration . In a great measure The Chiropractor's A r was written unh spiritual promptings, The object of a chiropracti c education is the attainment of information concerning the origin, development, structure, and functions of our physical organism, the phenomena of physical earth-life and that of spiritual existence . These are acquired by observation and demonstration. Chiropr actors declare ' that God is the II-pervading lntellige-ncc, that each individual, segmented -rit is ;-partof that 1iitelhgent creative principle; that only mat\u00ad ter changes its form; that spirit modifies its environment, and dissolution is but a process of reproduction. Chiropractic science cluci<lates the problems of life, gives us the incentive to human endeavor and the agen,cy by which sin, the violation, willfully or accidentall y, of moral or natural laws, may be eradicated by appropriate adjustment of the neuroskeleton. The cumulative function pertains to intellectual growth, whether sane or insane. As we retain our mentalities and carry with us to the great beyond only that which we mentally gather, it is necessary, in fact, i\\_ is a religious duty, to so care for our physical beings that our intellectual attainment may be of the very best. 6 THE CHIROPRACTOR. The philosophy of chiropracti c teaches the Universality of Intelligence / and that its aim is always onward and upward toward perfeiction. This truth l.makes the practice of chiropracti c a moral and a religious duty both in theory and in fact. Religion may be objective in its character. As a cult it consists of the rites and ceremonies pertaining to the worship 10f a Deity, and only known by external , devotion al acts of reverence. Subjective religion includes the moral and religious duty, the inner intellectual feeling, the science which treats of the existenc e, character and attribute\u00b7s of God and His laws re\u00ad garding our duty toward Him. The former is that of theolog y; it includes the peculiar modes of divine worship which belong to and make the special distinction of tribes, nations and communities. The latter is ethical religion and deals only with positives, existing phenomena , properties which are knowable , together with their invariable relations of co-existen ce and suc\u00ad cession. A belief in magic, the assistance of secret forces in nature, consti\u00ad tutes the essential of objective religion. The supernormal, the mysterious potency hidden from the understanding, the supernatural, the occult secret power, is the original, the basic element, the morbid outgrowth of subjective 1:eligion. Chiropractors deal only with moral obligations and subjective, ethi- cal religion. I do not propose to change chiropractic, either . in its science, art or philosophy, into a religion. The moral and religious duty of a chiropractor are not synonom' with the scienct art and phiiophy of chiropractic. There is a vast difference between \u00b7 a th_eological _ iriigibn -\u00b7 and a religiou s duty; \u00b7between the precepts and practices of religion and that of chiropractic. A person may be a conscientious devotee of any theological creed and yet be a strict, upright, exalted principled practitioner of chiropractic.CChiro Religio, Chiropractic Religion, the Religion of Chirpractic \u00b7 and the Religious Duty of\u00b7a Chiropractor are one and the same. Willard Carver, D. C., asks, \"Do you believe it wise to denominate chiro\u00ad practic as a religion?\" This question is equal to askin a physician, Do you believe it wise to denominate medicine (not the practice) as a religion? Webster' s Dictionary, latest edition, date 1910, gives near the bottom of page 1801, fifth column, the Latin phrase, religio medici, meaning, a physician's religion. Has not a chiropractor as much right to a religion as a practitione r of medicine? Is not chiro religio as consistent and comprehensible as religio medici? \"Do you believe it wise to denominate chiropractic as a religion?\" To denominate is to name, designate, specify or characterize. Wherein have I expressed a desire to RE-name the science, art and philosophy of chiropractic? In what sentence have I designated chiropractic by any other I distinctive title than that by whicii7fTs now known? ln what art a11a philosophy of chiropractic is one thing: the moral and religious duty ot The Moral and Religious Duty of a Chiropractor 7 a chiropractor is a different proposition. The founder, the fountain head, the creator, the originator, the developer, the one who named the science, art and 1,hilosophy of vertebral adjusting, says emphatically, it is not wise to denomi\u00ad nate chiropractic by any other name or title than the one by which it is known the world over. P. W. Carlin, D. C., writes me, \"The Religion of Chiropractic is absurd\" I fully agree with Dr. Carlin. To say or think that the science, the art, or the philosophy of chiropractic, or that chiropractic, the three combined, has a religion, is really absurd and ridiculous. He also says, \"All religions are more or less based upon superstition. Thefe is nothing superstitious about chiropractic.\" He is right. All methods of treating diseases, as well as all forms of religion, are based upon superstition. Chiropractic as a science, as an art and the philosophy 'thereof, also, the moral and religious duty of chiropractors, are free of superstition, they are based upon the knowledge of principles and facts. There 1s the moral and religious scien,ce of chiropractic, the moral and religious philosophy of chiropractic, the moral and religious responsibilit y attached to the practice of chiropracti c, the moral and religious liberty granted to chiropractors by the Constitution of the United States; also, the moral theology of chiropractic, known in the California Medical Act as .religion. Morally, cbiroptactors are in duty bound to help humanity physically. Religiously, they are required to render spiritual service toward God, the Universal Intelligence, by relieving mankind of their fetters, adjusting the tension-frame of the nenous system, the physical lines of communica tion to\u00ad .ind from the sp!.tit, By so doing they greatly ai \u00b7intellectual attainment 'Ind progress toward perfection through the untrammeled, mental reception of intelligent expressions of individual spirits. By correcting the skeletal frame the spirit is permitted to assume normal control, and produce normal expres\u00ad sion. The importance of bone-pressure on nerves as a disease producer (viola\u00ad tion qf publi_qr_divine law, the result of morbid conditions), is receiving attention by physicians. --- \u00b7- -------- .. \u00b7 The Los Angeles Times of May 25, 1911, gives a case of kleptomania wherein the knife was a-sed to remove bone-press ure on nerves which were supposed to cause \"crimina-ns ities.\" The \"pretty 22-year-old woman, an un,controllable one year in prison for shop\u00ad lifting.\" The physicians considered her case \"one of disease rather than of crime.\" A month after the operation \"a thorough revolution had taken place in her mental faculties. Her change for the good is going to be just as strongly pronounced as was her bent for the bad.\" ,. PASADENA, March 30.-Mrs. Jean Thurner of No. 315 West Avenue 8 THE CHIROPRACTOR SO, Los Angeles, who attained almost world-wide fame two years ago when she \u00b5nderwent an operation for kleptomania at the American Hospital in Berkeley, at the hands of Dr. Herbert Rowell, who removed a piece of skull as large as a dollar from the top of the head, on the right side, was arrested at her home yesterday morning at the instigation of Detective Charles Betts, charged with the theft of diamonds and rings valued at $581 from three Pasadena jewelry stores. Instead of using the knife and drugs, chiropractors substitut e hand\u00ad adjustment of the displaced portion of the neurosk eleton which presses upon or against some p\u00b7ortion of the nervous system, which injures, instead of protecting, the filamentous bands of nervous tissue that connect the parts of the nerv-0us \u00b7system with each other and transmit impulses to the various organs of the body. The principles which form chiropractic science have always existed; and are now being revealed to the world by D. D. Palmer, through the Chiro\u00ad practor's Adjuster. This revelation of the science, art and philosophy was ven by one who tells me that he is indebted to those who are farther ad\u00ad vanced in the knowledge of physical and spiritual phenomena than he is. Thr-0ugh and by these dis-roveri es chiropractors are able to relieve diseases which heretofore were pronounced by the medical profession as incurable. Thousands of cases of this kind can be cited. I created a science out of the principles reualed to me and named it chiropractic. I correlated the art of adjusting displaced vertebrae together with the philosophy of the science and' art. That these revelations were not made along the lines of medical and theological investigations is not strange when we consider that very few great discoveries have been made by those\u00b7 wh-0 were expecting results in certain smoothly worn grooves of stereo\u00ad typed education. It is not surprising that those who have given to the world its greatest and grandest thoughts have been, more or less, connected with those who had passed into the spiritual existence. Chiropractic gives relief to, and opens up a haven for, those who arc ailing, making them physically, mentally an<I spiritually invigorated and whole. This noble work results in the direct salvation of countles s numbers of mental and physical wrecks; for, the consequences of their disabilities do not stop at the grave, but continue on and on into the eternal spiritual xistcnce. An author on chiropractic states: \"The special philosophy which he has worked out assigned as the foundation.\" Philosophy , special or general, ls not the foundation upon which I built the science of chiropractic. Its science is based on tone. Tone is the standard from which we note the variations of structure;-Teinper.lure, tonicity, elasticity, renitency and tens_i<>nl . .U is the standard of lieaith; any deviation therefrom is disease. Tone is the 1BASIC PRINCIPLE, the one from which all other principles, which compose the science, have sprung. The Moral and Religious Duty of a Chiropractor 9 Chiropra,ctic is a scicni:c. The art of adjustin g is the systematic, skillful application of chiropractic principles. Much study and correct reasoning upon the laws which constitute this science have developed its philosophy . The foundation of chiropractic does not consist of its philosophy, nor of the art of adjusting. I discovered the principl es of whi,c,h chiropractic sci\u00ad <!nce is constituted. By skill, dirct,d by the knowledge of the science and its philosophy, I originated the art \u00b7of adjusting. A knowledge of the science, art and philosoph y of chiropractic contain a moral and a religiou s duty; morally , it serves as our basis of humane action according to our reason and judgment c<oncerning our physi,ca l welfare; religiously, it governs our motives of divine duty with respect to the advancement -of our spiritual existence throughout eternity. Its principles embrace the faith, belief, prac\u00ad tice, obligations and conduct of our lives toward God and man. Those who have a knowledg e of, or a belief in, a future state of exist\u00ad ence, regardle5s of church or nerd, can become believers in and practi-) tioners of, the religion OF chiropractors. That which I named Innate (born with) is a segmnt of that Intelligence which fills the universe. This universal, All Wise, is metamerized, divided into metameres as needed by each individualized being. This somatome of the whole never sleeps, nor tires, recognizes neither darkness or distance, is not subject to material laws, bodily wants are nbt essential, substantial conditions are not needed for its existence. It continues to care for and direct the organic functions of the body as long as the soul holds body and spirit together. Physicians deal with the phyf.ical only; chiropractors with both the physical and the spiritual. Psycological investigation reveals the fact that the spirit of man is a part of the All Wise Spirit, the Great Creator, and as such possess'es in an infinitesimal degree all the potentialities of omniscience and omnipotence existing in God, just as one drop of the ocean con'tains, in minature, all the qualities of the briny deep as a whole. There are those who think the spirit of man has an abiding place in the solar plexus ,or in the spinal column, or in the medulla oblongata, or in the cerebellum, or in the cerebrum, or at least in some portion of the encephalon, but just what part or how much space occupied has not been determined. The spirit holds the same relation to the body as God, the All Wise Intelligence does to the Universe. If you can locate the one, you can desig\u00ad nate the location and define the limits of the other. God is indwelling in the universe, everywhere present; He occupies every part thereof; likewise , the spirit permeates every portion of the body in which it dwells. God does not depend upon the universe for His existence, neither does the spirit rely upon the body for its continued manifestations. Although the surgeon cannot locate or dissect the spirit, that which ere ates intelligent action, yet we are conscious of this vita1 entity. . I The Moral and RcligioUJ Duty of a Chiropractor II The spiritual and the physical are counterparts of each other, duplicates in form, shape, size and color. The evidence given by seers of every nation in all ages has been that a likeness exists between the creator and the created. Locating the spirit in the brain, the encephalon, the mass of nervous matter containe d within the brain-ca se, is circumscribed and yet not definite. The nervous mass within the cranium includes the two hemispheres of the lrrebrum, the three divisions of the cerebellum, the pons varolii and medulla oblongata. Morphologically, these seven divisions of the encephalon arc derived from the fore brain, the mid brain, the hind brain and the end brain . The muscular, vascular and nervous systems permeate every avenue throughout the body. The conscious, characteristic actions of personified \u00b7 intelltgen ce are performed through the nervous filaments of the body in which the spirit tabernacles. The spiritual inte1ligence controls uninte1ligent matter through the nerv\u00ad ous system. Each and every portion of the body is permeated by the spirit ,md its means of communication. All functional acts are performed by the involuntary nerves; they direct organic life. The voluntary are those under the control of the human will, they look after the environments, that which supports and constitutes animal life. There are two series of ganglia (nerve centers) lying along each side and to the front of the vertebral column, reaching from the occiput to the coccyx, fibers of which extend into the cranial, the thoracic, the abdominal and the pelvic cavities; these communicating nerve branches connect the vertebral chains to the various organs, vessels and viscera. There are 144, or more, nerve centers, sympathetic nerve ganglia, desig\u00ad nated by physiologists as so many brains differing in size, color,. texture, functions, location, and more especially in the impulses received and dis- tributed. The controlling intelligence is everywhere present, manifesting through the nervous system its desires for advancement, making use of these nerve centers as receiving and distributing stations. The founder of chiropractic has located the spirit in man, found its abid\u00ad ing place to be throughout the entire body, a position from which each and every nerve ganglia may be used for receiving and forwarding impulses. Therefore, ina:1!1uc_as -Jig!t_tJi.fc was_ revt!_!! _t.Q m in the world, and as7ffll' pnys1c-al health and the inte1fecfual progress of thepersonified portion of the Universal Intelligence depend upon the proper alignment of the skeletal frame, I feel it my right and bounden duty to replace any displaced portion thereof, so that our physical and spiritual faculties may be fully and normall y expressed, thereby not only enhancing our present condition, but making ourselves the better prepared to enter the next stage of existenc to which this earthly existence is but a preliminar y, a preparatory step. IO THE CHIROPRACTOR nowledge of, or a belief in, the continuity of life has a tendency to uplift humanity, to make of man a desirable neighbor, a good citizen, a moral upright being and a practical understanding of right and wrong. Innate is embodied as a personified part of Universal Intelligence , therefore, \u00ab>-eterna l with the all-creative force. This indwellinlf portion of the Eternal is in our care for improvement. The intellectual expansion of Innate is in proportion to he normal transmissio n of impulses over the nervous system; for this reason the body functions should \u00b7be kept in the condition \u00b7of tone. Communication with the \u00b7Eternal Spirit, the Creator, is the goal of all religions. There is no living religion without a doctrine; a doctrine , however elaborate, does not constitute a religion. The doctrine of our principles, faith and knowledge, are as follows: I believe, in fact know, that the universe consists of Intelligenc e and Matter. This intelligence is known to the ,Christian world as God. As a spiritual intelligence it finds expression through the animal and vegetable creation, man being the highest manifestat ion. I believe that this Intelli\u00ad gence is segmented into as many parts as there are individual expressions of life; that spirit, whether considered as a whole or individually, is advanc ing upward and onward toward perfection; that in all animated nature this Intelligence is expressed through the nenous system, which is the means of communication to and from individualized spirit; that the eondition known as 110NE is. tiie.'tension and firmness, the renitency -and elasticity of tissue in a state of health, normal existence; that the mental and physical condition known as disease is a disordered state because of an unusual C>Unt of tension above or below that of tone; that normal and abnormal amounts of strain or laxity are due to the position of the osseo\u00b5s frame\u00ad work, the neuroskeleton, which not only serves as a protector to the nnous system, but, also, as a reg11lator of tension; that Universa l In\u00ad telligence, the Spirit as a whole or in its segmente4 parts, is eternal in its existence; that physiological disintegration and somatic death are changes of the material only; that the present and future make-up of individualized spirits depend upon the cumulative mental function which. lilte all other functions, is modified by the structural condition of the im\u00ad pulsive, transmitting, nenous system; that criminality is but the result of abnormal nenous tension; that our individualized, segmented spiritual entities carry with them into the future spiritual \u00b7state that which bas been mentally accumulate d during our physical existence: that spiritual existence, like the physical, is progressive; that a corroct understanding of the-se principles and the practice of them constitute the religion of chiro\u00ad practic; that the existence and personal identity of individualized intelli\u00ad gences continue After the change known as death; that life in this world and the next is continuoune of eternal progresaion. \"There is a natural body, and thcre..i.L a miritual..ho.dy.\" 1 Cor. iv:44. 12 THE CHIROPRACTOR By correcting these displacemen ts of osseous tissue, the tension frame of the nervous system, I claim that I am rendering obedience, adoration and honor to the All-Wise Spiritual Intelligence, as well as a service to the se-gmented, -Tncfiv-i<Iiial portions thereof- a duty I owe to both God and mankind, In a-ccordance with this aim and end, the Constitu tion of the United States and the statutes personal of Californi a confer upon me and all persons of chiropractic faith the inalienable right to practice our religion without restraint or hindrance. Chiropractic a Science, an Art and the Philosophy Thereof. It has been sa.id that science is a stranger to and nowise accounts for the peculiar contents of the book of life. Medical men have never been able to harmonize the science of medi cine with organic functions in health and disease. Science is the registered mental account of our surroundings; it is common sense-we desire to know things as they are. _Chiropractic embraces the science of life, the knowledge of bow organisms act in health and disease, also the art of adjusting the neuro- '1keleton. An organism is an organized body, such is known as the living econ\u00ad omy, the regulation of the parts of an organic whole, the aggregate of the parts and laws governing an organism. Ecology, \u00b7or bionomics, is that branch of biology which deals with the mutual relations between organisms and their environment, the e:ffect which our surroundings has upon life, the modification of vital actions which ar directed\u00b7 by an in\u00ad telligence. Bionomic forces are those external forces 1 other than vital forces, which influence the changes incident to the development of life. Bionomy is the laws of life; the science which treats of laws regulating the vital functions. Biologas is the living and intelligent power dis\u00ad played in organic activities. Bionergy is the life-force, the force exer\u00ad cised in living organisms. An organism is any individual animal or plant. Any living being is an organism . The collective parts which compose an organized body, together with the laws' :which govern iheir action constitutes an organism. An individual so constituted that it may carry on the activities of life by means of its organs, -which, although di:ffering in functin, yet are mutually dependent upon each other for their individual acts is an organism. An organized body endowed with a separate existence, whose vital acts depend upon the ag\u00ad gregation of organs, constitutes an organism. The science of chiropractic has lead to the creation of the art of vertebral adjusting. The philosophy of chiropractic (the science and the art) consists of the reasons for the principles which have lead up to and the wherefore of vertebral adjusting. Science refers to that which is to be known; art to that which is to be done; philosophy gives the reasons why of the method and the way in which it is to be performed. A science is composed of principles which coincide with mental and physical facts. I have systematiz ed the principles of biology, thereby 13 14 THE CHIROPRACTOR creating a science. The theory of chiropractic embraces the speculative principles upon which the art of vertebral adjusting is based. The study of chiropra ctic includes the considera tion of the three divisions, viz., the 1cience, art and the philosophy of the two just mentioned. Chiropractic to be a science must be specific. In order to be scientific it must contain the knowledge of the principles and facts of biology reduced to an unvarying law and embodied into a system. Where science ends faith begins. To know the science of chiropractic ie to have a knowledge of the principles which compose it. The ability to put that knowledge into practice is chiropractic art. Knowledge embraces all that we know from whatever source derived or obtained, or by whatever process acquired; it is the aggregate of facts, truths and principles obtained and retained by the mind or spirit through reason, objective perception, derived from the use of the external senses, or of intuition, subjective immediate knowing of the inner ani mating intelligence. Beyond the region of knowledge is that of nescience, laek of 1mowl\u00ad edge, a deficiency of knowableness. Science is founded upon faetB, while nescience decreases as knowledge increases, the unknowable is diminished. The principles of chiropractic science were not developed or evolved from any other method; they were discovered as pre-existing element. and formulated into a_ system. The principles which compose the science of chiroprac tic are as old as the vertebrata. To know chiropractic as a science, we must become familiar with ita principles, we must make it scientific. To know it as an art is to make it apecific, make use of the knowledge which compose s the science. A chiropractor is one who has a knowledge of the science and art of chiropractic, one who is capable of performing the art of adjusting verte\u00ad brae; he should, also, comprehend the philosophy of the science and art, the reasons for so doing. Seience is the know-how; the art is the doing; the philosophy con\u00ad sists in the reasons why of phenomena, as ei:plained by a knowledge of the powers and laws which govern them. The science of chiropractic embraces the principles and demon\u00ad atrated facts of biology. The science of dynamics includes the principles and facts of ma\u00ad chinery. The science of chiropractic and that of machinery have no resem\u00ad blance whatever, in their motive force. That being a fact, why try to illustrate either one by the principles belonging to the othert Just as well try to ei:plain the science of grammar by that of astronomy; geography by mathematics; chemistry by agriculture; or that of music by navigation. Man is not a machine. ( Chiropractic a Science, an Art and the Philosophy Thereof I 5 The science of chiroprac tic is in no way related to the science of machinery. Its phenomen a are dependent upon vital force, not that of dynamics._ - - - -The structure of the body is defined under that of anatomy, not metalography-a treatise on metals. Bodily functions depend upon vital force, not dynamics. The exist\u00ad ence of metals, whether in the form lne ry or that of ore, depends upon certain inanimate qualities, whereas the existence of animals depends upon functions. Vital philosophy and mechanical philosophy are not correlated, they are radically and entirely different. The laws which govern the existence of animated beings and that of animated obJ,cts differ. C hiropractic science is being enlarged and urged on to a higher development by the demands of the art' of vertebral adjusting. Why not make use of the knowledge which composes the\u00b7 sciencef In chiropractic, you should discriminate between science and art. Science depends upon principles, and art upon practice. The theories of chiropractic become demonstratejl facts, the practice an art. Biology and chiropractic include vital phenomena in contradistinc tion . to physical tacts; those fuJlctions, energies and acts that depend upon lite, as manifested by contrast to those which exist without intel Hgence. A prgminent writer aims to make a record in chiropractic by affirm ing that he is the author, formulator and constructor of the science of chiropractic; that the essence (the essential principles) is love, patince, perseverance, truth and equality; that these principles constitute its highest standard, wonderful bea,uty and simplicity. Love, patience, per\u00adseverance, truth and equality as principles belong to the Sunday School or the lodge room of some benevolent organization; as :five principles they are not found among the 500 which the founder of chiropractic uses to compose its science. - Why not learn chiropractic as a sciencet Why not be apeciflc in adjustingt Why not learn the specific cause of tYph0id fever, acquire the knowledge of why, how and where adjust for itf Why not compre\u00ad hend the how and the why organs and parts of the body are affected by displaced vertebraet Why not know that hemiplegia is because of the displacement of the,aixth dorsal vertebra, that one-hair of the body may be affected by the :fibers of that nerv Why not become acquainted with the proper method of adjusting that vertebra t Why not learn of the two ganglionic chains of the sympathetic nervous system which reach from the occiput to the coccyx, its plexus of nerves extenc\\ing into the cranium, the fibers of which unite with the cranial nerves, and that these 16 THE CHIROPRACTOR vertebral cords are distributing agencies of organic life, reaching to all the viscera f Why not learn that the neuroskeleton is a protector of the central nervous system, and that when any portion thereof is displaced it is a disturber of vibration, heat and other functions f Why not learn to use the vertebral processes as levers to replac vertebraef Science is knowledge, ascertained facts, accumulated, systematized information regarding causes and principles.

P. Bailey of Los Angeles, Cal. He says in part, \"Lucky, indeed, shall we be if ever we succeed in throwing a gleam of light upon the modus operandi with which sense\u00ad impressions are communicated to the intellect, and transformed into thought or consciousness. The marvel does not exist in our having eyes and ears, but in our being able to see and hear. Explain this and perhaps you explain e\\\u00b7erything else that has hitherto puzzled our benighted understandii;ig. '' And yet the whole mystery may admit of an splanation so simple that, when discovered, it will occasion universal surprise why nobody thought of it before.'' NEB.VE VIBRATION. Nerve vibration is associated with consciousness. Without it there would be no sensational intelligence, 110 activity which we recognize aa life. The phenomena of sound is produced by vibrations of the atmosphere. The vibrations impinge against the tympanum and continue inward over the acoustic, or auditory nerve. The tension of the tympanic membrane is not fixed as are stationary membranes; it is as well adapted for the reception of one vibration as another. In the absence of vibration a condition of relaxation exists. Our knowledge of ,unlimited variations of B,Ound is recognized by the infinite diversity of nerve vibrations. Con\u00ad sciousness is determined by and must accord with\u00b7 acoustic vibrations. Thought transference by speech is accomplished by and through the medium of atmospheric vibration. We recognize the volume and quan\u00ad tity of vibration focussed by the external ear and conducted to the acoustic nerve. The principles ivolved in the telephone and the ear are very similar; the phenomena of each are controlled by the same law. We recognize individual voices because of the difference in the vibrator] movements. This is true wlietlier conducted by the telephone wire or the atmosphere. We recognize the faces of individuals because of their dissimilarity, thus it is with voices. Faces and voices may be 110 di torted as to be unrecognizable. The combining of many voices, or that of many musical instruments, are blended into one vibration. Each in\u00ad strument, or any combination of instruments, are presented and recog\u00b7 nized by its peculiar vibration. The molecules of the atmosphere and those of the wire of the telephone transmit the vibratory movement. The diaphragm and the wire of the telephone perform the same office as 17 18 THE CHIROPRACTOR does the tympanu m and the auditory nerve of the ear. The vibration! of the transmitting diaphragm are carried over the connecting wire, while those of the ear are vibrated over the cochlear and vestibular the two which form the auditory nerve, the eighth cranial. -Nerve vibrations create consciou sness. The vibrations of the atmosphere are impinged against the tympanum of the ear, transferred to the auditory nerve, and we recognize those vibratory movements. The disagreea ble popping of gas engines may be rendered noiseless by a set of discs so arranged as to deflect the vibrations causing them to whirl similar to the water in an eddy. Echo, a repetition of a sound. The reiteration is the oscillating waves of the atmosphere reflected. The energy expended in the rebound is sooner or later lost. A stick of timber fifty feet long, more or Jess, is struck at one end, the vibratory movement of the molecules are transmitted from the end struck to all portions, even to every atom. The particles of a tuning fork vibrate when struck. Its vibration is determined by the force of the stroke. Not only the particles of the furk vibrate-but tne prongs moveina wave-like motion. This double movement of the atoms may be likened to waves of water which consist of an enormous amount of molecules, the drops of which move freely wit.h each other, a good illustration of molecular oscillation. The vibrations of the tuning fork are communicated to the atmosphere, impinge\u00b7against the (. tympanum of the ear, the mucous membrane is well supplied with the tympanum plexus of the glossopharyngeal nerve; these vibrations con\u00ad tinue the auditory nerve, :ire recognized by consciousness. The tun\u00ad ing fork is used to tone instruments. to get the pitch. Pit.ch is the rate of vibration. The vibrations of the voice is made to harmonize with tnose of the tuning fork. I have just said that there are two separate and distinctl y different movements of the atoms or molecules of substances. The movement of one atom against another, or others, for it touches all those which sur\u00ad round it, creates heat. The movement of a great number of these body atoms create within us ronsciousness. Gould's Dictionary says, '' Temperature, the degree of intensity of heat or molecular vibration.'' Heat is a form of energy, this energy is created by mo_tion. It is manifested in the effects of fire, the sun's rays and friction. The mole\u00ad cules (the smallest known particles of matter which move about as a whole) of all matter vibrate , that is, move to and fro, in a similar manner as the pendulum of a clock, or the balance wheel of a watch which vibrates four times in a second. The various degrees of temperature of iron are due to the amount of movement of the molecules of which it is composed. The varying temperatur e between that of 70 degrees and zero are due to molecular change (vibration) of its atoms. Energy NERVE VIBRATION 19 traveling in the form of radiation is sometimes called radiant heat. Radiation, however, is not heat, it is the kinetic energy of vibrations of ether. By an increase or decrease in the movement of its particles the color and temperatu re are modified. The color of iron may be changed from black to that of red. By still increasing the movement of its particles the red color may be changed to that of white, and, by a yet greater agitation of its atoms the color becomes blue. The greater the vibration, the more actiYe the molecules, the greater the heat. When a resonant bar of metal is struck, made to respond to a cer tain amount of vibration, waves rush through the substance which are unlike in character to those vibrations going on all the time among the molecules. The molecular vibration of nerve tissue and wave motion differ in that the former is tu\" movement of particles and the latter is r,f the whoIJ. The particles of all matter are always in a state of vibration. If inanimate matter changes its temperature according to the amount of its atomic vibration, why not living tissue! That the amount of nerve\u00ad tension determines the quantit y of heat is a demonstrated fact. Bodily temperature may increase after death and run as high as 106 or even to 108 degrees. The heat of the body, whether normal temperatnre, inflam\u00ad mation or fever is a fnnction of nerves ...liQrves heat the bodlr; An impulse travels over a nerve by waves known as vi ration, aim ilar as a pulse-wave; only more rapid. The speed of thought (an impuhle traveling over a nerve) has been duly measured by the aid of apparatus in physiological laboratories. In man the normal rate of vibration is said to be 114 feet per second. Sensory impulses, which convey sensation inward vary from 168 to 675 feet per second, the a,Yerage being 28:! feet. The commands, known as impulses, are carried over the nerves by vibration. Why does death result from high temperaturef Because excessive vibrations create sufficient heat to liguify tissue, necrose the web-like structure, render it too soft for normal vibration. The tripod of life, the vital tripod, the brain, heart and lungs, cease to innervate the organism through the nervous system, and maintain the circulation and aeration of the blood. If 200 nerve vibrations are normal, over that is an excess, heat is augment ed, bones, nerves, blood vessels and other tissue become softened, ehangd in color from white to that of reddish\u00ad yellow, the vascular system softened, causing hemorrhage from rupture and perforation. Nerves, like all material substances, are composed of particles , atoms or molecules, which vibrate , oscillate. When nerves are in a normal condition, known as tone-normal tension, normal ,41lasticity and normal renitency-impules are transmitted by vibration in a normal man\u00ad ner with the usual foree. The amount of impulsive force is determined by 20 THE CHIROPRACTOR the rate of transmission, the rate of action upon the quantity of vibra\u00ad tion, and the amount of movement upon tension. Motor and sensory im pulses are transmitted over the nervous system by molecular vibration. The force of an impulse depends upon its momentum, the momentum upon the impetus received from nerve vibration during transmission . If the nervous system. is normal in its tension, vibrations are normal and the degree of temperature is that of 98 to 99 degrees. Consciousness is associated with nerve vibration; the external organs focus the vibratory movements, perform the function of receiving, direct\u00b7 ing and transmitting vibrations. The retina of the eye and the tym\u00ad panum of the ear respo td to the vibrations of the atmosphere. These vibrations pass into the interior by means of the nervous system. If this means of communication is normal in tension, its vibration and car\u00ad rying capacity are also normal. The tension and rigidity of nerve tissue determines the amount of molecular oscillation. Petoskey, Mich., Aug. 13.-Miss Helen Keller, the noted blind and deaf girl, has heard her first note of music. She caught the vibrations of a violin string through her teeth, held against the bridge of the instrument, and, although her eardrums are useless, Prof. Frans Kohler of Oberlin conservatory declared today that the harmonies had been commnnicated to her brain and she had caught the strain. \"Like the voices of singini, ngels,\" said Miss Kelle to Miss Macey, her teacher. Light is transmitted by the vibration of ether at the rate of 186,300 miles per second. Vibrations strike the 'retina of the eye and are carried inward over the optic nerve. The retina forwards the vibratory impulses to the nerve which communicates between the brain and the organ of vision. The X\u00b7ray is a good illustratio n of light penetrating solid sub\u00ad stances by ether vibration, yet itJs not a therapeutical are vibratory transmitting mediums. Ether intorpene\u00b7 trates the atmosphere, as well as all material substances , liquid or solid. Ethcric vibrations pass freely through opaque bodies as light penetrates transparent substances, with the same velocity as that of light. Ether penetrates all substances. Spirit permeates and inhabits all living bodies. Ether and spirit are not subject to laws which govern ponderable substances . Telepathy, mental communieation between two persons at a \"distance from each other without the aid of spoken or written signs, ia accom plished through and by the transmitting vibratory qualities of ether. Ether is a medium filling all space, even in that which is occupied by fluids and solids. Its functions, so far aa known, are the transmitting of light, the production of all the phenomena ascribed to electric, vital and magnetic force,[!:ther will in the near future play a11 important part in the transmission of thought, not only between individuals of this world, but between astral beings and those of the physical. I Who know NERVE VIBRATION 21 but the way is now being opened for the inhabitants of other plan ets to convers e with those of our own by the aid of etheric waves f The transmission of thought from planet to planet would be only an increa\"s11 in distance as has been done with wireless telegraphy. Molecular vibration is a law of the univ erse, nothing is exempt from this activity. It is universal in its application. Progression is an esta.b\u00ad lished principle. Spiritual progress toward perfection is depend ent upon physcal and spiritual growth. The universe is composed of spirit and matter. All living material 1s aLimat eJ by spirit. The :i:,rocess of physical and spirituul growth are so intimat ely blended that 1t is difficult to separate one from the other. Our bodies are animate d by spirit through molecular vibration; biting !uper- sensible spheres are far more refined than the material of this world, yet they are undergoi:.ig a process of advanc ement analogous to that of individuals on this earth. A Brief Review Biology is the science of life. Life is intelligent action, movement, guided by intelligenc e. Life exista because of renitency and elasticit1 of tissue; these conditions not only permit, make it possible to receive, but actually create a. response to an impulse. Impulses are thoughts in transmission over the nervous system. In telepathy thoughts are trans\u00ad mitted by the vibrations of ether; in spoken language they are transferred by the vibrations of the air. The soul is intelligent life; it is the product from uniting intelligence and material, spirit and body; the result of a combination of the imma\u00ad terial with the material Vital makes possible organic functions , the power of motion and feeling. The a.mount of tension depends upon the relative position of the osseous frame, the neuroskeleton, the skeleton of the vertebrates. Bea.Ith is a. condition wherein all the functions a.re performed with a normal amount of force. Disease is an existence in which the action of an organ or organs a.re improperly performed. Death is a situation wherein action has ceased to be controlled by intelligence. The state of dissolution, or the act of a rolling stone, is not that of intelligence. In1lammation is a condition in which some local portion exhibits a higher temperature than any other, including the blood. Do not forget, in order to disturb functions, there m!lst be in-ordinate nerve tension, also, a change in heat production. Fever is a state in which the whole body is above normal in temperature. Fever is diffused in1lammation. In1lammation is associated with corns; the heat of which may be diffused, if so, the patient has fever. The neuroskeleton , when in normal position, is a protector of the nervous system, but, a nerve disturber when not properly placed. PRESSURE. There are three kinds of pressure, impingement, pinch and stricture; two forms of injury, cor.tusion and concussion; each are lesional. Pressure on any portion of the nervous system (the eneephalon, spinal cord, the ganglionic chains, ganglia or nerves) increases or impairs its carrying capacity of impulses (motor or sensory), causing too much or not enough functionating: heat is one of those functions. To impinge is to press on one side. Impinging and impinge are verbs, they denote action, something to be done, are always followed by on, upon or against. A nerve may be impinged on, upon or against. Impingement is a noun, denotes the act or condition of being impinged on, upon or against. A BRIEF REVIEW 23 Pinching or squeezing is an act done by pressure on two sides, a material placed between two harder substances. Spinal Adjustment displays two cuts on pages 146 and 14 7; the former is designed to '' show the normal condition of the intervertebral discs.'' In anatomy a disc is a circular organ or body which is plate-like. The epiphyseal plates of bone are situated on the upper and under sur\u00ad faces of the body of the vertebra and the intervertebral fibrocartilage are known as discs, because they are like a plate, fiat and round. The cut on page 147 is '' Showing compressed intervertebral disc and an impinged nerve from narrowin g of the foramina.'' The term foramina should be foramen, as nerve is referred to in the singular number. To compress is to press or squeeze together, to reduce in volume by pressure, to' make more compact. The intervertebral cartilage is a connective tissue, nonvascular , con\u00ad tains no nerves. It is surrounded by a fibrovascularmembrane, in which blood vessels and nerves are freely distributed, by which it receives nutrition. It contains a fibrous element, its base being of chrondin, a viscous, jelly-like substance which may be separated, from the fibrous por\u00ad tion by boiling. In the living subject it may be destroyed, necrosed, by excessive heat. Inflammation of the surrounding membrane liqni1les, liberates the gelatin and very often destroys the fibrous portion. Its size is not and cannot be reduced by eompression as shown in the cut. A displaced vertebra, one whose articular surfaces are separated, en\u00ad larges the foramina, therefore, does not occlude the opening, does not, pinch, compress or squeeze the outgoing nerves as they pass through the intervertebral foramina. The spinal nerves and their branches may be impinged upon or against, or stretched because of displaced vertebra, but not pinched. '' Impinged nerves from narrowing of the foramina.'' The author here refers to nerves being pinched, not impinged. Constriction is & condition of being narrowed by & binding force applied &round a tubular orrifice. A morbid contraction of a passage way, any hollow tube of the body. Constriction and stricture mean one and the 1ame. Illustrate stricture on board, eontracture of nerve tissue, inflamma\u00ad tion because of increased combustion of oxygen. Compression is to press together, to make more compact, to reduce in volume, to make narrower in one direction. A concussion is a shaking, a jarring, an agitation, or a shock caused by a collision. The real and direct cause of disease is more or less 'nerve tension than normal. Displaced bones because of their pressure against, or non-24 THE CHIROPRACTOR resistance of nerves, or that of stretching, cause an extra or a lessened amount of tension. An abnormal performanPe of function of the body is denominated disease , the kind depends upon the tissue affected and the function dis\u00ad turbed. The subtile and nicely discriminating transmission of physiological impulse s, in health, whether of cells, the elementary structure of which organic substances are formed, individual organs, or the body as an organism, is directed by an intelligence known as spirit. Sensory nerves are those nerve-fibers which carry sensory impulses from the exterior inward, to a nerve-center , resulting in sensation. Sensa\u00ad tion is the recognizance of nerve vibration. Sensory nerve centers is where nerve vibration is identified. A sensory nerve is an afferent nerve, one which transfer s peripheral impressions to the sensoria, sense-centers. Sensory ganglia are those masses of nervous substance which are thought to serve as a center of nervou influence. The most prominent of the sensory nerves are those of the olfactory, optic, auditory, gustatory, tactile and thermal. To these should be added that of cenesthesia, con\u00ad scious existence, painful or pleasurable, depression or exaltation, the gen\u00ad eral sense of bodily, or self-existence, the subconscious sensation by the functioning of the internal organs. Sensory impressions are the effects of external agents or bodies upon the organs of sense. These external agents or bodies; are always the same, impulses as originated are always perfect, if the nervous system is in a normal condition , the impressions, afferent impulses , can not be otherwise than normal. We have the spiritual and physical impulses, those from the creator and the mind. All efferent impulses are motor. All motor impulses, whether of the spirit or the mind, are normal, providing the nerves of transmission are of normal tension. All thoughts, orders, commands, directions of the mind, known as impulses, are normal if voluntary, the lines of communication are normal. All thoughts, orders, commands, directions of the spirit, a segment of the Universal Intelligence, contains in miniature all intelligence and qualities of the All-Wise Spirit, just as one drop of the ocean contains all the qualities of the briny deep. All spiritual impulses, those whith rause intelligent organic action, life, are perfect when originated, as mu!'h rn as their rreator, as mnni\u00ad fested in the new-born babe which bas not been iujured, whose impulse s are <'arried over nerves of normal tension; but, if the tension-frame is <lisplaeed. luxuated ever so little, nerves stretrhed, vibration modified, innen\u00b7ation inrreased or decreased, we have eonditions known ns disease . The body when diseased mnnifests no new funetions, develops no new forms of energy, adds no new space or accommodation. While the larger share of diseases, abnormal functionating, are be-A BRIEF REVIEW 25 cause of trauma, toxine and autosuggestion, there are minor causes such as inhalation of gas, smoke or flame, lack of food, water or air, decom\u00ad pression of the atmosphere in tunnels and caisons, an excess or a defic\u00ad iency of beat, local exposure to the extremes of heat or cold which in\u00ad duces necroses, and exposure to X-rays may lead to caries. INFLAMMATION Infiammation is from a Greek word which means a flame, to burn as a fiame, a condition of being inflamed. The early idea of inflammation was that of an entity and the treat\u00ad ment that of exorcism, adjuration or conjuration of evil spirits, expelling or driving out or off an evil spirit by using a holy name. Pathologists state, inflammation is an inflammable condition, which like a fire must be subdued by appropriate means, such as antiphlogis\u00ad tines, counterirritants, venesection, cupping, leeching and the use of mercury. That inflammation is a local attempt to repair an injury. That inflammation is a local reaction to irritation, it tends to counteract an injurious agent and repair its deleterious effect. That inflammation is conservative in tendency, benign in disposition, the result of a carefully adjusted protective mechanism. That inflammation is a purifyer, a body cleanser. The condition known as inflammation is brought about by disturbed tissue which have been damaged. The fact is, as demonstrated by the art of chiropractic, borne out by the principles of the science and the reasoning of its philosophy, inflammation and disturbed functions are the result of nerves being injured. Inflammation is a condition wherein the function of heat is per formed in too great a degree, the result of morbid nerve tissue. Inflammation is recognind by redness, swelling, heat, pain, impaired functions, over renitent tissue and a change in catabolism. Inflammation may be seated in any organ or tissue of the body wherein there are nerves. The hair, nails and cartilage are void of blood vessels and nerves, therefore are not subject to inflammation, neuritis or arteritis. The part inflamed bas a temperature much higher than the rest of the body. Blood bas the same temperature throughout the vascular system. Inflammation modifies physiological processes. Some of our grandfathers believed that animal heat was furnished by a set of nerves which were known as calorific-heat furnishing. When the surrounding temperature was above 99 degrees, there was another set which they named frigorific-eold producing. I am often told that anatomy cannot be otherwise than correct. I do not object to the slight difference in the number, form and structure of normal tissue found in different subjects, reversed organs, but I do dis\u00ad approve of the physiological and pathological deductions. Grey says on page 846 of his 1910 edition, \"Inflammation of the spinal cord (myelitis) may follow any of the acute specific fevers.'' Fever is diffused inflamma- 26 INFLAMMATION 27 tion. There ran he no fever without a lol'al inflammation. Inflammation always Jre,\u00b7edPH fe\\\u00b7er. The sensible phenomena inu.icating inflammation are r<lnC'ss, beat, pain, swelliug a111l u.isonl<>red function. Redness because of excess of bloo,I containing the red corpuscles; beat because of nerve excitation, contraction and excessive vibration; pain is a sensation con\u00ad fined to nerves only; inflamed nerves are swollen, enlarged in their diameter and contracted lengthwise; functions are disordered because of disturbed nervous tissue, normal function depends upon normal amount of energy, an impulse given too much force or a lack of arouses too much latent energy or not enough. We are told by pathologists that the pain and swelling are because of congestion. Pathologists look to blood as a functional disturber. If a disturber it shoul<l also be a rorrertor. The blood is one of the four liquids of the 'body, the only one which circulates; the other fluids osmose, transudate through moist membranes. \"Inflammation is not easily defined.\" If patholo\u00ad gists knew that heat was a function of nerves, the ea.use and the condi\u00ad tion of inflammation would be easily accounted for and explained. Such knowledge would let in a flood of light on the etiolop of many diseases now given as obscure. Blood circulates; serum, lymph and chyle, osmose, transudate, pass through a moist membrane. \u00b7 \u00b7 Artero-sclerosis in old age is physiological. In youth and adult life it is pathological. Post mortem examinations show but little of which we desire to know. Examine the living subject for benefit and informatin. Neuritis, nerve inflamed, sensitive to the touch; hardened, enlarged diametrically and contracted lengthwise. Microscopic examination shows myelin sheaths, swollen fibers (filaments, axis sylinders). Owing to the number of fibers we may have multiple neuritis. laments of one nerve may lea,e it and join another. Neuritis changes the structure of nerves. Arteritis modifies the structuM of arteries. Inflammation is present in most, if not all diseases, in the acute if not the chronic. Inflammation of the mucous membrane causes catarrh of any canal, cavity or hollow organ which communicates externally by an aperture through the skin. Nerve contraction causes an undue amount of heat, gall stones, hard ened e&r wax and dropsy are bee.a.use of inflammation. - -The healing of wounds and fractures require a rise in temperature in order to furnish a larger per cent. than usual of the red corpuscles. The degree of general temperature determines the per cent of red and white corpuscles. Local temperature determines the per cent of red or white and the amount of leakage deposited. 28 THE CHIROPRACTOR Necrotic inflamma.tion ca.uses death of tissue; softened ti11ue ha.a little or no vibra.tion, the carrying quality of impulses. Inflammation is characterized by excessive emigration of leukocyte from the blood vessels, which soon disappear by colliquative necrosis. Arteritis is an inflammation of an a.rtery, the nervi vasorum is irri\u00ad ta.ted, inffamed. Blood vessels rupture because of being softened. Soft ening a.nd hardening are known as malaeia and sclerosis. Many persons suffer in an amputated limb, because the pressure, the cause of pain and other diseased conditions, has not been removed. ' 'Blood poisoning, septicemia, pyemia, toxemia,' are medical terms used to account for any ailment which is presumed to arise from intro duction of decomposed organic matter into the blood, excrementitious toxins of the intestinal canal not properly eliminated, putrefactive micro organic germs which grow and multiply in the blood. In the above pathological conditions, please remember, morbid tiBBue and abnormal functionating always accompany each other. It is impos sible for either to exist without the other. \"Blood poisoning\" will be found coexisting with a more or less intense nervous irritation known as inflammation, a tissue necrosis. The tissue shows very marked altera tions, the cells or intereellular substance is softened and disintegrated. While it is a faet that inflammation causes abnormal organic mani\u00ad festation , there are no new functions developed. Physiolgical acts have become pathological. We are now back to the elementary proposition, ne\"es heat the blood, as well as all parts of the body. Hyperthermia changes the amount of and the per cent. of the solid substances of the blood, the corpuscles. Behind all abnormal functions, is the change in the structu,re of nerve tis81le and an increase or decrease of nerve vibra.tion. The following quotations were clipped from The Los Angeles Times of August 17, 1912. '' Cold feet and cold hands-other things being equal these indicate poor circulation. \" I presume that circulation refers to the blood, as no other tluid of the body circulates, makes a circuit. The blood remains the same temper\u00ad ature throughout the body regardless of the feet and hands being cold or warm. The blood is the same temperature in. the warm hands and the cold feet; the same blood circulates through'but the body about event:, timee a minute. ' 'You should eat nourishing food and mako good blood and enough of the starches, sweets, and fat to make heat.\" If it takes nourishing food to make good blood, then bad blood would be the result of eating unnutritious food. \"What is one man's food is another man 's poison. \" Dr. Warman follows the above with morning and evening exerciaes INFLAMMATION 29 of the hands and feet. Exercise excites the nervous system, causing an increase of vibration, consequently increased beat . A. T._ Still, the founder of oateopathy, says, on page 74 of bis work, that bad - the cause of fibroid tumors, painful monthlies, con\u00ad stipation, diabetes and dyspepsia. / The founder of chiropractic states that, nerve impingement, pressure against nerves, and more or less nerve tension than normal, is the cause of these diseases-quite a difference between osteopathy and chiropractic. Food furnishes material for the production of living tissue; it embraces those substances which are necessary for the maintenance and composition of the body. Bad blood is defined by pathologists as a deficiency in quanity, or a lack of the proper amount of red corpuscles. Pernicious anemi!!:, a deficient amount of blood, or a deficiency in the relative number of red corpuscles, is a pathologicat'condition which does not depend upon the amount of, or the quality of the food taken, ut up perature _o y. It is true, ingesta which irritates, acts as a poison on ,the nervous system, modifies the activity of molecular oscillation and increases heat produc\u00ad tion. lThe circulation of the blood and its quality depend npon the con\u00ad dition of the nervous system. I ? Medical practitioners state, n anemia may be 'due to an insufficient amount of food, excessive drain, exhausting discharges, blood-waste, hemorrhages, action of poisons, idiopathic (no known or recognized cause), and the cause is often obscure. Traumatic injuries and poisons affect nerve plexuses which are freely distributed on the surface and into the substance of the heart, the nervi vasorum surrounding the arteries and veins, supplying the media (middle coat) with a network of nerve fibers wbicb form dense plexuses giving them the power of contractility. This function of \u00b7shortening into a more compact form, a power possessed by living muscle-fibers and the nervous tissue, is modified by poisons ttnd the displacement of the neuroskeleton. VERTEBRAL LUXUA TIONS In pathology luxation and dislocation mean one and the same. A luxation is a displacement (not misplacement) of two or more bones whose articular surfaces have lost, wholly or in part, their natural connection. Pathologists give two causes for luxations, one known and the other unknown. !The known is caused by accidental luxations, owe their existence to external violence; the unknown to spontaneous luxation, those which owe their displacement to diseased conditions of the joint, including the vertebrae, known as tuberculosis; the bones and joints are affected with strumous arthritis, indolent ulcers, or that of white swell\u00ad ing, gelatinous arthritis, attended with slight continued feYer; the cause of the morbidity is obscure, therefore said to occur of itself without any manifest external cause. Diseases are said to be spontaneous which have no apparent cause, occurring without any external influence . For example, intra-uterine amputation, congenital di11location and fracture. As fast as the causes become known they are taken out of the list of spontaneous abnormal\u00ad ities. Chiropractic has greatly lessened this list. Luntions are complete when the bones ha.Ye entirely lost their utnral connection; incomplete when they partly retain it; ancl com\u00b7 pound when a wound communicates with the diplaced joint. Chiropractors are concerned with the incomplete luxations, articular surfaces slightly displaced and the relative position they occupy toward each other. The vertebral column bas four normal curvatures. The cervical and lumbar bend anterior, while the dorsal and sacral have their cun\u00b7atures posterior. A lordosis is an angular curvature of the cervical or lumbar portion of the spine. A kyphosis is an angular curvature of the dorsal portion of the spine, the sacral curvature being fixed and permanent owing to the vertebrae being fused. Seoliosis is a lateral curvature. An abnormal curvature consists of a sudden angular break, an increase in the convexity of the normal bend, a separation of the artieular sur\u00ad faces of two adjoining vertebrae, the superior articular proeesses of one or both sides being driven or drawn back'l'l\u00b7ard and away from its mate. Displacements cause a stretched eondition of the 8pinal nen\u00b7es, or some one or more of their branches, or the sympathetic, ganglinated, Yertebral cords.J A displacement of the twelfth dorsal (the spinous process of ) which is displaced anterior of the axial line of the Yertebral column) not only affects certain organs and portions of the body, because of excessiY e tension created, but, also, a portion 30or all of the spinal column through \\VERTEBRAL LUXUATIONS 31 excessive beat, softening tli vrtebrae, causing anterior, posterior and lateral curvature,- owing to the portion of the vertebral bodies softened and narrowed. As displacement of the twelfth dorsal caused abnormal ciirv'ature, replacing it in its normal position will restore the vertebral column to its normal curve. I have, in twenty-six years, only met ono exception to the above mentioned abnormal curvatures, that of Miss Pearl Weeks, which was returned to normal by adjusting the twelfth dorsal, the rule holding good even in reversed scoliosis and lordosis. Any angular curvature, displacement of a spinous process posteriorly by the racking of a wrtebra from its normal alignment, can be replayed by hand, using the spinous process as a lever. There are three forms of abnormal spinal curvatures, each of which has a differ(l,l)t cause. The augular curvature consists of a break, a sep\u00ad aration of the articular processes betwetln two vertebrae. A curvature known as Pott 's disease, carries of the spine, supposed by pathologists to be of tuberculous origin. The curvature which has no knuckle, no sharp break nor vertebral caries, but, an increased curvature in the rervical, dorsal or lumbar, or in both of the latter two, from the ver\u00ad tebrae becoming wedge-shaped. Displaced vertebrae, by impinging or stretching, cause contraction of nerve tissue. Tension is the condition of being stretched. Tension, more or less than normal, causes an increase or decrease of vibration, which means a greater or less force of an impulse and a corresponding amount of heat. Nerve contraction increases vibration, irritation and heat. The force of an impulse is augmented by the greater speed in transit. 'The bounding back of an impulse is known as reflex action. The greater the renitency (the bounding back), the greater is energy aroused as expressed in the performance of function.' Displaced bones cause pressure upon nerves and consequent tension and deranged function. Slight deflections of vertebrae cause pressure on the nerves given off by the spinal cord, functional derangements are the result. By restoring them to their normal position, normal function is restored. Nerve fibers possess the property of conducting impulses outward and inward. The amount of impulsive force is determined by the rate of transmission, the rate of that action upon the quantity of vibration and the amount of that movement upon tension. Physiological and pathological activity between peripheral end-organs and their central connection is dependent upon nerve tension. The specific energy of a nerve is due to its anatomical structure, its elasticity and tension. A nerve pressed upon by a fractured or a luxated bohe would be stretched were it not for the responsive principle of life which resists pressure. The impulsive force normally conveyed by the nerve is modified 32 THE CHIROPRACTOR by the elastic resistance known as renitency. The result is either too much or not enough function, conditions known as disease. The contrac\u00ad tion and expansion of the nervous system has a normal limit known as tone, the basis upon which I founded the science of chiropractic. Any deviation therefrom is recognized as disease. Tone denotes normal tem\u00ad perature, normal structure, normal tension and normal vibration of nerves. An angleworm, when relaxed, may measure six inches. Press against it, impinge upon it, try to stretch it and immediately a response of increased tension is observed; it contracts lengthwise and its diameter is increased . This ability of elastic resistance to any opposing force is an inherent qmllity of all living matter. Dead material does not possess it. An impingement upon a nerve calls into action two opposing forces. The impigning body tends to stretch the nerves, while the inherent principle of self-preservation exerts an activity toward contracting it. Trauma the cause of disease, increasing or decreasing function, is direct in displacing osseous tissue. Poisons as causes are indirect, they act on nerves, nerves on muscles, their combined action draw vertebrae out of alignment. Autosuggestion may be therapeutical, curative, or morbific, causing hysteric paralysis, contraction of muscles, impairment of vision, convul\u00ad sions, sensory disturbances and psychic manifesta tions. A change of thought is restful, but a constant continuation of the same thought, using the selfsame nerves, causes nerve disturbance and some form of in\u00ad sanity, and yet there is no discernable lesion of the nervous system. The relationship existing between bones and nerves are so nicely adjusted that any one of the 200 bones, more especially those of the vertebral column, cannot be displaced ever so little without impinging upon or stretching adjacent nerves. Pressure upon nerves, agitates, creates an excess of molecular vibration, the effects of which when local, are known as inflammation, when diffused as fever. Nerves are the con\u00ad veyors of impulses which create functions; an increase of vibration causes an exceSB of function-local inflammation or fever-symptoms which are common to most diseases. Subluxated vertebrae disarrange the costo-central articulation, the juncture of the head of the rib with the vertebra. These projecting sur\u00ad faces press against and impinge upon one or more of the four branches of the spinal nerve. The Adjuster contains thirty-six pages, from 189 to 225, devoted to luxations, giving the opinions of many authors. Please read them care\u00ad fully and notice how near they came to getting onto chiropractic in its principles, art and philosophy. Health, Disease, Life and Death. What do scientists, philosophers and divines know of life and death t What knowledge have you of the relation existing between intelligence and material, spirit and matterf Is not death an incident of lifet What is life, disease, death and eternal intelligent existence! What force created this human organism f What is this intelligent vital agency and from whence does it come! What of this intellectual entity which continues our existence as an intelligent livin_g being! These questions have been propounded by savants of all ages.(_ Chiropractors are able at least in a great measure, to answer these very important questions.) My idea's concerning health, disease, life and death have been greatly modi11.ed by years of careful research. Health is that condition of the body in which ,11 the functions are performed in the usual manner, impulses forwarded over the nervoua 1Ystem at the usual rate, giving the proper force to the rebound (rede:ic action) of the renitent tissue, all acts being performed in a normal degree. The nervous system is the line of communication of our thoughts (impulses). Impulses are not duids which dow. When the nervoua tissue is normal in ita structure, tension, :firmness \u00b7 and reuiteney have the degree of tone, the transference of thought, eomm&llds (impulses) are of normal force, the result of health. Disease has always been considered and treated as an entity, a being with an intelligence, one which could be talked to,, commanded to go at our bidding. The body treated in such a manner with drugs and incant& tions, so as, to make it uncomfortable for its, habitation. Disease is a condition . We are learning to think aright. Instead of a fearful reverence for irrational superstition, we are learning to reason along biological lines. In order to give you an idea of advancement in correct reasoning, the difference between superstition and rationalism, I will quote one illustra\u00ad tion of the former from each of four old books I have. Bate 's Dispensatory by William Salmon, Professor of Physic, date 1694, containing '' His choice and select recipes, applicable to the whole practice of physic and chyurgery, with above five hundred chymical processes, those so much famed in the world.'' On page 897 he gave the formula for \"The Sympathetic Ointment\" for wounds. The prescription is preceded by the ijr which was then, as well as now, always placed at the commencement of a recipe. Dunglison 's Dictionary says of this :S, \"Originally it was the sign of Jupiter, and was placed at. the top of a 33 34 THE CHIROPRACTOR formula to propitiate the king of the gods, that the compound might act favorably.' ' Jupiter was the ancient Italian god of the heavens. The compound was ma<le of '' Oil of roses, linseed oil, man's grease, moss of a man's skull, killed by a violent death in powder, mummy, man's blood, mix and make an ointment. By this ointment all wounds are healed; anointing the instrument by whirh the wound was made, once a day, every day, if the wound be great, otherwise , if the wound be small, once every second or third day may suffirc. The weapon is to be kept wrapt up in a clean linen cloth, and in a place not too hot, lest the patient suffers thereby.'' Physicians of the past and present in selerting portions of humans or animals always take those of the male as they are supposed to make stronger drugs than those of the females. They chose those who had met violent death, for the reason that those dying of disease would sow the germs of destruction. They treated the instrument as the producer and repairer. The London Dispensatory, date 1716, on page 169, gives a valuable ( i) recipe. \"The hair of the patient made into a powder and drank cures the jaundice. The ashes of it mixt with hog's lard as an ointment helps luxated joints; the simple ashes stop bleeding. An oil distilled from it with honey, anointed on bald places, causes hair to grow. '' The finger nails of the patient made into a powder or infusion cause vomiting, great sickness at the stoma<'h, and giddiness in the head; the powder laid to the navel in dropsies, is said to cure them. '' To cure consumption, take the hair and nails of the patient, cut them \u00b7small, and put them in a hole in the root of a cherry tree, and then stop it with clay. To cure quartans (fe,er) and the gout, take the said hair and nails, cut small, and either give them to birds in a roasted egg, or put them into a hole bored into the body of an oak tree, or else mix them with wax, and stitch it to 1. live crab, casting it into the river again.'' The above while relieving ( T) the patient of the evil was hard on the trees, crabs and birds. The people of Europe and America are making foolish pother over Friedman's serum evolved from a turtle as a cure of tuberculosis. I recall to memory Brown-Sequard 's elixir of life, Dr. Kochs consumption serum. Koch bad found the wiggler and the dope that would stop his wiggling. The above are but the sun\u00b7ival of the old superstition, \"The hair of the dog that bit you will heal the wound.'' In 1776 Baron van Swieten, counsellor and first physician to their majesties the Emperror and Empress of Germany; perpetual president of HEAL TH, DISEASE, LIFE AND DEA TH 35 the College of Physicians in Vienna; member of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Rurgery at Paris; H. Fellow of the Royal College of Phy\u00ad sicians at Edinburgh, published a book. On page 37 he says, '' A pleurisy terminate s either in a cure, in other diseases, or in death. This is a cir\u00ad cumstance which a pleurisy has in common with all other diseases.\" The Baron had made a wonderful discovery, that persons aft'ected with dis\u00ad ease either got well or died, unless their affections ended in some other disease. Samuel Frederick Gray published a treatise on pharmacology in 1824. On page 159 he says, '' In a medical or chemical point of view, animals are inferior in rank to vegetables, as neither affording remedies of such power, nor consisting of so many distinct principles, as the latter. '' There is even reason to suppose that most of the virtues attributed to animal s,ubstances are imaginary, and that their apparent effects ought to be ascribed to the other substances ehibited in them. In general, we only mention those substances, which are, or rather have been, kept in the shops. '' Human skull. Cranium hominis. The powder is used in epilepsy: those which have been long buried are to be preferred; and some even limit the effect to that triangular bone called the os triquetrum ( os tri\u00ad angnlare, cuneiform bone of the wrist).\" Age and distance lend en chantment to superstition. .. Hundreds of scientists are devoting their lives to the study of bacteriology, germ investigation, a microscopical branch of biology, in order to determine their .relation to health and disease, not realizing,lhat life action is due to the ombination of intelligence matterL spirit miuiifestation thr The isopathic theory and system of treatment' .of disease by means of the causal agent, that it is possible to cure a .disease by means of the ,\u00b7irus of the same disease; alsq, the treatment of a diseased organ, that its abnormal functions may be returned to normal by an extract of the same organ from a healthy animal, the curing a diseased organ by eating the analogous organ of a healthy animal, savors of canibalistic barba rism, eatin an enemy transfers his fightin 1ualities to the devourer. \"The explanation O this natural immunity is ;till-ucei-tain'\" 'All the phenomena of immunity have not been satisfactorily explained.\" Medical men, who believe in this dogma, think natural immunity heredi tary, that thon 's ancestors were immunized as a result of being infected. The immunity being transmitted to their descendants. \"But little is known regarding the antitoxins.'' The theory is, the serum of one animal when introdueted into the blood of another may destroy or modify the form, nature and structure of the red corpuscles.'' '' This wonderful pro\u00ad tective adaptation of the body toward the invasion of foreign cells; the nature of the processes involved is not at all understood, t'he phenomena is, therefore, designated provisionally as a biological reaction.'' 36 THE CHIROPRACTOR By referring to Dunglison 's Medical Dictionary, date 1903, page 1100, you will find that animal extracts are yet in vogue. Disease consists of a change in structure, position or function. Dis\u00ad ease is a disturbed condition, functions performed abnormally, in too great a degree or not enough; it is not something foreign to the body which by aome means enters it; it is not a thing of enmity which we have to fight. Disease does not involve any new functional expression which it did not &:lready possess. Disease is a manifestation of too much or not enough energy. Energy is liberated force; in the living being it is known as vital force. A normal amount of energy released from that which i11 stored, re\u00ad aults in health. The amount of energy stored for future use depends upon the condition of the organ as a storage receptacle. Disease is the result of releasing too much or not enough stored energy. Energy is the latent power or force in an organ, which when released creates action. Energy ia aroused by a motor impulse; if the impulse is normal in force then the normal amount of energy is expended. Disease is abnormal functionating-not enough or too much action-too much or not enough life. Life consists of intelligent action. Disease is morbid tissue and abnormal functionating. The quality of tisaue and the amount of func tionating are. coexistent. In all diseases we find an excess of, or a diminished amount of energy (force) expended. In one lesaon I cannot fully cover the eause of disease, as it takes in a large amount of chiropractic education in principles and facts re\u00ad garding the science of biology. Abnormal structure cannot do otllerwise than be the creator of disease. Death ia natural, whether of a physiological or a pathological nature -it ia a natural result, a natural change, all laws are of nature, natural What is that whicl. is preser.t in the living body and absent in the dead t It is an intelligent force, which I saw fit to name Innate, usually known as spirit. It creates and continues life when the vital organs are in a condition to be acted upon by that intelligence. RACHITIS OR RICKETS Rachitis, plural rachises, is a Greek word meaning spine. The origin of the word rickets is uncertain. It means to twist, to 1pra.in. Bachitis and rickets are synonymous terms, meaning one and the ume. Bachitis is an inflammatory disease of the vertebral column. This is an interesting and instructive condition for chiropractors to study. Medical dictionaries, pathological and orthopedic works describe definitely the malformation of the bones,. degeneration of the organs, general feverishness and abnormal functionating. Bachitis or rickets is a disease of early childhood characterized by defective nutrition of the entire body and alterations in the growing bones. The prominent symptoms are restlessness, fever, profuse sweating, and general sensitiveness, associated with characteristic skeletal lesions. The head becomes bulky, the spinal column curved, the sternum projected, and the long bones bent. Phyaiciam and surgeons &re not decided as to the came or e&ueL The,' have many and varied apeculative opiniom. (' When it becomes generally knoWD that heat is a function of nerves, 1 chiropractic beams pf eplietment will molutioni.ze the praetiee__9f that wfi1ca A natural insight ' of youz teacliir, tininmmeJed by superstition or education, assisted by revelation. and an inveetigation from a chiropractic '1ewpoint has enabled him to throw an illuminating ligllt on etiology In the Adjuster, on pages 237 to 255, is given a full description by many authors of this \"constitutional and nutritive disorder.\" . It is my desire to make you and the world acquainted with the etiology of this well-known disease, characterized by disorders of the \\ digeetive syetem and alterations in the shape and structure of bones. Oeteomalacia and rickets are similar in some respects and yet quite dissimilar in others. Bachitis is a disease of childhood, osteomalaeia (softening. of bones) la of agult life. The former is present while bones are being constructed , while the latter is only found after bones are formed. The structure of all tissue, more especially that of nerves, is modified aa age advances. The same pressure upon, or tension of the ume ne\"ee at dilferent ages produce quite different effects, which are classed as different diseases. No two of us look alike, no two have nerves of the ame quality in health, while in disease thHe differences ,.;e augmented. 37 38 THE CHIROPRACTOR The primary and secondary qualities of the nervous system differ in indi\u00ad viduals regarding their size, figure, number, aituation, molecular action, and more especially in intellecutal perc!lption, the quality and character of which is formed by contact with the five senses of consciousness. The structure and composition of bones undergo a change as age advances. Those of a child are composed of three parts gelatine and one part phosphate of lime, bone matter; in old age the proportion is re\u00ad versed, one part gelatine to three parts of bone material. Herein is the reason why the bones of the aged do not knit so readily when fractured as in those of younger years. Hyperthermia, excessive heat, temperature above normal, creates a larger per cent. of the red corpuscles and a corresponding inadequate number of the white corpuscles. This increase of the erythrocytes and the lessening of leukocytes has a tendency to soften all tissue, more notice\u00ad ably bones and nerves. The solid portion of the body is about one-tenth of the whole. The normal per cent of the red and white corpuscles are variously given as 300 to 600 of the red to one of the white. The color of the blood is from the preponderance of thii red corpuscles. The corpuscles are the solid portion of the blood and constitute about one-third to one-half of the blood. In anemia the number of the red may be reduced to one-tenth of the-ual number. In fever there is an increase of the colored and a lessening of the colorless corpuscle s; during convalescence this order is reversed. In the healing of wounds and fractures the temperatu re\u00b7 of the body is physiologically increased in order to produce plastic material, which is cartilage-like, known as callus, the osseous substance deposited in and around the divided portions of a fractured bone. A portion of this callus become s perminent and is changed into true bone, the tem\u00ad porary or provisional callus, is used as a splint to keep the ends of the bones in apposition; when the union is complete it is removed by ab\u00ad sorption. Poisons change the relative per cent of the red and white corpuscles, whether more or less depends upon the increase or decrease of organic function. Poisons ad'ect nerves, cause a greater or lessened tension, raise or lower the temperature, modify the per cent of red and white corpuscles. The pus cells of an abscess consist of dead white cor\u00ad puscles. Excess of heat makes it unfavorable for their existence and favorable for the red. Scurvy and rachitis may be associated. A pathologist says, \"We know nothing concerning the pathogenesis of scurvy.\" In all diseases wherein a high temperature was maintained before death, the bones and marrow will be found of a reddish color, owing to an excess of the red corpuscles and a corresponding deficiency of the white. If the temperature falls below normal, remaining so for a RACHITIS OR RICKETS 39 time, there will be an excess of the leukocytes and a lessening of the erythrocytes. A very high temperature causes an increase in the vascular circula\u00ad tion and an increased tension of the nervi vasorum (nerves distributed to the walls of blood vessels) in the perivascular (around) tissue. Varying degrees of temperature represent a corresponding rate of molecular oscillation, a greater or less vibration of atoms. Substances known as poison are noxious because of their exciting or depressing effects on the nervous system and their adaptation to modify functions; for this reason and for such a purpose physicians prescribe drugs. Any ingest& which causes abnormal functionating is a poison. The continued use of one article of food may act as a poison upon the nervous system in a 'like manner (a lack of rest, a continued strain) as does autoauggestion in hysteria, insanity and\u00b7 neurasthenic affections. Auto\u00ad nggestion may relax nerves, or act as a tensor. The heat condition of caries and rachitis are different in that the former is local, while the latter is diffused. In necrosis and caries the heat ii circumscribed, in the latter it is dispersed. Why not learn to make the distinction between the diseaaed concli- tiona arising from the tight, rigid, strained nerves of the third cervical and those of the twelfth dorsal I In bone softening without disintegration, the general diJfosion of heat ii due to hypertension of the twelfth pair of dorsal nerves, the second center place. In necrosis and caries the heat is localized because of tension on other nerves than those of the twelfth d9rsal, which 1114y be determined by the area affected. Caries, necrosis,\u00b7 rachitis and osteo\u00ad malacia are due to the function of heat being performed in exceBS, because of the displacement of some portion of the neuroskeleton. rachitic conditions are because of displacement of the twelfth f) dorsal vertebra; thia ii an estabed !act_ then, why not replace it,) thereby restoring those nerves to normal tension; tension depending upon the position of the bones of the neuroskeleton. It takes time to create abnormal curvatures, misshapen vertebrae-it will take time to reshapen them back to normal; this may be accomplished by proper daily adjusting. Stover' case of ichthyosis congenita, dry scaly tatter, a skin disease, a covering from the sebaceous glands, which disap\u00ad peared in summer and re-appeared in winter, covered the posterior por tlom of the forearms and the dorsal region of the back, also, pyorrhea alveolaria, inflammation gums, the tQJllllJLIUld npposed consumption were relieved by adjusting t real for Uae former two dlaeaaee and the fifth dorsal forth& latter two eonditiona. BIOLOGY In all the affairs of life we prosecute careful investigation in order to determine exactly what are the facts. Thinking we are right does not of necessity constitute righteousness. Thinking right or wrong is a matter of education. The standard of truthfulnes s may be quite differ\u00ad ent from the view we may happen to have. If, for example, I had gotten the idea that two times three are seven and carry that erroneous multiplication into all of my arithmetical calculations , architectural and financial operations; the fact that such was my honest conception would not undo or make right the enoneousness of my figuring. We should think correctly in order that we may get at facts. In chiropractic, too many teachers manufacture their own dP.fiuition of terms, make a dictionary according to thon 's conception. What would be the result if each banker and broker should invent and persist in using his own devised addition and multiplication table. Herein arises the discordant, inharmonious jangling among chiropractors regarding what constitutes the principles of the science, the method of adjusting, palpation and nerve tracing, the philosophy of the science and the art. Biology presents only facts, the laws of which are of nature, natural, whether exhibited in health or disease. As chiropractors we should continue to advance toward the truth in order to bring ourselves into closer relation with eternal realities. A truthful atatemen.t of facts is correct, not because of our consideration, supposition or imagination, hut because it IS right, because it conforms with everlasting truth. All is nature, natural, there is nothing supernatural, phenomena may he superusual and supernormal. Any observable fact or event may appear miraculous when it is merely marvelous; it is because of our ignorance in regard to nature's law that they appear so to us. Bio-a combining form from the Greek Bios, life, used to indicate relation to, or connection with, life, vital phenomena, or living organisms. Biology is the science of life, the study of living beings. It consists of a knowledge of principles and facts concerning life-the certainty that we live and the conditions which cause us to have an intelligent existence. Life may be one of health or one of disease. Biology treats of organized beings under their diverse relations, their organic structure, life, growth, action and reproduction. I desire to give you some of the im portant principles of biology as observed from several view points, con 1ining myself to the physiological branch which treats of the functions of the human body. You may accuse me of repetition. Fleeting im\u00ad pressions are only veneered. Essential ideas are worthy of repetition. 40 BIOLOGY 41 What is life T It is th at quality which distinguishes a living animal or plant from an inorganic body, from one which does not live, whose movements are not determined by an intelligence. Life consists of actions guided by intelligence. Life may consist of too much elastic force, too great or a lack of resisting vigor, such a condition is known as disease. Animals and plants have an existence because they live; they exist as living beings on account of their bodies being composed of organs con\u00b7 trolled by an intelligence. An organ is any part of an organism; an organism is an organized being. An organized being is one which is composed of organs. An organ is that which has a particular function to perform. The sensory or sense organs receive impressions from objec tive realiites. through the sensory or seme organs, transform them into sensation-conscious sense perception. Eyes are organs of sight, ears that of hearing, the olfactor y organ has\u00b7 the sense of smell, the nerves of taste are distributed to the palate, epiglottis, larynx and the tongue. To these may be added the senses of pressure, temperature, pain, hunger and thirst. \u00b7 Biology in its broadest sense includes embryolo p, the development of the embryo in animals and plants; zoology, the form, nature and habits of animals; botany deals with plant life; physiology relates to the func\u00ad tions of living bodies, animals or plants; anatomy, the dissection of organ\u00ad ized bodies, whether human, bmte-animal, or vegetable; cytology, the sci\u00ad ence of cell life. In common language it includes the principles and facts of the origin, development, stmeture, functions and distribution of plants and animals. Life exists be<'ause of the exer<'ise of organs. Physiologists study functions, the action of organs. Physiology: i}eals with the pro\u00ad cesses, activities and the phenomena incidental to life, the characteristic actions which constitute life, hose qualities which determine a living organism from one which does not live, those actions which depend upon an intelligence. Life consists of the actions of a living organism, they may .be of health, those desired to make us happy, give us ease, or they may be those known as disease, those which cause sensation and actions not desired. The body is incapable of creating new forces. Force is that which originates or arrests motion. Vital force is the energy which gives life or action to an organism, the vital power which distinguishes living matter from the dead. Organic force is the inherent vigor latent in an organ. Nerve force is the power or ability to conduct impulses. Reserve force is the energy which is stored in an organ or organism that is not required for normal funetionating. Intelligent actions are the expres 11ions of the sum total of life. This intelligence is able to accumulate and store energy derived from without. Certain fixed and definite conditions release this energy. 42 THE CHIROPRACTOR The condition of an organ suitable for health is known as tone. Tone consists of normal tension, normal firmness and normal renitency. When nerves have the proper tension, the suitable solidity and the re\u00b7 quired resisting force, health is the result. Biology embraces a knowledg e of living matter in contradistinction to substances which do not possess that vital force directed by an intelli\u00ad genc, a quality essential to intelligent beings. Physiology treats of the functions which create and continue a living existence, one which is normal, congenial and of health. Pathologic physiology is that condition in which the functions are performed ab normally. Pathology treats of the modifications of functions and the changes of tissue coincident therewith which always accompany the disturbance of functions. Pathology includes functions performed in an unusual manner, also changes in position from that of normal, as well as, ab normal structure of organs. The philosophy of chiropractic, the reasons concerning the science and art, is an explanation of the phenomena of life in health and diaeaae. The principles of biology are those of chiropractic; their associated elements onstitute th6 ecience of chiropractic; when formulated they express in a clear and definite form the scientific part of chiropractic. Chiropractic science is identified by the principles of biology; ita exist ence depends upon biological self-evident facts; they are the constituent elementary parts. To comprehend chiropractic it is essential that we shoula know of biology, the science of life, the physiological action of organs. We are, therefore, especially inte!ested in that branch of knowl\u00ad edge which deals with the activities and phenomena incidental to and characteristic of living organisms. The sl'ience of chiropractic, the prin ciples and facts pertaining to life, are distinct from anatomy, that branch of knowledge which deals with the structure only. In Ci'O'lsiderntion of the above I would give much more time to the study of the science of chiropractic than to that of anatomy. The medical fraternity have 0 studied tissue structure for centuries and yet did not become acquainted with the practical application of the principles which compose the science of chiropractic. The power or faculty of receiving impressions through the tlve enaes ia froni'without, ia of the animal functions, not organic. While in the new-born organic life is perfect, physical life is not yet manifested. The faculty of receiving mental impresaions through the action of sense organs is one of education. Actions known\u00b7 as organic are not of education. The vital organs perform eal'h their normal function from the 11rat; the animal functions have to be de,\u00b7eloped. The recently born child has eyes to see, but it sees not; ears to hear, but it hears not; hands to grasp, BIOLOGY 43 but they do not grip; legs to walk, but they do not take a step. It bas a mouth to suck by which it imbibes nutrition. The taking of sustenance is imperative for the continuanc e of life, therefore it may be considered an organis function directed by the creator, the intelligence which directs, controls and builds the body. The entire organism is devoted to sustain\u00ad ing life. To discern what is food and what is not, the senses of taste and smell are present at birth, even so in the child born a month or two before the proper time. The child shows satisfaction or disgust with ingesta which is pleasant or unpleasant to the taste, as shown by its facial expression, which is not acquired or imitative. As the infant advances in age its face becomes more expressive, its liking for sweet food con\u00ad tinues during lactation, also a dislike for that which is sour. To be a, ,food in a physiological sense' the substance must not affect injuriously the nutritive process by which food stuff is transposed into tissue. In the infant ugar is needed to form fat, furnish elasticity to muscles and nerves. In diabetes the sugar is carried out of the system, in consequence of which the patient becomes quite thin and emaciated. Carbohydrate fat is of a more solid consistency than the fat derived from other sources. The physiological assimilation ,of sugar in the pro\u00ad duction of fat is a vital organic process and cannot be imitated in the laboratory. The human milk contains a ratio of one nf albumen, two of fat and 4.2 of sugar. Acids as ingesta produce rigor, rigidity, shortening of nerves and muscles. Emotional states of the mother modify the qnan\u00ad tity and quality of milk, indicating the connection between the mammary glands and the nervous system. Innate, the spirit, selects that which con\u00ad tains sugar instead of acids. To the infant acids create a toxic effect, a pathological condition, contraction of the nervou'B\u00b7 system. It wlll be readily seen why the controlling intelligence selects substances which are sweet instead of sour. The sense of smell is closelv allied to that of taste. Tbe nose often suggests to the mouth whether to accept or reject an article for in,zesta. Feeling is first experienced and manifested through the lips. What the adult would feel with the hands, the infant tries with its lips and mouth. Feeling with the lips is followed by sensing with the hands and feet, stuffing everything reachable into its mouth to feel and taste. In time sight and hearing are deve!oped . While sight gives us nine-tenths of perceution, it is the last of th._e five senses to come rnto act1v1tv. ( l!reative intellect 1s rare.) veryone cannot be an original thinker.

In physiology a function is a normal and specific action of any tissue, organ, or part of a Jiving animal or plant, and is applied only to the action of an organ. A function is a peculiar action of an organ which has a duty to per form. The performance of a physiological duty is a function. A physio\u00ad logical function is performed in obedience to a command. An organ is a part of, or a definite structure of an animal or plant adapted to perform some specific function. The action or actions of an organ are known as functions. A func\u00ad tion may be expressed normally, or in too great a degree, or subnormal; a deviation either way from the standard creates conditions known a, disease, is disease. The functions include all of the vital phenomena of plants or animals, understood to be performed in a proper manner, unless otherwise stated. All functions are vital, directed by vital force, a force directed by an intelligence. Mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, mai;rnetic, co\u00ad hesion, gravity, centripetal and centrifugal forces differ from vital force which depends upon two original and independent elements, spirit and matter. Vital force may be divided into nenrism, nerve force, and bathism n growth force, energy. These two divisions of vital force are under the . 1 /direction and control of individualized spirits. Phrenism , that force is 1 _, \" of the mental, under the direction of the human will. Vital force is \u00b7 inherent in the organ or organism.! Vital energy is the expression of 11h ,\u00b7 \u00b7' vital force. Function is energy expressed by or through vital force. )The actions which cause us to live are eontrolled by intelligences. Spirit is e,\u00b7erywh<'re throughout the body. Te are HA brain centers from whic \u00b7 it directs all t vital functions. 5 - Functions are divided inb anima and vegetative. The animal func tions are those of the intellect, the voluntary motions. The vege\u00ad tative relates to metabolism, anabolism (constructh\u00b7e m.) and catabolism (destructive m.). The vegetative function includes the un\u00ad conscious, involuntary growing, or functionating after the manner of vegetables . The vegetative fun('tion is of the body; the cumulative is of the spirit. Either may be normal or !lbnormal. Bear in mind that a function is a duty to be performed, that behind the service there is an intelligence demanding a certain obligation, the performance of which ia a function. These orders are known as impulses sent out over the com\u00ad municative nervous system. Nerves carry motor impulses outward and sensational intelligence of the external requirements inward. 44 FUNCTION 45 Physiology treats of the functions performed normally-in the usual manner. Functions which are pathological are performe d in an unusual man,ner. Functions performed as desired are physiological. Innate is a director of the organic functions. Agents which cause an increase or decrease of functionating (disease) are rrom without, never from within. Animal economy includes the laws which harmoniously govern an organiz ation as a whole, man or animals. The functions of a human body, as a whole, are spoken of as the economic functions, the dispo\u00ad sition and regulation of all the organs of the body. The organic fl.!nctions are directed by spirit, as well in the new-born as in the edu\u00ad cated adult. Functions cannot be percented. We may speak of them in a com\u00ad parative w:r, or a relative amount . Function in physiology is applied to and refers to the action of an organ, or a part of an animal or plant.\u00b7 Functio n particularly refers to the special duty to be performed by an organ or parts. Normal or proper functionating requires a normal condition of the nervous system; a condition, we will learn in our next lesson, depending upon a correct position of the osseous framework. Science, we will learn in our last lesson of this course, iB a systema\u00ad tized knowledge which enables us to demonstrate and assign to their place anything and everything known as phenomena which we can per ceive with one or more of our senses; the science of functions include tht accumulated kno'Yledge of the qualities of the various functions of living tissue. Functional activity refers to the physiological or pathological t,ction of an organ. Instead of examining the cells of dead tissue with a microscope for aberrant functions I have given my investigations to functional deviation in living tissue. I want to repeat, in order to emphasize one of the physiological principles of chiropractic , that the performance of functions, normal or abnormal, depend upon the condition of the organ and the quality of innervating nervous tissue. The vegetative function is that office in the human econom y which controls the power of growing. It is concerned . with nutrition and growth. In anatomy it refers to those organs and tissue which contributer to nutrition, the development and reproduction; those organs which have to do with the growth of the physical body. The processes of assimila\u00ad tion of nutritive material and its conversion into living substances i1 known as anabolism. The cumulative function determines the quality of that which is accumulated by the mental, it corresponds in the spirit to 'the vegetative function in the physical. The quantity, character, peculiarity and the 46 THE CHIROPRACTOR nature of the contents of the mental storehouse depends upon the condi\u00b7 tion of the physical; therefore, chiropractors knowing how to adjust the osseous system, the tension framework, have a normal and a reous. duti_ form. As the vegetative function is subservient to the vital, so.the cumulative is subordinate to the mental. It is to the spiritual body just what the vegetative function is to the physical body. Normal functionating and normal temperature are co-existent, they constitute health. Disease is an alteration in tissue and function. The performance of functions above or below that of normal activity is due to the change in renitency, firmness and tension of the organ or part per\u00b7 forming the act. Impulses delivered with normal force result in. orders normally performed. Motive force exaggerated or decreased during the transit of an impulse over the nervous system results in conditions known as disease. The vegetative function depends upon e amount of vital force used in arousing latent energy. The quality an<\\ amount of mental impressions depend upon the cumulative function. Sane or insane ideas are the result of normal or abnormal perception. We receive impressions from the external world through the senses of touch, taste, smell, hearing and sight; qualities of the nervous system. We obtain knowledge, re\u00b7 ceive impressions, take cognizance of the existence and character of phenomena )y means of sensation-JDolecular vibration of the nervous system. The force of sensations d impressions depend upo1!'.\" the. condi- tion of the nervous tissue. a, A chanse in the structure or position of an organ creates over or under, too much or too little, fiincfion, a condition known as disease. There is a difference between ' ' disease is the resul\"t\"of over or under function '' and over or under function fs disease. Functions performed y is health, in an abnormal manner or amount is disease, a de\u00b7 parture from a state of health. Physiology treats of functions performed normally, Pathology dis\u00ad courses upon functions performed in an unusual manner. The performance of functions depend upon the amount of energy ltored and aroused by innervation. Pathological physiology is the performance of functions by an excess or a deficiency of vital force. Teratology is the science of abnormal growths, the result of vege\u00ad tative functions performed in an abnormal and unusual amount. All agents which cause increase or decrease of functionating (dis\u00ad ase) are from without-could not be from the spirit-from within. Vitality runs the vegetative function, while intellectuality directa tlte cumulative function. As the vegetative function may produce teratism, even ao, the cumulative may accumulate monstrous intellectual concep tions. As we carry with us in this world perfect or imperfect bodies, FUNCTION 47 just so, we tae with us into the next world sane or insane ideas pthered in this world.\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7-- The cumulativ e function determines the contents of the intellectual storehouse. The condition of the physical determines the qualification of the mental I We take with us into the beyond just what we have mentally gathered in this preparatory stage, whether those thought.I, impreBBions and recollections, are sane or insane, normal or monatroU1, of reason or of a frealdah mind. I VERTEBRAL ADJUSTING The direct cause of disease (abnormal functionating and morbid tis sue) is subluxated joints; about 95 per cent. of which are slightly dis placed vertebrae; the balance will be found in other joints than those of the vertebral co,lumn. There are no nerves between the articulati l\\.g surfaces of joints. / Luxations of the cause corns and bunions. ) A dorsal vertebra displaced ever so little, twisted out of its normal alignment, disarranges the costocentral, costovertebral, costo articulation, the juncture of the head of the rib with the body of the vertebra. A thorae.ic vertebra racked from its normal position affects the costo transverse joint, the articulation of the tuberosity of the rib with the transverse process of the vertebra. Its dislocation must of necessity displace the intervertebral articulation. The displaced bones of any luxated joint may impinge upon a nerve, or by their displacement cause a nerve to be stretched, thereby creating inflammation. A dislocated ver tebra cannot do otherwise than displace two (cervical and lumbar), folll' (eleventh and twelfth dorsal) or six (the first to and including the tenth dorsal) articulations causing nerve tension. Some authors on chiropractic state and use cuts to show how nervea are pinched because of occluded intervertebral foramina, the closing up of the foramina attributed to accidents or a settling together of verte brae. These writers now use the word impingement instead of pinch, seeing the founder of chiropractic makes use of that term, yet they do not compleliend the difference between a nerve being impinged AGAINST and one pinched BETWEEN two harder substances. There are no inter vertebral cartilage between the atlas and occiput and the atlas and axis, that by compression might narrow or occlude the intervertebral foramen. Atlas luxations are the cause of a large per cent. of diseases, which may be relieved by adjusting the displaced atlas. The displacement of other joints than those of the vertebral column cause nerve tension, a stretched condition; disease the result, and yet, no possibility of a nerve being pinched. I find that disease is caused by displaced vertebrae or other joints pressing against nerves; nerves are stretched because of displaced bones; the replacing of displaced portions of the neuroskeleton releases tension, consequently the conditions which cause disease are relieved. The spinal cord does not entirely fill the vertebral canal. A wide space, or rather three spaces, intervene between its surface and the wall of the canal; this arrangement affords freedom of movement of the verte bra! column without undue pressure or tension on the spinal cord. Two of these spaces are continued and surround the spinal nerves as they pass through the foramina affording the same freedom from pressure to the 48 49 VERTEBRAL ADJUSTING ---------- ---------=---- ---------- spinal nerves as is accorded to the spinal cord. The difference in the height of a man at twenty-five and eighty, bar.ring abnormal curvatures and luxations, considering the natural shortening or approximation of vertebrae, does not exceed one inch, usually less than half an inch. This shrinkage in height must be divided between the twenty-nine articulations from occiput to ankle. A slight bending of the neck of the femur should, also, be included. Vertebrae have epiphysial annular plates on the upper and lower surfaces of their bodies; each are developed from an ossifying center at the fifteenth to the twentieth year and join the body of the vertebra by the twenty-fifth year. These epiphysial plates are thickest at the circumference, gradu\u00ad ally thinning toward the center. A vertebral column at or about the age of fifteen will show the various stages of fusion of the vertebral bodies and their sttrface plates. Bear in mind the distinction between the ver tebral plates and the intervertebral fibro-cartilage discs; the cartilage of the former become ossified and eventually a par of the bodies, while the latter always remain cartilage. The point I wish to notice is that these epiphysial rings at the age of twenty-five are quite prominent; as age advances they approximate the height of the center of the interver\u00ad tebral snrface. Dividing this contraction of the 'Vertebral column and limbs among all the articulations, it would average one-thirtieth of an lnrh. It should be also remembered that the spinal nerves become l!lightly contracted in length, firmer and narrowed in their diameter as age advances. This slight difference mentioned in the length and diameter of the thirty-one pairs of nerves which arise from the spinal cord and pass out between the vertebrae , would fully make up the trivial variation 'found in the length of the spinal column and the size of the intervertebral foramina in adult and old age, as much so, as that found in the ad\u00ad vancing stages of growth from infancy to adult age. Kyphotic persons, known as hump-backs, will compare favorably, regarding health and longevity, with those who have not deformed back\u00ad bones. When we conEider that the spinal cord is freely movable within the spinal canal and that _the spinal nerves are afforded ample space for their emergence from the intervertebral foramina, we will see that normal movements do not compress the spinal cord or spinal nerves. The very slight difference in the size of the spinal foramina between the age of twenty-five and eighty would not be worth considering. Take into con\u00ad sideration the play, the amount of space between the occipital and the poterior arch of the atlas and the size of the nerves which pass out over the grooves, and between the atlas and the occiput there is no interverte\u00ad bral cartilage, only a very thin hya!ine, articular cartilag, which, if its thicknes was shrunken to half, or if it was all absorbed, would make no so THE CHIROPRACTOR appreciab le difference in the size of the gap between the atlas and oeci\u00b7 put, sufficient to compress or pinch a nerve--even if such were the ease, would not the bending of the head forward ever 110 little relieve the com\u00ad pression by enlarging the gapf Take your spinal column in hand. Do you not see that there is no intervertebral cartilage between the atlas and axis and the occipital bone and the first vetebra f Do you not see that the long, wide gap between the atlas and axis affords no possible chance for nerve compression-no more than there is between the atlas and oeeiputt If you think the 1lrst or second spinal nerves can be pinched, compressed or squeezed by the approximation of the atlas and the axis or the drawing together of the oeeiput and the atlas, just try to explain such a condition to your next prospective patient. The same kind of pressure that causes corns and bunions, and the many diseases which arise from impingement or a change in the amount of tension of the 11.rst and second pairs of cervical nerves, must also cause disease elsewhere. The rule must hold good throughout the body. The filaments of nervous tissue create heat and transmit impulae11, it ill the only structure which can increase or decrease the amount of heat, increase or decrease the velocity of impulaea or modify the force of reffex action, the bounding back of an impulae. Remember, the amount of function depends upon the renitency, the impulaive force obtained b:, the boUDding baek. Ease and disease depend upon the condition of nerves.

The double axial vertebral nerve cqiu are distributing agencies for the nerves of organic life. They control the circulation of the blood, respiration, nutrition and all the vital processes. They are the involuntary nerves, not directly under the con trol of the human will. They are connected by communicating nervea, one with the other, and with the various organs, blood veBBels and viacera.

Local inflam\u00ad matory conditions occur, such as necrosis and supperation of the in\u00ad testines, lungs, spleen, liver and degenerative changes in the kidneys. The vertebral ganglionic chains distribute fibers to various parts of the body, carry involuntary impulses, whether normal or abnormal, create functions which result in health or disease. To use the language of pathologists, '' The system reacts in some way, as yet unknown, to check its progress and to bring it to a termina.\u00ad tion at the end of four weeks.\" \"It is impossible to cut short the disease.'' In some ca.sea the symptoms of typhoid continue for months or years. This unlimited condition is known as ambulating or walking typhoid. Cretinism appears during the first three years of life. It is a con\u00b7 dition of physical, mental degeneracy and non-development.

The '' sympathetic nervous system is based upon superstition and \"'\\ while in vogue now, will not be in fifty years. It is unknown to the / P. S. C. and is replaced with a direct brain cell-to-cell nerve connection. 'We have said right along that the basis of the sympathetic nervous system was wrong because we are taught that man has 129 ganglions which are equivalent to 129 brains. When I saw there was no use for a sympathetic nervous system, I threw it out, and then just had to put something better in its place, so I discovered Direct Mental Impulse.'' Since D. D. Palmer ceased to be the editor of The Chiropractor, its pages do not teach and its clinics do not make use of the sympathetic nervoua system, the cranial nerves, the accessory, or communicating, or recurrent nerves. A ease of hemiplegia will illustrate the difference between the '' direct mental impulse'' theory discovered by B. J. Palmer and 110 taught to his students and that of the nervous system found in man alive and dead, and known by all anatomists. To reach each portion of the body affected by hemiplegia by the '' direct method'' would require the adjusting of a half-dozen or more vertebrae, as given by the '' com\u00ad bination of functions'' method. This form of paralysis is the result of CENTER PLACE AND SECOND CENTER PLACE 53 one displaced vertebra impinging upon one nerve and not a '' combination of functions.\" Considering the ganglionic chain of the sympathetic nerv\u00ad ous system, the impingement is only on one nerve, one bundle of nerve fibers which are distributed to the parts affected by the sympathetic ganglia. These ganglia are relays in the pathways for the transmission of impulses from the regions in which they arise to the tissue in which they are distributed. Communication between the central nervous system and the sympathetic is established through both efferent and afferent fibers. All spinal nerves are joined by gray rami communicantes from the sympathetic trunk. Corresponding communications exist be tween the cranial nerves and the sympathe tic, but these occur farther toward the periphery and in not so regular. a manner 3Jl the communica tions between the spinal nerves and the sympathetic system. Through this ganglionic distributing agency the fibers of one nerve reach one half of the body. This impingement will be found at center-place.

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM h biology, any part of the body having a special function ia an organ. In all organic beings there is a vital principle called nerve-for ce, nerve energy, nerve-impulse, or vital force. The force of the vital and intellectual depend upon the condition of the nervous system for the amount of their expression. h biology, a system consists of those organs which taken as a whole \u00b7contribute toward one important complex vital function-those structures which are anatomically or functionally related. We have the human sys\u00ad tem, the whole bodily organism, the osseous s., the muscular s., the di\u00ad gestive a., glandular s., the vascular s., the nervous s., the eerebro-apinal 1., the centrals., the sympathetic a., the peripheral s., the ganglionic s. The nervous tissue contained in the cranium is known as the encephalon or brain; it oblongata. The medulla oblongata is the upward continuation of the spinal cord, the transition is at the lower level of the foramen magnum. The medulla is from three-fourths to an inch long. The hat cerrieal nerve emerges from the vertebral canal between the occipital bone ud the posterior arch of the atlas. The hypoglossal, the twelfth cranial nerve, arises from the medulla oblongata inside the ring of the foramen magnum. The spinal accessory portion of the vagus nerve, the eleventh 1pinal nerve, arises in the cervical region of the cord, sometimes as low down as the sixth cervical nerve, including filaments or rootlets from each cervical as it passes upward. It is the only nerve which finds a passage way through the large oval opening in the occipital bone. The pons Varolil lies between the medulla oblongata and the fore and back brains. Pons means a bridge; Varolii is the name of the person who first wrote of this portion of the brain. The cerebellum is the posterior brain mass lying behind the pons and medulla and beneath the posterior portion of the cerebrum. It consists of two lateral hemispheres united by a narrow middle portion. The\u00b7 cerebrum forms the largest part of the encephalon. The two hemispheres are joined by the corpus collosum composed of nerve fibres by which every part of the cerebral hemispheres are connected, with each other. The spinal cord, the central nervous system, occupies the upper two-thirds of the vertebral canal. It extends from the foramen magnum to the lower border of the body of the first lumbar vertebra. It does not fill the entire vertebral canal in length or breadth. 54 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 55 Gray says the encephalon or brain is a complex organ in which resides the highest functions-co nsciousness, ideation, judgment, volition, and intellect-together with the centers of special sense and for the mechanisms of life (respiration and circulation), and the agent of the will. It specializes the manifestations of the intellect. Consciousness, ideation, judgment, volition and will are of the intellect, the understanding, creations of the mind. It specializes the manifestations of the intellect. It particularizes the exhibitions of life, actions created by intelligence. Feeling, sensation, the faculty of perceiving stimulus and conscious ness are senses of education, '' centers of special sense,'' therefore, of the mind. \"The mechanisms of life (respiratiort and circulation)\" I would prefer to say, respiration and circulation are two of the requisites of life, two indispensables upon which intelligent action depends. Respira tion and circulation are not controlled by the mind, .a.re not intellectual faculties, their action is past our comprehension; they are under the guidance of a superior intelligence than that of man. In which of the seven divisions of the brain does the mind residef In which of the seven does the fnnctional creator exist; where is his 'throne from whence he rules the organism f Gray tells us that. the spinal cord is composed of grey and white anbstaneees interlaced with minute fibrils, some of which serve as eon\u00b7 ducting paths between the brain centers and the spinal centers, that a1110Ciating systems unite these conducting paths. He also states, \"A. purely anatomical examination fail to reveal the functional relations in the fibres. '' Through the nervous system the intellectual receives all impressions and appreciation of the outer world. Nerve vibration is associated with consciousness. By and through it thon adapts itself to thon 's environments. The bodily functions control all physiological action. By and through the sympathetic portion of the nervous system life is main tained. Through evolution the nervous system has undergone remarkable differentiation and specialization attaining its maximum as a dominant ruler in the human species; however, some of the animals and birds excel iu some of the senses, for instance that of smell and direction . Anatomist usually divide the nervous system into two divisions, the cerebro-epinal and the sympathetic. I prefer those of epecial eense and vegetative, the animal and organic. The intellectual controls the nerve of animal life, while the epiritual intelligence runs the nerves of organic life. Each nerve is a cord or bundle of fibers, a sheath or covering 56 THE CHIROPRACTOR containing filaments, each fiber or filament being a distinct route of inter\u00ad courae of motor (mental) or sensory impulses from their origination to their destination. Nerve fibers do not inosculate or anastomose as do blood veHels. Read page 865, fifth paragraph, of Adjuster . The spinal nerve just as it emerges from the intervertebral foramen, divides into four branches. The posterior primary division divides into an internal and external branch. The internal supplies the bones, joints and fhe muscles about them with innervation; it may or may not supply the kin overlying them. The posterior primary division of the spinal nerve springs from the trunk immediately outside the intervertebrnl foramina, passes backward between the adjacent transverse processes. These divide and subdivide repeatedly, while the distribution to certain areas are more or less con\u00ad stant, they are very variable. No nerve, cutaneous or muscular, has a de!mte prescribed area of distribution. The meningeal or recurrent branch\"8 are very small and variable. They re-1,nter the vertebral canal through the intervertebra l foramen and supply the membranes and blood vessels of the cord and the vertebral ligaments. The posterior division of the spinal nerve furnishes sympathetic fibers for distribution in the walla of blood vessels. Sometimes there ia an inereue or a decrease in the number of the vertebrae in the vertebral column; in such cases there is a corresponding increase or decrease in the number of spinal nerves. The dorsal root of the Int cervical or BUb-occipital nerve in rare cases may be rudimentary or entirely absent. The first and second cervical nerves do not pass out\u00ad ward from the spinal canal through intervertebral foramina, but between the occipital bone and the posterior arch of the atlas and the dorsal arch of the atlas and the lamina of the axis. The thirty-first nerve is occasionally absent, there are sometimes one or two additional rudi mentary caudal pairs of minute filaments below the thirty-first. About seven-ten ths of the body is fluid. The blood is about one\u00ad Wrteenth of the weight of the human body, Bead for yourself in The Adjuster, at your leisure, pages 231, 323 to 830, third paragraph on 733 (make correction on page 733, last two lines of third paragraph, read in the dorsal and cervical from the opposite side in the lumbar-, and 805 and 806. In the vertebrate animals, the nervous system consists of two divisions. One includes the brain, spinal cord, the cranial and spinal nerves. The other division is the sympathetic nervous system. The activities of the body are controlled by nerve centers, by means of fibers which extend to all parts of the body, there ending ip the muscles. Those nerve fibers which originate in organs, receive and send sensations, are called sensory. Nerves which are connected with the central nervous system may be made up of fibers which bear mes-THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 57 ages from sense organs, in the skin or elsewhere, to the central nervous 1ystem, the 1ensory fibers, or to other fibers (the motor fibers) which carry impulses from the central nervous system to the outside. Some nerves are made up of both kinds of fibers, they are called mixed nerves. The nervou11 ayBtem i11 twofold in its stimuli, that which is somatic, from the external world, concerned in animal life, the outward actions of animal11, and that which is interested in the processes of nutrition and reproduction, the visceral, the excretory, the alimentary tract, the blood and lymph of the vascular system. It i1 twofold in its activity; it receives stimuli which ineites incen\u00b7 tive action, and motor responses which respond in movemen ts. It is twofold regarding diseases, that which is somatic, pertaining to the bod:rwalls, skin, muscles and skeieton, and that of the viscera of the four cavities. Of all those organs collectively which are of the same or similar tissue which especially contribute toward one of the important, complex, vital functions; the nervous system is the only one which is directly aft'ected with disease, all others being indirectly acted upon by their connection with the nervous system. The cerebro-spinal and the sympathetic aystems are known as the vol\u00ad untary and the involuntar y. The former includes the nerves of IIDimal life, .while the latter performs the functions of organic life, Heat production depen upon the excitation of the nervous ayatem-upon the amount of molecular vibration. Respiration, circulation and heat are eaential to life. These functions are performed in proportion to the in nervating force which, if exeeBBive or deficient, disease or death is the reault. Remember, disease is functions performed in abnormal ount. Heat may become so intense as to soften, necrose 'nerve tiaaue, thereby came a diminution of vibratory action, of whic we will learn more in our future lessons. Read page ,415 of Adjuster. I have always stated and maintained that over or under functionat ing is disease, not \"that disease is the result of over or under function.\" There is a vast diff'erence between these two statements. Let me repeat, over or under functionating, change of structure and position of one or more organs when present constitute a condition known as disease. Normal functionating, normal structure and normal position of organs are always present in health. When the organs of the body are in normal position, their structure normal, their functions performed in normal amount, there is health. Life is intelligent action. Absence of life ia coemtent with the aeparation of intelligence and material, 11pirit and matter, followed by diSBolution, di11integration, aeparation into its component parts of the material body. The intellectual portion known as spirit i11 a,ternal, always existed and always will. Material always was, its form has been subject to change, as much can be said of spirit.

Neuritis, Arteritis and Rheumatism. Diseases a.re classified (nosology) by pathologists according to the standpoint from which they are viewed. Hereditary, congeuital and acquired. Infantile, adult and senile. Conformable to their origin, zymotic (malaria, small pox and typhoid), infectious (transmission with\u00b7 out contact) and specific (s. remedy, s. medicine, s. disease, having a specific cause, as syphilis and the eruptive fevers). Agreeably to their manner of occurrence , sporadic (cholera and cretinism), endemic (belong\u00ad ing to a special part of the country), pandemic (affecting all persons of a city or country). Toxic (poison). Compatible to their lesions (organic, structural change and functional). Local, general and constitutional (hereditary, in consequence of inherent or acquired defects). Neuritis, an inflammation of the fibers of the nerve. Arteritis, an inflammation of the nerves of blood vessels. While arteritis is known 7 as inflammation of an artery, the inflammation is really confined to the nervi vasorum, the network of nerves which surrounds a blood vessel. Rheumatism, an inflammation of the nerves of a oint. Medical authors claiiii rheumatism among the self-limited affections, for which they give many probable causes. Spinal ne\"es, see The Adjuster, page 315. Neuritis and neuralgia, as conditions, are closely related. The former refera to the inflammatory condition, and the latter to the pain. The walls of arteries and veins are composed of a fibrilated sheath and three coats. The vasa vasorum, bl<'od vessels of the blood vessels, enter the external coats, from which branches enter the middle coat, but not the internal. The blood is returned from the walls of the vessels by small veins, venae vasorum. The blood vessel walls are covered and permeated with a plexus, a network of nerves, the nervi vasorum. See Gray's Anatomy, page 577. Arteritis is an inflammation of an artery, really an inflammation of the nervi vasorum. The inflammation may be in any one or more of the coats which form the vascular walls of arteries and veins. Arteritis obliterans, the closure or obliteration of the lumen of a blood vessel. Arteritis deformans, changes in the walls of blood vessels due to infiam mation. Softening, calcification, fatty degeneration, abscesses, ruptures, hemorrhages, ulceration, infiltration between the coats of the artery, are because of inflammation of the nervi vasorum. Infl.ammation (excessive heat) causes the vascular wall to become necrosed, softer than usual. Arterio-sclerosis may be pathological or phyaiological, as determined by age. High tension and rapid pulse may be physiological or pathological. 60 NEURITIS, Physiological func\u00ad tions pathologically performed are exaggerated or perverted capacities of the _structure involved. Hemorrhage of blood vessels, excessive exudation of fluid through their walls is but a physiological process, the emigration of corpuscles, exaggerated. Rheumatism may be acute or chronic, the former is characteristized by inflammation, fever, perspiration, pain and swelling of the joint.a. The latter is slow in progress, the fibrou8 structure of the joints are thickened and contracted. The fibers of the body affected may be that of nerves, muscles or tendons. Rheumatism is attended with loss of motion and often more or less deformity. Gout is a form of rheumatism, more especially of the toes. Gonorr,l\\eal rheumatism is the result of gonorrheal poison contracting nerves, drawing the second lumbar vertebra out of alignment. This dis\u00b7 placed vertebra impiges upon nerves, causing nerve tension, continues the eurethral and rheumatic inflammation. Gonorrhea is often compli\u00ad cated with prostitis, inflammation of the prostate gland, cystitis, i. of the bladder, ephidymitis, i. of the upper part of the testicles, salpingitis, i. of the fallopian tube and other pelvic diseases. These accompanying ail\u00ad ments are because of displacements of lumbar veitebrae brought about by reflex action, an involuntary nerve contraction, the result of neuritis (lnflammation \u00b7of a nerve). Nerve and muscle contraction draw vertebrae out of alignment. Adjust the first, second or third, lumbar vertebra. Acute rheumatism should be relieved by one adjustment. In auch eases, how about urie acid and bacteria as causes f Gorby.\u00b7? Inflammation may be known by redness, enlargement, excessive heat and sensitiveness to pressure. An inflamed nervi! may be recognized, when subcutaneous, by its hardened condition, i_ts sensitiveness to pres sure and its enlarged diameter, It is contracted lengthwise and enlarged diametrically. \\ Knowing these conditions we are able to trace the path way of subcutaneous nerves by palpation, ) Neurology is the science which treats of nerves and their disorder. Nerves which are abnormal in their structure create abnormally per\u00b7 formed functions, possess a greater or a lesser amount of heat than nor mal, their carrying capacity of impulses is above or below normal be cause of increased or decreased vibration . A neurologist is one versed in the anatomy of nerves, their physio\u00ad logical and pathological function-normal and abnormal action. Read last paragraph, page 147 of The Adjuster. Neuralgia has many prefixes, such as mammary '1\u00b7 intercostal n., degenerative n., sciatic n., idiopathic n. and stump n. \\Sometimes an operation or an amputation, the stump of the subcutaneous portion covered by the sear and the portion amputated becom'e the seat of neuralgic pains, which may render life miserable. Tlie wearing of an 62 THE CHIROPRACTOR &rtitlcial limb is sometimes imposaible, as light pressure against the 1tump will produce severe pain, owing to the sensitive condition of nerves. ( These conditions may be relieved by adjusting the displaced vertebrae which impinge against the nerves.\\ The same pressure which caused the Eain before amputatio n_ is yet pre6ing upon the same nerves, therefore a true neuritis continues. The severed ends of the nerves may become bulbous, neuromata. This diseased condition is known as ampu\u00ad tation, nenroma. As the nerve is composed of many fibers there may be multiple neuromata. Amputation neuromata are composed of proliferated nerve-fibers turned upon themselves and imbedded in a dense fibrous growth. Bead pages 472 and 473 of The Adjuster. The walls of an artery consist of a sheath and three coats. The in\u00ad bmmation may be confined to any one or more of these coverings which are known &11 the external, middle and internal coats. The walls of the blood vnsels are permeated with a plexus of nerves.

The medical profeaion are not agreed a to the caue, hljurl or beneftt1 derived from imlammation and fever. Stengel' Text-Book of Pathology, date 1907, on page 45 and 41, under the head of Nature of Fever, aaya, \"These proce11e1 of heat-pro\u00ad duction and heat-dilaipation are regulated in an orderly manner under the inJluence of the nervous system. Special centers for the production, clinipation, and regulation of heat have been described by the ph,-iol ogiatl, \u00b7 though their location and method of operation still remain iD doubt. Whatever the exact mechanism may be found to be, it ia quite certain that in some way the nervous system exercise a control over production an\u00a2 discharge of heat. '' While fever occasions many dilturbance ltrDd leads to varioua pathological consequences, it is not improbable that there ia a certain meuun of usefulne111, in iL'' KcJ'&rland statea, '' In11ammation i mm of phenomena mani\u00ad feated by an injured tiame.

His temperature is 105 degree Play\u00ad llieians remained at his bedside throughout the night.'' The production of animal heat is no more a process, a aeries of actions, than the heat created in a nail by a quick extraction hom a piece of hard wood in which it hacl been driven. In animals and vegetation the temperature is increased by a greater atomic action, while in lnani mate substances the heat i increased by a greater molecular vibration. Heat production in the animal economy is created by the vibration of molecules of which nerves are compoaed. It is a biologieal fact that nerves vibrate in proportion to the amount of tension. ere ia no al center for heat production, regulation and diBBipation. Beat 11 C-c tion of the whole nervous system, a discovery made by D.,D. Palmer on July 1, 1903. 63 64 THE CHIROPRACTOR Fever is a symptom, it is associated with pathological conditions. Fever is not a disturbe r of functions ; it, of itself, is excessive heat, dif\u00ad fused thronghout the body, however, it is always concomitant with actions which are performed in too great a degree. The quantity of heat is \"regulated\" by the amount of nerve\u00ad vibration. The '' orderly manner'' is determined by nerve tension. \"The influence (power) of the nervous system\" to produce heat in nor\u00ad mal qvantity depends upon the ability of the creator of life to transmit nervous impulses from a ganglionic center (Gould), known to physiol\u00ad ogists as nervous influence, nervous energy, nervous force and nerve stimulus. The tiseue of the nerve itself does not furnish the energy or the force. The impulses, the incitement of the mind or spirit (Webster), the influence of suggestion or prompting, furnishes a stimulus which arouses energy or force for the performance of functional acts. Instead of the nervous system '' exercising a control over the pro duction of discharge of heat,\" the animal-tissue (the nervous system) is controlled by an intelligence known as spirit. Intelligence produces the actions which constitute life by animating the material body. The ''usefulness'' of fever is made manifest by M. D. 's while sitting at the bedside of the patient, waiting and watching for the crisis of fever. Dr. Davis in his brief statement bove wisely sums up the opons and conclusions of the medical profession regarding fever. The word mechanism \u00b7 is mentioned twice in the above quotations. Webster defines mechanism as the arrangement or i;elation of the parts of a machine. Man, animal brntes and vegetables possess llfe, vital force, are not machines. Dorlnnd 's Dictionary gives 100 kinds of fever and Gould's 150. Fever is a condition in which the bodily temperature is elevated above the normal. The pulse is accelera ted, its movement increased, there is general derangement of functions, thirst and loss of appetite. Thirst, a desire to drink because of dryness, because of an inflamma\u00ad tion of the mucous membranes of the mouth, fauces, pharynx, esophagus and stomach. Excessive heat dries and thickens the mucus of the mucou1 membranes, water is cooling and moistens the mucus. Fevers are said to be symptomatic when functions are performed in an abnormal manner , producing vital phenomena not in accord with those of health-recog nized by signs and symptoms. Signs of disease may be objective, apparent to the observer by examination , and subjective, when known only by the patient. Signs include auscultation, percuBBion, commemorative (those preceding the disease), diagnostic (those which accompany it and reveal the nature and seat of the disease), prognostic when they indicate its probable duration and termination. Feven are essential when general, not depending on any local alfection. Idiopathic FEVER 65 when they arise without any known cause. Self-limited when they run a definite course under any and all treatment, and terminate in health or in death. Surrounding temperature makes no difference in the temperature of the body. The body does not depend upon external heat for its temper\u00ad ature, but, upon nerve tension. Esquimaux often experience 60 to 80 degrees below zero. Equatorial countries endure 130 degrees above, making a variation of 210 degrees. The heat in oceanic steamers often 150 degrees. Some persons take Turkish baths which by frequent exposures are brought to the boiling point. Persons have lived for a 7few minutes in rooms wherein the temperature was 211. The \"Sala mander\" withstood for 14 minutes a temperature of 338 degrees. His pulse on entering was 76, on coming out po, yet there was no variation of bodily temperature. While the pulse varies, more or lees, with the change of bodily temperature, exercise and mental agitation, but it does not accord with animal heat. A rise of 2 or 3 degrees in the aged is more alarming than in the youth. As age advances nerve-tissue is less elastic, firmer, less yielding, not so pliable, does not so readily adapt itself to heat modifi_cations. Fever may be the result of traumatism or poisons. Nerves excited cause hyperthermia. Heat is a function of nerves-not of bJood. Rheumatism may be from trauma or poison. Gonorrhea is a direct effect from poison, while gonorrheal rheumatism is indirect, the poison causes nerve contraction, nerve tension draws vertebrae out of align\u00ad ment; vertebrae awry strenerves:effect of which we name rheumatism. The pulse in scarlatina is more rapid, in typhoid fever slower. ' Some poisons excite, while others depress. In scarlatina the poison excites, in typhoid it depresses. This difference is owing to\u00b7 the nature of the poison ingested, injected or inhaled. Delafield and Pruden in their work on pathology state, \"lnff.amma\u00ad tion is a modification of physiological processes.'' They should have said, infiammation modifies physiological processes and the general tem\u00ad perature of the body. Fever is destructive, not conservative. In fever anabolism is decreased and catabolism increased. The normal temperature of the body is about 98.5, although it drops almost two degrees after we have gone to sleep. It is ordinarily the highest at 5 p. m. because of labor, and the lowest at 4 a. m. on account of relaxation . The body temperature may be two or three degrees higher during violent exercise owing to nerve excitation. Bodily tem\u00ad perature depends upon nerve innervation, nerve excitation, not blood circulation. Bodily heat may be increased by exercise, electricity, poisons, pres-66 THE CHIROPRACTOR sure on nerves and an undue amount of tension. Mechanical action excites, feet and hands are warmed by friction, temperature is increased because of nerve excitation. Tbe chafing of nerves excite greater action, while blood circulation and its temperature remains the same. Masseurs,\u00b7 osteopaths and spondylotherapists, who rub, stroke, knead and tap the superficial soft parts of the body with the hand or an instrument for remedial purposes, excite or depress the action and functions of the nervous tissue, increasing or lessening nerve vibration, consequently, changig the temperature of the body. Operations are followed by a rise of temperature because of injury to the nervous tissue. Electricity stimulates, because of greater nerve tension. Poisons create more or less contraction of nerve tissue. Impingements excite, create greater tension. Nerve injuries produce excessive heat, consequently, pathological conditions. We may have healthy (physiological) changes of temperature during the healing of wounds and fractures of bones. In neuralgia there is no fever, no constitutional disturbance. Whyf In neuritis the tension and pain is in the whole length of the nerve, while in rheumatism and many other diseases the stretch, the tension, is confined to a very short portion of a nerve. Acute and chronic are antithetical terma; when applied to disease they refer to the duration. A disease is said to be acute when it is severe, of short duration, attended with danger, of rapid progreu and its termination for better or worse is quickly reached. Chronic diseases progress slowly and are of long duration. Acute diseases should not become chronic and will not if the dispkced portion of the neuroskeleton is properly adjusted. Brain fever is ditfosed heat from an inflamed cerebrum or cerebellum. or their membranes. Pneumonia, pneumonitis, is an in1lammation of the lungs, when its diffused heat is spoken of it is referred to as lung fever. Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, a serous membrane which covers the walls and viscera of the thoracic cavity. The exudation which collects upon its surface or in its cavity is the thickened viscid liquid serous secretion of the pleura. These diseases are acute, each should be \u00b7)\u00b7 relieved by one adjustment, one thrust upon the vertebra which is imping\u00ad ing upon the nerve whose fibers ramify the portion affected. In diseases of only a few days' duration, the vertebra does not become ill-shapened.( In chronic diseases, those of long standing, the vertebrae become wedge\u00ad shaped; auch require much time to reshapen back to normal. '? 7 Constipation and Costiveness. Standard dictionaries use these two terms as synonyms, meaning nearly one and the same. Medical dictionaries make only a slight di1ference. In the practice of chiropractic there ill a vast di1ference; this discrimination should be duly considered. Chiropractors should make a special distinction between constipation and costiveness. The two conditions resewble each other in the infrequency of evacuation, in no other sign or symptom are they alike. In the character of the stool there is a great di1ference. In costiveness the feces are scanty, dry, hard, compact and in chunks, yet the co1or is normal; the fluids from the spleen,' pancreas, liver and intestine give it the normal color. In constipation the character of the stool may be normal; the sluggish movement of the feces may be owing to atony, a lack of tone or ten.iion, or a relaxed condition of the bowels, or the organs of the abdomen may be :ff.acid, weak and displaced. The prolapsed condition of the stomach, kidneys, uterus, bowels, rectum, the conditions known as hernia, floating kianeys, prolapus uteri, and hemorrhoids are because of a lack of tone, a relaxation of the abdominal nerves. Chiropractors should become aware of this condition resulting from relaxation and undue tension. Constipation is due to functional inactivity of the intestinal canal, or from a lack of biliary, pancreatic and other secretions; obstructions of the intestinal canal, or paresis, paralysis of the intestinai walls, or the use of certain food or drugs, or a general depre_sion of vital activity. Each of these when known will suggest to a chiropractor the change of inject& necessary and the proper adjustment'.-not adjustments. In constipation there is a lack o'f vermicular or muscular motion, waves of alternate circular contraction and relaxation of the intestinal tube by which the contents are propelled onward, as is the circulation of the blood by the nervi vasorum. There is a condition known as reversed peristalsis, in which the waves of contraction and relaxation are reversed, the contents of the intestinal tract, or a portion of it is reversed and thrown backward. When the bile is furnished in an unusual quantity it is thrown upward and into the stomach, and from thence it is ejected through the mouth. In peristaltic unrest the bowels are in a state of abnormal mobility, the evacuations too frequent. The lesion should be located and the over-tense nerves restored to their normal tonicity. Coarse food, \u00b7 such as corn meal and graham, increases the vermi\u00ad cular motion, because of its action, excitation by chafing of the nervous tissue of the intestine, whereas, white :ff.our does not excite,, it is smooth and pasty. 67 68 THE CHIROPRACTOR Costiveness is accounted for by a lack of moistur e; the kidneys are too active, they secrete and excrete more than their usual quantity of fluid, thereby robbing the stool tract of its normal amount of moisture. Bear in mind that costiveness is because of a k. p. the distance between its 1iiferior articulating processes and those of the first lumbar are increased, thereby stretching the nerves which innervate the kidneys. Tense nerves, like stretched wires of a musical instrument, increases vibration, excitement and beat, a condi\u00ad tion known as inflammation. Constipation and costiveness are two en tirely, distinctly different conditions. Bones have a normal limit in their movement-I refer to the mobility of joints, the articulations, the places of union between two or more iones-more than normal is abnormal, pathological. '-How do I diagnose, determine the nature of the case and know where to adjusU This is done in far less time than it takes to describ e the diagnostication, and much more comprehensive were you to see it performed. For the class a few cases demonstrated is worth more than any number not shown or proven. For example, a case is presented for class benefit.( An ingrown toe nail, a callus on the plantar surface, soft and hard coms. I may say to you that the ingrown toe nail is because of' lumbar luxation, the soft and hard corns are fro slightly displaced joints, that is, the articular surfaces of the toe joints are subluxated the same as in the joints of the vertebr al column. These displaced bones, whethe r in the joints of the toes or the vertebral column, stretch nerves which are attached to the surfaces of those bones, or to be more definite, the nerves are attached to muscles which are secured to bones by tendons, tension creates conditions known as disease. There are no foramina in the toe joints, and those in the spine, together with the long gaps between the occiput and atlas and the atlas and axis, have nothing whatever to do with the tension of the spinal nerves and their branches. The hard and soft corns are the same, except tha.t a soft corn is between the toes and is kept soft by moisture. The foot has seven tarsal bones and the hand bas eight carpal bones. The callus on the bottom of the foot is because of a displaced tarsal bone, or at the articulat ion of the tarsal and metatarsal bont!. To demonstrate that the callus on the plantar surface was because of a subluxated tarsal bone, that the corn was from a slightly displaced toe joint and the in grown toe nail came from 'L,!umbar luxation I would make the ad h at different clinical lectures,\"1iut for a private practice I would adjust all three ailments at the same call. ) Cordelia, Risley, and Mrs. Kale). It is well to know of the construction of the parts we are handling. This branch of knowledge is known as anatomy. We should be CONSTIPATION AND COSTIVENESS 69 acquainted with the vital processes of animal organisms-physiology. It is necessary that we should be acquainted with material and vital anges known as diseases-pathology. We ought to know specifically tbe cause of disease as comprehended by chiropractors-etiology. he nature of the disease should be known-gnos!!: About one chiro\u00ad actor in a hundred can give a definition of these terms and make intelligent use of that knowledge. However, I would rather have you comprehend one idea than to learn a dozen you do not understand. l\\ How do I d First: I make use of clinical diagn. I sldy the signs of disease as exhibited by outwarn appearance which indicate & certain disease or morbid condition, also, the symptoms as related by the patient, who usually considers all cases where the evacu\u00ad ation of the bowels are infrequent, or iii.complete, more or less fecal matter retained in the intestine, as constipation. As I question the patient I bring in differential diagnosis,\u00b7 by which I determine whether the condition is one'\"of constipirtfon or costiveness. , Then the diagnosis , of exclusion is made use of. There may be symptoms which might belong to and be associated with other diseases; these I exclude, leaving only one or more symptoms or signs which unerringly point to\u00b7 a certain vertebral luxation. chiropractors 111ake1 use of l diagnosis; in fact one in &hundred chiropractors make any diaps at all,_ have no ihysiology, pathology, anatomy, symptoiiiitology , orthopedy or etiology. We ought to so conduct our exercises that each student wuld see the utility of being acquainted with these branches. If I determine that I have a case of costiveness, of which the larger share of those who consider themselves suffering from constipation are; to assure myself and the patient that I am con-ect I make use of physical diagnosis. I palpate the spine in order to loeate the 12th dorsal vertebra. The region of the 12th dorsal is readily found by placing the thumb under the lower rib, the outstretch ed fingers will give you the location of the 12th dorsal, making an allowance for the differ\u00ad ence in the height of your patient; in time you will do this uncon\u00ad aeiously. Having located the 12th dorsal by the means spoken of and a certain rate of motion best adapted to determine such inequalities in the contour of the spine as are caused by slight or partial displace ments, NOT A CLOSING TOGETHER, NOT AN OCCLUSION. A dis\u00ad placement displaces vertebrae, spreads them apart, does not draw them together. To close them up would not be displacing. To luxate, dislocate would not be to draw the bones more compactly together. I proceed to palpate on both sids of the spine, using one 1lnger and thereby determine which one or both of the 12th pair of nerves and the one or both of the kidneys are affected. This is determined by the rigidity of the nerves; those atfected will be swollen anti sensitive to lpressure. Palpation is made by a vertical movement back and forth70 THE CHIROPRACTOR f of a half-inch. The ensitive, contracted nerve or nerves may be fol\u00ad , lowed to the affected kidney or kidneys. This procedure is known a nerve-tracing, an art not known to pathologists, the subcutaneous nerve thusly followed are not known to anatomists. Thia diagnosis is of no value to the one who doea not comprehend if or doe not make use of it, to the one who adjusts anywhere and everywhere regardleBB of the determination of the nature of disease it is valueleBB, to the one who adjusts without making a scientific diserimination, it is worth\u00ad less, to the one who adjusts every other vertebrae today and the inter\u00ad vening one tomorrow it would be despised, to the one who adjusts every vertebrae for any and all diseases, commencing at the atlas in Qrder to \\ I drive the disease down and out it would be condemned . A student of , the Bohemian thrust wrote me \"I lay awake at night earching the depths of my creative ability for a painless thrust. For the last three years I have clinked each vertebrae of the entire spine without pain or diseomfort to the patient. With this thrust I cannot jump about here and there in the spine, but must start at the' sacrum and end at the oeciput, and I have the satisfaction of knowing that I have set every vertebrae where it belongs, plump against the facet of ita neigh\u00ad bor.\" This method waa called \"reconstruction of tutional discoverer had epeeillc, de11.nite, scientific adjusting. h chiropractic there} no need of a laboratorial diaj!!._oaia, whether made by chemical aiia1Yils;iilcroacoy1cal enmination, or a bacteriolog\u00ad ical study of the discharges from the kidneys or bowels, they do not tell chiropractors anything of value.

Feces and urine have no nervous tissue, they have no functions to per\u00ad form. Poisons are not created within the body. That which has a deleterious eft'ect on the nervous system is from without. All fevered conditions are because of dift'used inflammat ion. The morbid process known as infl.ammation i11 the result of nerve tension. Nerve tension is because of trauma or toxine. The condition of constipation does not produce poison .. Poisons decrease or increase nerve action. Evacuation and micturition remove waste material. The organic waste products, the undigested residue of the food, epithelium, intestinal mucus and other waste material are not tissue, they do not assist in forming any defl.nite structure of the body. It is diffiult for some persons to clear their mentalities of the cobwebs of superstition. In many diseases the evacuation of the bowels is not normal because of the constructive and assimilative changes known as anabolism and the retrograde and destructiv e processes of catabolism. ' There has been much determined by chiropractors, yet there remains much more to be ascertained and defined by us with clearness concern\u00ad ing anatomy, phyaiology, pathology, symptomatology, etiology and diagnoeia which ia not in accord with noted authors on these subjects, also, aome statements made by standard authors which we u chiroprac ton do not agree with.

Kuch ha been written by medical men regarding spinal pathogen eaia, the special origin or development of disease because of abnormal i ties of the spine, but it remained for chiropractors \u00b7to demonstrat that such ia a fact. Trauma, T oxine and Auto-Suggestion. Trauma singular , traumata plural 1 an injury or wound. Traumatic of, or pertaining to, or due to a. wound or injury. Traumatism, the morbid condition of the system due to a. tra.uma. Trauma a noun, the name of a condition, the injury or wound which i1 the cause of a diseased condition. Traumatic, an adjective, pertaining to a wound, or that which is caused by a wound, e. g., t. abscess, t. amputation, t. appendicitis, t. cat\u00ad aract, t. dislocation, t. fever, t. hemorrhage, t. inflammation, t. suggestion, t. lesion, t. disease, t. medicine and t. back. Traumatology, a treatise on wounds, the science of injuries, a descrip\u00ad tion of wounds and the disabilities arising therefrom. Diseases which are caused by displaced osseous tissue or wounds are ) said to be traumatic or lesional. E. H. Laughlin in his \"Quiz on the Practice of Osteopathy\" makes frequent use of the word lesional in place of its synonym cause. Toxin or toxine, means poison. Toxic is poisonous. Toxicology is the science (the knowledge) of poisons. A toxicoligiat is one vened in poisons, one who knows the changes likely to be produced in functions by the use of drugs. A poison is an animal, vegetable or mineral substance which, when introduced into the system as ingesta, by injection, inhalation, or ex\u00ad ternal application, causes such changes in functions as\u00b7 to produce dis\u00b7 ease or death. A chiropractor does with his hands just what an M. D. aims to do with drugs. An osteo aims to do with his hands that which an M. D. does with medicine. Do not forget for one moment that all organic functions are the characteristic work of organs or an organism directed by an intelligence known as spirit. This intellectual being transmit s its impulses, its com\u00ad mands, over the nervous system by molecular vibration. Poisons are irritative, cause inflammation, excessive nerve vibration, or they may be sedative or narcotic, produce stupor, reduce vital power, produce slower vibration. Modifica tion of functions are known as disease. Medical men divide poisons into two classes, organic and inorganic. The former includes those poisons supposed to be developed within the body and cause disease. The latter includes deleterious substances from minerals, plants and snake venom. Toxine in biology, as understood by medical men, is a poisonou s sub- 1tance produced by microorganisms. 01' these, two kinds are recognized, 72 TRAUMA. TOXINE AND AUTO-SUGG ESTION 73 animal toxine excreted by certain animal cells, and the poison produced by bacteria. All nerve irritants are traumatic, lesional or of toxic origin; cause abnormal functionating, pathological action. Toxicosis is a disease caused by poison, an abnormal condition of the nervous system. A toxicide is a remedy, an antidote, an agent, used to destroy the effects of another poison, not as a chemical antidote, but because of its opposite effect on nerves. Landois in Human Physiology says: \"The apparent increase in the temperature of inflamed parts is by no means dependent upon increase in the temperature above that of the blood, a condition that bas never been observed.\" In other words: the temperature of inflamed parts is not dependent upon nor coincident with :i,n increased temperature of the blood. This condition, a rise in the temperature of the blood, correspond \u00ad ing to that of the inflamed organ or portion, has never been observed. Inflammation and fever are not subject to, are not influenced by, do not rely upon the quantity nor the temperatur e of the circulating fluid. Within certain limits of intensity beat is essential to the develop\u00ad ment of all organized beings; above a certain degree, it ie destructive to all organization and life. At birth the temperature of the infant is slightly above that of the mother. During childhood the temperature gradually approximates that of the adult. Heat production and heat regulation, maintaining the same constant bodily temperature regardless of the surrounding degree of cold or heat, below or above that of the body, bas been and: is, a-' problem to the 0 med\u00ad ieal profession. Inflammation and fever, pathological beat conditions; do not offer to the germ theorist any solution of this perplexed question. Bowel's Text-Book of Physiology says: Anesthetics and narcotics, such as ether, chloroform, cocain, chloral, phenol and alcohol, may be applied 1ocal!l,,_ a nerve and the conductivit y and irritabilit y lessened, or suspended entirely at that point, and restored when the narcotic is removed.'' Poisons affect nerves, not blood. 7 The following biological principles which go to make up chiropractic science should be known and made use of by practitioners. Nerve fibers possess the property of conducting impulses outward and inward. The amount of impulsive force is determined by the rate of transmission, the rate cf that action upon the quantity of vibration and the amount of that movement upon tension. Physiological and pathological activity between peripheral end-organs and their central connection is dependent upon nerve tension. The specific energy of a nerve is due to its anatomical structure, its elasticity and tension. A nerve pressed upon by a fractured or luxated bone would be 74 THE CHIROPRACTOR stretched were it not for the responsive principle of life which resists pressure. The impulsive force normally conveyed by the nerve is modified by the elastic resistance known as renitency. The result is either too much or not enough functionating, conditions known as disease. The contraction and expansion of the nervous system has a normal limit known as tone, the basis upon which I founded the science of chiropractic. Aniation therefrom is recognized as disease. Tone denotes normal temperature, normal structure, normal tension and normal vibration of nerves. An angle worm, when relaxed, may measure six inches. Press against it, i_mpin_ge upon it, try to stretch it, and immediately a response of increased tension is observed; it contracts lengthwise and its diame\u00ad ter is increase<!,_ This ability of elastic resistance to any opposing force isaii inherent quality of all living matter. Dead material does not possess it. An impingement upon a nerve calls into action two oppos\u00ad ing forces. The impingin_g body tends tQ stretch the nerve, while the inherent principle of self-preservation exerts an activity toward con\u00ad tracting it. Reflex action is the bounding back of an impulse; the conveyance of an impression from the central nervous system ,and its transmission back to the periphery through a motor nerve. The amount of function depends upon the renitency, the impulsive force obtained by the bound\u00ad ing back. Traumatism, as the cause of disease, increasing or decreasing func\u00ad tionating, is direct by displacing osseous tissue. Auto-suggestion and poisons, as causes, are indirect. They draw vertebrae out of align\u00ad ment by the contraction of nerves and muscles. Insanity may be caused by auto-B11ggestion, continued thinking upon one subject without rest. In such cal!es the third .rutrvieal nerves will be found affected. porret'!t by adjul!ting the thlrdeervical vertebra. Whether or not a given substance should be included under the term drug depends upon the purpose for which it is sold (as reprda the seller) or used (aa regards the purchaser). Any substance or preparation used in treating disease is a drug. :Medicine a11 defined by the medical profession includes any drug or remedy used in the treatment of diaease. A remed\"y is defined as that which cure!!, paliatea or prevents di11eaae. In its broadest sense it is defined as the art or 11cienee of healing diaeaaea, more especially the administration of internal remedies. Thusly defined, a drug refen to the solid or liquid used in the treatment of diaeue, while that of medicine include11 the drug or remedy uaed, alao, the 11tud7 and ability to treat disease. :Medicine is divided into internal and uternal, the former refer11 to the treatment of organic di11eases, abnormal fnnc tions and abnormal ti111ue, while the latter refen to 1urger7, the treat ment of external di1ea11e TRAUMA, TOXINE AND AUTO-SUGGESTION 7; In 1908 James Gillman, a rancher on Mount Hamilton, Cal., who had been insane for several years, was bitten by a rattlesnak e on the hand. The hand became 1wollen and showed the usual symptoms of snake bite. A few \"hours later the effects of the venom was no longer visible, and Gillman was restored to saneness, his mind became as clear and active aa it ever had been. The poisonous venom had acted as an antidote, ita contractile quality upon the nervous system had drawn the diaplaced vertebra, which caused his insanity, into alignment, accomplishing jua what the chiropractor would have done by hand. Bacteria., microbes , or microorganisms are microscopical vegetation, or those minute animals visible only with the aid of the microscope which live and develop in fluids or on moist surfaces and multiply with great rapidity. They subsist on dead organic material, are parasitical scavengers. Mould, a fungus, grows on decaying vegetable matter, such as bread, cheese, gum and ink. Lippincott's Medical Dictionary says of the two latter, 'Destroying their valuable properties.'' As i;nucb might be as wrongfully said of the mould on bread, cheese and stagnant pools of water. The fact is that putrifying animal ma.tter invitee living sca.v agers, whether buzzards while decaying vegetables and motionless water make BUitable conditions for the gi'owth and multipli cation of vegetable life. Autoeuggestion is nggesting to one's self. Nerves are the means, the channels of communication of one's own thoughts and v9r7 often those of another. That other may be in the physical, :near or far cliatant, or an utral being 8%isti:ng as a spiritual intelligence. Nervea need mental a.nd physical rest.

I\\ CATARRH 77 Enteriti, inflammation of the mucous membrane of the intestines. Ccrvicitis , inflammation of the lining membrane of the neck of the uterus. Inflammation of the mucous membrane of the uterus is known as metritis. Epidemic catarrh, influenza, grip, is from a condition of the at\u00ad mosphere. Endoappendicitis, inflammation of the mucous membrane of the Gonorrhea is venereal catarrh, inflammation of the urethral mucous membrane. Ienstruation is a periodic discharge of mucus from the surface of the mucous membrane of the uterus, together with an excretion of blood from the Yascular vessels of the mucous membrane of the uterus. It is often accompanied by local and systemic changes. The hyperemic con\u00ad dition of the uterine blood vessels is owing to increased temperature. The finer blood Yessels of the uterine mucosa ruptur, allowing the blood to escape. During the menstrual flow and the time in which physiological men\u00b7 struation gradually ceases, the nervous system is excited, a physiological rise of temperature is experienced. Many diseases, or ailments, which are usually very slight, are greatly increased during the menstrual dis charge and aggra,\u00b7ated at the time of the change of life. As to the why, pathologists offer no explanation. During some diseases, such as typhoid or typhus fe\\\"er, the menses disappear. Some poisons excite the nervous system, while others depress, diminish vital energy, lower nervous func\u00ad tional actiYity, causing muscular relaxation. Catamenia is the name of a condition, the periodic menstrual dis\u00ad rharge of mucus and blood from the uterus. The menses is the recurrent monthly excretion of mucus and blood during sexual life from the genital canal of the female. The amont of mucus and blood leakage depends upon the degree of inflammation. Menstruation is an organic function controlled by an intelligence, and not of the mind or mental. This periodic action responds to the solar or lunar month of 28 days, not the man-made calendar month of 30 days. It is said that most women menstruate during the first quarter of the moon and only a few at the time of the new or full moon. The menopause, the grand climacteric, is the change or turn of life, the natural cessation of menstruation. Puberty and the menopause denote climacteric periods, during which the physical, mental, and moral nature of the female is taxed more than ordin:irily. All affections are intensified; some diseases are manifest at thee periods whirh before or after were latent, or at least apparent only in a mild form. The cause lies not in the disturbance ot\"the blood, it CATARRH. This term was originally applied to inflamma tion of the mucous membrane of the nasal and respiratory passages and known as a cold; it is now extended to the mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes, stomach, intestines, appendix, colon, bladder, uterus, urethra and vagina . . A mucous membrane is a thin tissue which lines the canals, cavities and tlie inside of hollow organs which communicate externally by differ ent appertures. It is the inside cutaneous tissue, similar as is the outside skin; it has certain functions to perform, and subject to diseases as is the outside cuticle. Mucous membranes secrete a mucus, viscid, to vegetable mucilage. It is albuminous, like the white of an egg. The mucus preserves the membranes and keeps them moist, a condi\u00ad tion suitable for the performance of their functions . The mucus coating on the mucous membrane of the stomach prevents the stomach from self\u00b7 digestion. Mucus is secreted and exuded through the membrane, a process known as osmoses, or dyalisis; it is exuded , not circulated. Mucous membranes are well supplied with arteries, veins, lymphatics and nerves. In the afute stage of inflamma tion, the mufous membrane is at first dry and swollen. The catarrhal discharge is purulent, tenacious, thick and ropy or ltringy . It is at first frothy, then spots of gummy pus. In color it is at first white, then yellow an finally green. In recovery, under adjustment, the discharge will become thinner and more plentiful for a time as it returns to its natural consistency . Pathologists define catarrh as an inflammation of a mucous mem- brane. The thickening mucus is a result of a membrane being inflamed. Catarrh may be acute or chronic. Catarrh of the nasal mucous membran e is known as rhinitis. Inflammation of the bronchial tubes results in bronchitis or pul monary catarrh. Hay fever is the result of the mucous membrane of the eyes and air passages being inflamed. Asthma, suffocath\u00b7e catarrh, is the congestive swelling of the bron\u00b7 chial mucous membranes which narrows the lumen of the bronchial tubes. Cystitis, inflammation of the bladder. Gastritis, inflammation of the stomach. Inflammation of the eustacian tube, catarrh of the ear, otitis. Endocolitis, inflammation of the mucous membrane of the colon. 76 78 THE CHIROPRACTOR i1 not a proceH of purification, nor is it for the purpose of removing an exceH of nutriment from the body. It is the physica l condition re 1ult&nt from increased nerve tension. Menstruation is a function, the performance of which, normal or abnormal, depends upon the condition of the nervous system; its cessation is as natural as its appearance. Many ailments, not of the generative organs, are intensified at the climacteric periods. They are no more dependent upon the condition of the urus than dysmenorrhea, hysteria, chlorosis or hysteralgia. At these periods the nervous system becomes more tense, thereby intensify \u00ad ing conditions known as disease. The uterine mucosa (the mucous membrane) is inflamed and swollen at each monthly period. This is the actual source of the hemorrhage known as menses. Preceding the hemorrhage and immediately after, there is a mucoid excretion, which at other times would be known a.a ca\u00ad tarrhal dileharge. Chronic inflammation of the uterine mucosa may re\u00ad mit in a discharge of portions of the mucoll8 membrane, the resultant of exeeuive heat, necrosis. The theory of some physiologiatl ia that the inflammation of the uterine muco is for the purpose of creating a raw surface upon which the OV'Dlll may be readily grafted, aiding it in becoming attached to the matemal organilm u a paruite upon ita host. Greater nerve tension ereatea an inereue in functioD&l activity. The philosophy of this phe\u00ad nomena ii readily comprehended when we take into consideration the extreme sensitiveness of the female during these climacteric periods. The senses of smell, taste, i;ight and hearing are more acute than ordinary. These conditions abnormally expressed, are by no means resultant from the change, but because of greater nerve tension. Any dileue arisinie at puberty or the menopause should be adjusted for, jun the aame as though appearing at any other time. Vicarious menstruation is the menstrual 11.ow from some part or organ other than the vagina. The above knowledge and philosophy ac\u00ad counta for what is known as compensatory menstruation. Vicarious, compensatory, a 111b1titute, taking the place of another, the &181lming of a function belonging to another organ. V. respiration, an increased respiratory action in one lung to make up for the diminished action of the other. V. secretion and excretion may be increased in one part of the body instead of the usual function in another. V. diarrhea, an inereued discharge of watery stool due to inaction of the kidneys, known u compensatory diarrhea. V. menstruation, a periodical bloody diacharge from the stomach , nose, breasts, rectum, the pores of the akin or other parta of the body, occurring at the time of, and taking the place of, in part or whole of the men1e1. Blood-sweating, a bloody discharge from the pores of the akin ia considered vicarious when present in absent menstruation. It is an CATARRH 79 elfect from a nervous disorder. Blood corpuscles have been found in the escaping drops of red sweat. Yellow fever at times is attended with bloody sweats. Biliary pigment bas been found in the sweat of jaun diced persona. You will find a brief description of, and where to ad.just for, the above diseases in the Adjuster. I prefer to give you some ideas of value not found in the Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic. These lectures are intended as an appendix to the Adjuster, not a Mail Course, not a Correspondence Course, nor a Post Graduate Course. IMPULSE. In our last lesson we learned that intuition is a knowing without reasoning. That instinct is a natural inherited impulse, unasisted by reasoning. An impulse is a spontaneous incitement arising from the feelings of the mid or spirit in the form of an abrupt and vivid suggestion prompt\u00b7 ing some premeditated action, An impulse suddenly starts or drives a thought forward to action. Thoughts are entities; they exist, are created by imagination, reflec tion, mediation, judgment and reason; they are elaborated. They may be transferred from one intelligent being to another by signs, speech or telepathy. A sign is that which communicates an idea, speech consists of articulate sounds transferred by atmospheric vibration, telepathy is the communication of ideas between two minds at a distance from each other without the aid of words or signs. The power or force of thought depends upon its momentum, and momentum upon the impetus received from nerve vibration during trans\u00ad mission. Vibrations receive their force from the amount of heat. The amount of molecular action and heat are coexistent. Molecular action decides the quantity of heat. Heat determines the amount of mole\u00ad cular action. The quantity of heat depends upon tension, and tension upon excitation. Normal stimulus is furnished by Innate, the spirit, a segment of Universal Intelligence. Too much or too little excitation, stimulation, is the result of over-tension. Over-tension from pressure, disi,lacement of the tension frame (bones) and nerve toxication. Morbid impulses a1e qualified and differentiated as animal, destruc\u00ad tive, homicidal, suicidal, uncontrollable, and especially those of an insane character. An impulse denotes action, not an entity. Fl1Dction is the special and normal action of any organ or part of a living animal. This includes the natural action of any mental faculty. Pathological functions are those performed in a greater or lesser degree than normal. Force is that power which produces or arrests motion, that which may be converted into motion, the rate of transforming energy. Vitality ia the vigorous active principle upon which individual life depends. Vital force is that principle of life which imparts energy. It is in\u00ad herent in each organ of an organism. Energy is the internal, inherent power, the product of activity, that which is aroused by an impulse. Nerve-vibration carries thoughts, commands, orders, known as im pulses when in transit over the nervous system. 80 IMPULSE 81 Thoughts gather force, receive impetus, while being transmitted, the amount depending upon the quantity of nerve-vibration . .Momentum is the force of motion acquired by the movement of thoiights, the impetus received from nerve-vibration. Tone is the normal activity, strength and excitability of the various organs and functions as observed in health. Tone is a response of tonicity. Tonicity is the normal elasticity of the filamentary or threadlike structures of the body, the nervous system. To tnnerva.te is to supply with nerve-force. To enervate is to deprive of nerve-force. An impulse is a communicated thought. Impulses are conveyed over the nervou, system by means of vibration. Thoughts originate in man, animal and spirit. They are forwarded by atmospheric and etheric vibration. In spoken language by the former and by the latter where the affections of one mind a:re acted upon by the thoughts or emotions of another without communication through the ordinary channels of sensation, viz., the five senses. There are two kinds of impulses, sensational and motor. Kotor impulses go outward and sensational inward. The motor is twofold, one originating in the mind of the physical, governs animal functions, the nerves of animal life, it is under the control of the human will; the other is not under the control of the human will but that of spirit, and controls the sympathetic nerves of organic life, creating and continning an in\u00ad tellectual existence. A sensational impulse is one which comes from with\u00ad out, one which creates within us sense impressions of our environents. A sense impression is no more or less than a recognition of nerve. vibra\u00ad tion, which is set in motion by the force of a E1ensational impulse. An impulse (a thought in transit) may be passed from one intellect to an other, as in hypnotism and telepathy, or it may be transported from one portion of the body to another. In the latter case the nervous system ia the transmitting medium. An impulse does not make a circuit. Mental, motor, impulses go &1\"&7 from the central nervous system. Sensory impulses go to the central nervous system and away from the external, and to the origination of nerves. Motor or sensory impulses do not make a circuit, they do not circulate. Motor impulses may be of the mental or spirit, the sensory is of the mental Life (intelligent action) is the response to an impulse. This is trne of the voluntary and involuntary functions. The former are those of the human will, the latter are those of the spirit. The impulse in tranait ia the thought sent out, it always remains the same in its requirement and command; however, its force may be augmented or decreseil. owing to the amount of nerve vibration. 82 !HE CHIROPRACTOR Functions performed normally, with normal force, produce activity known as health. Functions performed with more or less force than those indicating health is disease. Either of these conditions is life, one of health and the other of disease. Pathology is modified physiology. Pathological operations are physi\u00ad ological acts modified. Processes which are pathological are but modified functional movements. Physiological impulses may become pathological in the,ir expres8ion. The spiritual or organic impulses are transmitted over the sympa\u00ad thetic ganglionic nervous system, the nerves of organic life which ramify the viscera of the four cavities of the body, whereas the mental impulses are of the mind, under the control of the human will; they go to the somatic portion of the body over the anterior and posterior branches of the spinal nerves. It will be seen that the impulses of spirit (Innate) and those of Educated (the mind) have different origins, each are trans\u00b7 mitted over their special nerves, the splanchnopleure to the inner or visceral portion and the somatopleure to the body wall. These two classes of impulses, destined for different portions of the body, over entirely different divisions of nerves, the one involuntary, the other voluntary, the former devoted to organic life, the latter to animal, ought not be thrown into oue indiscriminate lot, as '' Innate mental impulses.'' That Frenchma n threw in '& question a few evenings ago by saying, although the lady with the head of beautiful fl.owing hair has a good fl.ow of language, yet there is nothing about her hair that is char\u00ad acteristic of a fluid. I was referring to physical science, natural philosophy , which deals with the material world. However , any gentle, gradual movement or procedure of thought, diction, or music, which resembles the quiet, steady movement of a river, or a continuous outpouring of words, a stream of language, is referred to as flowing. It is usmned that all intelligence, our thoughts, every impulse, is formulated in the brain. If so, in what particular part of the brain 7 Do they originate in the pons, the oblongata, cerebellum or the cerebrum, If in the cerebrum, which halff Is that originating center midway in the corpus callosum, between the two hemispheresf Why not say, I do not knowf In physical science to flow is a type of motion characteristic of fluids; that is, of liquids, gases and viscous solids. A viscous solid i one dis\u00ad tinguished by vicosity, having the quality of being adhesive, sticky, ropy, or glutinous consistency. Impulses do not flow as a liquid, transudate or circulate as a fluid, or become softened sufficiently to run as a viscous solid. Rivers flow from lakes, tears from the eyes, and the menstrual fl.ow is periodical. Impulses are not liquids, therefore, do not flow. Light, heat, sound and impulses are transmitted by vibration-molecular action IMPULSE 83 -they do not flow. Vital force is inherent, consequently, does not flow. Impulses are not substances, they are not ponderable, capable of being weighed, they cannot be measured by the bushel, they have no length, breadth or thickness; they do not flow, they cannot be percented, nor impeded, hindered, obstructed or interfered with by the placing of an obstruction in their pathway. The arch or bar of a violin, guitar or other stringed instrument, which gives permanency to and causes the wires or strings to be tensely stretched, do not prevent the pusage of vibration. An impingement modifies tension, it changes the amount of vibration, but does not obstruct the course of an impulse; it simply aug\u00ad ments or decreases the force of an impulse. Please remember, abnormal functions and morbid tissue are co\u00ad existent. Howell-'s Text-Book of Physiology says: \"Variations of temper\u00ad ature change the velocity of the impulse, the rate of transmission in creases with a rise of temperature up to a certain pqint. The irritabilit y and conductivity of nerve :fibers are influenced markedly by temperature. If a small area of a trunk nerve be cooled or heated the nerve impulae as it passes through this area may be increased or decreased in strength. Impulse conductivity may be entirely suspended by \\'.looling a nerve down to zero, Centigrade; 32 above zero, Fahrenheit. Function promptly re\u00ad turns when the nerves are warmed.'' Why are abnormal functions and morbid tissue always associated I Because tissue can only perform functions becoming their condition; atructure determine s the amount of function. The special action of an organ or other part of the body is determined by the firmness, renitency and tension of tissue. The truths of biological science have been known for centuries. I made use of them in formulating the science of chiropractic. The prin\u00ad ciples which compose the science of chiroprac tic have existed as long as animals have had backbones. Physicians and surgeons knew of and have taught nerve-tension; neurectasia , nerve-stretching and nerve vibration. They have used, and so have the osteopaths, the stretchin g of nerves as a therapeutieal agent 'fiirm1i..ny years: r was the first to assume that the neuroskeleton was a nerve tension-frame.

Why not make it definite, specific, scientificf The Normal and Abnormal Movements of the Vertebral Column. Muscles or sinews, is one of the contractile organs of the body by which the movement s of the various organs and parts are affected. They possess the power of contraction and relaxation. One author says a muscle fibre is from one to five inches in length, another states they vary from a fraction of an inch to many inches. Muscles are directly attached to bones or indirectly by tendons or ligaments, or more defin\u00ad itely speaking they are made fast to the periosteum, the thick fibrous membrane which covers and adheres closely to the entire surface of bones, except', where they are covered with articular cartilge. Muscles in shape may be that of a cord, ribbon or sheet. The surface of bones to which muscles are attached are rough. Laborers have rougher bones than those of clerks. The bones of females are smoother than those of males. Bones become rougher as age advances. Muscles, like nerves, are classed a s voluntary and involuntary. The voluntary are those whose actions are under the control of the will; the invbluntary control the functions of the internal organs, intestines, blood vessels, etc. The\u00b7 part which is moved by contraction of the muscle is known as the insertion, or distal, and the fixed or central attachment the origin, or proximal. Skeletal muscles are connected at either or both of their extremities with the bony framework (the tenaion-frame) of the body. A muscle is attached to two objects; its contraction lessens the distance between them. Motor and sensor nerves end in voluntary muscles. The involun\u00ad tary muscles are supplied from the sympathetic\u00b7 \u00b7nerve system. The tendinous portion of a muscle increases with age. The muscles of an adult are stiffer than those of a child, therefore, the range of joint movement is diminished with age, muscular extensibility is greater in youth; as age advances the tendinous inextensibility is increased. There are three layers of muscles in the back. The superficial, the I l , ' deep facia and the trapez.ius. The deep facia is a dense fibrous layer at-j \u00b7 \u00b7 tached to the occipital bone, the spines of the vertebrae, the crest of the ilium and the spine of the scapula. The trapezius muscle is attached to the external occipital protuberance, the spinous process of the seventh cervical and the spinous processes of all the thoracic vertebrae. To the atlas are fastened nine pairs of muscles. To the axis are connected eleYen liable to be pinched between the articular surfaces. Muscles are composed of bundles of reddish fibres, the lean meat of the body, surrounded by a greater or lesser extent by glistening, white connective tissue; they constitute about two-fifths to three--sev.-- ';.hs of 85 86 THE CHIROPRACTOR the weight of the body. They are known by 230 distinct names. Authors differ as to the number of muscles in the human body, some mention as low as 501, others as high aH 682; this difference is accounted for by the anomalous and variable number in different subjects. A tendon is a nonelastic fibrous cord or band serving to connect a muscle with a bone or other tissue, they are lubricated by synovia. A ligament is a band or sheet of fibrous, inextensile , pliable, tough and strong tissue connecting the articular extremitie11 of two or more bones, cartilages or other structure, they may serve as supports for fasciae or muscles. Interosseous ligaments with the laminae of the lower 23 movable vertebrae complete the roofing-in of the spinal canal, permit variation in the width of the interlaminar spaces in :fl.exion and extension; they restore the articulating surfaces to their normal position after each movement, and take the place of muscles which would be liable to be pinched between the articular surfacs. Fasciae covers, ensheaths, supports or binds together internal parts or structures of the body. The word fascia means a band or bandage. Fasciae are divided into superficial and deep. Chiropractors are espe\u00ad cially concerned with the deep faseiae which is pearly white, dense, strong, flexible, inelastic, unyielding fibrous membrane, forming sheaths for muscles and atfording broad surfaces for attachmen t. The inner or deep layer of fascia is continuous with the sheaths of nerves, arteries and veins, They not only bind down collectiv ely the muscles, but give a separate cover to each, as well as to blood vessels and nerves. In biology the term fascia is applied to any broad, transverse feathers, hair or scales. The intervertebral fibrocartilaginous disks are interposed between the adjacent irurfaces of the bodies of vertebrae from the axis to the sacrum and between the vertebrae of the sacrum in youth until they become fused; they are the chief bond of connection between these bones. The compressible intervertebral disks constitute pivots round which the bodies of the vertebrae can twist, tilt or incline. The curve of old age is due to the shrinking of the intervertebral substance. The pulp part of these disks form a central elastic pivot or ball, upon an4 around which the center of the vertebra rests and twists. If it were not for the articular processe s which give steadin.ess to the column the motion would be of a rolling character. There are no fibrocartilaginous disks between the occiput and atlas, nor between the atlaa and axis. These rubber-like layers of fibroeartilage are adherent by their surfaces to a thin layer of hyaline cartilage which covers the upper and under surfaces of the bodies of vertebrae. The intervertebral foramen is formed by the justaposition of the upper and lower intervertebral notches or grooves; the upper and anterior portion of which is arranged by the lower border of the pediele The Normal and Abnormal Movemenb of the Vertebral Column 87 and the posterior lower corner of the body of the superior vertebra. 'i'he posterior and lower portion of the foramen is formed by the artict!\u00b7 Jar process of the inferior vertebra. The border of the intervertebral foramen is one-fourth smooth and three-fourths rough. There are no muscles, tendons or ligaments attached to the smooth portions of bone. The upper portion of the border of the intervertebral foramen is smooth and the remaining three-fourths roughened for the attachment of liga\u00ad ments or fasciae. An examination of an intervertebral foramen in the recent state will disclose the trunk of a spinal nerve, which is one\u00ad fourth of an inch in length, securely attached by muscles and liga\u00ad ments to the body of the upper vertebra and the articular process of the lower one adjoining it. The ver.braterial foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebra form a passage way for the vertebral arteries, veins and plexuses of the sympathetic nel'ves.' This network of nees sur\u00ad round the arteries and accompany them through the transverse foramina, entering at the sixth and traverse all above it. From the costotransverse foramina of the atlas they enter the skull through the foramen magnum. Thia interjoining of nerves supply filaments (vasom,otor) to the muscle fibres of the arteries and accompany them to the cerebrum and cere\u00ad bellum. The vertebral plexns communicates by delicate threads with the cervical spinal nerves. The vertebral veins correspond to the enra cranial parts of the vertebral arteries. They form by the union of offsets from the intraspinal venous plexuses, issue from the spinal canal, pass acrou the posterior arch of the atlas with the vertebral artery to the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas. It then descends through the vertebraterial foramina and breaks up into a plexu'.s of venous channels which surround the artery. ese channels unite to form a single trunk which i8Blles from the transverse foramen of the sixth cervical vertebra. Each vertebral v11in receives offsets from the intraspinal venus plexus which pass out of the spinal canal by the inter\u00ad vertebral foramina. The long gap between th11 occipital bone and the atlas and the inter\u00ad vening apace between the atlas and axis are not foramina: no possibility of nerves being pinched, squeezed, occluded, no narrowing of the for\u00ad amina, no settling in that region. The posterior portion of the ring which surrounds the foramen magnum, the whole surface of the posterior arch of the atlas and the superior of the lamina of the axis are smooth; but few muscles are attached thereunto. There are two distinct sets of articulations in the vertebral column; those between the bodies and intervertebra disks and those between the articular processes. Arthrodial joints admit of gliding movements: they 11,fe formed by the approximation of two plane surfaces, one slightly concave and the other correspondingly convex, the amount of motion between them being 88 THE CHIROPRACTOR limited by ligaments and osseous abutments. The articular surfaces are covered with hyaline cartilage and the bones kept in contact by liga\u00ad ments. The transverse ligament of the atlas is a thick, strong band, which arches across the ring of the atlas, and serves to retain the odontoid process in firm connection with the anterior arch. This ligament is flat tened from before backward, broader and thicker in the middle than at either extremity, and firmly attached on each side to a small tubllrcle on the inner surface of the lateral mass of the atlas. This ligament is supplied with a facet, the surface of which is covered with hyaline cartilage. The odontoid process is smaller at the lower part than at the upper portion; it is retained in close connection with the atlas by the transverse ligament embracing tightly its narrow neck. The vertebral column permits of three distinct movemen ts, gliding, circumduction and rotation. These movements are, however, often, more or Jess, combined in the various joints and thusly produce quite a variation. It is seldom that we find only one kind of motion in any particular joint. The movements of the vertebral column are controlled by the shape and position of the articular processes. In the loins the inferior zygapophyses are turned outward and embraced by the suior of its neig-hbor below; this renders rotation, twisting, of the spinal column in this region impossible. There is nothing to prevent, except, to a certain extent, a sliding movement upward of one and downward of the other, of the two 1:mrfaces in eontact, known ai, flexion (bending) and exten\u00ad sion (straightening of a curve). In the thoracic region the articulating processes by their direction and mutual adaptation, especially at the \"upper part of the dorsal serills, permit of rotation, but prevent flexion and extension; while in the cervical region the greater obliquity and lateral slant of the articular proeesses allow not only fiexion and exten\u00ad sion, but also rotation. TherA is only a slight degree of movement hctween any two indi\u00ad vidual vertebrae, the atlas nnd axis excepted, although they permit, as a whole, a considerable ehange of situation. This slight alteration in the position of the two articular surfaces is allowable, thus far and no farther is normal, a greater separation, or displacement, more than usual, is disease creating. Vertebral displacement is the normal gliding movement exaggerated. The separation of the articular processes in creases the distance between the body of the superior vertebra and the articular process of the inferior segment to both of which the spinal nerve trunk is ecurely moored by stays, known as facise, which are attached to three-fourths of the borders of the foramen; that of the articular process of one vertebra which forms the inferior notch of the foramen, and that of the body of which bounds one-third of the The Normal and Abnormal Movements of the Spinal Column 89 superior notch. Displaced articulations are Eeparated more than usual by oversliding each other, 80metimes the separation is complete !lnd accom\u00ad panied by fracture. The only portions of the vertebral column which permit of being luxated, subluxated, dislocated, displaced are the articular processes. To displace does not mean to crowd together, to shorten the spine by thinning the intervertebral disks or occlude the intervertebral sizP r,f the foramen and the distance between the two places of anc!10rage or the nerve trunk and its branches, thereby stretching the ligaments and fasciae whereby the trunk of the spinal nerve is secured to three\u00b7 fourths of the border which is roughened for their attachment, thereby modifying the tension of the nerve trunk. and its branches. The above holds true in. all intervertebral formania from the axis to the sacrum. The gliding movement is the most simple kind of motion that can take place in a joint: one surface gliding over another without any angular or rotary movement. This motion is not confined to plane 111rfaces, but may exist between any two contiguous surfaces, of what ever form, limited by the ligaments which enclose the articulation. An articular displacement increases the separation of tlie articular surfaces. Rotatian 1s produced by the twisting of the intervertebral substance (the fibrocartilaginous disks) and a movement between the articular 811rlaces; this twist and move, although only slight between any two vertebrae, produces a considerable extent of movement when the whole length of the vertebral column is considered. In rotation of the whc1e vertebral column, the front of the upper part of the spine is turned to one side or the other. There is only one vertebra, the atlas, which really rotates, moves around an axis, the only example furnished in the backbone, the odontoid process serving as a pivot around which the atlas turns. The first and second spinal nerve trunks are anchored to the roughened posterior surfaces above and below the articular processes of the atlas. Any displacement laterally, the only direction in which the atlas can be dislocated, would cause nerves to be stretched, a condi\u00b7 tion known as nerve tension. Circumduction is a movemen t in a circular direction, it is a com\u00ad bination of anterior, posterior and lateral :flexion-anterior , posterior and lateral bending. The normal movement of a vertebral joint may be increased or decreased. Articular displacements, when they remain in a strained position, are disease producers because of creating and continuing nerve tension. Nerve stretching is caused by separating the articular pro cesaes, enlarging the foramina, stretching the faciae and tissue. The intervertebral foramina are not occluded, closed up,'\u00b7 narrowed or made smaller. The intervertebral disks are not compressed, made thinner, the nerves are not occluded, pinched or impinged nnon. We, 90 THE CHIROPRACTOR as chiropractors, haye no use for such unscientifi c terms as '' The spinal windows are occluded, closed up.'' Forward 11.exion is a bending of the spine so that the concavity is increased, while the fibres of the opposite side are stretched. The inter space between the laminae of the cervical are widened, and the inferior articular processes of the vertebrae above slide upward upon the articu lar procsse1 of the vertebrae below. Flexion is the moat extensive of all the movements of the vertebral column. Take your spine in hand, bend it between two vertebrae (the only place it can be flexed) of the dorsal until the articular surfaeea are in contact half and half, and you will have created a disease producing displacement, a subluxation, a chiropractic dislocation. The gliding movement of the articular pro\u00ad ceeaea can only be performed by extension as each vertebrae of the lower six cervicals and the twelve dorsalll are provided with a sat of abutments which prevent a downward movement past the normal of the superior articular processes. If such a movement was possible, it would occlude foramina. This gliding movement of the articular surfaces upon h other whether performed in a normal amount or an excess can not do otherwise than enlarge the foramina; this holds true in the lower six cervical, the twelve dorsal and the l.ve lumbar vertebrae. This gliding movement is the moat simple kind of motion that can take place in .a joint, one aurface \u00b7 gliding or moving over another without. aiiy angular. or rotary movement. Thia sliding movement is the only one permitted between the articuJar procenes of vertebrae. As I have already a.id, this gliding movement can only be increased in one direction in the vertebrae named, and such always increases the size of the intener tebral foramina. The two articular surfaces of the articular proceBBea lie face to face in close contact. They are held in this position by pliant, flexible, inextenaile, strong, tough ligaments and will not readily yield in any direction except that of the usual gliding movement. Backward 1lexion, the movement of the vertebral column back ward, an opposite disposition of the parta take place to that of displace\u00ad ment by extension. This movement is very slight, being limited by the imbrication of the laminae and spines, the anterior common ligament, the 011eoua abutments on the lower six cervical, the twelve donal, and lumbar vertebrae. In the donal region the close proximity of the 1pinous proceases to each other allow only a very slight extension, back ward movement, that which would close the foramina. In lateral flexion, bending of the body sidewise, the sides of the intervertebral disks are compre1111ed, the extent of motion being limited by the approximation of the transverse processes. Thia movement may take place in any part of the vertebral column, but has the greatest range in the neck and loins. The extension movement is a backward fl.axion, a straightening of The Normal and Abnormal Movemenll of the Vertebral Column 91 the spine. This action i11 limited by the anterior common ligament, the appro:r:imation of the spinous processes and the osseous abutments located at the lower edge of the superior articular processes, 110 that in bending backward the superior processes from the axis to the twelfth dorsal strike against the junction of the transverse processes. The twelfth dorsal is absent of the transverse processes, but more or less supplied with the mammillary processes which serve an admirable purpose for preventing such a movement as would close the foramina. Thus, there is a wise provision throughout the vertebral column to prevent occlusion of the intervertebral foramina. Flexion and extension are greatest in the lower part of the lumbar region betwe the third and fourth, and fifth lumbar vertebrae; above the third they are much diminished, and reach their minimum in the middle and upper part of the back. Flexioh and extension increase again in the neck, the capability of backward motion from tlae upright position being in this region greater than that of the motion forward, whereas, in the lumbar region the reverse is the case. By palpation we determine the spinous process, out of alignment beeauee of displacement of the articular processes. Displacing the artieular nrfaces cause flexion; the bend is shown by the projection of tile apmoue process above the luution. The articulating proeeeses of vertebrae have thin, loose ligamentous aeb, known as capsular ligaments, attached to the margins of their artieular BUrfacee through the greater part of their circumference. They eonnect the two osseous structures on opposite Bides of the intervertebral foramen and hold the blood vessels and nerves in tlieir respective posi\u00ad tion u they pass through foramina. These thin seets of pliable tissue are lined on the inner surface with synovial membranes, the function of which is to furnish synovia, a clear, thick, viscid fluid, like the white of an egg, to lubricate the surfaces of these ligaments. The synovial membran es of the vertebral articulations are well supplied with blood veesela and nerves and may become inflamed, known as synovitis. A displacement of the articular surfaces which create the intervertebral foramina, enlarges the size of the aperture, stretches the intervenin g fuciae, augments nerve vibration of the spinal trunk, causes the fl.laments to be on a stretch, creates diseased conditions in those parts or organs in which these nerves en d. }.djusting, by sliding the articular surfaces back to their normal position, closes the foramen to its normal shape and size, releases undue nerve tension and all is well. The articulation of the atlas with the axis ia of a complicated nature, comprising no fewer than four distinct joints. There is a pivot articulation between the odontoid process of the axis ad the ring formed between the anterior arc of the atlas, and the transverse liga\u00ad ment and the posterior of the odobtoid. TJ:ie projection of .oe axis aids 92 THE CHIROPRACTOR in forming two joints-one in front between the posterior surface of the anterior arch of the atlas and the front of the odontoid process; and another between the anterior surface of the transverse ligament and the back of the tooth-like process. Between the articular processes of the two bones there are double arthrodial or gliding joints in which the opposing surfaces are nearly planes in which there is a gliding motion, which permits the atlas to rotate (and, with it, the cranium) arounsl the projection of the axis, the extent of rotation being limited by the odontoid check ligaments. No rotation can occur between the occiput and atla8. The condyle of the occiput is biconvex, it fits into the biconcave superior articular surface of the atlas. The atlas is the only vertebra which revolves around an axis. Very rarely the atlas is displaced upward. I saw one specimen which showed plainly two articular surfaces on the front of the odontoid process. I have seen quite a number axeses whose odontoid processes had been extended, lengthened one-sixteenth to one-eighth of an inch by exostosis, a deposit of osseous material upon the apexes of the odon toid processes, e11idently for the purpose of preventing the atlas from sliding upward and backward over the tooth-like process. There is no provision made for a lateral movement of the atlas. Any deviation from the median line, to the left or right, displaeea, more or less, four articulations,, two of the odontoid process, and two of the. articnlar processes. No one .of the four joints can be displaeed without a corresponding displacement of all The odontoid process stands mid\u00ad way between the two tubercles, of the lateral masses, for the attach\u00ad ment of the transverse ligament. These tubercles are in the adult 4ve\u00ad eighths of an inch distant from each other. The neck of the odontoid (transverse measurement) is one-fourth of an inch in diameter, leaving a distance of three-sixteenth of an inch on either side of and between the tubercles and the process void of osseous tissue. Occasionally the atlas is displaced laterally to one side or the other, stretching the liga ments, faseiae and nerves which unite the atlas and axis an4 makes: secure not. only the spinal cord, but also, the nerves and blood vessels during their passage through the Jong gaps and emergence from the spinal canal. In all such \u00b7 cases the proper thing to do is to replace the displaced bone, thereby relieve excessive muse! and nerve tension. Between\u00b7 the oceiput and axis there are no intervertebral foramina, or intervertebral disks to blame for pinching nerves, abnormal chemical combinations, obstructed currents or occlusion of stimuli. While the rotary movements are specially arranged for by the pecu\u00ad liar articulations between the atlas and axis, the nodding or rocking motion of the head is permitted by the cups of the superior articular processes and the projecting condyles of the occipital bone. In no one of the skeletal articulations is there a greater diversity in shape and The Normal and Abnormal Movements of the Spinal Column 93 1ize than in the occipital condyles and their receiving concavities, so much so, that no one condyle can be found to fit in any other than its life!ong mate. This variation in size and shape is shown in the condyles and their corresponding articular surfaces of the same occiput and atlas. In this region I never have had any reason for adjusting, or trying 7 to adjust, the 1kull or axis, although I have frequent need for replacing the atlas and the third cervical. In adjusting I regard the axis, seventh , cervical and sacrum as stationary. A displaced atlas can be easily -J replaced by giving the thrust against the posterio r arch. If the force is thrown against the right half it will spring the anterior arch from the odontoid process sufficient to allow the atlas to move to the left and vice versa. Vertebrae are occasionally forced out of alignment, the cartilaginous disks torn lo6se from the bodies. Fractures and osseous ankyloses usually make them immovable; such are surgical displacements of which a chiropractor has nothing to do. The special features of the above may be verified by anatomical works and dissecting the backbone of human or brute beast. The movements and displacements of the joints of the foot are of 10 _much concern to chiropracto rs that I insert a des'cription. A study of their atructure, displacements and corrections given by adjusting should relieve us of a lot of absurdities regarding articular displacements which h.ave crept into chiropractic literature . The skeleton of the foot consists of tarsus, metatarsus and phalangea. The bones of the tarsus are seven in number. Their action is of a alight gliding movement against each other. Like other joints, they are aup plied with ligaments, faseiae and synovial membl:'anes. There are no foramina to be sensured for ailments, no intervertebral disks to be thianed by compression. Anq yet, although the ligaments which hold the tarsal bones together are \u00b7of great strength, dislocation occasionally occurs. Such displacemen ts cause '' sprained feet' '-nerves stretched and in1lamed . The portion of the plantar surface in which the nerves end, form calluses and the part of the foot in which the bone is displaced becomes quite painful. By replacing the displaced bone the callus and distreaa disappears. The only movements in the phalangeal (toe) joints are 1lexion and euension. These joints are very liable to be dislocated and calluses appear over or on the sides of the joints known as corns. Those between the toes are called soft corns because of being kept moist. By adjusting the displaced joints the come will disappear. This may be accomplished at one Bitting, or it may take much time, because of illshapened joints and bony or 1lbrou11 adhesions. Medical men can and osteopaths will accept the abov& facts without due credit-better for the world that is so than aot at all. Can you 94 THE CHIROPRACTOR name the chiropractor who will lay claim to being '' the developer'' of these ideas f Is it not better to write of what we know, than of that which we know nothingf A vertebra consits of an anterior solid segment, the body, anJ a posterior section, the neural arch. The arch 1s formed of two podiclcs, two laminae and !'even processes, the two t.ranRverse, one spin('us and four articular. The articular processes , four in number, two on either side, each of the two face each other, have a certain amount of movement , which is normal; when this gliding motion becomes increased beyond the normal, it is said to be displaced, dislocated, luxated, the amount depend\u00ad ing upon the articular surface exposed. There are two sets of articula\u00ad tions between the movable vertebrae, those between the bodies and those between the articula r processes. Dislocation between two vertebrae (I am speaking of the vertebrae as defined in this article) is almost, if not impossible, such could not occur without a tearing of the intervertebral cartilaginous disks from the bodies of the vertebrae. No chiropractor pretends to replace dis\u00ad placed intervertebral disk11. There is no place for a chiropractic dis placement, a dislocation, a luxation, except between the articular sur\u00ad faces of the articulating processes. All vertebrae, except those which deviate from the common vertebral type, present two sets of articula\u00ad tions. The vertebrae are articulated between the centra, known as intercentral, and a pair of articulations between the neural arches called interneural. The intervertebral disks are located between the verttebral bodies to which they are firmly attached. The ligaments which unite the component parts of the vertebrae together are so strong, and these bones are so interlocked by the arrange\u00ad ment of their articulating processes, that dislocation of the vertebrae, itself, is very uncommon, unless accompanied by fracture. Nerves are never pinched or impinged upon in the foramina. Foramina are never narrowed. WE DO NOT ADJUST THE VERTEBRA. The vertebra itaelf, so far as a chiropractor knows, is never displaced, dislocated or eubluxated. Any extreme movement of the articular surfaces enlarges the fora- men or foramina, causes the nerves and blood vessels to become f stretched, irritated, increasing its carrying power. Nerves are never shut off by the closure of the foramina. There \u00b7 are no dams or obstructions that restrict. Impulses are never inter\u00ad rupted. Reducing the luxated intervertebral articulation; diminishing the displacement of the articular processes, replacing the two articular sur- The Normal and Abnormal Movements of the Vertebral Column 95 faces, returns the enlarged foramen to its normal size, removes tension and irritation. Irritated nerves cause muscular contraction. The loca\u00ad tion and amount of disturbance depends upon the portion of the nervous system involved. A displacement is known by the contour of its angularity , the spinous process will appear to be slightly elevated to the chiropractor who will bold his band cros,wise of the body and run his fingers along the spinal column-not too fast or too slow. Don't do as osteopaths , who run their fingers along on each side of the spinal column to determine what pro\u00ad cesses are bent to the left or right-these have been foolers to the osteo\u00ad paths, and chiropractors have dropped into the same rut-don't do any\u00ad thing as an osteopath does. The sliding of the upper surface upward beyond its normal limit causes the spinous process to become more prominent and a slightly greater space will be fqund between the spinous process of the two vertebrae whose articular surfaces are displaced. The medical method of reducing a dislocation is, extension, counter extension and coaptation. The chiropractor uses the latter only, the adjusting of two displaced surfaces to each other. Occasionally one of the spinous processes deviates from the median line, more especially, the center six of the dorsal region, a fact that should be remembered in practice, as they are not signifibnt to a chiro\u00ad practor, having existed as mch since birth and have nothing what,,ver in common with disease. ( Disease is too much or not enough function. ' About !!,.5 eent :,S all diseases are accompanied by slightly displaced artieulatio'Jm.---.the vertebra is not displaced-the sliding movement of the articulations are increased beyond the normal-consequently, increasing the 11ize of the foramen on one, or the foramina on both sides. The balance of ailmen\\a' are because of displacement of other joints. A displacemen t displaces the articular surfaces, does not crowd, the normal movement is exagerated. Chiropractors have demonstrated that nerves which innervate cer\u00ad tain organs, proceed from one or the other side of the spine. A proven fact: the neuroskeleton is a regulator of tension when its articular sur\u00ad faces have not been forcibly displaced, separated from their normal bearings, but, articular processes not in normal contact, partially dis- placed are disease producers. A surgical luxation has been known to the medical fraternity for centuries, but, a chiropractic luxation was discovered by D. D. Palmer. Chiropractic is unlike any other method or system-do n't you forpt it. The ingenuity manifested by chiropractors placing vertebrae in cuts just to suit their fancy is not only amusing but borders upon the ridiculou11. I am making an important distinction between a 11Jrgical displace-96 THE CHIROPRACTOR ment of vertebrae and a chiropractic d islocation of the intervertebral articular surfaces. I copy a few terms of chiropractor s who refer to the vertebrae as defined in this article and by all anatomists. But few chiropractor s realize the difference between the two luxations. In the many cuts of vertebrae I have on hand their abnormal rela\u00ad tive position (always made so by hand), the vertebrae are shown as being qisplaced out of their normal alignment. Judging from the fol\u00ad lowing quotation s I am not mistaken in the above statement. Spinal adjustment. Subluxated spine. Vertebrae depressed. Dis\u00ad placed vertebrae. Vertebral subluxation. Displacement of vertebrae. Vertebrae become displaced. Vertebrae become luxated. Adjusting spinal vertebrae. Adjustment of a vertebra. Vertebrae out of align\u00ad ment. Partially displaced vertebrae. We adjust displaced vertebrae. Subluxations in the spine. The vertebrae are wrenched, .displaced. Cbiro practie is the adjustment of vertebrae. Spinal adjustments replace ver\u00ad tebrae into line. Stimulus occluded, normal and abnormal foramina. Vertebral luxations the cause of disease. Shut off the fl.ow of impulses. Do vertebrae stay in place when adjusted f These displacements may be in many directions. Adjustments restore the vertebrae to their normal position. The vertebrae are liable to subluxations or partial displace\u00ad ments. _ The _ vertebrae of the spinal _ are replaced in proper alignment, When\u00b7 vertebrae.become iuxated; they pinch nerves and they shut offiirve force. It is \"positively proven tht vertebral subluxations are the cause of disease. Cut No. 3 show spines and vertebrae in and out of plii.ce: In this cut the lower vertebrae\u00b7 is racked to one side, subluxated, \u00b7 dis\u00ad placed. (Under a cut). Showing how vertebrae can be out of line, pinching nerves. A vertebral subluxation is a mechanical interference with flow of the nerve supply. Between the vertebrae is the only places where the nerves pass between movable bone structures. From sublux ations comes the pressure which holds back from the organs and tissues the vitalizing currents. In Cut 1, the second vertebra has been moved backward presenting a partial displacement or subluxation. An accident or strain will cause a displacement or luxation of any one of these vertebrae. A chiropractor with one dextrous thrust adjusts the vertebrae into its natural position, removes the sublu:ication. In cuts B and D the superior vertebra is luxated (displaced) the spinal openings are occluded (nearly closed). A prominen t writer says: \"The clicking resulting from adjustment can never be shown to be 'that bone has been thrown in place,' as the::, so strenuously maintain. \"The sudden separation of the facets takes place, and the 'clicking' sound is produced. \"Separating the facets of the two bone11-that is the articular 11ur\u00ad face11-and lets the air in and gives the sound.'' The Normal and Abnormal Movemenb of the Vertebral Column 97 His Alma Mater taught, \"We find great use for atmospheric pressure to hold bones far enough apart to let the 'joint water' pass freely over the upposing ends of bones.'' Many persons have had the articular surfaces of vertebrae replaced of themselvccidenta'.l chiropractic. These replacements of articular surfaces are accompanied by audible clicks or snaps. The audible click heard when adjusting is the upper articular process striking against the osseous abutments , the laminae in the lumbar, the shoulders of the laminae in the dorsals, except the 10th, 11th and 12th, which may vary in having the transverse processes broken up into external, superior and inferior tubercules; the superior tubercules answer\u00ad ing an admirable purpose of an abutment in preventing the occlusion of the foramina. The atlas strikes against\u00b7 the odontoid thereby, eallBlllg th 'audible click. ,. Spinal Pathogenesis. Pathogenesis, the generation of diseaae, the act or process of repro\u00ad duction, the breeding and production of disease, the origin and genesis of suffering, the development of morbid conditions, or of a diseased charact,er. Medical men look upon disease aa an entity, a something that has an individual living existence, its continuance depending upon its repro\u00ad duction, therefore, they fight disease, aim to stamp it out; if they could destroy, kill, get rid of every pathogenic germ, the last microbe disease breeder, there would be no such a thing as disease. They consider a disease germ aa a special virus, a kind of spore, whieh by rapid increase causes conditions known as disease, by which disease is communicated. They hold that certain diseases are dependent upon definite micro-organ\u00ad isms. A germ disease is one caused by microorganisms. A microbe is a pathogenic microorganism. They believe that all germ diaeaaes are pro\u00ad duced by microbes, that diseases originate from minute microscopic fungi, baeteria1 which are developed without or within the body, that unhealthy tissue furniahes food, makes favorable conditions for their rapid multi\u00ad plication within the animal economy, thereby cause specifl.e diseases which become communicable. Mental peculiarities, physical characteristics and diseases may be con\u00ad genital. Congeital is inclusive, it takes in all uterine conditions from concepton to birth. Inborn refen to that whch may be engrafted on the mental or body during development. An infective disease ( one which is communicable) may be congenital, not inborn, as are dispositions and constitutional peculiarities which are implanted during development. A physical defect, faulty metabolism, is inborn, a developmental error, acquired during the process of development of the fint four months, did not originate because of intrauterine disease or injury. <,'hiropraeton look upon disease, not as an entity, but a condition in which there is a change in position, structure and functions of organa, that microscopic fungi, or bacteria, are there because of favorable con ditions, just as rotting cheese and decaying bread favor the growth of mould. Fungi range in size from the microscopic cell of the yeaat plant to the highly organized body of a mushroom. Drug pathogenesis is the production of morbid 11ymptoms by the ue of drugs. A drug is any 11ubstance used to return abnormal function\u00ad ation, or abnormal ti11sue to normal; any article u11ed a11 a medicine or in the composition of medicines for external or internal use for the cure of di11ease. The hi11tory of medicine discloses that each method of treating the 98 SPINAL PA THOCENESIS 99 sick has been followed by another based on exactly opposite principle s and philosoph ies which are diametrically opposed to each other. Allopathy. That system of remedial treatment which seeks to cnre diseases by producing a condition incompatible with the disease; op\u00ad poaed to homeopathy. 11 Any poisons must, as Galen held, by counter\u00ad poisons be expelled. '' Homeopathy. That system of medical treatment which seeks to cure a disease by administering medicine which would produce this same di ease in a healthy condition; opposed to Allopathy . Similia similibua curanter. Like cures like. Spinal pathogenesis includes the origin and development of morbid conditions because of the pathological anatomy of the spine. In allopathy disease is treated by llxciting a morbid (diseased) process of a'n:other kind, in another part of the body, a method of substi\u00ad tution. In Homeopathy, the theory of dynamitization, succussion, trituration, dilution with agitation ill said to increase enormous ly the potency or power of a drug. For example, one part of a crude drug, named salt when uaed on the table as food, but when it becomes a drug it is sodium chloride. One part of this drug is succussed with nie parts of the sugar of milk. This is known as the first decimal potency. To make the second, one part of the first potency is added to nine parts of sugar of milk, and ao on. This trituration may be carried on until there is only one part of salt to a million parts of sugar; this is known as a high potency. A vertebral column of bonee is referred to as a backbone, apiDal column and spine. It is not a backbone: it is twenty-six backbones. Taken collectively it is not a spine, although there ii: a column of spiDeL It is also called vertebrarium, composed of vertebrae, yet in the whole column there is but one vertebra, the atlas is tlie only segment ,vhich turns (vertere to turn) on a pi'vot, the ondontoid process. In man the vertebral column is spoken of and understood as being vertical; in quadrupeds horizontal. The twenty-six segments are referred to aa a eolumn because they are piled one upon another. Bony columns are 1iexuoua, having alternate opposite curvatures . They are 1iex:ible, capable of being bent without breaking. The vertebral column supports the head and chest and transmits their weight to the pelvis. It is the axial center of all the movements of the trunk. It lodges and protect& the spinal cord, the myelon, spinal marrow, medulla epinalia. The vertebral notches form foramina, give paasage vertebral nerves, arteries and veina. The vertebraterial foramina furnish a path\u00ad way for the vertabral arteriea, veins and the of nerves, which the viacera.

In one other vertebral column a fractured lateral dislocation of the linh and aeventh cervicals. The intervertebral foramina are very much enlarged because of the displacement, the spinous processes widely dis\u00ad placed, no possible chance for the spinal nerves to be pinched. Nerve are impinged upon or against, instead of being pinched between. The osseous substance of the bodies of the ninth and twelfth donal and all the lumbar vertebrae has oozed out and spread upon the bodies of the vertebrae, causing ankyloses by the fusion, of liquified bony tissue. Excessive heat ell.used the softening, lowered the temperature, hardened the callus material. Several vertebrae are ankylosed by exostoses. Second, third and fourth donal vertebrae are ankylosed by fusion of th'eir bodies, the cartilage destroyed by heat. Formation of aeoliotie curvature between second-and fourth donala. The ouification muscle renders the contour of the apinoua processes as one continuous surface. The spinous proceaea of the second to the 1lfth cervical are \u00b7 fractured. The bodies of the cervical vertebrae have been softened b7 heat and made thin b7 compreaaion. The cause of all these morbid conditions is found in the displacement, uk7loaia and fracture of the sixth and seventh cervieala; not hi the occlusion of the intervertebral foramina for they are enlarpd.

The artieulationa between the bodiea of vertebrae form a aeries of amphiathrodial joints, allowing partial movement in every direction. ThOBe between the articular processes form a succession of arthrodial joint,, having a sliding movement. Upon and within the spinal column are numerous venou!I plexuses. The veins within the spinal column join those on the outside through the intervertebral foramina . . ?athogenesis is the morbid process, the mode of origin, the develop\u00ad ment of disease. To learn the cause of disease it is better to examine the living than the dead. To know of and comprehend the position of aublaxated vertebrae, it is preferable to examine vertebral columns which have vertebrae displaced and aukylosed while the owner was living in\u00ad stead of having cuts made of vertebrae ingeneously diaplaced by hand to 1uit the fancy. Pathological means morbid or diseued. A morbid or diseased change in the tissue, bones softened and friable. Morbidity of bones, either too hard, eburnated , qr too soft, friable in their texture. Color, reddish-yellow. Excessive heat has changed the color and con Bistence of the bones. Bones are formed of white corpuscles , leucocytes. In fever the per cent. of the white and red corpuscles are modified, the red corpuscles, erythrocytes, are increased and the white is diminished. Temperature of 98 to 99 degreea creates the normal, relative number of white and red corpuscles. El:oatosis, a morbid deposit of bone upon the eurface of a pre-existing bone. Enoatoeis, a bony growth on the interior eurfaee of a bone, in the mednllary cavity. Hypertrophy, an excessive growth of a part from over\u00ad nonriehment. Hypoplasia , a lack of development of a bone. A epinal column before me gives unmistakable evidence of the cause of the morbid condition of those bones. The sixth, seventh and eighth cervicals are ankylosed, spondylosed, the joints immovably fixed by fusion and adhesion. The beat Wll8 intense (spondylitis, inflammation of one or more of the vertebrae) that the osseous substance was softened and oozed out, covering the anterior of the bodies of the three vertebrae, ankylosis by fusion. The articular processes are also flrmlr united, bony 11nion. The displaced sixth cervical is anterior of the normal position, three-sixteenths of an inch out of alignment, causing cervical lordosis. It11 transverse processes are anterior of the normal position, thereby 11tretching the vertebral ganglionic chain which lies in front of and against their anterior surfaces. The intervertebral foramina have not been decreased in 11ize. The whole column 1how1 spondylitis deformans. The luxated vertebra by its pressure against the ympathetic nerve trunk, reaching from the atlas to the coccyx, caused increased nerve tension, liquefaction and fusion, abo the same condition in other part of tile nrtebral column. Palpation and Nerve Tracing. The chiropractor determines the position of bones, more especi&ll7 those of the vertebral column, the condition and pathway of aubdermal nerves, by palpation; this is known as physical diagnosis. Thia e:umina\u00ad tion. ia performed by a discriminating touch of the fingers which, directed by knowledge and the skill acquired by continued application, become very aensitive. The truth of the science, the correctneBI of the a.rt and the reuonableneBB of its philosophy are demonstrated thereby. Nerve tracing ia an art. The aystematic application of knowledge regarding the condition of nerves in health and disease, observation, study, experience and skill acquired by constant practice, has resulted in determining certain principles and facts which enable us to determine the luxated joints, which by their displacement cause more or le11 nerv tension, variation of functions, conditions known as diaeaae. The art of palpation to determine the condition of subcutaneou ) organs has been used for centuries by medical practitioners. The a.rt of nerve-tracing ia of recent date, your teacher was the flnt to praetice lt.. The chiropractor should trace aensitive, swollen, longitudially COD traeted nerves, for the purpose of locating their impingement and in the donal poatricir0and ventral in the lumbar. In a practice of twenty-five years I have only known one case of reversed kyphoaia and lordoais which I relieved by adjusting the twelfth dorsal. There are three vertebrae which may be considered u stationary, the ms, the Int donal and the sacrum. There is no better way to locate the cause of dlseue, or demonstrate to a prospective patient how bones and nerves are related to each other and why such relationship accounts for health and dlseaae, than by palpation and nerve-tracing. By palpation and nerve-tracing the chiropractor ean often determine the organ and the innervating aubdermal nerves &fleeted. Nerves in their normal condition are not sensitive to presaure; thoe in the \u00b7teeth are not dected, by cold or hot, sweet or sour ingest&. By a unique movement the nerve which l unduly' tretehed, beeaue of being impinged against, or stretched by a displaced bone of the neuro\u00ad keleton, is returned to its normal tension, normal vibration, normal tun- perature and normal functionating. Chiropractors demonstrate the eorrectnea of Dr. Dungliaon tate\u00ad ment in his dictionary, '' Irritation is indicated b7 tendernes on presnre over the pinoua proce11 of one or more vertebrae or part of the id of the spine. '' 102 PALPATION AND NERVE TRACING 103 Chiropractors are demonstrating upon living subjects, no cadavers, no vivisection, that there are nerve fibers which have not been noticed by anatomists .

A number of theories have been advanced to explain the process of heredity, the transmission of acquired characteri he perpetuation of ancestral distinguishing traits and qualities, including the inheritance of dise88e from ancestors. One of which is that germinal continuity, minute particles are given olf from all cells of the body and collected in the reproductive, generative, living, active basis of all animal organiza\u00ad tions; they represent all of the body characteristics, both heredity and . cq1:1ired. Medical men believe that the cause of diseases originate outside the body, or are generated within the body .. Those outside are, traumatic, heat, cold, poisons and living organisms such as bateria and animal parasites. Those '' originated within the body are less definitely known.'' '' The self-poisoning is designated auto-intoxication.'' measles, mumps, whooping eough are among those diseases acquired by inh_!!!U!l]!J:e, tted from parent to olfspri.!iJ__phyilcal or mental qylitie;_\u00ad Teyed. from anee1ton to their progeny. This theory includes the doubling Ud multiplication of the vital units of the future individual, which ae\u00ad eounta for the variation of form, physical and mental qualities, \"including the tranlference of disease. Speculation based on such assumed hypo\u00b7 theais necessarily falls to the ground, as no sharp distinction exiats be\u00ad ween germ-cells and somatic (pertaining to the wall of the body or the body aa a whole) cells. \u00b7\u00b7 The above named diseases are classed as thcise of heredity, whose )duration ia considered self-limited, are readily relieved by chiropractic \\,_ adjuatments. Conaeious intelligence is the observation of impressions received through the sensory organs of sight, bearing, smell, taste, and touch. To these may be added perception, apprehension, recognition , undentanding, discernment and appreciation of our physical surroundings, and these are increased by occult intuition and piritual instinct, the ability of know\u00ad ing and the power of acting without the assistance of reason. Intuitive ense is modified by imagination and memory, by the dis criminating qualities of intensification, by the condition of tone and the variation from the standard of health. Modified intuitive sense varies the actions of instinctive consciousness. Intuitive knowing and instinctive action are determinqd by organic habit and unconscious 11ensation without thought or volition: Inatinct is immediate in action without the proceB11 of reason. 104 THE CHIROPRACTOR Intuition consists of knowing without reasoning from cause to effect, direct immediate perception without reasoning. Instinct is a natural, inherited impulse, unassisted by a reasoning eonception of that which occasions or effects a result. Intuition is the ability of knowing without reason, the immediate perception of truth without conscious investigation, or assigning rational causes for their existence. Instinct is an inward unconscious principle in man and the lower animals, an involuntary prompting which causes mental or physical action without individual experience or a distinct apprehension of the end to be accomplished, an innate tendency to perform a special action in a distinctive way when the necessity occurs. Intuitive belief, intuitive judgment and intuitive knowledge are qual\u00ad ities due to direct perception, the result of inward consciousness. Intui\u00ad tion may be mystical, perceptional, intellectual or moral. We may have mystical vision, spiritual perception and direct intellectual apprehension. Hexiology is the science of habits. A habit is a tendency to perform the same spontaneous action under similar circumstances. Habit applies to individuals, instinct to ancestors. Habits acquired through our ances\u00ad tors are known as instinct. Organic habits may be acquired by the physical organism during the life of an individual or of a race. The system of bodily processes of the physiological organism has been acquired through past generations. Constant practice, frequent repetition, habitual custom, con1lrma habit until it becomes a function. Mental or organic habits are acquired through the education of the nervous system. In biology our environments are the aggregate of all the enemal condition s and influences . attecting the life and development of an organism. In a measure we regulate our surroundings, giving but little thought of individual and organic habits. Pernicious habits may become fastened upon the human will, weaken vitality and bore tunnels through the reservoirs of force and character. Self-respect and restraint of pas\u00ad sions are as essential to longevity as prophylaxis , the science and art of retaining the health. Desides that are dangerous must be shunned; the mind must be kept wholesome. Every time we think, each time we act, a record is made. Each repetition of a thought, each performance of an act deepens the groove of habit, mental or physical; it renders the next similar impulse or move\u00ad ment more automatic until in time the nervous system becomes like a phonograph disk; without apparent consciousness we find ourselves guilty of repetition. Habits become our master and we its slaYe. Pure air, claan water, unadulterated food and thoughts free from error and vulgarism will form cleanly habits of mind and body. Chiropractors should comprehend the principle of reliex action. PALPATION AND NERVE TRACING 105 Reflex is the bounding back, the return of an impulse. A reflex action is one executed without our will, one performed and directed by that in\u00ad telligence which controls the sympathetic nervous sy!tem, the nerves of organic life. An involuntary movement of an organ or part of the body resulting from an impression carried by a sensory or afferent to a subor\u00ad dinate center, and then sent back by an efferent nerve to some place at or near the source of irritation is known as reflex action. All acts performed without brain function are known as reflex actions. The involuntary brushing a fly from the face, or the attempt to move away from an annoyance when tickeled with a feather are ex\u00ad amples. In reflex acts, a person does not think before he acts; he acts before he thinks. The nervous impulse comes from the outside and re\u00ad turned, is acted upon without going to the cerebrum. As it were, the message is short-circuited back to the surface by motor nerves, without having reachrp the thinking centers. Automatic acts are accomplished without thinking. By training the acts have become automatic. Habits are really acquired reflex actions. Habit trains certain nerve centers. Reflex action is the bounding back of an impulse;, the conveyance of an impression from the central system, and its transmission back to the periphery through a motor nerve. The amount of function depends upon the renitency, the impulsive force obtained by the bounding back, the reflex action. ! A reflex pathway is the route taken by an impulse; it includes the afferent nerve, the nerve-center and the efferent nerve. \u00b7 A reflex center is any ganglionic center where a sensory impreseion is changed into a motor impulse. Sneezing and the involuntary sniffing of an odor, whether pleasant or unpleasant, are reflex actions. Coughing and choking may be pro\u00ad duced by tickling the pharynx, reflex actions, the performance of func\u00ad tions by the controlling intelligence without using the encephalon. \u00b7 Accu\u00ad mulated urine and feces call for micturition and defecation, reflex action. An enlarged, contracted, sensitive nerve may in reality be only a nerve fiber which may leave a nerve (a bundle of :fibers) and enter an other; thus, we trace many nerve fibers from their exit at the spinal foramen to their destination, or vice versa, nerve filaments which have Dot been recognized by anatomists. Be careful to make a distinction \u00b7between palp&tion, perceiving by Uae enae of toucll and palpitation, rapid pulsation of the heart. ... Bones and Nerves. Medical, osteopathic and chiropractic schools give more or less atten tion to the study of osteology and neurology, but not a page, paragraph or even a sentence is found in any one of the many works I have on anatomy, neurology, physiology and pathology regarding the all important fact that, the position of bones ha.a all to do with the a.mount of nerve tension. Dr. A. P. Still 's philosophy and mechanical principles of osteopathy, \"date 1902,\" has less than a half page referring to the vertebral column. He says, '' Every joint of the neck a.nd apine has much to do with a healthy heart and lungs, because all vital fluids pass through the heart and lungs. \"He ( the osteopath) should . . . never rest day or night until he knows the spine is true and in line from atlas to sacrum, with all the ribs in perfect union with the processes of the spine. '' Slipped or twisted vertebrae and ribs must be sought out and adjusted, giving intercostal nerves thorough freedom to act and often muscles and let blood loose to feed and nourish the whole spine. ' ' Adjust the bones of the neck and let blood flow to and feed the nerves and muaeles of the neck and stop the eonstrietures that laave been holding the blood in cheek until it has died.\" Doctor Still, the founder of osteopathy, believed that wind, air, electricity and gas existed in the joints, between the articular nrfaeee, that a change in the amount of these duids accounted for health and disease. l quote from page 130. _ '' Before pain begins at the joint you are sure to find that all gas or wind has left the joints. Thu, electricity burns because of bone friction. Some gas must be between all bone joints. Thus, we find great use for atmospheri c pressure to hold bones far enough apart to let the joint water pass freely over the opposing ends of bones. There is a natural demand for gas in all healthy joints of the body. Reason leads us to believe that gas is constantly being conveyed to or generated in all join.ta. Before rheumatism appean the separating gas baa been ezhausted, and there follows friction and electric heat because of there i)eiug two or more joints in one electric current or division. \"We thus get what we call neuralgia, rheumatism , sciatica, and so on to the full list of aches and pains not accounted for to date by our philosophers. '' On this plane of reason you can see and know the whys of con\u00b7 sumption, dropsy, tumors, ti.ts, grey hair, baldness, 110 on to a surpris\u00ad ing number of diseases.'' 106 BONES AND NERVES 107 The above does not read like, nor is its philosophy that of chiro\u00ad practic. Evidently, Dr. Still was looking to joints for the cause of disease. On\u00b7 the title page of McClelland 's Regional Anatomy, twp large volumes, Date 1892, is a line in French, in English it says, '' Anatomy is not such as is taught in schools.'' In other words, anatomy as taught in schools is not anatomy. Schools of chiropractic put in many months studying anatomy. The students are led to believe that the study of anatomy furnishes the all important education for a chiropractor, that to know anatomy is to understand chiropractic. A course in dissecting and the different branches of medicine will not furnish the principles of chiropractic, reason out its philosophy, nor educate one in vertebral adjusting. Bones give, rigidity and shape to the body, form a case around the brain and spinal cord, protect delicate organs in the body cavities, con\u00ad stitute a frame-wor k of which individual \u00b7bones are used as levers by muscles and nerves. In many invertebrate animals the muscles are at\u00ad tached to the exoskeleton. In man they are connected to the endoskel\u00ad eton. Bones serve as a tension-frame; their position determines the amount of muscle and nerve tension. Nearly half o the body weight is of muscle. Movements are performed by means of muscles, leverage is obtained by their attachment to bones. Displaced bones cause muscles &Jld nerves to become stretched or relaxed. Traumatism is a diseased condition of the system due to an injury or a wound. Luxated joints, more especially those of the vertebral column, cause uaumatism, a diseased condition. Dislocated bones impinge upon nerves, cause irritation; or, by their displacement relax or efungate the nervus tissue, thereby modifying tension, vibration, the transmission of impulses, the production of heat and organic function. Poisons affect nerves, cause their relaxation or contraction. Loss of tension produces atony, enervation, a. diminution of muscular power. Innerva.tion is increa.sed by nerve contraction. Contracted nerves by their action on muscles draw vertebrae out of alignment. Autosuggestion, or hypnotism (suggestion by another) relaxes or contracts nerve tissue, causing more or less tension. The importance of bone pressure, nerve impingement, nerve tension, the all important fact that the position of the osseous frame, the neuro\u00ad skeleton of the human body, ha.s all to do with the amount of nerve tension, normal or abnormal, known u nerve stra.in, the amount of heat, is never mentioned, in fact, is never thought of by the teachers of medical or chiropractic schools. It is, therefore , manifest that, the would-be teachers of chiropractic know but little of the principles of chiropractic, do not know of it as a. science, or of its philosophy, ' 108 THE CHIROPRACTOR Nerve tension is accomplish ed by the bones acting as levers. A knowledge of this principle is essential for the comprehension of chiro\u00b7 practic as a science, and specific adjusting as an art. A student may become familiar with the diJl'erent branches of anatomy by the study of one or more books and dissection on the cadaver, and y,et no_t know anything of the relationship existing between bones and nerves. Knowing the structure of bones and nerves, the names of each and all their surfaces, the descriptive terms, nomencla ture and classification, their location and functions, do not inform us of the importance which chiropractors should attach to the position of bones. Do not forget for one moment that, all vital and intellectual forces depend upon the condition of the nervous system for their expression, that there is a vital principle which distinguishes organized matter from inorganic, that when associated with matter of organized bodies controls its manifestation. Bones are the only hard substances whieh can press against, impinge upon nerves, by their displacement cause nerves to become stretched. Displaced bones are the direct cause of a large per cent. of diseases. Any pressure upon or against nerves excites and creates abnormal tension. Bones displaced ever so little cause nerves to become contracted or re\u00ad lu:ed; either condition modifies vibration, alters the force of an impulse and the amount 'of heat. \u00b7\u00b7 A knowledge of the structure of bones and nerves is well and \u00b7good. To be able to name and locate the depressions, articular and nonartienlar eminences ia of especial benefit to surgeons, but to a chiropractor it ia all important and of more service to be acquainted with the relationship existing between bones and nerves. In order to have health, nerves must have normal tension, innrvate each and every organ of the body, so that their functions may be properly performed. Displaced bones, luxated or fractured, cause disease (not eaae), by overtension of nerves, therefore, chiropracto rs should be especially inter\u00ad ested in the study of bones and nerves, more particularly regarding the e1fect either one has upon the other. See pages 761' and 766 of The Adjuster. \u00b7Normal nerve tension depends upon the usual position of bones. Displaced bones modify nerve tension, vary the amount of heat. lloleeu Jar vibration produces heat in animate and inanimate bodies. EneBBive nerve vibration, molecular disturbance, causes inflammation. Diffused indammation ia known as fever; heat expanded, spread, aeatterecl, .X\u00b7 tended, dispersed throughout the body is known as fever. Pyorrhea Alveolaris. Pyorrhea alveolaris has been extensively written upon by Fauchard, Riggs and many others; it is known as Fauchard's disease, also Riggs' disease. Alveolar pyorrhea is an oozing of pus from beneath the gum mar\u00ad gins; a resorption of the alveolar borders, with progressive loosening of the affected teeth, and a deposition of calcic matter, calcium, lime, known as calculi, upon the surface of the denuded roots. With the loss of teeth these morbid conditions cease. It is a disease of adult life, sel\u00ad dom found before the ag\u00b7e of thirty years, owing to the pliability of nerve tissue'during youth. Nerve tissue becomes firmer, less elastic, as age advances, therefore it does not so readily adapt itself to heat modi\u00ad fications. Pus is composed of leucocytes, white corp1,1scles. The propor\u00ad tion of white and red corpuscles varies slightly in different persons in health, in various portions of the body and at different ages in the same individual, owing to slight deviations of temperature; the norma,l amount is one of white to 700 of red. In fever the }>er cent of erythro\u00ad cytes is increased. When the temperature goes below 98 degrees the proportion of leucocytes is increased. Alveolaria is pertaining to the alveoli. The alveola is the socket in which the tooth rests. Pyorrhea alveolaris refers to a discharge of pus from the opening in which the tooth is held. Pyorrhea is a disease of the dento-alveolar joint, a gomphosis articulation, one in which a conic process is held in place by a socket, which permits a certain degree of motion. Extractic,n of the teeth puts an end to the disease by eliminating this membranous joint; it removes, with the teeth, the intervening pericementum. An inflammation of this membrane is known as pericementitis. Alveolitis is an inflammation of the alveoli, the bone surrounding the roots of the teeth; the alveoli become necrosed because of too much heat. Alveolar periostitis is an inflammation of the alveola periosteum. The periosteum is a thin vascular membrane of the alveoli, closely adhered to and covering the outer surface of the pcriccmcntum. The function of the pcriostcum is to nourish the alveoli by vasa vasorum. This vascular circulation is controlled by thru the ncrvi vasorum. Osteo-pcriostitis is an inflamma tion of the bone and its pcriostcum. Interstitial gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums, more especially the tissue between the gum and the teeth. The teeth become loose the gums red and swollen and sensitive. The gums arc composed of dense fibrous tissue covered by mucous membrane, arc richly sup\u00ad plied with blood vessels, but sparsely with nerves. Around the neck of the teeth, at the gingival, the gum forms a free overlapping collar, 109 110 THE CHIROPRACTOR the dental ligament, where it is freely supplied with nervous papilla, visible to the naked eye. Cementoperiostosis is an inflammatory con\u00ad dition of the cementum of the teeth. Cementum is outer cortical substance, the substantia ossea, the crusta petrosa, the rocky crust, a form e,f modified bone, which covers the roots of the teeth and an\u00ad swers a similar purpose as does the periosteum of the alveoli. The alveoli-dental pericementum, peridental membrane, membrane , is a vascular layer of connective tissue attached to and lying between the periosteum of the walls of the alveoli and the cementum of the roots pf the teeth. When the pericementum, which is well supplied with blood vessels and nerves, is inflamed, it becomes swollen and very sensitive. The tooth, as a result of the swelling, is pushed partly out of its socket, its crown projects above those of its neighbors, and strikes against the opposite tooth, causing pain and much annoy\u00ad ance. The alveolar periosteum is firmly united to the root cementum by perforating fibers, establishing a communication of blood vessels and nerves between the jaw and the teeth. Pericementitis is an in\u00ad flammatory condition of the peridental membrane. The pericementum, the interstructural membrane, is composed of white fibrous tissue, in\u00ad terlaced with blood vessels, nerves and glands; it is, therefore, liable to be inflamed, as other membranous tissue. It subserves the purpose of a ligament, similar as the pericranium performs in the sutures of the cranial bones. The same blood vessels and nerves supply the perios\u00ad teum, pericementum and cementum. Perioatitis, gingivarium, and is an \u00b7inftam-\u00b7 mation of the gums. Gingivitis ezpulsiva is the gradual loosening and expulsion of a tooth or teeth from their sockets. The teeth are composed of four specialized tissues-enamel, dentine, crusta petrosa and the pulp. Between the root of the tooth and the alveolar process are the cementum and the periosteum, interposed between the latter two membranes is the pericementum. The roots of the teeth have small apertures in their apices, which transmit blood vessels and nerves to the pulp cavity, which is filled with pulp. The sockets of the alveoli are lined with periosteum, covering them closely, and intimately uniting the cementum with the fibrous structure of the gums. The pathological condition of cementoperiostosis is slow progressive expulsion of the teeth. If the M. D.'s had this disease to treat they would class it among the incurable-etiology obscure. Some dental authors ascribe decayed teeth as the cause, altho they know that the most of teeth so expelled are perfectly sound. Were they correct in their etiology of this cementoperiostitic condition that periodontitis is caused by any one of the fifteen lesions given by dental authors, it would be an unexplainable explanation, for we would want to know the cause of dental caries. I 111 Pyorrhea and dental necrosis should be classed as two separate conditions, two different nerves impinged upon, creating two dis\u00ad tinctly different morbid conditions of tissue and dissimilar abnormal functions. The dental profession has made much study of this disease known by several names. They have no trouble in designating the parts affected: the morbid conditions and symptoms are readily apparent. They arc well acquainted with the pathological functions and morbid tissue, but as to the cause of the morbid changes in and around the alveoli, they are unable to give us any light thereon. Its etiology remains obscure. Many, very many, remedies have been tried in vain. The body is composed of myriads of cells; the teeth and their sur\u00ad roundings are no exception. These have the quality of form altera\u00ad tion; they possess the ability to contract and expand, known as latent energy. This energy is controlled and modified by heat; the amount of heat is' aetermined by nerve-vibration, heat being a function of nerves. Extremes of temperature, above or below normal, softens or hardens tissue, induces necrosis or sclerosis. A living organism, or any of its organs, possess a certain degree of action and function, a condition when normal known as health. When functions are raised or lowered from the general average, a condition of disease exists. Nerve irri\u00ad tation increases temperature. Cell metabolism is a heat production. Energy is stored in the cells of organs as a latent agent ready to be used as a functional force directed by impulses. Extremes of heat and cold induce the various phases of inflammation by contracting nerve tissue longitudinally. Heat within certain defined limits is essential to the development of all organized beings. Excessive heat when applied to tissue, external or internal, causes its expansion, con\u00ad verts it from the solid into the fluid state. Any interference with the normal response of an impulse results in morbid physiology\u00ad pathology. All functions in any degee are controlled by and dependent upon nerve impulses. Fear causes a contraction of the blood vessels of the head and face; shame and anger a dilation of the same vessels; these two conditions are the result of nervi vasorum force on the vaso vasorum. With the cessation or the disappearance of the emotional state, the blood vessels return to their former degree of contraction. The flushed condition shown by redness and excessive heat is the result oi an accumulation of blood in the capillaries. The whitened, colorless, pallid cuticle is from a lack of ordinary nerve vibration; un\u00ad dulation is dependent upon excitation of nerves. Alveola pyorrhea is always associated with nephritis, an inflamma\u00ad tory condition of the kidneys. For many years I observed that every patient having pyorrhea of the gums had Bright's disfase, but not112 THE every one affected with nephritis has alveolar pyorrhea. !:!_her of the twelfth pair of dorsal nerves go to and innervate the kidneys, ms an eyelids. Inflammatory disturbances involve an interstitial gingivitis, an infil\u00ad tration of leucocytes into the interstices of connective tissue of the gum. When inflammation is confined to the margin of the gums adjoining the necks of the teeth, it is specialized as marginal gingivitis. The effect of a low-grade inflammation is the resorption of crust of osseous sub\u00ad stance covering the roots of the teeth or periosteum of the bones. The alveolar process is that portion of the maxillary bone which surrounds and supports the tooth. The surface of bone lining the alveolus is pierced by many passages for blood vessels which furnish nutriment to the pericementum and cementum. These contain in the a plexus vaso-motor nerves, vasoconstrictors and vaso\u00ad dilators, which control dilation of the blood vessels. In the physio\u00ad logic condition these fibers are in a state of continual contraction, giving to the arteries and veins a certain average caliber which not only permits, but by normal impulsive force causes a definite volume of blood to flow thru them in a given unit of time. The tonic con\u00ad traction and expansion, diastole and systole, is due to and modified by the amount of heat, a result of nerve vibration. The tonicity of the vacsular muscles is subject to increase or decrease in\u00b7accordance to the.\u00b7 quantity of nerve vibration and heat production; these are always correspondent in their amounts. Increased contraction results in a decrease of diameter of blood vessels and a reduction in the out\u00ad flow of the blood. The small arteries thus determine the volume of blood passing to any given area or organ in accordance with its func\u00ad tional activities. The vaso-motor nerves pass directly from the spinal nerves to the muscle-fibre through the inseparable, vibratory nerve\u00ad movement and the resultant heat therefrom, the internal diameter of the blood vessels and the volume of the blood are accurately adapted to the needs of each organ. During the rest and activity the blood vessels and nerves maintain a constant tone, normal t enitency, elas\u00ad ticity, activity, strength and excitability, as observed in a state of health. The nerves of the pericementum are derived from the fifth cranial or trigeminal nerve and the sympathetic nervous system; they enter by the apical tissue and the alveolar wall. Lippincott says, Exostosis (hypercementosis), pyorrhea alveolari. necrosis jaw (alveolar cancer), recession of the gums, stomatiti (inflammation of the mouth), gingivitis and gum boils, are due to in\u00ad tlammation of the tissues around the teeth. It is true, all of these morbid conditions arc attended by inflam PYORRHEA AL VEOLARIS 113 mation, are the result of excessive heat. ChiropracticaJly, these dis\u00ad eases should be placed in three clases: Pyorrhea, recession of the gums; gingivalgia, pain in the gums, and gingivitis, inflammation of the -gums. Gingivalgia, pain in the gums, and gingivitis, inflammation of the gums, are because of an impingement on the twelfth th_e _tet_h. alveolar 1:iurrowing gum boils are d to an im11inge\u00ad ment on Ole tfii,r\"9 P.ir of cervical nerves. Stom-atitis S!,1:!Jrom offthe right fihh dorsal n_erve. The dental profession give as probable causes of gingivitis that of uric acid diathesis, mercurial poisoning, gonorrheal infection, bacteria , drug action, faulty metabolism, auto-intoxication, irritants in the blood and disti:. bed peripheral nutrition, as systemic causes; that of maloc\u00ad clusion, c,v,;ruse and disuse of the teetli, as mechanical excitants, and a lack of, r an excess of, friction, and fermentable material lodged about the necks of the teeth, as local causes. I discovered and have proven by relieving a number of cases that cxpulsive gingivitis is caused by inflammation of tbe twelfth air of dorsal nerves, a portion of the fibers of which ramify the gums as \"ii\"ervi vasorum. A relief of this nervous affection may be had by re- moving the impingement on these nerves. ' BurchaTd's Dental Pathology states: \"In cases of hypercementosis .it is assumed that the source of irritation is pressure upon the nerves of the pericementum by the hypertropbic growth. Very widespread disorders may arise from this source.\" Burchard assumes that widespread disorders (spreading over many and varied conditions of disease) of the teeth and gums ma:, arise from pressure upon nerves. Chiropractors do n\u00b0Qt, or, at least should not, assume the source of irritation. They should know the origin of disease, and be scientific as well as efficient in the art of adjusting. Burchard mentions trifacial neuralgia as being a reftez disturbance from pressure upon nerves. Trifacial neuralgia includes odontalgia, toothache and neuralgia maxillaris. A refl.ex action is one executed without consciousness. Such move\u00ad ments are accounted for by chiropr.actors as a bounding back-a return of an impulse-a motor, impulsive response to a sensory impulse\u00ad the conveyance of an impression to the central nervous system and its transmission thru a motor nerve to the periphery. A reflex or refl.ected pain, according to pathologists, is one referred to some location other than that of its origin. This definition, if accepted by chiropractors, would define all pains as being reflex, origtnating in one locality by an impingement on a nerve, and its expression of disease, in another area, at its peripheral ending. Dental neuralgi3, odontalgia, toothache and dental ca'des arise from 114 THE CHIROPRACTOR ( nerve excitation of the._!hird pair of C:_rJi.\u00a3Jl neryes, the cause of inflammatory conditions, while tfiat \u00b7of the hard tissue of the ms because of pressure on t Jwe.lft.h atgf _dorsal. nerves, the cause of dental neuralgia and caries, can be traced to the third pair of cervical mc - Through the intestinal sympathetic connection of the fifth cranial nerve with the seventh, ninth and tenth cranial nerves, salivary, mus\u00ad cular, nervous, alimentary and pulmonary possible. dentition readily demonstrates the relationship exist\u00ad ing between pressure-impingement, irritation, inflammation and their \"reflex disturbances.\" Increased dental temperature stimulates the salivary glands, increases the Aow of\u00b7 saliva, creates a disturbance of functional activity-functions performed in excess is disease. Fever is diffused inflammation. Temperature above that of normal creates disease. Impulsive nerve-vibration determines the amount of heat. The degree of heat of the body of a living being regulates the amount of function. Functions performed above or below normal creates conditions known as disease. Burchard affirms: \"Neuralgia pain is a condition produced thru the overexcitation of any portion of a sensory nerve. The causes should be sought for and, if possible, removed.\" Chiropractors a e able to locate the cause of nerve overexcitation and relieve toothache in less than a minute by the removal of pressure. Burchard tells us that overuse, \u00b7abuse and disuse of the teeth are causes which produce inflammation of the pericementum (interstitial gingivitis), inflammatio'l purulent liquefaction (necrosis) of the pericementum (pyorrhea alveolaris). Burchard blames dental irritation for gout, obstinate pains in the toes and fingers, also sciatica, ovarian and uterine neuralgia. He speaks of violent a'ttacks of trifacial neuralgia as a common reflex dis\u00ad turbance from functional disorders of the eye and ear, and motor disturbances of chorea, epilepsy, paralysis, malaria, syphilis and amenia as\u00b7 producing neuralgia. The same old A11opathic explanation-one disease produces another. He fails to grasp the fact of nerve-distri\u00ad bution, that a nerve is composed of one or more fibers, which ramify one or more areas, consequently one or more affections, in as many parts of the body, may arise from one impingement upon a nerve containing many fibers. He maintains that neuralgia pains in the teeth are because of pressure on exposed dentine, that pulp degenera\u00ad tion as a cause of affections outnumber a11 others. Dentists and physicians are alike in ascribing one disease as the cause of another, and, that othet' is the cause of the one, simply from PYORRHEA ALVEOLARIS IIS the fact that two or more affections are frequently associated together. Chiropractors elucidate this heretofore mysterious connection of morbid anatomy and functional variation of two or more organs, collectively known as disease. "}
