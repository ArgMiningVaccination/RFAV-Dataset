Work with your MS healthcare provider to determine the best schedule for you. If the risk of your MS worsening outweighs or is equal to your risk of contracting COVID-19, do not alter your DMT schedule and get a vaccine as soon as possible. If your MS is stable, consider the following adjustments in the administration of your DMT to enhance the effectiveness of the Tysabri Do not delay starting one of these medicines for your vaccine injection. If you are already taking one of these DMTs, no adjustments of your DMT administration are recommended. Sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor modulators: If you are about to start one of these medicines, consider getting vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to starting your medicine. If you are already taking Gilenya, Mayzent, Zeposia or Ponvory, continue taking as prescribed and get vaccinated as soon as possible. Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) If you are about to start Lemtrada, consider getting vaccinated at least 4 weeks before starting Lemtrada. If you are already taking Lemtrada, consider getting vaccinated 24 weeks or more after the last Lemtrada dose. If you are due for your next treatment course of Lemtrada, when possible, resume Lemtrada 4 weeks or more after getting vaccinated. This suggested scheduling is not always possible and getting the vaccine may be more important than coordinating the timing of the vaccine with your Lemtrada dose. Work with your MS healthcare provider to determine the best schedule for you. Oral cladribine (Mavenclad) If you are about to start Mavenclad, consider getting vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to starting Mavenclad. If you are already taking Mavenclad, the currently available limited data does not suggest that timing the vaccine with your Mavenclad dosing is likely to make a significant difference in vaccine response. Getting the vaccine may be more important than coordinating timing of the vaccine with your Mavenclad treatment. If you are due for your next treatment course, when possible, resume Mavenclad 2-4 weeks after getting vaccinated. Work with your MS healthcare provider to determine the best schedule for you. Anti-CD20 monoclonal infusions (Bruimvi, Ocrevus and Rituxan about to start Briumvi, Ocrevus or Rituxan, consider getting vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to starting the infusions. If you are already taking Briumvi, Ocrevus or Rituxan, the ideal time for vaccination is approximately 4 weeks before your next scheduled therapy. This suggested scheduling is not always possible and getting the vaccine may be more important than timing the vaccine with your MS medicine. Work with your MS healthcare provider to determine the best schedule for you. Ofatumumab (Kesimpta) If you are about to start Kesimpta, consider getting vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to starting Kesimpta. If you are already taking Kesimpta, there is no data to currently guide timing of the vaccine in relation to your last DMT injection. Consider getting vaccinated 4 weeks after your last dose of Kesimpta. When possible, resume Kesimpta injections 4 weeks after getting vaccinated. This suggested scheduling is not always possible and getting the vaccine may be more important than timing the vaccine with your MS medicine. Work with your MS healthcare provider to determine the best schedule for you. High-dose steroids Consider starting the vaccine injection(s) at least 3-5 days after the last dose of steroids.
