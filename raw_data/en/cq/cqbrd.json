This will allow them to enter Singapore without quarantine and/or testing under the Vaccinated Travel Framework . 3 Similarly, fully vaccinated travellers with digital COVID -19 vaccination certificates issued in Singapore (i.e. HealthCerts) can securely obtain Vaccination Passes on the AU TT and TV platforms . 4 The TT and TV platforms are based on the African Union standard for harmonizing digital passes and hea lth-related screening standards across Africa for seamless travel. The TT ecosystem gives governments and eligible organisations access to a network of platforms for health credential issuance , border risk management , digital public health surveillance , and lab, clinical and vaccination registries. The platform s have been operational since the last quarter of 2020 and ha ve currently fully onboarded, or are finalising the onboarding of (either directly or through regional initiatives like WAHO's BIOMARS and ECSA's DELPHIX1), 21 major African destinations including Ethiopia, Nigeria, Ghana, Namibia, Kenya and Rwanda , with plans to onboard all African countries in the next few months . Through the new PolyGlot standards adapter, the T T and T V system s also facilitate the interoperability of African digital COVID -19 platforms and those of other continents. 5 Persons fully vaccinated in Singapore can apply for a digital vaccination HealthCert , issued by the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH) , via the Notrise website (notarise.gov.sg). The vaccination HealthCerts will be sent by Notrise to the individual's email and/or via the Singpass app . 1 The West Africa Health Organisation's Biodata Mutual Assurance (BIOMARS) protocol and the East, Central & Southern Africa Health Community - supported Health Data Exchange (ECSA's DELPHIX) 6 The PanaBIOS Consortium , a multistakeholder initiative convened under the aegis of the African Union, provided technical support , under the UNDP -sponsored Global Haven program, for the attainment of this Global Health milestone.
