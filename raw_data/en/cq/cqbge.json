Community has always been at the center of Adventist Health's mission \u2014Livin g God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope. The Community Health Needs Assessment is one way we put our faith- based mission into action. Every three years, we conduct this assessment with our community. The process involves input and representation from all: community organizations, providers, educators, businesses, parents, and the often marginalized \u2014low-income, minority, elderly and other underserved populations. We use the Community Health Needs Assessment to achieve the following goals : Learn about the community's most pressing health needs Understand the health behaviors, risk factors and social determinants that impact our community's health Identify community resources and prioritize needs Collaborate with community partners to develop collective strategies Partnering with our communitie s for better health W hile conducting the Community Health Needs Assessment we solicited feedback and input from a broad range of stakeholders. Contributors to the process included these partners: Healthy Columbia Willamette Colla borative Project Access N ow Central City Concern Data Sources The as sessment d rew f rom publicly av ailable s econdary data sources, as w ell as fro m nationally recognized data sources.

I n addition, to validate data and e nsure a broad representation of the communit y, Adventist Health Portland partnered with the H ealthy Columbia Willamette Collaborative to conduct a community health survey, key interviews and focus groups. Questions focused on access to, and use of, health care services; vision of a hea lthy community; and top community health needs a nd barriers to a ccessing re sources. 4 Ranking of Community Health Needs and Concerns Me thodology: Using the four sources of information listed below, thirty -one areas of health were ranked based on the information collected from those sources. Healthy Columbia Willamette Colla borative (Appendix A) AH Hospital Data AH CHNA i dentified Trends East Multnomah County Service Provider Survey T he following Adventist Health Portland Committees reviewed the findings from the Primary data (Page 2 9) and Secondary data (Page 3 3) sources listed above and approved the final ranking. AH Community Benefits Outreach Committee AH Community Mission Integration Committee (Board Sub -com mittee) . This committee includes members of the community.

We believe we have addressed the short falls with this document. We have also continued our membership with the Healthy Columbia Willamette Collaborate and we continue to use the CHNA generated by that organization as a major supplement to our own CHNA. The following bullet points are the major findings of this report. Demographics: Since our 2011 -2013 and 2014- 2016 CHNAs it has been observed that the concentration of our patients, either receiving charity care and Medicaid, has increase by a substantial amount in a number the zip codes in our service area. Since our 2011 -2013 and 2017- 2019 CHNA it has been observed that the concentration of our patients, either receiving charity care and Medicaid, has increase by a substantial amount in a number the zip codes out of our service area. Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Black/African Americans experienced the greatest number of disparities with the highest level of concern relative to other communities of color. In Multnomah County, all racial and ethnic groups experienced some disparities relative to their non- Latino White counterparts. A striking number of disparities exist for Black/African Americans and American Indian/Alaska Natives. Numerous disparities also exist for Latinos and Asian/Pacific Islanders, but those communities also fared better than non- Latino Whites for some indicators While two out of three uninsured Oregonians in 2012 were White, Oregonians of color were significantly over- represented among the uninsured Aging Over the past 10 years, the population age 65 and over increased from 37.8 million in 2007 to 50.9 million in 2017 (a 34% increase) and is projected to reach 94.7 million in 2060. About 28% (14.3 million) of older persons lived alone (9.5 million women, 4.8 million men). Among women age 75 and over, 44% lived alone. In 2017, 4,681,000 older adults (9.2%) were below the poverty level. 11 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Primary Data: Summary of what we heard from our community Behavior/Mental Health o Community support, both as crucial to maintaining cultural values and establishing a sense of belonging, and to help ease depression and other mental health concerns. o Significant stress, often because of racism, d iscrimination, and feelings of exclusion from the community due to their race/ethnicity, socio -economic status, LGBTQ+ identities, disability status, and citizenship status. o Cultural/social isolation, and geographic isolation. Access to Affordable Health Care o Lack of access to the health care system, citing financial and cultural barriers o Difficulty affording medical costs and medications. o Language barriers, and a lack of translators, were cited as significant barriers to health among participants. Life S tyle Concerns surrounding: o Drug and Alcohol Abuse o Safety concerns impacting the health of their community o Obesity o Lack of Exercise Social Determinates of Health o Housing Unaffordable housing costs and rent hikes greatly contribute to the stress community members face on a regular basis o Homelessness o Need for infrastructure changes to the transportation system Secondary Data: Chronic diseases and conditions \u2014such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and arthritis \u2014are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems. Diabetes: Diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States and in Oregon. The increase in diabetes deaths has almost exactly paralleled the rise in obesity. The prevalence of diabetes among adults in Oregon has more than doubled over the past 20 years. African Americans are three times as likely and American Indian and Alaska Natives are twice as likely to have diabetes compared to non -Latino whites. Obesity: Obesity is the number two cause of preventable death in Oregon and nationally, second only to tobacco use. 12 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Preventing obesity among Oregonians lowers the risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, arthritis, stress and depressio n. In Multnomah County approximately 26% of adults in the county are obese and 30.2%are overweight Heart Disease: Heart Disease is the second leading cause of death in Oregon. Cardiovascular disease rates are highest among blacks in Multnomah County. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in Oregon. Stroke death rates among blacks in Multnomah County is higher than the national rate. Hypertension rates is highest among blacks in Multnomah County C OPD/Asthma/Allergies: The death rate for COPD is de clining except for black women. From 2001 -2002 to 2013- 2014, current asthma prevalence significantly increased among adults; by weight status, asthma prevalence increased among adults in the overweight category but not among adults in normal weight or obese categories. Allergies are the 6th leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S. C ancer: The death rate from all cancers combined continues to decline. Cancer remains the second most common cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease, accounting for nearly one in every four deaths. The number one cause of death on Oregon. The top 5 most common cancer sites in the US are female breast, lung and bronchus, prostate, colorectal, and melanoma of the skin. In Oregon in 2015, there were 19,883 new cases of cancer. For every 100,000 people,400 cancer cases were reported. In Oregon, approximately 276 radon -related lung cancer deaths happen each year. Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer. More than one in three Oregonians with a h ousehold income of less than $15,000 a year smoke. In comparison, one in 10 Oregonians with a household income of more than $50,000 a year smoke. Race and ethnicity are also important factors. Thirty -five percent of American Indians in Oregon smoke compare d to 21 percent of non -Hispanic Whites Cigarette smoking has decreased from 1996 to 2016. However, use of non -cigarette products is on the rise. Behavioral Health : Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States age 18 and older, or 18.1% of the population every year.13 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Anxiety has become the number one mental health issue in North America. It's estimated that one third of the North American adult population experiences anxiety unwellness issues. Major depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States. An estimated 70 percent of adults in the United States have experienced a traumatic event at least once in their lives and up to 20 percent of these people go on to develop posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. People who have been traumatized need support and understanding from those around them Race is also a strong indicator of whether a child is likely to experience ACEs. Alzheimer's disease is t he most common cause of dementia among older adults More women than men have Alzheimer's or other dementias. Almost two -thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's are women. One of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States. The 6th leading cause of death among US adults. The 5th leading cause of death among adults aged 65 years or older The rate of suicides in Oregon rose 28.2% form 1999- 2016 In 2016, suicide became the second leading cause of death among those aged 10 -34 and the fourth leading caus e among those aged 35 -54. Illicit Drug Use: The opioid overdose epidemic continues to worsen in the United States. Fentanyl is the most prevalent and the most significant synthetic opioid threat to the United States. According to the National Survey on Dru g Use and Health (NSDUH), cocaine use has remained relatively stable since 2009. Across the Tri -County region in 2015 there were: 159 fatal opioid overdoses; two Deaths occur at younger ages among males than females in all three counties. Deaths from heroin occur at younger ages than from prescription opioids in all three counties. Over 90% of opioid deaths occurred among those of white race. From 2007 to 2017, the number of deaths attributable to alcohol increased 35 percent. 22% of Multnomah County reports to drink excessively. Hepatitis C: 81% of U.S. residents infected with HCV were born between 1945 and 1965. At least 50% of persons infected with HCV are unaware of their infection. HCV testing, followed by appropriate care and treatme nt, can reduce risk for liver cancer by 70% and mortality by 50%. Injection drug use accounted for most new HCV infections in Oregon. 14 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Sexually Transmitted Diseases: Chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis are the most common bacterial STIs in Ore gon. During 2017, these three infections continued to increase alarmingly, representing indisputable statewide epidemics with little evidence of abating. Forty -eight percent of cases diagnosed with HIV in Oregon during 2006 -2015 were Multnomah County resid ents. New diagnosis rates were nearly five times higher among Blacks and African Americans than Whites. The rate of new diagnoses for Hispanics was 1.8 times higher than for White non - Hispanics. Social Determinates of Health: Social determinants of health are conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality -of-life outcomes and risks. That high -income American households are getting wealthier faste r than those at the bottom has been widely noted. The number of people in poverty fell by 2.5 million between 2015 and 2016. Poverty is a strong predictor of poor health. People with lower socioeconomic status experience higher rates of early death. They also have higher rates of factors that contribute to chronic disease, such as smoking and obesity. Adult Oregonians living at or below the federal poverty limit and/or have not completed high school tend to have higher levels of disability status and highe r levels of food insecurity than those of more economic means. Adults living below the federal poverty limit and/or who have not completed high school were less likely to report good to excellent general health and more likely to report fair to poor genera l health than those with higher income and education. In addition, they were more than twice as likely to report frequent mental distress and that poor physical or mental health limited their daily activities. Multnomah County child poverty prevalence is 1 9%, 50% of black children live in Poverty, 41% for Hispanic Children, 13% for White children. African American households face hunger at a rate more than twice that of white, non - Hispanic households. And getting enough to eat is a consistent struggle for 1 in 4 African American children 40.0 million people lived in food -insecure households (US) Overall, households with children had a substantially higher rate of food insecurity than those without children The rate of food insecurity (being without access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food) in Oregon is 14.6%. Between 2007 and 2018, the number of individuals experiencing homelessness increased in 22 states and the District of Columbia. The largest increase was in New York 15 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center (11,771 more people), a 42 percent rise. Washington and Oregon also had large increases (3,135 and 1,268 more people). Oregon has the highest rate of unsheltered people in families in the US (54.3%) Oregon has the third highest rate of unsheltered veterans in the US (56.0%) Oregon has the fourth highest rate of unsheltered chronically homeless individuals in the US (78.5%) Introduction On behalf of the Adventist Health- Portland (AHP), the Community Benefit Committee conducted a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) to distinguish the unmet medical and public health needs within the greater East Multnomah County area. The study has two objectives. One objective was to meet state and federal requirement that the hospital conduct a comprehensive community health needs assessment every three years. The second, ultimately more important objective was to conduct a study that would provide a guide for AMC to build a consensus on the area's health care needs and provide a basis for the implementation plan to best direct our resources to improve the health of the area's residents. The information for this report was collected from multiple so urces. First, a web base information survey which was available to the public. Secondly, a Community Health Expert survey was sent to public health experts within the hospital and through the community. Thirdly, our membership with the Healthy Columbia Willamette Collaborate gave us access to the group's in- debt analysis of the community health needs of Multnomah County. The data also includes a review of publicly collected health and demographic statistics. Adventist Medical Center, like other non -profit hospitals, is a tax -exempt institution and has a statutory obligation to provide community services. The State of Oregon and the Federal government require non -profit hospitals to report the value of the community services provided during the year. The go vernment identities that collect this data have the responsibility to assure the public that all healthcare organizations claiming non -profit, tax - exempt status fulfill their fiduciary obligation by providing community benefit commensurate in value to the organization's tax savings. The guidelines used to determine what activities qualify as measurable community benefit, for both the state of Oregon and the Internal Revenue Department, are based on the guidelines created by the Catholic Hospital Associatio n. With the passage of the Accountable Care Act, non-profit hospitals will be receiving additional scrutiny. For the first time, we will have to meet federal standards for our community benefit programs. Under the direction and guidance of AMC administra tion, there has been a renewed emphasis in focus on the hospital's mission. This community health needs assessment will provide guidance in \"... focusing outreach and planning on improving the health of our local communities ...\" 16 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Whom We Serve In conducting a community health needs assessment, a hospital has many decisions to make. One of the decisions a hospital needs to make is to determine what is the community that they serve as it applies to their needs assessment? The Treasury Department and the IRS allow a hospital facility to consider all the relevant facts and circumstances in defining the community it serves. A hospital needs to make sure that it does nothing to exclude any at risk populations. Adventist Medica l Center (AMC) is a member of the Healthy Columbia Willamette Collaborate (HCWC) (see appendix C). The Needs Assessment that was developed by the HCWC is substantial and meets the Federal requirements required. The decision was made by the AMC Community Be nefit Committee to supplement the work completed with the Collaborate with a Community Health Needs Assessment of a more narrowly defined area. Using our hospital's patients to determine a community area that would direct hospital resources to be used to address the community needs identified by this needs assessment. In keeping with the spirit of recent IRS proposed regulations, AMC has determined from its hospital patient base, the zip codes where our patients live. \"Finally, if a hospital facility uses a method of defining its community that takes into account patient populations, these proposed regulations require the hospital facility to treat as patients all individuals who receive care from the hospital facility, without regard to whether (or ho w much) they or their insurers pay for the care received or whether they are eligible for financial assistance.\" 78 FR 20523 April 2, 2013 This data set was draw from 108,864 unduplicat ed patients from January 2017 to December 2018. In the following table, the top 33 zip codes are listed. The first column lists the zip codes in order of total amount of patients from most to least. For each zip code, the number of Charity Care and Medicaid patients for that zip code is listed along with the total of both. For each category, a percent of the zip codes total patien t counted is listed. For example, for zip code 97236, 5.3% of the 29,940 patients from that zip code had Charity Care and 33.79% had Medicaid. Please note that the patients are patients that were either inpatients or outpatients that use AMC hospital facil ities for health care services. The second table represents the top ten zip codes for AMC patients using either Charity Care or Medicaid and a column for combined total of Charity Care and Medicaid patients. For zip code 97233, 42.8% of the AMC patient c ount for 97233 were either Charity Care or Medicaid patients. This was a small increase from our last assessment. It also had the lowest median income for those ten zip codes. 97209 had a small sample size and is out of our service area. 17 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Adventist Medical Center 2017 -2018 Through September Unique Patient Count By Zip Code Zip Code Patient Count Percent of Total Patient Count Patients with Charity Percent of Patent Total per Zip Code Patients with Medicaid Percent of Patent Total per Zip Code Total Percent Charity and Medicaid Poverty* Median Household Income* Population * American Finder 2013 -2017 5 Year Estimates Above chart includes hospital patients only.

(The full report can be found at http://web.multco.us/heal th/reports .) \"In Multnomah County, all racial and ethnic groups examined in this report experienced some disparities relative to their non - Latino White counterparts. A striking number of disparities exist for Black/African Americans and American Indian/Alaska Natives. Numerous disparities also exist for Latinos and Asian/Pacific Islanders, but those communities also fared better than non -Latino Whites for some indicators. Non- Latino Black/African American Black/African Americans experienced the g reatest number of disparities with the highest level of concern relative to other communities of color. As shown in Figure 1, of the 33 indicators examined in this report, Black/African Americans experienced disparities for nine indicators that require int ervention and 18 indicators that need improvement . There were only four indicators where a disparity was not detected. There were no indicators where the group fared significantly better than the non -Latino White comparison group. Black/African Americans experienced a geographic disparity for each of the physical environment indicators.\" Black/African Americans experienced the largest number of health disparities among racial/ethnic groups in Multnomah County. The report shows statistically significant d isparities for 9 of the 18 health indicators for African Americans. Health indicators requiring improvement/intervention include: Cigarette use Obesity Teen birth rates Health Insurance Children with untreated tooth decay First trimester prenatal care Low birth weight babies Infant mortality Stroke mortality Prostate cancer mortality Gonorrhea HIV incidence Diabetes mortality Coronary Heart Disease All cancer Relative to their White non -Hispanic counterparts African Americans: continued to have significantly higher proportions of mothers who did not receive prenatal care in their first trimester experienced an infant mortality rate that was almost twice as hi gh. had a higher stroke mortality rate. had a diabetes mortality rate more than two and a half as high. were almost two times as likely to die of prostate cancer though there was no disparity in other forms of cancer. Homi cide rates about six times higher. 25 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Social and Economic indicators with improvement needed include: Children living in poverty Children living in single -parent households Children not meeting third -grade reading standards Unemployment Asian/Pacific Islanders Asian/Pacific Islanders experienced fewer health disparities than other racial/ethnic groups in Multnomah County. For 11 indicators, Asian/Pacific Islanders, did significantly bet ter than non -Latino Whites. Though this group fared well for many indicators, it is likely that aggregation of data into this large group is masking some disparities being experienced by sub -groups of Asian/Pacific Islanders. More attention should be given to disaggregated data for this population. A supplemental report focusing on Pacific Islander health disparities is forthcoming. Health indicators with improvement needed include: First trimester prenatal care Low birth weight babies Homicide rates Adults without health insurance was the one indicator that requires intervention level for Asian/Pacific Island-ers. The percentage without health insurance is more than two times higher among non -Latino Asian/Pacific Islanders in Multnomah County than among non -Latino Whites. Relative to their White non -Hispanic counterparts Asian/Pacific Islanders: continued to have significantly higher proportions of mothers who did not receive prenatal care in their first trimester. continued to have higher proportions of low birth weight births. experienced a higher homicide rate. Social and Economic indicators with improveme nt needed include: Third -grade reading level Post -high school education Native Americans There are statistically significant disparities in 5 of the 18 health indicators for Native Americans and 12 at the needs improvement level . However, for seven of the other health indicators, Native Americans did not have a sufficient number of events to c alculate a rate. Health indicators requiring intervention: Teen births Current cigarette smoking Adults with no physical activity outside of work Health indicators needing improvement include: No first trimester prenatal care Stroke mortality 26 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Infant mo rtality Low birthweight Self-reported mental health Relative to their White non -Hispanic counterparts: Native American had higher rates of teen births. Native Americans continued to have significantly higher proportions of mothers who did not receive prenatal care in their first trimester. Social and Economic indicators with improvement needed include: Are more than twice as likely to have children living in poverty Twice as likely to have children not meeting third- grade reading standards Lack of post -high school education Hispanics There are statistically significant disparities in 6 of the 18 health indicators for Hispanics. There were also eight indicators where Latinos fared significantly better than non- Latino Whites. Health indicators requiring intervention include: Obesity First trimester prenatal care Untreated tooth decay Teen birth rate Lack of health insurance Health indicators needing improvement include: HIV incidence Diabetes mortality rates Overall Health status Relative to their White non -Hispanic counterparts Hispanics: continued to have significantly higher proportions of mothers who did not receive prenatal care in their first trimester Experienced a teen birth rate that was 3.5 times higher Latino adults were two times more likely to lack health insurance Social and Economic indicators with improvement needed include: Are more than twice as likely to have children living in poverty Twice as likely to have children not meeting third- grade reading standards Lack of post -high school education Homicide rate From the \"Facing Race - 2013 Legislative Report Card on Racial Equity. 27 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Whites are far less likely to face poverty than communities of color in Oregon. In 2012, the poverty rate for Whites was only 15 percent, but 30 percent for Latinos, 34 percent for Native Americans and Alaska Natives, 36 percent for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders and 41 percent for African Americans. As for public education, in Multnomah County, just 7 percent of White students do not graduate from high school compared to 30 percent of students of color. In Oregon's placement of children in foster care, Native American youth are more than five times as likely to be placed into foster care; African American youth are four times as likely, and Pacific Islanders are twice as likely to white youth. Oregon's population is increasingly diverse \u2014more multiracial, multicultural and multilingual. From 1990 to 2012, Oregonians of color have increased from just 9.2 percent of the state's population to 22.4 percent. Communities of color face greater obstacles to health insurance than White Oregonians generally do. The primary source of health coverage in Oregon \u2014 job-based insurance \u2014is not accessed by people of color to the same degree given the higher unemployment and underemployment rates. While two out of three uninsured Oregonians in 2012 were White, Oregonians of color were significantly over -represented among the uninsured As We Age From the 2018 Profile of Older Americans: Over the past 10 years, the population age 65 and over increased from 37.8 million in 2007 to 50.9 million in 2017 (a 34% increase) and is projected to reach 94.7 million in 2060. Between 2007 and 2017 the population age 60 and over increased 35% from 52.5 million to 70.8 million. The 85 and over population is projected to more than double from 6.5 million in 2017 to 14.4 million in 2040 (a 123% increase). Racial and ethnic minority populations have increased from 7 .2 million in 2007 (19% of the older adult population) to 11.8 million in 2017 (23% of older adults) and are projected to increase to 27.7 million in 2040 (34% of older adults). The number of Americans age 45 -64 - who will reach age 65 over the next tw o decades - increased by 9% between 2007 and 2017. More than one in every seven, or 15.6%, of the population is an older American. Persons reaching age 65 have an average life expectancy of an additional 19.5 years (20.6 years for females and 18.1 years for males). 28 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center There were 86,248 persons age 100 and over in 2017 (0.2% of the total age 65 and over population). Older women outnumber older men at 28.3 million older women to 22.6 million older men. In 2017, 23% of persons age 65 and over were members of racial or ethnic minority populations --9% were African- Americans (not Hispanic), 4% were Asian (not Hispanic), 0.5% were American Indian and Alaska Native (not Hispanic), 0.1% were Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (not Hispanic), and 0.8% o f persons 65 and older identified themselves as being of two or more races. Persons of Hispanic origin (who may be of any race) represented 8% of the older population. A larger percentage of older men are married as compared with older women ---70% of m en, 46% of women. In 2018, 32% older women were widows. About 28% (14.3 million) of older persons lived alone (9.5 million women, 4.8 million men). Among women age 75 and over, 44% lived alone. The median income of older persons in 2017 was $32,654 for males and $19,180 for females. The real median income (after adjusting for inflation) of all households headed by older people increased by 1.1% (which was not statistically significant) between 2016 and 2017. Households containing families headed by persons age 65 and over reported a median income in 2017 of $61,946. In 2017, 4,681,000 older adults (9.2%) were below the poverty level. This poverty rate is not statistically different from the poverty rate in 2016 (9.3%). In 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau released a new Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) which considers regional variations in living costs, non -cash benefits received, and non-discretionary expenditures but does not replace the official poverty measure. In 2017, the SPM showed a poverty level for persons age 65 and over of 14.1% (almost 5 percentage points higher than the official rate of 9.2%). This increase is mainly due to including medical out -of-pocket expenses in the poverty calculations. The need for caregiving increases with age. In January -June 2018, the percentage of older adults age 85 and over needing help with personal care (20%) was more than twice the percentage for adults ages 75 -84 (9%) and five times the percentage for adults ages 65 -74 (4%). Among adults age 75 and over, 42% report the television is their first source of emergency information as compared with 31% for the total population. The percentage of older adults receiving information from the internet (9%) is much lower than for the total population (31%). 1 Principal sources of data for the Profile are the U.S. Census Bureau, the National Center for Health Statistics, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Profile incorporates the latest data available but not all items are updated on an annual basis. 2 This report includes data on the 65 and over population unless otherw ise noted. The phrase \"older adults or older persons\" refers to the population age 65 and over. 3 Numbers in this report may not add up due to rounding. 29 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Primary Data Primary Sources A primary source provides direct or firsthand evidence about an eve nt, object, person, or work of art. Primary sources provide the original materials on which other research is based and enable students and other researchers to get as close as possible to what happened during an event or time period. Published materials can be viewed as primary resources if they come from the time period that is being discussed and were written or produced by someone with firsthand experience of the event. Often primary sources re flect the individual viewpoint of a participant or observer. Primary sources can be written or non -written (sound, pictures, artifacts, etc.).

They recognized these requirements as an opportunity to align the efforts of hospitals, public health and the residents of the communities they serve to devel op an accessible, real- time assessment of community health across the four -county region. By working together, they would eliminate duplicative efforts, facilitate the prioritization of community health needs, enable joint efforts for implementing and tracking improvement activities, and improve the health of the community. Members With start -up assistance from the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, the Healthy Columbia Willamette Collaborative (Collaborative) was developed. It is a large public- private collaborative comprised of14 hospitals and four local public health departments in the four -county region. Members include: Adventist Medical Center, Clackamas County Health Department, Clark County Public Health Department, Kaiser Permanente, Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center, Legacy Meridian Park Medical Center, Legacy Mount Hood Medical Center, Legacy Salmon Creek, Multnomah County Health Department, Oregon Health & Science University, PeaceHealth Southwe st Medical Center, Providence Milwaukie, Providence Portland, Providence St. Vincent, Providence Willamette Falls, Tuality Healthcare and Washington County Health Department. HCWC Prioritized Core Issues Overview: The Conveners collected feedback from HCWC Data Workgroup members and their external partners through a survey about the 10 Core Issues which were identified for the CHNA. After review of the feedback received and assessment of the underlying data supporti ng each Core Issue, five Core Issues were prioritized. Top 10 Core Issues: The identified Core Issues are listed in alphabetical order: 1. Access to: Health Care, Transportation, and Resources 2. Behavioral Health (Depression and Intentional Self- harm) 3. Chroni c Conditions (Heart Disease, Diabetes, Hypertension) 4. Community Representation 5. Culturally Responsive Care 6. Discrimination/Racism 32 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center 7. Isolation 8. Liver Disease 9. Sexually Transmitted Infections ( Chlamydia and Gonorrhea) 10. Trauma Prioritized Core Issues: Behavioral Health Community Representation Culturally Responsive Care Isolation Sexually Transmitted Infections The prioritized Core Issues were chosen because they were identified as key gaps in the region by both HCWC Data Work group members and external partners. The underlying data also suggests these Core Issues are not being adequately addressed and there is significant room for improvement across the region. The Core Issues of Discrimination & Racism and Trauma also rose to the top through the prioritization process but are more accurately reflected in the CHNA as drivers/influencers for each of the prioritized issue above. The Core Issues of Access to: Health Care, Transportation and Resources, Chronic Conditions, and Live r Disease, were not prioritized as they were not Survey Conclusions A review of the results of the two surveys shows similar concerns among the both. Those concerns are as follows: Behavior/Mental Health o Community support, both as crucial to maintaining cultural values and establishing a sense of belonging, and to help ease depression and other mental health concerns. o Significant stress, often because of racism, discrimination, and feelings of exclusion from the community due to their race/ethnicity, socio -economic status, LGBTQ+ identities, disability status, and citizenship status. o Cultural/social isolation, and geographic isolation. Access to Affordable Health Care o Lack of access to the health care system, citing financial and cultural barriers o Difficulty affording medical costs and medications. o Language barriers, and a lack of translators, were cited as significant barriers to health among participants. Life Style Concerns surrounding: o Drug and Alcohol Abuse o Safety concerns impacting the health of their community 33 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center o Obesity o Lack of Exercise Social Determinates of Health o Housing Unaffordable housing costs and rent hikes greatly contribute to the stress community members face on a regular basis o Homelessness o Need for infrastructure chang es to the transportation system These results will be added to concerns raised by the following sections of secondary data research. The data is drawn from publicly available data. Analysis will be made based on trends in occurrences of the major areas of illness, leading causes of death and cost of medical care. Secondary Data Secondary sources describe, discuss, interpret, comment upon, analyze, evaluate, summarize, and process primary sources . A secondary source is generally one or more steps removed from the event or time period and are written or produced after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. Secondary sources often lack the freshness and immediacy of the original material. On occasion, secondary sources will collect, organize, and repackage primary source information to increase usability and speed of delivery, such as an online encyclopedia. Like primary sources, secondary materials can be written or non- written (sound, pictures , movies, etc.).

Health Behaviors include measures of smoking, diet and exercise, alcohol use and risky sex behavior. Clinical care includes measures of access to care and quality of care. Social and economic factors include measures of education, employment, income, family and social support, and community safety. The physical environment includes measures of environmental quality and the built environment. Factors within this category have changed in the 2018 ranking. The health outcomes ranking is based on measures of mortality and morbidity. 37 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center The mortality rank represents length of life and is based on a measure of premature death; the years of potential life lost prior to age 75. The morbidity ra nk is based on measures that represent health -related quality of life and birth outcomes. Four morbidity measures were combined: self -reported fair or poor health, poor physical health days, poor mental health days, and the percent of births with low birth weight. Prevalence of Selected Chronic Conditions among Adults by County County Arthritis Asthma Heart Attack Coronary Heart Disease Stroke Data form BRFSS, by County, Oregon, Chronic Diseases among Oregon Adults Rates are age- adjusted. Age-adjusting a rate is a way to make fairer comparisons between groups with different age distributions. For example, a county having a higher percentage of elderly people may have a higher rate of death or hospitalization than a county with a younger pop ulation, merely because the elderly is more likely to die or be hospitalized. The same distortion can happen when we compare races, genders, or time periods. Age adjustment can make the different groups more comparable.

The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was 9.7%, and the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 4.3%. These results show that among all adults with diabetes, 30.7% had undiagnosed diabetes. Men had a higher prevalence of total diabetes than women. The prevalence of total, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes increased with age and weight status. Differences were seen in the prevalence of diagnosed, undiagnosed, and total diabetes among the race and Hispanic- origin groups. The prevalence of total, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes was higher among Hispanic adults than among non -Hispanic 40 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center white adults, and the prevalence of total and diagnosed diabetes was higher among non -Hispanic black adults than among non -Hispanic white adults. No significant differences were seen in the prevalence of total, diagnosed, or undiagnosed diabetes between non -Hispanic Asian and non -Hispanic white adults. Continued monitoring of total, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes will provide informatio n about the burden of diabetes am ong adults in the United States The rates of diagnosed diabetes in adults by race/ethnic background are: 7.4% of non -Hispanic whites 8.0% of Asian Americans 12.1% of Hispanics 12.7% of non -Hispanic blacks Age-Adjusted Prevalence of Total, Diagnosed, and Undiagnosed Diabetes* Among Adults Aged 20 Years \u2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 -2000 to 2015 -2016 41 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2015 based on the 79,535 death certificates in which diabetes was listed as the underlying cause of death. In 2015, diabetes was mentioned as a cause of death in a total of 252,806 certificates. Diabetes may be underreported as a cause of death. Studies have found that only about 35% to 40% of people with diabetes who died had diabetes listed anywhere on the death certificate and about 10% to 15% had it listed as the underlyi ng cause of death. In 2016, Diabetes was the 7 th leading cause of death. Total deaths in Oregon in 2016: 1,240 Deaths per 100,000 people in Oregon in 2016: 30.4 Deaths per 100,000 people in Oregon in 1997: 25.9 The increase in diabetes deaths has almost exactly paralleled the rise in obesity, Hedberg said. Many of the same factors associated with hypertension, specifically diet, are at the root of the increase. The prevalence of diabetes among adults in Oregon has more than doubled \u2014 an increase of 124% \u2014 over the past 20 years. There are approximately 287,000 adults with diagnosed diabetes in Oregon and an estimated 110,000 adults with diabetes who do not know it. Diabetes is slightly more common among men compared to women (9.2% vs. 7.8%). More th an 18% of adults aged 65 years and over have been diagnosed with diabetes compared to 2% of adults aged 18 to 34 years. 42 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center African Americans are three times as likely and American Indian and Alaska Natives are twice as likely to have diabetes compared to non -Latino whites. An estimated 1.1 million (37%) adults have prediabetes, which puts them at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. In 2013, about 821,000 (27%) adults were considered obese and 1,014,000 (33%) were overweight. Obesity Obesity is the number two cause of preventable death in Oregon and nationally, second only to tobacco use. Obesity related conditions account for 1,400 deaths in Oregon each year. Preventing obesity among Oregonians lowers the risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, arthritis, stress and depression. Children and adolescents who are obese are at increased risk for becoming obese as adults. Starting in 2018, coordinated care organizations (CCOs) will be held accountable to a metric for weight assessment, nutrition and physical activity counseling for children and adolescents. This preliminary measure begins conversations between local and state public health authorities and CCOs about strategies to address obesity. 43 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Multno mah County, Oregon, is tackling obesity throughout the community. Approximately 26% of adults in the county are obese and 30.2% are overweight. Among children, 26% of eighth grade students and 23.4% of 11th grade students are overweight or at risk of becom ing overweight. Approximately 70% of adults in Multnomah County do not eat the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables, and 14% of adults reported no physical activity in the last 30 days. Although some communities in Multnomah County have made great strides in the areas of access to healthy food and support of local farmers, disadvantaged populations are still struggling. Oregon is consistently ranked as one of the nation's most food -insecure states. Further, approximately 15% of the 735,334 re sidents in Multnomah County live under the Federal poverty level. In addition to obesity -prevention efforts aimed at Multnomah County's entire population, certain initiatives target high -risk populations, such as low -income groups and black residents. Heart Disease and Stroke What is heart disease? Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. More than 600,000 Americans die of heart disease each year. That's one in every four deaths in this country. The term \"heart disease\" refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common type is coronary artery disease, which can cause heart attack. Heart Disease, Stroke and other Cardiovascular Diseases Cardiovascular disease, listed as the underlying cause of death, accounts for nearly 836,546 deaths in the US. That's about 1 of every 3 deaths in the US. About 2,300 Americans die of cardiovascular disease each day, an average of 1 death every 38 seconds. 44 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Cardiovascular diseases claim more lives each year than all forms of cancer and Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease combined. About 92.1 million American adults are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or the after -effects of stroke. Direct and indirect costs of total cardiovascular diseases and stro ke are estimated to total more than $329.7 billion; that includes both health expenditures and lost productivity. Nearly half of all NH black adults have some form of cardiovascular disease, 47.7 percent of females and 46.0 percent of males. Coronary Heart Disease is the leading cause (43.8 percent) of deaths attributable to cardiovascular disease in the US, followed by Stroke (16.8 percent), Heart Failure (9.0 percent), High Blood Pressure (9.4 percent), diseases of the arteries (3.1 percent), and ot her cardiovascular diseases (17.9 percent). Heart disease accounts for 1 in 7 deaths in the US. Heart Disease (including Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Stroke) remains the No. 1 cause of death in the US. Coronary heart disease accounts for 1 in 7 deaths in the US, killing over 366,800 people a year. Stroke Someone in the US has a stroke about once every 40 seconds. Stroke accounts for 1 of every 19 deaths in the US. Stroke kills someone in the US about every 3 minutes 45 second s. When considered separately from other cardiovascular diseases, stroke ranks No. 5 among all cause of death in the US, killing nearly 133,000 people a year. From 2005 to 2015, the age -adjusted stroke death rate decreased 21.7 percent, and the actua l number of stroke deaths declined 2.3 percent. Each year, about 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke. Approximately 610,000 of these are first attacks, and 185,000 are recurrent attacks. Stroke is a leading cause of serious long- term disability in the US. Sudden Cardiac Arrest In 2015, any -mention sudden cardiac arrest mortality in the US was 366,807. Most of the Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCA) occurs at public settings (39.5 percent). In 2015, home or residence (27.5 percent) and nursing homes (18.2 percent) were the second and third most common locations of OHCA. 45 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center 46 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease In the United States, an estimated 16 million adults have COPD. However, that may be an underestimate. The American Lung Association (ALA) thinks there may be as many as 24 million American adults living with COPD. Overall, the crude rate for COPD -related deaths among adults aged 25 and over remained flat with 132.1 de aths per 100,000 population occurring in 20 00 compared with 130.4 in 2014 . The age - adjusted rate declined 12.3%, from 134.6 deaths per 100,000 standard population in 2000 to 118.0 in 2014. For men aged 25 and over, the crude death rate declined from 146.4 in 2000 to 134.5 in 2009 but remained stable afterward. The age -adjusted rate declined 22.5%, from 183.0 in 2000 to 141.9 in 2014. 47 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Among women in the same age group, the crude death rate increased from 119.0 in 2000 to 123.7 in 2014. The age -adjusted rate declined 3.8%, from 104.9 in 2000 to 100.9 in 2014. The age -adjusted death rate remained higher for men than for women, although the gender gap narrowed over time Overall, the age- adjusted death rate for black adults aged 25 and over declined 11.5%, from 98.8 deaths per 100,000 standard population in 2000 to 87.4 in 2014 ( Figure 4 ). For black men, the age- adjusted death rate declined 24.3%, from 159.8 in 2000 to 121.0 in 2014. For black women, the death rate increased 4.2%, from 64.1 in 2000 to 66.8 in 2014. The death rate was higher for black men than for black women throughout the period, although the gender gap decreased over time. Asthma Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001 -2014 In 2011- 2014, current asthma prevalence was 8.8% among adults. It was higher among adults with obesity (11.1%) compared with adults in normal weight (7.1%) and overweight (7.8%) categories. Women with obesity had hig her current asthma prevalence (14.6%) than those in normal weight (7.9%) and overweight (9.1%) categories. Current asthma prevalence did not differ significantly by weight status for men. Current asthma prevalence was highest among adults with obesity for all race and Hispanic origin groups and age groups. Overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 2001 -2002 (7.1%) to 2013- 2014 (9.2%). By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or norm al weight categories From 2001 -2002 to 2013 -2014, current asthma prevalence significantly increased among adults; by weight status, asthma prevalence increased among adults in the overweight category but not among adults in normal weight or obese categorie s. Among adults, overall current asthma prevalence increased significantly from 2001- 2002 (7.1%) to 2013- 2014 (9.2 %). Among weight status subgroups, current asthma prevalence increased among adults in the overweight category, from 5.6% in 2001- 2012 to 8.4% in 2013- 2014. There was no significant trend in current asthma prevalence among adults in the normal weight or obese categories. Status and race and Hispanic origin: United States, 2011 -2014 current asthma prevalence 48 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Allergy Asthma and allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever), food allergy, and eczema, are common for all age groups in the United States. Asthma affects more than 24 million people in the U.S., including more than 6 million children. 1 Allergies are the 6th leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S. with an annual cost in excess of $18 billion. More than 50 million Americans suffer from allergies each year. 2 Allergic rhinitis, often called hay fever, is a common condition that causes symptoms such as sneezin g, stuffy nose, runny nose, watery eyes and itching of the nose, eyes or the roof of the mouth. Allergic rhinitis can be seasonal or perennial. Symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis occur in spring, summer and/or early fall. They are usually caused by allergic sensitivity to pollens from trees, grasses or weeds, or to airborne mold spores. 49 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center People with perennial allergic rhinitis experience symptoms year- round. Perennial allergic rhinitis is generally caused by sensitivity to house dust mites, animal dan der, cockroaches and/or mold spores. Underlying or hidden food allergies rarely cause perennial nasal symptoms. Once diagnosed, allergic rhinitis treatment options are: avoidance, eliminating or decreasing your exposure to the irritants or allergens that t rigger your symptoms, medication and immunotherapy (allergy shots). Immunotherapy (allergy shots) helps reduce hay fever symptoms in about 85% of people with allergic rhinitis. The prevalence of food and skin allergies increased in children under 18 years from 1997 - 2011. Cancer Cancer remains the second most common cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease, accounting for nearly one in every four deaths. The incidence of some cancers, including kidney, thyroid, pancreas, liver, ute rus, melanoma of the skin, myeloma (cancer of plasma cells), leukemia, testis and oral cavity and pharynx, is rising. The burden of some types of cancer weighs more heavily on some groups than on others. The rates of both new cases and deaths from cancer vary by socioeconomic status, sex, and racial and ethnic group. The economic burden of cancer also is taking its toll. As the U.S. population ages and newer technologies and treatments become available, national expenditures for cancer continue to rise an d could potentially exceed overall medical care expenditures combined. Researchers believe that rising obesity in the U.S. has contributed to the increasing death rates for endometrial, pancreatic, and liver cancers. Researchers also believe that hepatitis C infection among Baby Boomers has contributed to increasing rates for liver cancer, and that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has contributed to the increasing rates for oral cavity and pharynx cancers. Researchers say the decreases in mortality fo r lung cancer and several other cancer sites are largely due to reduced tobacco use. However, cigarette smoking still accounts for more than 25% of cancer deaths in the US. Improved treatments have also helped lower the death rate for several cancers, especially breast, prostate, colorectal, leukemia, and Non -Hodgkin lymphoma. 50 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center The top 5 most common cancer sites in the US are female breast, lung and bronchus, prostate, colorectal, and melanoma of the skin.

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of more than 200 related viruses. More than 40 HPV types can be easily spread through direct sexual contact, from the skin and mucous membranes of infected people to the skin and mucous membranes of their partners. They can be spread by vaginal, anal, and oral sex ( 1). Other HPV types are responsible for non- genital warts , which are not sexually transmitted. Each year, about 42,700 new cases of cancer are found in parts of the body where human papillomavirus (HPV) is often found. HPV causes about 33,700 of these cancers. An HPV -associated cancer is a specific cellular type of cancer that is diagnosed in a part of the body where HPV is often found.

Nearly one in five U.S. adults' lives with a mental illness (44.7 million in 2016). Mental illnesses include many different conditions that vary in degree of severity, ranging from mild to moderate to severe. Two broad categories can be used to describe these conditions: Any Mental Illn ess (AMI) and Serious Mental Illness (SMI). AMI encompasses all recognized mental illnesses. SMI is a smaller and more severe subset of AMI. Additional information on mental illnesses can be found on the NIMH Health Topics Pages. Prevalence of Any Mental Illness (AMI) In 2016, there were an estimated 44.7 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States with AMI. This number represented 18.3% of all U.S. adults. The prevalence of AMI was higher among women (21.7%) than men (14.5%). Young adults aged 18 -25 years had the highest prevalence of AMI (22.1%) compared to adults aged 26 - 49 years (21.1%) and aged 50 and older (14.5%). The prevalence of AMI was highest among the adults reporting two or more races (26.5%), followed by the American Indian/Alaska Native group (22.8%). The prevalence of AMI was lowest among the Asian group (12.1%). Mental Health Treatment \u2014 AMI NSDUH defines mental health treatment as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling, or having used pre scription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. In 2016, among the 44.7 million adults (over 18) with AMI, 19.2 million (43.1%) received mental health treatment in the past year. More women with AMI (48.8%) received mental health treatment than men with AMI (33.9%). The percentage of young adults aged 18 -25 years with AMI who received mental health treatment (35.1%) was lower than adults with AMI aged 26 -49 years (43.1%) and aged 50 and older (46.8%).

Anxiety disorders are highly treatable, yet only 36.9% of those suffering receive treatment. Prevalence of Any Anxiety Disorder Among Adolescents Based on diagnostic interview data from National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS -A), Figure 3 shows lifetime prevalence of any anxiety disorder among U.S. adolescents aged 13- 18.3 o An esti mated 31.9% of adolescents had any anxiety disorder. o Of adolescents with any anxiety disorder, an estimated 8.3% had severe impairment. DSM -IV criteria were used to determine impairment. o The prevalence of any anxiety disorder among adolescents was higher f or females (38.0%) than for males (26.1%). o The prevalence of any anxiety disorder was similar across age groups. Anxiety has become the number one mental health issue in North America. It's estimated that one third of the North American adult population experiences anxiety unwellness issues. Anxiety Disorders affect 18.1 percent of adults in the United States (approximately 40 million adults between the ages of 18 to 54). - National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Current estimates put this number much higher - approximately 30 percent - as many people don't seek help, are misdiagnosed, or don't know they have issues with anxiety.

We believe the number of men who struggle with generalized anxiety is much higher because many don't report it to their doctors. Very likely to be co -exist with other disorder s. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: 2.2 million, 1.0%. It is equally common among men and women. One third of afflicted adults had their first symptoms in childhood. In 1990 OCD cost the U.S. 6% of the total $148 billion mental health bill. Panic Disorder: 6 million, 2.7%. Women are twice as likely to be afflicted than men (we believe the number of men who struggle with panic disorder is much higher because many don't report it to their doctors). Often co -exists with depression. 63 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Posttraumatic Stress Dis order: 7.7 million, 3.5%. Women are more likely to be afflicted than men. Rape is the most likely trigger of PTSD, 65% of men and 45.9% of women who are raped will develop the disorder. Childhood sexual abuse is a strong predictor of lifetime likelihood for developing PTSD. Social Anxiety Disorder: 15 million, 6.8%. It is equa lly common among men and women. Specific Phobia affects: 19 million, 8.7%. Women are twice as likely to be afflicted as men. SOURCE: Anxiety Disorders Association of America (ADAA) https://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety- statistics -information.shtml Anxiety and Depression It's not uncommon for someone with an anxiety disorder to also suffer from depression or vice versa. Nearly one-half of those diagnosed with depression are also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Facts Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) GAD affects 6.8 million adults, or 3.1% of the U.S. population, yet only 43.2% are receiving treatment. Women are twice as likely to be affected as men. GAD often co -occurs with major depression. Panic Disorder (PD) PD affects 6 million adults, or 2.7% of the U.S. population. Women are twice as likely to be affected as men. Social Anxiety Disorder SAD affects 15 million adults, or 6.8% of the U.S. population. SAD is equally common among men and women and typically begins around age 13. According to a 2007 ADAA survey, 36% of people with social anxiety disorder report experiencing symptoms for 10 or more years before seeking help. Specific Phobias Specific phobias affect 19 million adults, or 8.7% of the U.S. population. Wom en are twice as likely to be affected as men. Symptoms typically begin in childhood; the average age -of-onset is 7 years old. Obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are closely related to anxiety disorders, which some may experience at the same time, along with depression. Obsessive -Compulsive Disorder (OCD) OCD affects 2.2 million adults, or 1.0% of the U.S. population. OCD is e qually common among men and women. The average age of onset is 19, with 25 percent of cases occurring by age 14. One -third of affected adults first experienced symptoms in childhood. 64 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) PTSD affects 7.7 million adults, or 3.5% of the U.S. population. Women are more likely to be affected than men. Rape is the most likely trigger of PTSD: 65% of men and 45.9% of women who are raped wi ll develop the disorder. Childhood sexual abuse is a strong predictor of lifetime likelihood for developing PTSD. Major Depressive Disorder The leading cause of disability in the U.S. for ages 15 to 44.3. MDD affects more than 16.1 million American adults, or about 6.7%of the U.S. population age 18 and older in a given year. While major depressive disorder can develop at any age, the median age at onset is 32.5 years old. More prevalent in women than in men. Persistent depressive disorder, or PDD, (formerly called dysthymia) is a form of depression that usually continues for at least two years. Affects approximately 1.5 percent of the U.S. population age 18 and older in a given year. (about 3.3 million American adults). Only 61.7% of adults with MDD are receiving treatment. The average age of onset is 31 years old. Children Anxiety disorders affect 25.1% of children between 13 and 18 years old. Research shows that untreated children with anxiety disorders are at higher risk to perform poorly in school, miss out on important social experiences, and engage in substance abuse. Anxiety disorders also often co -occur with other disorders such as depression, eating disorders, and attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Older Adults Anxiety is as common among older adults as among the young. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder among older adults, though anxiety disorders in this population are frequently associated with traumatic events such as a fall or acute illness.

For some individuals, major depression can result in severe impairments that interfere with or limit one's ability to carry out major life activities. Depression (major depressive disorder o r clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least two weeks. Some forms of depression are slightly different, or they may develop under unique circumstances, such as: 65 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia) is a depressed mood that lasts for at least two years. A person diagnosed wit h persistent depressive disorder may have episodes of major depression along with periods of less severe symptoms, but symptoms must last for two years to be considered persistent depressive disorder. Postpartum depression is much more serious than the \"ba by blues\" (relatively mild depressive and anxiety symptoms that typically clear within two weeks after delivery) that many women experience after giving birth. Women with postpartum depression experience full -blown major depression during pregnancy or afte r delivery (postpartum depression). The feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that accompany postpartum depression may make it difficult for these new mothers to complete daily care activities for themselves and/or for their babies. Psychoti c depression occurs when a person has severe depression plus some form of psychosis, such as having disturbing false fixed beliefs (delusions) or hearing or seeing upsetting things that others cannot hear or see (hallucinations). The psychotic symptoms typically have a depressive \"theme,\" such as delusions of guilt, poverty, or illness. Seasonal affective disorder is characterized by the onset of depression during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight. This depression generally lifts during spring and summer. Winter depression, typically accompanied by social withdrawal, increased sleep, and weight gain, predictably returns every year in seasonal affective disorder. Bipolar disorder is different from depression, but it is included in this list is because someone with bipolar disorder experiences episodes of extremely low moods that meet the criteria for major depression (called \"bipolar d epression\"). But a person with bipolar disorder also experiences extreme high - euphoric or irritable - moods called \"mania\" or a less severe form called \"hypomania.\" Above from: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml Trauma Complex Trauma Many of the children and young people found in child welfare, mental health, special education, and justice settings have been exposed to trauma in their early years. The literature differentiates between type 1, or acute trauma, which results from exposur e to a single overwhelming event, and type 2, or complex trauma (a.k.a. developmental or relationship trauma), which results from extended exposure to traumatizing situations. Bessel van der Kolk (2005) describes complex trauma as \"the experience of multiple, chronic and prolonged, developmentally adverse traumatic events, most often of an interpersonal nature...and early life onset\". Kinniburgh and her colleagues (2005) note that in terms of both experience and effect, \"exposure to complex inte rpersonal trauma is qualitatively distinct from acute trauma\" Outcomes of complex trauma Following exposure to acutely traumatizing events, some people develop the symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder. These involve the repeated, cue -triggered, involuntary re -experiencing of the terror and helplessness (often through nightmares or flashbacks); a focus on avoiding cues that might be reminders of the trauma; hyperarousal and hypervigilance ; problems with concentration and focus; and an exaggerated startle response (the formal criteria can be found in American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Children affected by developmental trauma need adults in their lives who can understand the pervasive impact of thei r experiences and who recognize that the pain from ruptured connections can lead to a range of challenging behaviors . They need adults who can develop trauma -informed approaches that promote healing and connection. The three treatment elements ou tlined here can be applied by anyone who has a role in caring for, teaching, or otherwise mentoring these children and constitute the essential features of healing environments. https://s3 Portland Adventist Medical Center An estimated 70 percent of adults in the United States have experienced a traumatic event at least once in their lives and up to 20 percent of these people go on to develop posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. An estimated 5 percent of Americans \u2014more than 13 million people \u2014have PTSD at any given time. Approximately 8 percent of all adults \u20141 of 13 people in this country \u2014will develop PTSD during their lifetime. An estimated 1 out of 10 women will get PTSD at some time in their lives. Women are about twice as likely as men to develop PTSD. Extreme Trauma and PTSD PTSD may develop following exposure to extreme trauma. Extreme trauma is a terrifying event or ordeal that a person has experienced, witnessed, or learned about, especially one that is life -threatening or causes physical harm. The experience causes that p erson to feel intense fear, horror, or a sense of helplessness. The stress caused by trauma can affect all aspects of a person's life including mental, emotional, and physical well- being. Research suggests that prolonged trauma may disrupt and alter brain chemistry. For some people, this may lead to the development of PTSD. Risk Factors Those at risk for developing PTSD include: Anyone who has been victimized or has witnessed a violent act, or who has been repeatedly exposed to life-threatening situations. This includes survivors of: Domestic or intimate partner violence Rape or sexual assault or abuse Physical assault such as mugging or carjacking Other random acts of violence such as those that take place in public, in schools, or in the workplace Children who are neglected or sexually, physically, or verbally abused, or adults who were abused as children Survivors of unexpected events in everyday life such as: Car accidents or fires 67 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Natural disasters, such as tornadoes or earthquakes Major catastr ophic events such as a plane crash or terrorist act Disasters caused by human error, such as industrial accidents Combat veterans or civilian victims of war Those diagnosed with a life -threatening illness or who have undergone invasive medical procedures Professionals who respond to victims in trauma situations, such as, emergency medical service workers, police, firefighters, military, and search and rescue workers People who learn of the sudden unexpected death of a close friend or relative Estimated risk for developing PTSD for those who have experienced the following traumatic events: Rape (49 percent) Severe beating or physical assault (31.9 percent) Other sexual assault (23.7 percent) Serious accident or injury, for example, car or train accident (16. 8 percent) Shooting or stabbing (15.4 percent) Sudden, unexpected death of family member or friend (14.3 percent) Child's life -threatening illness (10.4 percent) Witness to killing or serious injury (7.3 percent) Natural disaster (3.8 percent) http://www.ptsdalliance.org/alliance -formed -to-raise -awareness -about -ptsd/ Adverse Childhood Experiences In \"The Prevalence of Adverse Childhood Experiences, Nationally, by State, and by Race or Ethnicity ,\" authors Vanessa Sacks and David Murphey used data from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health to determine which children 17 and under are more likely to experience trauma, and where these children live. They looked at the data regarding eight ACEs: Parental divorce or separation Parental death Parental incarceration Violence among adults in the home Victim or witness to neighborhood violence Living with a mentally ill adult Living with someone who has a substance abuse problem 68 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Experiencing economic hardship often, such as the family finding it difficult to afford food and housing ACEs aren't limited to this set, Sacks noted, and they also change over time as scholars better understand trauma. For instance, experiencing violence in one's neighborhood and homelessness didn't used to be considered ACEs; they are now. Some researchers are calling for racism to be designated one as well. But one thing is clear: The more ACEs a child experiences, rather than any particular one, the more likely they are to struggle later. The most prevalent ACEs that American children experience are econom ic hardship and divorce or separation of a parent or guardian. Nationally, one in every ten kids has experienced three or more of them. Maryland, Massachusetts, and Minnesota had the most children with no ACEs, while in Arizona, Arkansas, Montana, New Mexi co, and Ohio as many as one in seven children had experienced three or more. Arkansas had the most ACEs, with 56 percent of all children experiencing at least one, and Minnesota had the least at 37 percent \u2014which is still more than a third of the state's ch ildren. While Sacks said it's difficult to ascertain what causes such stark differences among states, one factor stands out: Some of the states with the most ACEs are also those with a high rate of child poverty. And though Sacks and Murphy didn't look at differences between urban and rural children, the 2011- 2012 National Survey of Children's Health found that rural children were more likely to experience ACEs than urban children\u2014 due in part to the fact that rural children are more likely to live in poverty than their urban counterparts. Race is also a strong indicator of whether a child is likely to experience ACEs. \"In almost every group of states we looked at, as well as nationally, white and Asian children have the lowest rates of ACEs, while black and Hispanic children tend to have the highest,\" said Sacks. In numbers, this translates to 61 percent of black children, 51 percent of Latino children, 40 perc ent of white children, and 23 percent of Asian children having at least one adverse experience. After economic hardship and divorce or separation, white children are most likely to experience an adult living with mental illness or dealing with substance abuse, while for black children parental incarceration is the next most -common ACE. African -American kids are also the most likely to have experienced the death of a parent or guardian. For Hispanic children, the next most -common ACEs are living with an adult with a substance abuse issue and parental incarceration. https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/02/where -american -kids-are-in-crisis/553682/ Become Trauma Informed Becoming \"trauma -informed\" means recognizing that people often have many different types of trauma in their lives. People who have been traumatized need support and understanding from those around them. Often, trauma survivors can be re -traumatized by well -meaning caregivers and community service providers. The Iowa TIC project seeks to educate our communities about the impact of trauma on clients, co -workers, friends, family, and even ourselves. Understanding the impact of trauma is a n important first step in becoming a compassionate and supportive community. http://www.traumainformedcareproject.org/ 69 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia a mong older adults. 5.7 million Americans are estimated to be living with Alzheimer's disease in 2018. It is the fifth leading cause of death for adults aged 65 years and older, and the sixth leading cause of death for all adults . Alzheimer's disease is not a normal part of aging. 5.7 million Americans are estimated to be living with Alzheimer's disease in 2018. Symptoms usually begin after age 60, but Alzheimer's disease likely starts a decade or more before problems first appear. One of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States. The 6th leading cause of death among US adults. The 5th leading cause of death among adults aged 65 years or older More women than men have Alzheimer's or other dementias. Almost two -thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's are women. Projections of Total Numbers of Americans Age 65 and Older with Alzheimer's Dementia by State - Oregon- 2018 65,000 2025 84,000 Percent increase 29.2 Most studies indicate that older African - Americans are about twice as likely to have Alzheimer's or other dementias as older whites. Some studies indicate Hispanics are about one and one -half times as likely to have Alzheimer's or other dementias as older whites. Recent studies suggest the increased likelihood for Hispanics may be slightly lower than this, depending upon the specific Hispanic ethnic group observed (for example, Mexican -Americans compared with Caribbean -Americans). Key Facts Alzheimer's disease is not a normal part of aging. 5.7 million Americans are estimated to be living with Alzheimer's disease in 2018. Symptoms usually begin after age 60, but Alzheimer's disease likely starts a decade or more before problems first appear. Risk factors include aging, diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), smoking cigarettes, a nd a family history of dementia. Alzheimer's death rates increased 55% and the number of Alzheimer's deaths at home increased from 14% to 25% while deaths in institutional settings decreased, from 1999 to 2014. More than 16 million Americans provide unpaid care for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. Currently, there is no cure. There are pharmaceutical options for managing symptoms and care planning. Alzheimer's disease is: One of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States. 70 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center The 6th leading cause of death among US adults. The 5th leading cause of death among adults aged 65 years or older https://www.cdc.gov/aging/aginginfo/alzheimers.htm Differences Between Women and Men in the Prevalence of Alzheimer's and Other Dementias More women than men have Alzheimer's or other dementias. Almost two -thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's are women. Of the 5.5 million people age 65 and older with Alzheimer's in the United States, 3.4 million are women and 2.0 million are men. Based on estimates from ADAMS, among people age 71 and older, 16 percent of women have Alzheimer's or other dementias compared with 11 percent of men. Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Prevalence of Alzheimer's and Other Dementias Although there are more non -Hispanic whites living with Alzheimer's and other dementias than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States, older African Americans and Hispanics are more likely, on a per -capita basis, than older whites to have Alzheimer's or other dementias. Most studies indicate that older African - Americans are about twice as likely to have Alzheimer's or other dementias as older whites. Some studies indicate Hispanics are about one and one -half times as likely to have Alzheimer's or other dementias as older whites. Recent studies suggest the increased likelihood for Hispanics may be slightly lower than this, depending upon the specific Hispanic ethnic group observed (for example, Mexican -Americans compared with Caribbean -Americans). There is evidence that missed diagnoses of Alzheimer's and other dementias are more common among older African -Americans and Hispanics than among older whites. Based on data for Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older, Alzheimer's or another dementia had been diagnosed in 6.9 percent of whites, 9.4 percent of African -Americans and 11.5 percent of Hispanics. Although rates of diagnosis were higher am ong African - Americans than among whites, according to prevalence studies that detect all people who have dementia irrespective of their use of the health care system, the rates should be even higher for African -Americans. Suicide Suicide is a major public health concern. Suicide is among the leading causes of death in the United States. Based on recent nationwide surveys, suicide in some populations is on the rise. Suicide is defined as death caused by self- directed injurious behavior with intent to die as a result of the behavior. A suicide attempt is a non -fatal, self -directed, potentially injurious behavior with intent to die as a result of the behavior. A suicide attempt might not result in injury. Suicidal ideation refers to thinking about, consi dering, or planning suicide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WISQARS Leading Causes of Death Reports , in 2016: o Suicide was the tenth leading cause of dea th overall in the United States, claiming the lives of nearly 45,000 people. 71 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center o Suicide was the second leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 and 34, and the fourth leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 35 and 54. o There were more than twice as many suicides (44,965) in the United States as there were homicides (19,362). Suicide rate is based on the number of people who have died by suicide per 100,000 population. Because changes in population size are considered , rates allow for comparisons from one year to the next. Figure 1 shows the age -adjusted suicide rates in the United States for each year from 1999 through 2016 for the total population, and for males and females presented separately. o During that 17 -year period, the total suicide rate increased 28% from 10.5 to 13.4 per 100,000. o The suicide rate among males remained nearly four times higher (21.3 per 100,000 in 2016) than among females (6.0 per 100,000 in 2016). Data from the National Vital Statistics System, Mortality For 2000 -2016, the age -adjusted suicide ra te increased 30%, from 10.4 to 13.5 per 100,000 population, increasing on average by about 1% per year from 2000 through 2006 and by 2% per year from 2006 through 2016. For females aged 10 -74, suicide rates in 2016 were higher than in 2000. For males age d 15 -74, suicide rates in 2016 were higher than in 2000. In 2016, for females, suffocation accounted for a higher percentage of suicides among those under age 25, while poisoning accounted for a higher percentage among those aged 45 and over. In 2016, fi rearms were the most common means of suicide among males aged 15 and over. Oregon Why is suicide a problem in Oregon? In 2015, 762 Oregon residents died by suicide. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among Oregonians aged 15 to 34 years of age, and the 8th leading cause of death among all ages in Oregon. In addition, more than 2,000 hospitalizations are due to self -harm or suicide attempts in Oregon each year. Approximately 16% of eighth graders and 11th graders reported seriously considering suicide in the past 12 months in 2015.Nearly eight percent of eighth graders and six percent of 11th graders self- reported having attempted suicide one or more times in the previous 12 months in 2015. Cost estimates, including average medical- related costs and average work loss cost are nearly 800 million dollars each year. Source: CDC WISQARS, O regon healthy Teen Survey, and Injury and Violence Prevention Program, OHA Suicide is a serious public health problem that affects individuals, families, and communities. In 2015 alone, more than 44,000 Americans died by suicide and almost half a million Americans received medical care for self- inflicted injuries. Oregon's suicide rate has been higher than the national average for the past three decades. Oregon's age -adjusted suicide rate of 17.7 per 100,000 residents in 2015 was 33 percent higher 72 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center than the national average and Oregon ranked 13th place among all US states in suicide incidence. Suicide rates for Oregon and U.S. states have increased since 2000. Racial and Ethnic Disparities Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death among American Indians/Alaska Natives across all ages. Among American Indians/Alaska Natives aged 10 to 34 years, suicide is the second leading cause of death. The suicide rate among American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 34 (19.5 per 100,000) is 1.5 times higher than the national average for that age group (12.9 per 100,000). The percentages of adults aged 18 or older having suicidal thoughts in the previous 12 months were 2.9% among blacks, 3.3% among Asians, 3.6% among Hispanics, 4.1% among whites, 4.6% among Native Hawaiians /Other Pacific Islanders, 4.8% among American Indians/Alaska Natives, and 7.9% among adults reporting two or more races. Among Hispanic students in grades 9 -12, the prevalence of having seriously considered attempting suicide (18.9%), having made a plan about how they would attempt suicide (15.7%), having attempted suicide (11.3%), and having made a suicide attempt that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that required medical attention (4.1%) was consiste ntly higher than white and black students . Gender Disparities Males take their own lives at nearly four times the rate of females and represent 77.9% of all suicides. Females are more likely than males to have suicidal thoughts. Suicide is the seventh leading cause of death for males and the fourteenth leading cause for females. Firearms are the most commonly used method of suicide among males (56.9%). Poisoning is the most common method of suicide for females (34.8%). https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/Suicide -DataSheet -a.pdf 73 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Tobacco More than one in three Oregonians with a household income of less than $15,000 a year smoke. In comparison, one in 10 Oregonians with a household income of more than $50,000 a year smoke. Race and ethnicity are also important factors. Thirty -five percent of American Indians in Oregon smoke compared to 21 percent of non- Hispanic Whites. These disparities must be addressed in order to reduce tobacco use and tobacco- related diseases. Cigarette sales in Oregon have declined by more than 50 percent since TPEP began in 1997. However, tobacco use remains the number -one cause of preventable death and disease in Oregon. It kills nearly 8,000 people each year Tobacco use costs Oregonians $2.5 billion a year in medical expenses, lost productivity and early death. Cigarette smoking has decreas ed from 1996 to 2016. However, use of non -cigarette products is on the rise. Data show that more than half of youth and young adults who use tobacco are using flavored tobacco or vaping products . Tobacco companies spend billions of dollars on tobacco marketing in the United States every year. In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission reported that the tobacco industry spent nearly $8.9 billion marketing cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. This is almost $25 million per day or approximately $1 million an hour. The tobacco industry has shifted its marketing from billboards and TV commercials to convenience stores, pharmacies and grocery stores. Almost 75 percent of the tobacco industry's total marketing expenditures for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are in the retail environment. (6) In fact, the tobacco industry spends more than $100 million every year to advertise and promote its products in Oregon's stores. On August 9, 2017, Governor Kate Brown signed Senate Bill 754 into law. This law raised the required minimum age for a person to legally buy or obtain tobacco products, inhalant delivery systems, and tobacco product devices, from 18 to 21. 74 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center 75 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Illicit Drug Use In 2016, synthetic opioids (primarily illegal fentanyl) passed prescription opioids as the most common drugs involved in overdose deaths in the United States.

At least 50% of persons infected with HCV are unaware of their infection. HCV testing, followed by appropriate care and treatment, can reduce risk for liver cancer by 70% and mortality by 50%. 82 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center 83 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Sexually Transmitted Disease Nearly 2.3 mi llion cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis were diagnosed in the United States in 2017, according to preliminary data released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the National STD Prevention Conference in Washington, D.C . This surpassed the previous record set in 2016 by more than 200,000 cases and marked the fourth consecutive year of sharp increases in these sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The CDC analysis of STD cases reported for 2013 and preliminary data for 20 17 shows steep, sustained increases: Gonorrhea diagnoses increased 67 percent overall (from 333,004 to 555,608 cases according to preliminary 2017 data) and nearly doubled among men (from 169,130 to 322,169). Increases in diagnoses among women \u2014 and the speed with which they are increasing \u2014 are also concerning, with cases going up for the third year in a row (from 197,499 to 232,587). Primary and secondary syphilis diagnoses increased 76 percent (from 17,375 to 30,644 cases). Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) made up almost 70 pe rcent of primary and secondary syphilis cases where the gender of the sex partner is known in 2017. Primary and secondary syphilis are the most infectious stages of the disease. Chlamydia remained the most common condition reported to CDC. More than 1.7 mi llion cases were diagnosed in 2017, with 45 percent among 15 - to 24 -year -old females. 84 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Diagnoses of HIV infection From 2012 through 2016, the rate of diagnoses of HIV infection in the United States decreased; the annual number of diagnoses remained st able (Table 1a). In 2017, the rate was 11.8. 85 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Figure 36.

Conditions (e.g., social, economic, and physical) in these various environments and settings (e.g., school, church, workplace, and neighborhood) have been referred to as \"place.\" In addition to t he more material attributes of \"place,\" the patterns of social engagement and sense of security and well -being are also affected by where people live. Resources that enhance quality of life can have a significant influence on population health outcomes. Ex amples of these resources include safe and affordable housing, access to education, public safety, availability of healthy foods, local emergency/health services, and environments free of life- threatening toxins. Understanding the relationship between how population groups experience \"place\" and the impact of \"place\" on health is fundamental to the social determinants of health\u2014 including both social and physical determinants.

The rate of food insecurity (being without access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food) in Oregon is 14.6%. About 552,900 Oregonians are food insecure, of those 194,070 are children. About 72% of the people who receive food have incomes below the federal poverty level. Of households utilizing food pantries, about 80% of them are able to meet their food needs for the month with the help of a pantry. 58% of households are getting benefit from SNAP 18% of client are 65 years or older 165 of households reported having someone who is unemployed. https://www.oregonfoodbank.org/our -work/hunger -in-oregon/ 92 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center 93 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Homelessness 94 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center 95 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Please contact us with your thoughts, possible program ideas, potential partnerships or connected individuals based on the information presented above. Unemployment 96 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Appendix A: Healthy Columbia Willamette Collaborate HCWC Prioritized Core Issues Overview: The Conveners collected feedback from HCWC Data Workgroup members and their external partners through a survey about the 10 Core Issues which were identified for the CHNA. After review of the feedback received and assessment of the underlying data supporti ng each Core Issue, five Core Issues were prioritized. Top 10 Core Issues: The identified Core Issues are listed in alphabetical order: 11. Access to: Health Care, Transportation, and Resources 12. Behavioral Health (Depression and Intentional Self- harm) 13. Chroni c Conditions (Heart Disease, Diabetes, Hypertension) 14. Community Representation 15. Culturally Responsive Care 16. Discrimination/Racism 17. Isolation 18. Liver Disease 19. Sexually Transmitted Infections ( Chlamydia and Gonorrhea) 20. Trauma Prioritized Core Issues: Behavioral Health Community Representation Culturally Responsive Care Isolation Sexually Transmitted Infections The prioritized Core Issues were chosen because they were identified as key gaps in the region by both HCWC Data Work group members and external partners. The underlying data also suggests these Core Issues are not being adequately addressed and there is significant room for improvement across the region. 97 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center The Core Issues of Discrimination & Racism and Trauma also rose to the top through the prioritization process but are more accurately reflected in the CHNA as drivers/influencers for each of the prioritized issue above. The Core Issues of Access to: Health Care, Transportation and Resources, Chronic Conditions, and Live r Disease, were not prioritized as they were not identified as a key gap in the community. Listening Session Preliminary Report: African Americans in Multnomah County When: November 17, 2018 Population: African Americans with Housing Concerns in Multnomah County Location: Butte Hotel Rec Space Total session participants: 19 Summary: What makes their community healthy? Participants described a healthy community as a diverse group of people living together, where everybody knows each other, and neighbors look out for each other. In a healthy community all resources are accessible even for residents without a car, and there are recreation centers and programs for kids to be involved in. A healthy community contains positive role models and events where neighbors can get to know each other. Participants also described the importance of a career, and the ability to save for retirement. What is their community doing well? Participants felt that the black community is incredibly resilient, and able to withstand the change that has happened in their community. Community members mentioned a park in North Portland that they use to gather and hold community events. They also saw improvement in the opportunities and resources available post- incarceration. What could their community improve? Participants felt that there needed to be a more level playing field with access to resources, as well as repairing what they perceive to be loops of frustration and lack of opportunity due to promises of help that do not come through. Overall, they wanted to see more black -owned businesses, more support and trust amongst their fellow community members, better access to health care and mental health resources, more programs for youth, and more diversity in their community. Top emergent themes: 1. Community -led resources: Participants expressed a desire for more community -led resources as well as more members of the black community in positions of leadership and education. Not only did participants desire more black communit y members to be role models for the younger generations, they also wanted more black -owned businesses to be formed and to invest in the black community. The resources and concerns that participants expressed a need for were food deserts and education about diet and lifestyle, more black -owned businesses such as grocery stores and clinics, more peer support specialists, more mental health services, continuing education, culturally -specific resources, and after school programs for inner city youth. \"I would like to see us as black people work together as a race that is proud and strong that wants to build.\" 98 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center 2. Discrimination: Participants described experiencing discrimination, racism, and prejudice in all facets of life, but especially emphasized its impact on employment opportunities and their experience in their neighborhoods. Participants described examples in their places of work where discrimination kept them from advancing or being promoted, and expressed that workplaces prioritized white employe es and believed that organizational goals of diversity are just for show. Participants also described feeling discriminated and profiled by the police and feeling unwelcome in certain communities, especially in their own neighborhoods. Participants express ed that prejudice within the black community was a concern, and there was a perception of being viewed negatively and unfairly stereotyped by fellow black community members, and this was a reason why black people are not hired by or receiving help from bla ck-owned -businesses in the area. \"I'm experiencing a lot of discrimination and bias. All the whites help their race move up and get bigger and better positions.\" \"I thought that diversity was important, but now I see that's a cover up - yeah, let's hire a few blacks, let's hire a few trans people - but they basically deny you from moving up.\" 3. Lack of Community: Participants expressed that their community felt closed off and that people lacked the trust and the willingness to help each other. There was a consensus that more individuals in their community needed to believe in the impact they could have and get more involved to strengthen their community. Participants felt that successful black community members left to live in other areas, such as Atlanta, rather than reinvesting in the Portland community. They also felt that black -owned businesses in the Portland area distance themselves from the black community. They felt that black youth were more likely to be involved in gangs than in school, and this co uld be partially attributed to a lack of programs, resources, and role -models to keep them engaged. Many participants referenced a shift in the black community that they had seen in their lifetime: their emphasis on community used to be strong and they fel t they had a collective voice, and this has since faded. \"I'm 63. I've seen a lot of bullshit all my life. This is the second time I've been here. We are the hardest race in the world to work together with each other. We talk a good game, but we do nothing. All this will be forgotten in 2 hours. Black people working together is a healthy community. We haven't come together since the day they took us off the avenue. We've been fighting each other since.\" 4. Gentrification: Participants explained how gentrification has wiped out black -owned -businesses, and the black -owned businesses that remain often do not acknowledge or give back to the black community. Participants expressed a loss of their neighborhoods, and expressed feeling pushed out of their community in N/NE Portland and pushed into the outskirts of Portland. They shared with the group that they used to have so many activities in their neighborhoods to keep them involved with their neighbors, as well as many black churches where they could come togethe r. Now participants expressed being a part of neighborhoods, workplaces, schools, and communities where there are only a few black people and little diversity. They feel like they now have limited access to housing security, job security, and other opportu nities. \"The community I was born and raised in is NE/N Portland, from Greely all the way to Broadway and to 82nd Ave. We were raised in this area, this was the area we lived in our whole lives - it's now gone. It's not healthy to have these communities go ne ... Everything is gone. All the black people don't live here anymore.\" Listening Session Preliminary Report: Pacific Islanders in Multnomah County When: November 26, 2018 Population: Pacific Islanders in Multnomah County Location: APANO/PI Coalition 99 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Total session participants: 16 Summary: What makes their community healthy? Participants described a healthy community as one in which all people have access to affordable housing, healthy food, employment, and exercise. In a healthy community, p eople respect cultural traditions and work together to empower their community. A healthy community is supportive, family oriented, educated, and spiritual. What is their community doing well? Participants appreciate the Community Health Workers (CHWs) tha t work in their community and feel they serve as an excellent bridge between community members and the health care system; however, they wish there were more CHWs available. There are also certified interpreters and groups such as APANO that provide cultur ally competent services. Participants feel that the Pacific Islander community is slowly beginning to be recognized, which is a positive improvement. Another asset to the community is the existence of Utopia PDX, a space for queer and trans Pacific Islande rs. Community members explained how identifying as a Pacific Islander and LGBTQ person can be isolating and lead to a disconnect from Pacific Islander culture, therefore having a space such as Utopia PDX has been a tremendous resource. What could their com munity improve? Participants felt that there needed to be more accountability for decisionmakers in the government, more transparency about where money goes, and more trust between decisionmakers and community members. They felt that more people and organi zations outside of the pacific islander communities should get involved with the community; not only in terms of offering them more funding, but providing more services than just translation services that are at a reading level too high for the community. The group desired more community forums to create space for engagement and wanted the counties to provide them with the resources and funding to be able to help themselves. Summary: 1. Cultural Competence: Participants expressed a need for more Community Health Workers and interpreters to provide services for all the different Pacific Islander communities that reside in the area. They desired improved translations, with translation extending to prescription bottle labels and translations accessible at a 5t h grade reading level. Participants expressed the importance of empowering community members by enabling them to communicate in their language and to express their culture. This empowerment is particularly important for the elderly and for people who have immigrated and may need a translator to communicate their needs. Participants also desired cultural investment beyond simply providing translation services, including outreach by the healthcare system to help shift the mindset of many Pacific Islanders who need help understanding the culture of medicine in the U.S. Participants discussed examples such as the common belief in their community that the hospital is where you go to die, as well as avoiding primary and preventive care for fear that going to the d octor may reveal unknown health concerns. 2. Representation: A lack of representation was discussed among participants, who felt that current policies were often outdated or misinformed due to inaccurate data. Participants explained that the data could be improved with better representation, and that current policies serve as barriers. They discussed the need to establish institutional solutions, and desired shared power in decision making. Participants would also like to see greater youth representation, a nd to have more youth involvement in organizations. 3. Education Participants desired increased education about healthy lifestyles, as well as support for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Participants explained that parents want to be knowledgeable about prevention and insurance, but they often don't know what questions to ask. Additionally, there are language and immigration barriers, and many adults must rely on their children to translate for them. Participants feel that greater education is needed regar ding immigration, because many community members are undocumented and do not seek 100 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center services when they need them for fear of deportation. Education is also needed regarding the purpose of hospitals and preventive care, as participants explained that currently their community views doctors and hospitals as a place to go when you are dying, not as a place to go for preventive care. 4. Accountability and Trust Participants feel there is a lack of trust between community members and decision makers, and they beli eve increased accountability is needed to build trust. Participants would like to see changes and results within their community, rather than more reports. There is a perception that money is not being spent the way that it should be spent, and participant s feel that there should be a mechanism to hold the government and hospitals accountable for how they spend money. Participants also noted a lack of follow -through at past listening sessions and expressed a desire to see that information shared back to the ir community. \"We need to build the capacity for us to advocate for ourselves\" 5. Connection between health and culture Participants want to see their traditional values more incorporated into the dominant healthcare culture. For example, two -way communication between doctors and patients to enact the belief that everybody brings their own wisdom; and more acknowledgement of traditional health practices and community members cultural wisdom surrounding wellness. Participants suggested utilizing the Pacific Islands' cultural traditions of story -telling to encourage healthy behaviors and healthy eating habits within the community. It was emphasized that the many cultures of the Pacific Islands are more collectivist; for participants, the health of their community is directly tied to establishing harmony between their interpersonal connections, environment, food culture, and cultural traditions. \"We need to go back to warrior spirit and push past prejudice, racism, discrimination\" \"To be strong is to fe el the connections and support each other through things happening with children and with jobs. To have people stand by you and understand what you are going through is what is critical to health.\" Listening Session Preliminary Report: Latino Population in Multnomah County When: November 27, 2018 Population: Latino population Location: Shaver Elementary School Total session participants: 14 Summary: What makes their community healthy? Participants feel that their community is healthy when kids are playing outdoors and have access to healthy activities, when the community is clean, when they feel safe to go to school and be out in their neighborhood, when the crime rates are low and apartment management is equitable, and when everyone has access to h ealth insurance. What is their community doing well? Participants feel their community does well with encouraging kids to be involved with community activities, particularly when those activities were promoting healthy behaviors. Examples included gardening, picnics, and healthy eating education. Participants also appreciate how some schools, such as Shaver, are making an effort to be culturally specific and inclusive. Participants noted how their community has been supported by programs that offer assistan ce or classes, such as Medicaid, Programa Hispano, Latino Network, SnowCap, the library, churches, and assistance with food and rent offered by schools. What could their community improve? Participants felt that their community needed improved access to he alth care and resources that are integral to maintaining health, such as healthy food, activities, and opportunities to voice their concerns. Participants 101 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center also felt their community was facing increased stress from a perceived lack of safety and experiences of racism and discrimination. The community desired greater support for establishing and maintaining healthy behaviors within their families. Top emergent themes: 1. Access to Resources: Participants lacked access to basic resources necessary to maintain a healthy community and life, this included assistance in finding employment, legal support, accessing comprehensive women's health screenings, health fares, culturally -specific resources, and more resources to help them cope with stress and depre ssion. Participants desired classes that could teach healthy cooking and how to eat a balanced diet, particularly for children and families. One area of concern was the lack of healthy food options provided to children at school - they felt that the school s needed to provide food options that emphasized fruits, vegetables, and encourage better hydration. Participants noted the lack of exercise classes and family - centered activities that could that could include the whole family, such as Zumba classes held in a park. 2. Access to Care: Participants felt they lacked access to information and services that are important for their health, such as mammograms, pap smears, colon cancer screenings, and diabetes. They desired opportunities to learn more about mental health and wellness, with an emphasis on stress, depression, and anxiety. Participants wished more health fairs, providing free screenings, were offered. They also explained that mental health counseling needs to be available for the whole family, including having mental health counselors at elementary schools for children whose parents do not have insurance. Counseling for other issues, such as drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or other addictions, was also cited as a need among community youth. Additionally, parti cipants discussed the need for more appointment availability at doctors' offices to allow for back to back scheduling for families with multiple children. 3. Racism and safety: Participants noted how racism and racial profiling are detrimental to the healt h of their community. They discussed the difficulty in finding housing as a Latino family, being denied housing due to their race/ethnicity or receiving unfair treatment from building management. As a result, participants often don't feel that it is safe for their kids to play outside and they expressed feeling wary about interacting with their neighbors. Participants also felt distrustful of law enforcement, citing racial profiling and negative interactions their community has had with the police. Participants described their fear of the police and racial profiling as a large contributing factor to their community's health and feelings of unsafety. Safety is a concern for participants, who discussed an inability to exercise outdoors or let their kids play i n the park, not only because of fear of deportation and racial profiling, but due to other factors such as the large amounts of trash in their neighborhoods, vandalism, and drugs present in their community. Participants discussed how the issue of homelessn ess intertwines with these factors to create an atmosphere of neglect. 4. Support for Families: Participants discussed a need for increased support of family needs, including the needs of both children and adults. Stress was identified as a major issue within families, and participants expressed that marriage counseling or classes for new parents could help to reduce that stress. Participants described the need to extend the classes and workshops that aid with interpersonal and psychosocial stress to their children, such as classes to teach kids how to handle bullying or learn about substance abuse prevention. Participants also identified the need for affordable childcare, which is not something that is currently available for many families. There was a cons ensus among participants of a need for more family -friendly activities, such as classes to help them grow their own food, community gatherings in public spaces, more opportunities for free physical activities, and activities that provide their kids with opportunities to immerse into the dominant U.S. culture. 102 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Listening Session Preliminary Report: Veterans in Washington County When: December 1, 2018 Population: Veterans & Spouses of Veterans Location: VFW Hillsboro Total session participants: 10 Summary: What makes their community healthy? Participants described a healthy community as one in which people worked together to solve issues, even if they shared different views on the problem. A healthy community has houses and streets that are well- maintained, and neighborhoods that are safe for walking around. The community members in a healthy community have healthy social lives as well as physical health, and they can afford groceries and housing. What is their community doing well ? Participants appreciated many of the organizations that work on behalf of the community, and veterans, such as VFW. The Portland VA was highlighted as a helpful resource for mental health, however it lacked sustained support for older veterans. Participa nts also emphasized the positive impact of organizations that are not government affiliated, such as the Boys and Girls club, and voiced support for tax -funded community organizations. Participants also appreciated the way that transit officers deal with s ituations involving individuals with mental health issues or drugs in their system. Participants referenced how transit officers do a good job of interacting with these individuals without escalating the situation. What could their community improve? Parti cipants want more support for veterans, more tax money for programs, and believed there needed to be a better enforcement of immigration and drug laws. They think that politicians should be held more accountable, specifically by holding town halls outside of election years. Participants wanted education reform with a stronger emphasis on English -language curriculum and Civics. They wanted their community to be able to more openly express their opinions, and that there needed to be a shift in policies so tha t community members who rely on benefits (OHP, SNAP) are held more accountable. Participants felt that a large stumbling block of community health was keeping Portland, and the state of Oregon as a sanctuary city/state. Top emergent themes: 1. Addiction an d Homelessness Participants discussed the need to proper support to end the cycle of drug addiction and homelessness. Participants believe that most people who are homeless also suffer from addiction issues, and although there are programs that offer help, the services are often designed as a one -time intervention rather than on -going support. Participants feel that support systems need to be more holistic and comprehensive in order to help people overcome addiction and homelessness, emphasizing the addicti on is a disease like any other. The participants felt that current drug laws were not being properly enforced, and not only does this exacerbate the housing crisis, but they felt that it was a conflict of interest for the U.S. to continue to support and provide aid to the countries whose cartels are providing and selling the drugs that are causing the issues. Additionally, participants believe that the government needs to think more strategically about how to pay for affordable housing, which they feel is s orely missing from their community. 2. Lack of education: Participants feel that the education system is lacking and contributing to poor health conditions. A major concern that was discussed is the perceived neglect of teaching English in school in favor of teaching other languages, such as Spanish. Participants explained that English is a vital tool for a successful life in the United States and believe that schools should focus on English to bridge the gap between cultures. Another area of 103 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center education that participants felt was lacking was Civics, both local and national. Participants discussed how schools no longer teach about the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, and that schools no longer adopt a view of American pride. Participants also felt that education for children should have more of an emphasis on good manners, empathy, and religion. 3. Threats to community values: Participants referenced a lack of manners and empathy that they believe is contributing to the poor health of their communi ty. There was discussion about a lack of care and compassion, as well as feeling that some members of the community were not graciously accepting what was being offered to them. Discussing immigration, participants explained that all Americans are immigrants, but they believe that immigration law and sanctuary cities are too lenient, and that the current immigrants should work to assimilate to America rather than expect America adapt. They desired a return to religious values, of any religion, to inspire compassion and morality. Participants felt that all individuals should be held accountable if they are provided with government benefits, such as SNAP or OHP. They viewed this accountability as giving back to the community in some way, through volunteering o r working. \"This country was created because the people who came here were suppressed in the countries they came from. The people that come here now want to change our country to their country. Different traditions that families continue to have but they don't push them on anyone else. I want to give immigrants credit -- they take care of elders/family and we don't as Americans. If we were families and took care of families, our health care costs would go down.\" 4. Representation Participants feel that their views and concerns are not being taken into consideration, and that the government only cares about minority populations, to the detriment of the majority. Participants feel that they have worked hard and contributed to society, and yet their needs a s members of the majority population are being ignored. During this discussion, participants referenced Town Halls that have been held with politicians. Participants explained that veterans are not chosen to ask a question during these Town Halls. Overall, participants believe that all Americans should have the right to express their opinions and to be listened to. Quotes from the session: \"I don't believe the community is healthy at all right now.\" \"We can't solve national conflicts at the neighbor level, but we can start at that level.\" \"Envision a world where everyone can work with each other.\" \"It's not a privilege to be an American, it's an honor.\" Listening Session Preliminary Report: Latino Population in Washington County When: November 13, 2018 Population: Latino Location: Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center Total session participants: 17 Summary: What makes their community healthy? Participants described a healthy community as one with a foundation of trust, where everyone is happy and making progress in their lives. A healthy community has low crime rates, no violence, and has many opportunities for families to be active and come together. To have a healthy community, people must feel free to express themselves and be polite and engagin g with one another, and they must have resources available to them to help meet all their needs. What is their community doing well? 104 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Participants described their community as having very strong community leaders; they observe many people taking care of oth ers who are not able to drive or need other assistance and highlighted the seniors in their community as good leaders. They appreciated the programs offered by Adelante Mujeres, classes at Virginia Garcia to help people stay active, and the food assistance provided by churches, cultural centers, and local food banks. Participants gave many examples of resources to help their community be food secure and healthy, such as nutrition centers, health vouchers, low -income assistance, immigrant programs, and assis tance at schools. What could their community improve? Participants described feeling like their community is unhealthy: many are sick or suffering from chronic conditions. They do not feel a connection with their neighbors or community members, and they de sire developing a greater trust in their community. They feel there is a lack of understanding on the resources available, as well as language barriers and other cultural barriers to accessing them. Participants noted the inequality in the services people are able to access, and felt that their community members - seniors, especially - needed better advocates in the health system. Participants are also concerned about children's health and the technology available to them. Top emergent themes: 1. Access to resources and food security: Participants desired spaces where they could come together and learn about issues of concern in their community, as well as spaces where they can exercise or learn new skills. They felt positively about the resources available through the school systems to help connect their children to services and programs but desired more youth -focused workshops for them to participate in outside of school. Overall, there was a desire for free indoor recreational areas to exercise and be physically active in the winter time. Participants describe feeling food insecure despite the current resources available to them, such as churches, cultural centers, and food banks. They want to eat healthy and incorporate local produce when possible, but often must choose less nutritious foods because they are cheaper. Transportation was also cited as a large issue to accessing health care, especially due to concerns that the time spent getting to the appointments would mean a loss of a whole day's pay. Most of the income gets spent on paying their rent and their utility bills, and they desired more financial assistance to help them with these costs. 2. Community support: Participants emphasized the importance of community members supporting one another to make sure they get their needs met and believed that trust between community members is crucial to their health. They desired to become more involved in their schools, churches, workshops, and cultural centers because it would help them stay connected to others and share resources and information with one another. With community support, they can stay healthier by exercising together with their neighbors and children and can hold each other accountable. They wanted to see more of their community members volunteering, communicating better, asking for help, and s haring mental health struggles with one another. 3. Family concerns: Participants described a multitude of concerns they are trying to navigate to keep their families happy, healthy, and safe: worries about insurance access, care for seniors, communication between parents and children, long work hours that keep families apart, bad influences on children, diabetes, depression, illness, and overuse of technology that harms their children's development and performance at school. Participants were very concerned about the technology available to children in their community, and desired to better understand internet and social media so that they could better monitor what their children were exposed to. A large barrier to monitoring their children's cell phone and internet use is not understanding how to operate parental controls and parents who are absent because of their work schedules. They desired ways to get their children involved in the community, such as more youth -focused groups and workshops for them to participate in. Overall, they wanted more resources to help them address bullying, sexual abuse, self -harm, substance abuse, and safety concerns with their children. 4. Cultural barriers and discrimination: 105 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Participants described inequities due to language barriers, both in terms of navigating the healthcare system as well as seeking out services and assistance. They felt like there were not enough advocates and interpreters available who could help them access and apply for services. Participants described feeling uncertain about U.S. laws, and desired to have resources to help them learn English. A barrier to accessing services was not having a Social Security Number, which participants felt hindered their access to economic opportunity. Participants felt e xploited by businesses who give them the worst jobs because they are \"illegal,\" and they described being denied the ability to leave work for appointments or care for their children when they are sick. Due to immigration status and lack of opportunities in the Latino community, they often must get by on only one income. Listening Session Preliminary Report: Rural Youth in Clackamas County When: December 5, 2018 Population: Rural Youth in Sandy, Clackamas County Location: AntFarm Cafe Total session partici pants: 10 Summary: What makes their community healthy? Participants described a healthy community as one where everyone cooperates with each other and is self-sustaining. A healthy community is one where the town takes responsibility for its community mem bers, keeps towns clean, has schools with appropriate curriculum, plentiful resources, and people are well informed and do not treat others differently because of race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender identity, or lack of opportunity. Participants felt that the most important feature of a healthy community are different groups of people working together to achieve common goals. What is their community doing well? Participants felt that their community has many thriving local businesses, and that many community members are working together to improve the community. They described partnerships between Sandy AntFarm Youth and AmeriCorps as a community strength, and appreciated the free lunch and dinners hosted by local churches to engage diverse groups of community members in dialogue. Community center outreach programs, food provided by the Action Center, and native council meetings where people come together to solve issues were also highlighted. What could their community improve? Participants described racism and prejudice as hindrances to the health of their community; social media was a barrier to these concerns, with participants describing that the majority of people use it in a vacuum and don't engage with people who have different viewpoints and identities. Overall, participants felt that their community needed to increase their engagement and communication across subgroups to help bridge the assumptions that lead to racism and prejudice. Participants also expressed the need for more jobs to be available, an improved educational curriculum that is more comprehensive, as well as bett er understanding of how Sandy's government works. Top emergent themes: 1. Community cooperation: Participants emphasized community cohesiveness and cooperation as the key to improving their community and felt that Sandy could benefit from more communicati on on all fronts. Isolation between different groups of people with opposing viewpoints or different identities was a common source of tension, and community members believe that this exacerbates inequalities and mistreatment of community member s and must be rectified by creating a culture of openness and willingness to learn about other sub -groups. Overall, participants felt that their tight- knit community should 106 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center encourage more activities, and that people should think more critically about the c ons of closed -off groups and strive to be more open when interacting with people whose identities challenge viewpoints. Participants described different methods of communicating in sub -cultures that they belonged to, and desired for these practices to expa nd into the larger community. [Social media] \"expands on itself and gets out of control...no one challenges you because everyone agrees with you.\" 2. Misinformation and poor education: Participants are very concerned about the misinformation being disseminat ed in their community. They emphasized how important it is to have a well -rounded education, and that includes formal education curriculum as well as more access to reliable sources of news instead of propaganda that misleads people about sub -communities. Social media was a barrier to interacting with communities (both internet communities and their local community), because it removes the challenge of communicating with people who may disagree with their viewpoints. They believe that the educational system needs to be improved to meet the needs of youth who will soon need skills to help them as adults: financial knowledge, sex education, home economics. They addressed the misconception that schools expect that parents are supposed to teach these skills to their children, noting that this is often not the case, and students would be better served if they had more resources at school to help them navigate the real -world responsibilities of adulthood. \"We've been having an issue...kids are graduating high school with not much financial knowledge, no sex ed, and they don't know what they want to do...but at least they know the quadratic formula!\" \"Kids who don't know how to grow up. They assume parents will teach that, but there's a flaw: some people don't have parents.\" 3. Racism and prejudice: Participants described racism and prejudice in their community as hinderances to the health of their community. Participants noted that not only do they struggle with discrimination based on skin color, but also because of ethnicity, age, gender, and sexuality. As mentioned above, community members envision more communication as a solution that could bridge the gap between different sub -groups of people. Participants described that white community members often cannot see the racism within their community, and that those who are racist are often speaking out online and not in person, as that platform amplifies their voice. Many participants experienced racism and discrimination in the work place and described feeling as if their identities negated their viewpoints in other community members' eyes. [On racism] \"Just because you don't see it, doesn't meant it's not happening.\" \"Racism and prejudices from childhood are a hard boulder to move.\" 4. Access to resources: Participants desired more resources that would aid them in finding jobs, working and cooperating with their community members, and establishing better communication between sub -groups. Overall, they felt that the resources available to them were not always known by community members and did not feel they had sufficient resources to help them obtain their goals. They wanted more community center outreach programs to encourage healthy behaviors, which they acknowledge that programs are already aiming to improve upon. They appreciated services that allowed them to access food, such as Action Center as well as free food offered by the schools, but they expressed concerns that these programs are abused by people who are food secure, and that programs like these could lead to many people de pending solely on the resource. [On resources available] \"It's hard to answer this because we don't know what we have to begin with.\" \"I wouldn't have had Thanksgiving if it wasn't for the Action Center.\" \"I personally go to the Action Center because I nee d food...it's an annoyance to watch the food be carted away by people who have fridges full of food - they eat just a little bit and then toss it as if it's nothing.\" 107 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Listening Session Preliminary Report: Elderly Rural Population in Clackamas County When: December 5th, 2018 Population: Elderly (65+) Rural Location: Estacada Community Center Total session participants: 6 Summary: What makes their community healthy? Participants felt that a healthy community included family, good schools, and safety. T hey described a healthy community as one that supports individuality, as well as supports each other with homegrown food and a local workforce. Participants cited transportation and access to health care as critical components to a healthy community. What is their community doing well? Though isolated from many resources, the number of medical clinics and providers available in Estacada has increased in recent years. Participants expressed positivity towards the natural beauty of the environ ment as well as community features, such as the library and the skate park. What could their community improve? Participants expressed a desire for greater civic engagement among community members, a stronger focus on community development and infrastructu re, and more opportunities for community involvement and support. Participants discussed how younger generations leave Estacada due to lack of opportunity, and people who are new to the area do not seem to share the same values. Participants would like to build a stronger sense of community among the people who live in, and support, Estacada. Top emergent themes: 1. Decision Makers: Participants discussed at length how the dominant population and politics of Portland shape laws, policies, and what the stat e focuses on. They felt that Estacada, as well as other rural communities, do not see their interests and needs reflected unless they align with Portland's. There was an emphasis on communities making their voices known, both through voting and social medi a, to influence decisionmakers on both the local level and the state level. Participants noted that, for example, money the community had tried to raise for a community swimming pool was funneled into other projects by decisionmakers without consulting com munity members. 2. Access to Care: Access to health care was a large barrier to health for participants - while they noted that Estacada now offers better medical care than it had in the past, many services are not available in their remote area. The commu nity lacks the resources to help people with medical assistance, such as getting to medical appointments, and they emphasized that if they required specialty care or critical care their options in Estacada are very limited. Even when services are available in Estacada, they require a vehicle to get to them, which further isolates community members who are not able to drive or do not have transportation. Overall, participants need transportation and clinics to better bridge the gaps. One participant shared her experience of attempting to find in- home care for her husband at the end of his life. They could not find care givers who were willing to drive that far out to Estacada care for him, and the only aid they received was from an Adventist clinic that came out for one hour to show them how to change sheets while the patient was in the bed - tricks they later could not remember. Her and her daughter ended up being her husband's caregivers because they had no other option. 3. Community Support: Participants discussed the need to build a stronger sense of community and emphasized the power of community centers and schools to create a supportive community. Participants spoke about the 108 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center importance of families being engaged in community activities. They believe it is not enough to offer sports at school, and that by emphasizing family -activities like the town used to have (dance halls, movie theater, bowling alley) more families will choose to stay in Estacada. Participants also expressed interest in hosting workshops to expand community members skills like computer classes and using cell phones. 4. Infrastructure: Participants noted that the reason many people leave Estacada is to access resources, community services, social connections, job security, education, and healthcare. Participants expressed a need for more affordable grocery stores, more programs and extracurricular activities for children, community centers, and more business development to keep people in Estacada. Participants noted that outsiders emphasize the beauty and scenery that surrounds towns like theirs, but do not invest in the community's wellbeing or fund community development and infrastructure. Participants discussed the changes in the lumber industry that has historically suppo rted their community, and how multiple businesses have closed due to unaffordable rent. Participants believe that investing in businesses, particularly family -oriented businesses such as a movie theater and bowling alley, would encourage economic growth in Estacada. Participants also discussed the need for infrastructure changes regarding the roads and transportation system. They referenced streets that are too narrow for cars, inadequate parking, and a lack of public transportation available for individuals without personal vehicles. Listening Session Preliminary Report: People in Affordable Housing in Washington County When: December 7, 2018 Population: People in Affordable Housing Location: The Knoll Total session participants: 10 Summary: What makes their community healthy? Participants described a healthy community as a community that is safe, has affordable housing, a sense of community and connection among residents, and affordable resources nearb y. What is their community doing well? Participants appreciate the resources available within their community, such as the close proximity of the senior center, the friendliness of building management, the availability of public transportation, and the amenities offered through affordable housing programs. What could their community improve? Participants felt their community could be improve d by having improved transportation and access to resources. They often feel priced -out of participating in community events and feel socially isolated due to a lack of safety in their community. Participants also emphasized the need to address housing issues for individuals experiencing homelessness. Top emergent themes: 1. Transportation: Participants described their issues and needs concerning transportation as two -fold: On one hand, they were concerned about the noise and safety issues cause d by traffic, construction projects, and inaccessibility of sidewalks and safe walkways. On the other hand, they desired more communal transportation options as many of them did not drive on freeways or did not have access to cars. Participants wanted more places to be accessible by foot, particularly grocery stores, farmer's markets, and community events, and felt that people living in their community without a car were socially isolated and unable to access a lot of what their community has to offer. \"[I] have a car but don't get on the freeway, so can't go to things that you have to go on the 109 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center freeway to get to.\" 2. Access to affordable resources: Participants felt that there needed to be more grocery stores within walking distance, more resources to help them exercise, and greater access to community events and communal transportation. While they acknowledged that there were a lot of resources in the area, such as yoga, Pilates , tai chi, and senior centers, these services were not affordable to comm unity members. Participants emphasized that they do not expect every service to be free, but that there should be more opportunities for income -based sliding scale payment options so they are not so excluded from participating. Participants felt that, with out a car, their access to healthy food was greatly reduced. They also expressed a great need for affordable dental care in the area as well as better access to affordable insurance. \"Even the senior center costs.\" \"Don't mind paying a bit, but I don't want to be priced out.\" \"You have to be missing so many teeth before they will provide dentures. Dental care is ridiculous.\" 3. Housing Concerns: Housing and homelessness were discussed at length by the participants, who acknowledged how hard it was to maintain housing due to the high costs of rent and stagnant wages, as well as very high utility bills. Fear and safety concerns due to homeless individuals in the area was expressed, but participants also expressed understanding for how easy it is to be come houseless. Crucial to community health is to prioritize affordable housing and assistance with utilities as well as reduce the wait time it takes to get access to the affordable housing. One participant told the group that they were waitlisted for aff ordable housing for over three years. \"If it's not affordable, what kind of good health or life are you going to have?\" 4. Safety: Participants described safety as one of the most important building blocks of having a healthy community. They described conc erns about homeless individuals committing crimes in the area, concerns about sex - trafficking, feeling unsafe in their apartment complex, not having enough funding in their community to take the steps needed to make people feel safer from violence (more la w enforcement, security cameras, safer housing options). Environmental safety was also an issue of concern, with many mentioning the poor air quality and diesel fumes as factors that impact health. Participants also discussed feeling unsafe on the roads or walking due to a lack of sidewalks, traffic, and icy conditions in the winter. \"People drive like they are on fire and it's scary.\" Listening Session Preliminary Report: Latino Farmworkers in Clackamas County November 16, 2018 Population: Latino Farmworkers in Molalla Location: Plaza los Robles Total session participants: 10 Summary: What makes their community healthy? Participants describe a healthy community as one that works together and is united, with family, neighbors, and coworkers that respect each other. For a community to be healthy, there need to be easily accessible clinics and resources for mental health, healthy eating, and preventive health. Providers should be available and local, and everyone should have access to insurance that makes appointments affordable. What is their community doing well? Participants felt the resources in the community, including parenting classes, busses to Woodburn, Latino - specific activities, afterschool homework help for kids, programs to help pay utility bills, access to food, purchase gifts and school supplies for children, and church community service programs are assets to the 110 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center community. Specific resources mentioned as assets were: OCDC, Todos Juntos, the Catholic church, food banks , Salud Clinic, and the migrant program at the local school. What could their community improve? Participants noted the cost of health care is too expensive, and the community needs more low -income clinics, Spanish- speaking providers and language services, and access to dental care, and better transportation. Overall, they felt their community could do a better job of exercising, eating well, providing youth resources, and utilizing preventive services. Language barriers, racism, youth marijuana use, and discrimination were all mentioned as barriers to the health of the community. Participants noted that a census to gauge community needs is useful in Mexico and could be implemented in their community, and that the community needs to be more involved and assi st one another. Top emergent themes: 1. Access to services: Participants discussed lacking access to medical services due to transportation and financial barriers, noting the high costs of health services, few low -income clinics, confusion navigating and obtaining insurance, and lack of access to dental care. Overall, to improve access, participants said they needed more mental health clinics, providers, dentists, vision services, and better and affordable comprehensive insurance options to help them acces s resources already available. They explained that the limited number of medical clinics available in Molalla were further limited due to high costs and language barriers. Many participants expressed frustration that they earned too much money to qualify f or the already -existing low -income clinics but were still unable to afford medical services without insurance. Participants desired more information on preventive health, and more medical clinics providing a full spectrum of services in one easily accessible hub: medical, mental, and dental health. Many participants do not have a Social Security Number or ID that is required to get assistance and referenced the lack of Spanish speaking services in Molalla to help them access what is available to them without this identification. Participants referenced feeling geographically isolated; Woodburn is the closest available resource hub to Molalla and they often must travel there to meet all of their needs. 2. Language barriers: Language barriers, and a lack of translators, were cited as significant barriers to health among participants. Participants described getting turned away by providers because they require Spanish -speaking services; noting that language barriers make everything more difficult, from accessing dental care to going to the bank and managing finances. They discussed an inability to be treated at clinics due to providers in Molalla not speaking Spanish, expressing that it was extremely difficult to communicate their concerns. They describ ed difficulties resolving issues with their children at school because they don't have access to interpreters for parent teacher conferences and other meetings and often must heavily rely on their children to be their interpreters. 3. Discrimination and st ress: Participants discussed experiencing significant stress, often because of racism, discrimination, and feelings of exclusion from the community due to language barriers. Participants feel unwelcome in establishments where they are unable to speak the l anguage, and specifically felt that they were often turned away by healthcare providers because they were discriminating against the Hispanic/Latino community, as well as those without insurance. Members described feeling stressed that they didn't have clo se access to emergency services in Spanish and would need to travel very far if there was an emergency and they needed critical care. Overall, they felt their health and wellbeing was at risk due to their geographic isolation from resources and services av ailable in Spanish. Participants also expressed concern about their children, and not feeling connected to their children's lives at school. They worried that their children could be dealing with mental health issues, bullying, or drugs, and that the paren ts would have no way of knowing. 4. Healthy lifestyle and education: Participants desired more education about preventive health services, healthy eating, 111 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center and healthy exercise habits. Conversely, participants felt that Latino/Hispanic community members wer en't utilizing the resources they already had available to them, perhaps due to not being aware of what was available. They also felt their community lacked access to healthy food options and grocery stores, which was a hindrance to the health of their com munity. They wanted better resources and healthy outlets for the young members of their community, who they felt needed interventions for marijuana use and drug addiction and more access to healthy activities. Participants discussed the need for more youth -oriented activities. They explained that many youths in the ir community are involved in drugs, and that there are no activities available to them other than hanging out in the park. Participants believe there should be resources like creative centers, soccer fields, and summer programs to engage the youth of their community in positive activities. Listening Session Preliminary Report: Arabic Population in Washington County When: November 30, 2018 Population: Arabic population Location: Beaverton Total session participants: 9 Summary: What makes their community h ealthy? Participants describe a healthy community as one where all community members have a healthy lifestyle, community support, access to preventive and mental health care, are housing secure, do not fear discrimination or bias, there is job security, and there are fewer language and education related barriers. What is their community doing well? Participants appreciate that their community aids low-income families for housing, transportation, and medical care through programs like Habitat for Humanity, OHP, Medicare, IRCO, and TriMet. Free meals are offered to low -income children in school, and language classes are offered for free to help with English and Arabic language skills. What could their community improve? Participants feel that their community could improve access to resources for mental health support, education and job transfer options, translation and interpreting services, more gender exclusive recreational spaces, affordable housing, and services to assist with financial security and integrating into the healthcare system. Top emergent themes: 1. Community support: Participants placed an emphasis on community support, both as crucial to maintaining cultural values and establishing a sense of belonging, as well as to help e ase depression and other mental health concerns. Participants desire more community activities, especially ones that are tied to healthy lifestyle choices and rooted in community values. Participants also explained the strain immigration put on their community - many of their loved ones are still in their home countries, making them feel isolated from their support systems. \"We don't have that much social life here. I am always cooking or working or cleaning here, back home we get together with family and friends regularly.\" 2. Cultural competency and identity: Participants expressed a desire to maintain their cultural values, with special emphasis on their religious values as well as their social values. They emphasized that their community needed more mental health support; however, cultural barriers and stigma within their community create a reluctance to discuss mental health with professionals. Additionally, participants worry about Arabic interpreters gossiping about them. Language barri ers were cited as extremely detrimental to their community's health, making it difficult to 112 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center access healthcare, connect to other communities in the area, and connect to assistance. They want to see more schools teach Arabic and about Arabic cultures to create more understanding of their lifeways and culture in their larger community. Participants felt that greater cultural competency and understanding within the community would allow their community members, particularly women, to become more involved. For e xample, offering exercise and swimming hours that are women- only is a cultural consideration that participants desire. 3. Education and Employment: Participants note that the transfer of their education and careers they had before moving to the U.S. wasn't equitable and didn't set them up for success. Most of their education from back home is not recognized, and they describe having to spend a lot of money and time to transfer their degrees and make up missing classes when trying to obtain similar jobs in t he United States. For example, one participant at the session was a dentist back in her home country but works in the U.S. as a medical interpreter because her credentials are not transferrable. Participants felt they were unable to take the time to comple te or transfer their educational credits while also working to earn enough to support themselves and their families. Additionally, participants felt that they did not have access to job security, and that there were not enough jobs that met their financial needs. They also desired more job training. [People who have degrees/advanced skills] \"are well experienced but are neglected and should be recognized\" \"Not many jobs fit us...most of our education from back home doesn't count, we have to get evaluated and re - get degrees\" \"This is a big problem for all of us - have a degree back home that is not recognized here and so you have to choose: work or study. 4. Access to resources: Participants felt they lacked access to necessary information and resources that ar e critical to maintaining health. They feel that, as immigrants, the healthcare system is new to them and they desired more support to help them integrate and utilize preventive care and insurance, as well as to navigate the available resources. They felt there needed to be more resources to help them understand law enforcement, as well as the cultural norms surrounding legal and safety procedures. Participants expressed a need for more Community Health Workers (CHWs) and community organizations to help them better utilize the health system. While they appreciate the interpretation services currently available, they pushed for more Arabic interpreters who were not part of the same cultural community, as well as stricter training concerning patient pr ivacy among interpreters. Participants also struggled with a lack of resources for dealing with financial insecurity, they expressed a need for affordable housing and affordable healthcare. \"I don't have any idea how to deal with things here - like if we g et pulled over by a police officer officer - I don't know what to do.\" 5. Discrimination and challenges of immigration: Participants discussed experiencing discrimination stemming from cultural and religious differences. Female participants expressed fear about attention received for wearing a Hijab and feel that the negativity expressed towards them has increased lately. In addition to facing challenges of discrimination and cultural misunderstandings, participants discussed oth er challenges that accompany being an immigrant or refugee in their community, such as no credit history to assist in financial endeavors. Participants explained that renting or buying a house without a co -signer is not an option without established credit history. They also face high car insurance costs due to a lack of driving history. Participants desired programs to help them navigate these challenges so they could set down roots in their community. \"It wasn't like that in Oregon before...from time to tim e can tell someone is staring, giving the looks. Feeling sometimes uncomfortable.\" \"Because I came here as a single mom, I faced a lot of barriers.\" 113 2020 -2022 CHNA Portland Adventist Medical Center Appendix B Community Resources Portland Adventist Community Services 11020 NE Halsey Street Portland, Or 97220 503- 252-8500 WWW.portlandacs.org Volunteers needed.
