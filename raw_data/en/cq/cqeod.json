While they won't take the place of your naturopath or primary care doctor, these professionals can be seen to supplement and treat ongoing health challenges without medication or western intervention. In many cases, they may finally present a solution to challenges you've been facing for many years, from headaches to chronic back pain. Consider the following alternative health professionals and whether they would be a good fit for your health needs in 2018. Herbalist Herbalists were around well before Western doctors ever held a prominent place in our society. In an effort to have more holistic health experiences, people are now looking to the traditional remedies these professionals can provide because herbalists look at health from every angle: \"Diagnosis and treatment are based on a holistic view of the patient and the patient's symptoms, expressed in terms of the balance of yin and yang. Yin represents the earth, cold and femininity, whereas yang represents the sky, heat, and masculinity,\" according to the book [Herbal Medicine: Biomolecular and Clinical Aspects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92773/). The same book suggests seeing an herbalist to treat chronic and acute conditions and ailments, such as: Cardiovascular disease Prostate problems Depression Inflammation Immune system issues When applied in treatment, herbs are taken in a variety of formats, including whole herb, tea, syrup, essential oil, ointments, salves, rubs, capsules and tablets. Hearing Care Specialist How often do you get your hearing checked? The answer is likely, \"never,\" which puts you in the majority. \"Of the 48 million Americans with hearing loss, only about 25 percent take charge of their hearing by having a hearing evaluation,\" says Corrine Perritano, president of [Beltone North America](https://www.beltone.com/index.aspx). Seeing a hearing care specialist is the best way to start your journey toward improving your hearing in 2018 and on. With access to some of the newest technology available, these alternative health professionals can cater their testing and solutions to your specific hearing needs, whether you're 25 or 82. \"Hearing care professionals are more empowered than ever to deliver a whole new level of personalized hearing care and service in ways that are simple and convenient for our patients,\" says Perritano. Once tested, they'll develop a custom solution for your needs, helping you tweak, test and tweak some more until the desired results are achieved. Yoga Therapist While all yoga is good for your body, there's a distinct difference between your favorite yoga class and yoga therapy: \"With the growing popularity of yoga in the Western world, there are a large portion of yoga classes that are specifically geared toward fitness for young and healthy people. Many yoga teachers are therefore qualified to teach healthy adults, but do not have the training or knowledge base to teach those students that have injuries, chronic illness, or even 'older' adults,\" explains Caitlin Parsons, certified yoga therapist and owner of [Healers Within Yoga Therapy](http://healerswithin.com/). She continues, \"Yoga therapy began as a way to meet people of all ages and conditions where they're at.\" As such, this form of yoga can help heal a wide variety of acute and chronic health conditions, including back, neck and shoulder pain, heart disease, arthritis, cancer, respiratory disorders, autoimmune diseases and much more. While there are gentle, therapeutic yoga classes, having one-on-one sessions with a yoga therapist ensures that you get a personalized experience, focused on the specific health challenges you're facing. When meeting a new yoga therapist, you'll likely start with a consultation to discuss your aches, pains and needs so they can create a custom plan for you. Acupuncturist This 3,000-year old technique of Traditional Chinese Medicine has become popular in Western culture as a way to manage and heal a wide range of health conditions and challenges. According to [UC San Diego's Center for Integrative Medicine](http://cim.ucsd.edu/clinical-care/acupuncture.shtml), \"Acupuncture improves the body's functions and promotes the natural self-healing process by stimulating specific anatomic sites\u2014commonly referred to as acupuncture points, or acupoints.\" The practice involves inserting fine, sterile needles into the skin, using pressure, heat, or electrical stimulation to further enhance the effects. In any given session, you may also have the choice of using massage, moxibustion or heat therapy, cupping, and the application of topical herbal medicines and linaments to further your treatment. UC San Diego suggests that acupuncture can be used to treat more than 20 well-known ailments, ranging from musculoskeletal problems to anxiety, depression, arthritis, and morning sickness.

Massage Therapist You may know massage as a great way of reducing stress, anxiety and tension within the body. What you don't know is that iIt can also help reduce pain, digestive issues, joint pain and injuries, according to [the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/massage/art-20045743). In 2018, take control of your health with regular massage sessions, regular being the key word. According to experts at [The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/massage/massageintroduction.htm), consistency is key: \"Much of the evidence suggests that these effects are short term and that people need to keep getting massages for the benefits to continue.\" Another critical aspect to make massage therapy work for you is finding the right type of massage for your needs. Share the details of your aches, pains, or stiffness to the massage therapist, who will help you tease out your needs and find the best option. Alternative Health in 2018 Make health a priority in the New Year, but don't rely on the sole opinion of your doctor or naturopath. See if one of these alternative health professionals can help you find new solutions for on-going challenges and uncover opportunities to better yourself and your health. "}
