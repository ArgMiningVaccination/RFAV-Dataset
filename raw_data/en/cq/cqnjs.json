EuroNatur stands for a different way. The foundation's nature and species conservation projects help preserve Europe's nature in its beauty and diversity. EuroNatur protects large-scale natural landscapes as well as ecologically valuable cultural landscapes throughout Europe. EuroNatur projects are designed for the long term and involve the needs of local people. We strive not only for the protection of wildlife and its habitats in Europe, but also for an ecologically sustainable development of the respective region - in harmony with nature. We emphasize cooperating with local partner organisations and provide our partners in the EuroNatur project areas with the necessary support that enables them to effectively protect nature. "}
