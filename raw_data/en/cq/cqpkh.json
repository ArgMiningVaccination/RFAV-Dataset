Clinical massage therapy (CMT), as an important part ofcomplementary and alternative medicine, is widely employed among massage therapists, physical therapists, nurses, and physicians when managing CRF. Clinical research indicates that CMT produced relief of CRF. In this systematic review, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CMT for patients with CRF. Methods: We will search the following electronic databases for randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CMT for CRF in cancer patients: CENTRAL, Embase, MEDILINE, CINAHL and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Each database will be searched from inception to October 2018. The entire process will include study selection, data extraction, risk of biasassessment and meta-analyses. Results: This proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CMT for CRF. The outcomes will include change in quality of life, fatigue relief and adverse effect. Conclusions: This proposed systematic review will evaluate the existing evidence on the effectiveness and safety of CMT for patients with CRF. Dissemination and ethics: The results of this review will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication. Because all of the data used in this systematic review and meta-analysis has been published, this review does not require ethical approval. Furthermore, all data will be analyzed anonymously during the review process.

Introduction With approximately 15.5 million cancer survivors today in the United States alone, increased attention is being given to quality of life after cancer treatment.[1]Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms experiencedby people with cancer. [2]It can persist for months or years after cancer therapy is completed[3-5]and has a negative impact on all areas of function.[6]Moreover, CRF is more troublesome and has a greater negative impact on quality of life than cancer-related pain, depression, or nausea.[7,8] It is reported that over 50% of cancer survivors use a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approach for symptom management,[9]and demand and expectation from the survivors keep increasing.[10]One of the widely employed CAM interventions is massage therapy. Most studies that investigatemassage therapy as supportive care for patients treated for cancer focus on depression, anxiety, or pain as the outcomes of interest. [11-13]This systematic review was supported by grants from National Science Foundation of China (No.81574092) and State Administration of TraditionalChinese Medicine of the People 's Republic of China (No. GZYYGJ2018028).

Medicine (2018) 97:49(e13440)Received: 2 November 2018 / Accepted: 6 November 2018http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000013440Study Protocol Systematic Review Medicine\u00ae OPEN 1Nowadays, clinical massage therapy (CMT) is one of the fastest growing alternative therapies and has a high rate ofacceptance for symptom management among cancer patients. There are many different styles of CMT, such as, Chinese massage, Swedish massage, Japanese massage, Thai massage, etc.All of which involve manipulating muscles and rubbing or stroking soft tissues of the body. Moreover, massage has been shown in smaller studies with cancer patients to modulate theimmune system, [14,15]and has been demonstrated to signi cantly decrease markers of immune system activation in normal subjects.[16,17] Over the years, there has been a general concern that massage can increase the risk of cancer cells spreading to other parts of the body.[18-20]However, there is lack of evidence that this happens. Only through some use of extreme focused pressure, such assentinel lymph node mapping, that the promotion of metastasis through physical touch has been demonstrated. [21] This review aims to systematically review all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effectiveness and safety of CMT for patients with CRF. 2. Materials and methods This systematic review protocol has been registered on PROSPERO. The Protocol follows the Cochrane Handbookfor Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol (PRISMA-P) statement guidelines. [22]We will describe the changes in our full review if needed. 3. Inclusion criteria for study selection 3.1. Type of studies This review will include clinical RCTs of CMT for CRF in cancer patients without any language or publication status restrictions. Non-RCTs, quasi-RCTs, case series, case reports, crossover studies, uncontrolled trials, and laboratory studies will not beincluded. 3.2. Type of participants Cancer patients, male or female, of any age with a diagnosis of CRF, which based on International Statistical Classi cation of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10 threvision (ICD-10) proposed criteria and required evidence from the history, physical examination, and laboratory ndings that the fatigue was a consequence of cancer or cancer therapy and not primarilya consequence of comorbid physical or psychiatric disorders, will be included. Pregnant and lactating women will be excluded. Patients who were actively suicidal or homicidal; medical conditions felt to be clinically contributing to fatigue; medi-cations felt to be clinically contributing to fatigue; body mass index<18.5kg/m 2; and use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants within the past 6 months will be excluded. 3.3. Type of interventions Interventions will include any type of clinically performed massage for improvement of cancer-related fatigue. This will include Chinese Massage, Japanese Massage, Thai Massage, Swedish Massage, Tuina, Shiatsu, Remedial Massage, GeneralMassage, Acupressure, Re flexology, Manual Lymphatic Drain- age. Studies of CMT combined with other interventions such asacupuncture, herbal medicines, qigong and yoga will be considered for exclusion. Control: Placebo, no intervention, standard care and other body-based practices including exercise techniques, qigong, yoga and taichi. 3.4. Type of outcome measures 3.4.1. Primary outcomes. The primary outcome measure will be Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) from European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer(EORTC) 3.4.2. Secondary outcome. The secondary outcome measures will include Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI); Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue Short Form; Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q- LES-Q). 4. Search methods for the identi cation of studies 4.1. Electronic searches We will search the following electronic bibliographic databases for relevant trials: /C15Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); /C15CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, from 1937 to present); /C15EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database, from 1947 to present); /C15Ovid MEDLINE ALL (Ovid Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, from 1946 to present); /C15CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, from 1979 to present). 4.2. Data collection and analysis 4.2.1. Study identi cation. We will use EndNote X8 software to manage the records of searched electronic databases. Theinitial selection will involve scanning of the titles and abstracts of the retrieved studies. The full text of relevant studies will then be reviewed for study inclusion, in accordance with the inclusioncriteria, by 2 authors (KW and SQ). Potentially relevant articles will be reviewed independently by 2 authors (KW and HL) to determine if they meet the prespeci ed criteria. Any disagreement between authors will be resolved by consensus with a third author. The study selection procedure will follow and be recorded in the PRISMA flow chart. All the evidence will be assessed by The Grading of Recommendations Assessment,Development and Evaluation (GRADE). 4.2.2. Data extraction and management. According to the inclusion criteria, a standard data collection form will be madebefore data extraction. The following data will be extracted by 2authors (KW and SQ): /C15General information : Research identi cation, publication year, the title of the study, rst author. /C15Study methods : Study design, sample size, randomization method, allocation. concealment, blinding, incomplete report or selecting report, other sources of bias; /C15Participants : Inclusion and exclusion criteria. /C15Intervention : CMT technique names, motion details, treatment duration, and frequency.Wang et al. Medicine (2018) 97:49 Medicine 2/C15Control : Type of control body-based practice, motion details, treatment duration, and frequency. /C15Outcomes : Primary, secondary, and safety outcomes. 4.2.3. Risk of bias assessment. The risk of bias in included studies will be assessed independently by 2 reviewers (KW andGF) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, with any disagree- ments resolved by consensus or by discussion with a third reviewer. All judgments will be fully described, and theconclusions will be presented in the Risk of Bias gures and will be incorporated into the interpretation of review ndings, by means of sensitivity analysis. The risk of bias of each domain willbe graded as adequate, unclear, or inadequate. We intend to usethe concealment of allocation grading in investigation of any heterogeneity and in sensitivity analysis. Other aspects of study quality including the extent of blinding (if appropriate), theextent of losses to follow up, non-compliance, whether the outcome assessment was standardized, and whether an intention to treat analysis was undertaken, will be presented in the risk ofbias table describing the included studies and will provide a context for discussing the reliability of the results. 4.2.4. Data analysis. We will use Review Manager Software (Review Manager \u2014RevMan) [Computer program]. Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The CochraneCollaboration, 2014) provided by Cochrane Collaboration for data synthesis and analysis by 2 authors (XZ and HL). We will summarize data using risk radio (RR) with 95% con dence intervals (CI) for binary outcomes. If different measurement scales are used, standardized mean difference analyses will be performed. We will consider heterogeneity to be substantial if the I 2statistic is >50%. Data from individual trials will be combined for meta- analysis if the interventions, patient groups and outcomes are sufciently similar. Meta-analysis will not be performed if the I2 statistic is 85%. We will use a random-effects model for meta- analysis unless the degree of heterogeneity is readily explainable. If theI2statistic is <25% a xed-effect model will be used. Sensitivity analyses : heterogeneity may be due to the presence of 1 or more outlier studies with results that con flict with the rest of the studies. We will perform sensitivity analyses excluding outlier studies. In addition, we plan to perform sensitivity analysisto explore the in fluence of trial quality on effect estimates. The quality components of methodology include adequacy of generation of allocation sequence, concealment of allocation,and the use of intention-to-treat analysis. Subgroup analyses : if data permits, we will perform the following subgroup analyses. /C15different types of outcome measures; /C15different types of control therapies; /C15treatment duration. 4.2.5. Publication bias. If suf cient number of trials (more than 10 trials) are found, we will generate funnel plots (effect size against standard error) to investigate publication bias. 4.2.6. Ethics and dissemination. The data used in this systematic review will be collected from published studies. Based on this, the study does not require ethical approval.
