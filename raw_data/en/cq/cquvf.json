These two are intricately intertwined. With hormones off, you can start feeling sluggish, start gaining weight, craving more, and eating worse. This leads to metabolic dysfunction and chronic diseases that are riddling the United States. Hormone Health You've probably heard of the big ones like Testosterone and Estrogen but there are many hormones that go unnoticed like Cortisol, Melatonin, and the Thyroid hormones. These are crucial for proper physiological and mental function and regularly go unchecked. We ask a lot of questions to pin down what hormones should be evaluated to get you back to optimal. Metabolic Health To put it simply, Metabolic Health is addressing those chronic diseases that will kill you early- leaving your family wondering what happened. Cardiovascular disease, Diabetes, Obesity- all these lead to worsening outcomes later in life. We strive to get these things in check and addressed before they become an issue for you and your family.

We want to know about your sleep, stress levels, diet and exercise routines- All these aspects of your life matter and can have a dramatic effect on your health. What Questions Do You Have? [What is Integrative Medicine?](#what-is-integrative-medicine) We are board-licensed physicians that treat a broad spectrum of diseases and conditions. We are dedicated to accurately diagnosing, providing you with the understanding of your condition, and offering effective treatments and lifestyle changes. Integrative physicians bond the gap between commonly used medications and natural therapies using research-based medicine. We take into account all aspects of the person, including their lifestyle. This is one of our core values in our practice and is emphasized down to our name. \"Victus\" which in Latin means \"way of life\" and \"full nourishment of the body\". [How long is my first appointment?](#how-long-is-my-first-appointment) We reserve 60 minutes for the first appointment with one of our physicians. This is not your normal doctors appointment, and we like it that way. We will go in depth about your medical concerns, medical history, and lifestyle; perform a physical exam, schedule or draw any necessary bloodwork and imaging, and provide you with a treatment plan*. *A thorough treatment plan is provided at the second visit, the treatment visit. This is because we first want to know what we are treating. Prior to this second visit, we will evaluate labs and imaging so that we may apply appropriate treatment for your condition. [How long is a follow-up appointment?](#how-long-is-a-follow-up-appointment) Follow-up appointments with our physicians are typically 15-30 minutes in length. This is where we will discuss your progress and make any necessary modifications to your treatment plan. [Do you take HSA or FSA cards?](#do-you-take-hsa-or-fsa-cards) Yes, we do take Health Savings Account (HSA) cards and Flexible Spending Account (FSA) cards in office. We also take all credit cards including Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express [Do you take my insurance?](#do-you-take-my-insurance) We are a cash-based medical practice so we do not take insurance. This provides us the flexibility to spend more time with patients and helps us to avoid complicated billing processes that slow productivity. Because of this, we can give definitive prices for blood work, procedures, and treatments. We have contracted, lower-priced, cash-pay lab services for on-site blood draws to ensure competitive prices for all patients; regardless of insurance or deductibles. Did we mention the On-Site blood draw? You get it done all in one place. For your convenience, we can provide you with a claim form to submit to your insurance but there is no guarantee of coverage and all payments are due at the time of service. **We do take Health Savings Account (HSA) cards and Flexible Spending Account (FSA) cards.
