It is used in narrow-profile health centers and in specialized resort complexes, where you can combine relaxation and Indian alternative medicine. Patients with various diseases come to India to undergo the Ayurvedic therapy program. Clinics of countries with developed medicine offer innovative methods of treatment, but Ayurveda, after millennia, does not lose its relevance. Let's analyze in detail the strengths and advantages of Ayurveda in this article. Ayurveda is the balance of mind and body The word \"Ayurveda\" comes from Sanskrit (an ancient Indian language) and means \"science of life\". Ayur is a long life, Veda is knowledge. Ayurveda is based on the belief that everything is related to everything else. Because of this, general health and well-being depend on achieving inner harmony. When a person is unbalanced or under stress, illness can be developed. Ayurveda focuses on lifestyle interventions and natural therapies to bring balance between the physical body, mind, spirit, and the world around the individual. In the process of this treatment, the beauty of nature and clean air favorably affect a person. In their reviews, patients who have visited India note that they instantly switched on arrival at Ayurvedic sanatoriums.

Thus, a person heals in a safe way and without side effects. Why is Indian Ayurveda so popular among Europeans and Americans? Ayurveda is one of nature's ways to improve the functioning of various body systems. A common problem for Americans is being overweight. At the same time, not all people are ready for a radical solution to the issue. Bariatric surgery and liposuction have their advantages and disadvantages (it takes time for rehabilitation and healing of the incision area). Therefore, Ayurvedic treatment is an alternative way to reduce weight. According to WHO, mortality from cardiovascular diseases accounts for 16% of all deaths of patients in the world. Therefore, residents of European countries resort to preventive measures in order to improve the work of the heart and to clean the blood vessels. To do this, they come to Ayurvedic resorts in India. The climate of Kerala allows people to have a good time on vacation with health benefits. From the Instagram of Hollywood stars and supermodels, it can be seen that they also use the Ayurveda system. Mostly yoga and meditation. In addition, many celebrities keep to the concept of Ayurvedic nutrition - vegetarian dishes and teas from medicinal plants. This indicates that not only surgery and hardware cosmetology help people maintain their youth and health! How medicinal plants are used in Ayurveda Plant components make up the bulk of all cosmetic and medicinal products that are used in medical Ayurveda. Indian specialists work with massage oils, creams, and masks made from natural products. Most often, these are extracts from plants, tinctures of herbs, and fruits. Tulasi is one of the most common herbs in Ayurveda. In India, it is considered an elixir for the continuation of life. Tulasi is sometimes referred to as the holy basil. In Ayurvedic centers, dietary supplements based on tulasi are given to patients as an antioxidant. Dhanvantari (Dhanvantar gutika) is a popular herbal preparation in India, which is named after the founder of Ayurveda. It is often prescribed to pregnant women with signs of toxicosis and muscle tone. Dhanvantari is considered a universal remedy that is drunk for many pathologies (chronic headache, asthma, and more). A medicinal plant in India is a valuable source for the creation of various organic medicines. Therefore, the best Ayurvedic clinics create individual products for their visitors that have the certain effects on the body. - - choleretic; - anti-inflammatory; - restorative; - painkiller; - wound healing and so on. Depending on the diseases and complaints of the patient, organic preparations are necessarily added to all Indian practices and diet. They can be intended for oral use, for external care of the skin of the face and body, hair, oral cavity. The main feature of Ayurvedic cosmetics and medicines is their natural composition. Can Ayurvedic medicines and cosmetics have side effects? According to the American National Library of Medicine, Ayurvedic medicines may have health benefits but they are not without side effects. They can be caused by integral components such as alkaloids. Each chemical compound in any Ayurvedic preparation must be listed on the label along with recommendations for the correct dosage. A patient who takes an Ayurvedic medicine and uses organic cosmetics should remember: - the natural composition of a product may have components that cause an individual allergic reaction; - exceeding the recommended doses may cause unpleasant symptoms (nausea, skin irritation, rash). The main advantage of getting Ayurvedic medicines and cosmetics in specialized centers is safety. The fact that people randomly buy on the Internet may not give the expected effect or lead to undesirable consequences. In the laboratory, mercury and lead were found in unknown medicines when patients were hospitalized after unsuccessful use of pseudo-Ayurvedic medicines. Ayurveda centers in India care about their patients and the reputation of the institutions. Therefore, all plants that are used to make medicines, massage oils, shampoos, and other products are herbs grown on special plantations. They are processed according to the ancient recipes of Ayurveda. The employees and owners of the centers are responsible for quality and efficiency. Ayurvedic Nutrition The Ayurvedic nutrition is focused on the effectiveness of foods that will be beneficial for a person depending on his physical condition and physique. Ayurveda experts believe that such a diet can improve not only health but also the functioning of the mind. How does diet work in the overall Ayurvedic system of wellness? According to Ayurveda, the universe consists of five elements: Vayu (air), Jala (water), Akasha (space), Teja (fire) and Prithvi (earth). It is believed that these elements form three different Doshas, which are defined as the types of energy circulating in the human body. Each dosha is responsible for certain physiological functions. Pitta dosha controls hunger, thirst, and body temperature. Vata dosha maintains electrolyte balance and movement. Kapha dosha promotes joint function. Thus, the Ayurvedic diet is based on determining the dominant dosha of the patient and eating certain foods to help normalize the balance between all three doshas. What food is suitable for Ayurveda? There is no unambiguously correct answer to this question, because it is not only about food, but also about human goals. In specialized Ayurvedic centers, it is customary to develop a diet individually for everyone who needs healing and cleansing of the body. When forming an individual Ayurvedic diet, they take into account what the patient's complaints are and what exactly the patient would like to improve in his (her) state. Also certified doctors in Ayurveda take into account the incompatibility of some products. Definitely, Ayurvedic nutrition excludes alcohol and fast food. True Ayurvedic cuisine does not offer meat dishes. But there are a huge number of Indian recipes that successfully replace our usual meat food and bakery products. Ama in ancient Indian Ayurveda is the remnants of undigested food. They accumulate in the digestive tract, stagnate, and cause disease. Therefore, canonical Ayurvedic nutrition helps to eliminate toxins from the body through properly selected ingredients. What is panchakarma and how is it used in medical Ayurveda Panchakarma is a special cleansing program that works according to the principles of Ayurveda. It is selected taking into account the individual characteristics of the patient. Panchakarma allows to get rid of deep stress and remove toxins from the body that cause diseases. The program includes all kinds of detox procedures. The main panchakarma program in Ayurvedic medical centers includes: - obligatory medical consultation; - special three meals a day; - massages; - spiritual practices; - yoga; - individual procedures, depending on the diagnosis and health complaints. Massage and exercise can effectively deal with stagnation in the body. In the process of reducing body weight, this helps to bring the skin in order and get rid of flabbiness and sagging. Dr. Ajay Johnson from the [Puvar Island Resort](https://experts-medical.com/en/clinic/ayurvedic-resort-poovar-island-resort-4/) (Kerala, India) will tell you more about the 5 stages of panchakarma. Treatment in Indian Ayurveda centers As a rule, before understanding what treatment is needed, the patient undergoes a study in a medical institution. Based on this, the doctor makes a diagnosis and the person roughly understands why the symptoms appear. In the event that urgent surgery or device therapy is not required, the patient may consider alternative methods. Ayurveda is an ancient Indian knowledge that allows to solve a number of medical problems in a pleasant and safe way. What are Indian Ayurveda centers? India is one of the most popular countries for medical tourism. In multidisciplinary clinics, special attention is paid to safety for foreign patients. People come here for the treatment of complex oncological diseases and organ transplantations. As for rehabilitation and recovery, the Ayurvedic centers of India are unique in their kind. This is because: - India is the country where Ayurveda originated; - specialists who work in specialized centers have been trained in Ayurveda schools; - each element of the wellness program is ancient practices that have proven their effectiveness. Depending on how ready the patient is to plunge in the Ayurvedic atmosphere, different recovery options can be considered. For example, in [Kalari Rasayana Ayurvedic clinic](https://experts-medical.com/en/clinic/ayurvedic-center-kalari-rasayana/), only authentic methods of therapy are practiced. Meditation, yoga classes, and going to bed are strictly on schedule. Patients come here for at least 2 weeks. Compliance with strict conditions is less reminiscent of a spa holiday, compared to other centers of Ayurveda. However, the result of treatment exceeds all expectations! The power of Ayurveda is 100% revealed to visitors to Kalari. In addition, for Europeans, this is quite an interesting experience. In the Indian state of Kerala, there are several specialized institutions where medical Ayurveda is practiced. Most of them combine all the advantages of a resort holiday and the opportunity to take a health course. According to the Cleveland Clinic research center, 80% of India's population (1.2 billion people) use some form of Ayurvedic medicine. India has opened public and private Ayurvedic medical schools, clinics, and specialized eco-hotels. This is an important aspect of traditional Indian culture, which attracts people from other countries. Every year, patients from Germany, the USA, England, Ukraine and Asia come to India to undergo Ayurvedic therapy. What is practiced in the centers of medical Ayurveda? The main practices that are included in the modern health system are recommendations recorded in the texts of ancient Indian treatises (dated 700 BC - 1st century AD). Thus, the followers of the ancient Indian teachings rely on the true knowledge of Ayurveda but in some cases it is adapted to the convenience of current patients. As in ancient times, the vital activity of an organism is considered through the interaction of three substances (air, fire, water). Only professionals who have undergone special training, have studied the treatise and all the basics of Ayurveda can work with them. When coming to India for Ayurvedic treatment, patients can expect: Ayurveda also uses minerals and precious metals. They have healing properties, the most important thing is to use them correctly. For example, copper is useful for people with a predominance of kapha dosha, as it helps to stabilize weight, get rid of edema, and cleanse the lymphatic system. Gold has a beneficial effect on the functioning of the heart muscle, improves memory, and tones the nervous system.
