The secondary objective is to compare the safety of a single/multiple UC-MSCs injection in a dose escalating manner as well as on the efficacy of stem cells treatment (reepithelialization of the external openings of fistula) Nutritional Saffron supplement has been widely used as food supplement and has known anti-depressant and anti-inflammatory activities. It is generally consumed as stigmas in drinks or dishes. The investigators use saffron extract in patients with colitis for 8 weeks. Although patients and physicians have shown tremendous interest in the effect of diet on ulcerative colitis, there is a lack of significant evidence for providers to make practical recommendations with. In this study, the investigators hope to find out if dietary therapy by either the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) or the Mediterranean diet will help improve ulcerative colitis symptoms for patients with mild to moderately active disease. In addition, the investigators will compare disease activity and changes in the intestinal bacterial composition in the colon that occur with the Mediterranean or the SCD diet in active ulcerative... The purpose of this study is to determine whether a diet intervention (the Fasting Mimicking diet) will help induce clinical and biochemical response to tofacitinib therapy or second line biologic therapy with ustekinumab or infliximab in patients with ulcerative colitis. Study period will be 8 weeks during induction of tofacitinib or ustekinumab or infliximab. The primary aims of this study are to determine clinical response and improvement in fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein levels. Secondary outcomes will include assessment of changes in the stool microbiome. A Phase II study to assess the safety and efficacy of AVB-114 in treatment of complex Crohn's perianal fistulas in subjects with quiescent rectal disease and whose fistula has failed to respond to biologic or conventional therapy. Combined remission of treated perianal fistula in the investigational treatment arm will be compared to a standard of care control arm. The study has 2 parts: Part 1: All required study visits for subjects who initially receive study treatment and those who receive standard of care therapy (control arm). Part 2: Subjects who are enrolled in the control arm may receive treatment with AVB-114 ... Patients presenting with severe symptoms of ulcerative colitis (UC) require hospital admission for urgent assessment and therapy. Endoscopic examination of the rectum and/or distal colon is often performed to assess severity and obtain tissue for histopathologic evaluation, but this is often extended to full colonoscopy to assess the extent of bowel involvement. Full colonoscopy is hazardous in this setting Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have been shown to be at increased risk of developing certain infections, such as shingles from the Herpes Zoster (HZ) virus, as a result of their underlying disease. Patients with UC are also often treated with immunosuppressants, and research has shown that IBD patients on immunosuppressants have an impaired immune response to vaccination in comparison to immunocompetent controls. Because UC patients are often treated with immunosuppressants, the live HZ vaccine was not recommended in these patients. Shingrix, however, is a new inactivated vaccine... ustekinumab (UST) can effectively induce and maintain clinical remission and mucosal healing of Crohn's disease (CD), but some patients still have poor response. Dose optimization is an effective way to improve the response rate of UST, and re-intravenous induction is a common way of optimization. For patients with secondary loss of response, about half of the patients can re-respond after dose optimization. We plan to use CDST-UST to stratify the response level of patients before treatment, select patients with poor response, and initially give multiple intravenous therapy as an intensive induction therapy strategy, so as to improve the ... The European guidelines currently recommend to use 2 L of polyethylene glycol and free residue diet before any capsule endoscopy. However, up to now, no studies have been conducted to specifically evaluate bowel preparation modalities before small bowel capsule endoscopy in patients with Crohn's disease. In patients with Crohn's disease and small bowel ulcers, polyethylene glycol may remove some fibrin from these ulcers and alter bowel preparation. Moreover, it is important to select the most acceptable bowel preparation because patients with Crohn's disease will have to repeat capsule endoscopy several times after initiating... The investigators will be evaluating bone marrow composition via magnetic resonance imaging in newly diagnosed adolescents with Crohn disease (CD) compared to healthy, matched controls. The investigators will also be assessing their bone mineral density via other imaging modalities, including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and peripheral quantitative computed tomography. This longitudinal project will focus on abnormalities in bone marrow composition, and specifically whether adolescents with newly diagnosed CD exhibit increased bone marrow fat, its association with bone mineral density (BMD) and "}
