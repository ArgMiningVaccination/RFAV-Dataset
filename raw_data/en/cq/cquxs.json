The Spring Equinox is a representation of new life and light, new beginnings, new paths, new seeds. This equinox will also be the representation for our needs for balance, renewal and growth. Sophia will assist you to release and reset and welcome the new energy and transformations you desire for your goals. This session involves: Gentle yoga stretches to release stagnant energy and to encourage the body and mind to get into the mood of letting go. Flower meditation to release blockages and things we're holding on to that no longer serve us. Journaling to encourage downloads and create an action plan for the journey ahead. Sound Healing for deeper energy clearing and relaxation. These tools open a window of opportunity that will continue beyond the equinox. The actions taken on this day will benefit you physically, emotionally and spiritually. Take this opportunity to welcome and embrace new beginnings. This session is open to all levels of experience.
