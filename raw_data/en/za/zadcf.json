The fingerprints submitted by the applicant will be retained by FDLE and the Clearinghouse. All costs for conducting a criminal history background screening are borne by the applicant. Please ensure that the Originating Agency Identification (ORI) number is provided to the service provider when you submit your fingerprints. If you do not provide an ORI number or if you provide an incorrect ORI number to the service provider, the board office will not receive your fingerprint results. The applicant is fully responsible for selecting the service provider and ensuring submission of the prints to the Department. You can find an approved Livescan Service Provider at [https://www.flhealthsource.gov/background-screening](https://www.flhealthsource.gov/background-screening). Please take [this form](/forms/FPform-RT.pdf) with you to the Livescan provider. Please check the service provider's requirements to see if you need to bring any additional items. Also verify that the Originating Agency Identification (ORI) number submitted by the livescan service provider matches the information provided. General Information The Florida Board of Medicine general statutes require that you must have a valid Florida medical license to practice medicine in Florida.

You will need to know your File ID number and your date of birth to access the information. Your File ID number will be given to you once you start the application. We recommend that you do not make any commitments based upon expectation of licensure until you are actually licensed. Some applicants suffer significant costs by signing mortgages and committing to a start date prematurely. Read instructions before and while you complete the application. Failure to do so may result in delays in processing your application. One application is not accelerated at the expense of another, particularly if there is a premature commitment to start practicing medicine. All applicants are handled equally and fairly. The application process may take between two to six months to complete depending on your credentials. You will not be able to start work until you have been granted a full medical license. Applicants can help expedite the application process by including all relevant materials with their application packets (medical school diploma, residency certificates, etc). We will mail you a deficiency letter approximately 30 days after receiving your application. Please refrain from contacting our office until after you have received your initial deficiency letter.

Licenses will not be issued without the background check results and will be issued in date order. When issuing licenses, we have a strict policy of fairness. One application will not be accelerated at the expense of another. All applications will be handled equally and fairly. Also, the less time reviewers spend responding to duplicate e-mails and telephone calls, the faster applications can be reviewed.
