Being a part of the Medical Section, the International Society of Anthroposophic Naturopathy (ISAN) works diligently and with fervour to improve this profession. To this end, a certification system for Anthroposophic Naturopaths was created in 2012, which was established in co-operation with the Medical Section at the Goetheanum / Dornach. An essential step in this direction was the introduction of certification guidelines and the registration of the \"Anthroposophic Naturopathy\" brand as a brand in 2012. Now, ISAN is the only body world-wide, which trains, educates and certifies naturopaths in Anthroposophic Naturopathy. This trademark-protected Quality Seal - in addition to an international framework curriculum - alone ensures qualifications in Anthroposophic Naturopathy. The fulfillment of such standards in regard to Anthroposophic Naturopathy - which were established in close cooperation with the Medical Section - has become an international internal obligation for all Anthroposophic Naturopaths. Following this policy, Anthroposophic Naturopaths contribute to further safeguard and acknowledge this profession. With this professional profile of Anthroposophic Naturopathy - as confirmed by IKAM (International Coordination of Anthroposophic Medicine) - ISAN represents Anthroposophic Naturopathy both within the Medical Section at the Goetheanum as well as in IKAM. On account of both, spiritual observance and scientific evaluation, the executive board of the International Society of Anthroposophic Naturopathy (ISAN) supports the SARS-CoV-2 assessments of the Medical Section of the School of Spiritual Science at the Goetheanum, based upon the expertise of the healthcare professions involved. Speaking in the context of smallpox vaccination, Rudolf Steiner once observed that the latter could be survived without any impairment, assumed Anthroposophy is practiced perseveringly.[1] Anthroposophic naturopaths recognise the complexity of the subject matter. Apart from everyone's personal momentary stand in regard to the issue of vaccination, there frequently arises the question concerning the improvement of constitutional and requisite congruence within the physical-etheric rhythm. What are the prerequisites so that everyone, with no loss of his personal self-reflection, may achieve his own personal ideals? \"If ideals are to have value, ideals must be rooted as deeply in the spiritual world as are natural laws in the natural world. Laws of development must be such true ideals.\"[2] This answer points out the possibility for advancement towards an individual identiy with its own values, as well as - likewise and at the very same time - towards the diversity of values. The Medical Section published numerous excellent statements about SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19), which offer a differentiated view.[3] Besides, the executive board of the International Society of Anthroposophic Naturopathy (ISAN) supports the \"Declaration of the General Conference of German Naturopathic Associations and Specialist Societies\": \"We hereby unanimously and explicitly dissociate ourselves from any non-democratic, anti-semitic and rightwing respectively radical groups as well as from Corona deniers. Non-medical practitioners are cosmopolitan by nature. We practice methods from many different cultures and Weltanschauungen. Members of our professions are as diverse as our patients. Faith into natures healing powers unites people of various origins and of all age groups independent from religion and Weltanschauung. It is the ailing and afflicted human being who is central to our acting, independent from race or religion. The basic principle of our work comprises humanitarianism, appreciation, respect, and human love. Thus, we send a clear message: naturopaths are colourful, and not brown.\"[4] Anthroposophic naturopaths side with all patients and their spiritual distress who are affected by the Corona pandemic.

Rudolf Steiner; drawing by Alexander B. Schadow It was Rudolf Steiner who, during the last century, established Anthroposophy as a path of knowledge for contemporary man. Derived from a true knowledge of the human being, which incorporates into its analysis both, the bodily, mental, and spiritual wholeness of man as well as the individual progress, he, in union with the physician Ita Wegmann, thus, in 1920 sowed the seed for a spiritually enhanced medicine. Members of ISAN recognise Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy as a scientific way which provides the potential to gain knowledge about the context of the spiritual within man, thereby permeating, extending, and complementing existing academic medicine as well as generic naturopathic methods, whilst within a spirit always pertaining to the humanities. Members of ISAN endeavour to promote Anthroposophy beyond the scope of profession-specific fields. Within Anthroposophy they gain further qualifications in regard to therapeutic methods, the personal schooling path of the Naturopath, one's own social and ethical attitude, appreciation of one's fellow human beings, as well as qualifications in regard to environmental sustainability. ISAN holds research and development as of fundamental concern. ISAN promotes vocational and advanced training of Naturopath, who are interested to extend their own therapeutical work into the field of the Anthroposophic humanities. in regard to Anthroposophic Naturopathy (AGAHP)\u00ae Members of ISAN may obtain certification - by means of application, only - of their knowledge gained either through ANTHROPOS-SOPHIA, the associational institute, or through other recognised educational facilities.
