GEROPROTECT\u00ae Autophagy Renew Benefits - Innovative longevity formula - Helps your body function optimally, without cellular debris getting in the way - Promotes healthy AMPK activity - Encourages cells to recycle waste material - Helps maintain cellular energy balance Recycling what's inside: autophagy explained We know that recycling is good for the environment. But as it turns out, it's also good for our cells: autophagy is a natural process by which cells clean up intra-cellular debris and other metabolic waste. Tiny cellular organelles called lysosomes breakdown and repurpose this spent material. So why does cellular autophagy matter? Because it helps our bodies conserve energy and function properly, which is essential to living a long, healthy life. Life Extension - Why Do We Do It?
