If a person is experiencing interference in their nervous system, then they are not reaching their full potential. I practice principled chiropractic care and deliver specific adjustments to remove the interference and allow the body to heal itself. \"Some of my professional interests include providing care to patients during their pregnancy and caring for children. These interests have motivated me to attend multiple post-graduate programs to expand my knowledge of caring for expectant mothers and infants\" -Dr. Bemis.
