The government recently introduced a new category of visa, the Ayush, to facilitate travel for foreign nationals seeking treatment according to traditional systems of medicine.

(Unani is Islamic traditional medicine derived from the teachings of Hippocrates in ancient Greece; siddha is southern Indian traditional medicine.) Ayush Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said the new visa category would boost health tourism by appealing to those in search of such treatments. To be granted an Ayush visa (US$80 for up to six months; US$120 for 12 months), applicants must submit supporting medical documents from an accredited Ayush institution where they will be treated and a prescription or medical history document from an accredited hospital in their home country. Ayush visas can also be obtained for those accompanying and assisting a patient. All Indian states are vying for a slice of the Ayush tourism pie, but Kerala in the country's south, known for its rich culture, agreeable climate, pristine beaches, tranquil backwaters, lush hill stations and sumptuous food, has grabbed the spotlight. At the southwestern tip of India, Kerala has identified wellness tourism as a \"highly promising area\" of tourism development, says P.B. Nooh, director, Kerala Tourism. \"Ayurveda figures prominently in this scheme,\" he says. [Have earache? Eat raw garlic, pour in some oil - Ayurvedic remedies](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/3207108/have-ear-ache-eat-raw-garlic-pour-oil-your-ears-or-water-through-your-nostrils-home-remedies?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) A Sanskrit word that translates to \"knowledge of life\", Ayurveda is said to have originated in India more than 3,000 years ago. It is centred on the concepts of the universal interconnectedness between the body's constitution (prakriti) and life forces (doshas). Ayurveda combines lifestyle changes and natural therapies to balance the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to ensure that the mind, body and spirit are in harmony. It has preventive and curative aspects. Treatments typically include dietary changes, massage therapies, meditation and herbal medicines. Herbs, plants, oils and common spices are used to manage symptoms, treat imbalances and build resistance. The efficacy of Ayurveda is not universally accepted, but the people of Kerala have been convinced of its benefits for centuries. \"Every little town and village has an Ayurveda pharmacy,\" says Nooh. \"Most Ayurvedic practitioners here hail from families where the knowledge was passed from father to son over successive generations. \"The location of the state helps, as does the presence of dense tropical forests rich in herbs and medicinal plants to make extracts and elixirs prescribed by Ayurveda.\" Kerala is home to at least 120 private establishments, including holiday resorts and Ayurvedic centres, that offer traditional treatments and therapies. And it has more than 100 government-run hospitals in which Ayurveda is practised, around 800 Ayurvedic medicine dispensaries, and more than 800 Ayurvedic medicine factories. According to Market Research Future, the global Ayurveda market is projected to grow from US$9.2 billion in 2023 to US$26.16 billion in 2032. Its report says consumer demand is being driven by \"knowledge of advantages, awareness about drawbacks of allopathy [the treatment of disease by conventional means], accessibility, and rising disposable income\". \"[Kerala] used to get around [1.2 million] international tourist arrivals per year, with almost 30 per cent visiting for medical tourism,\" says Sajikumar S, managing director of Kerala's Dhathri Ayurveda hospital. \"The pandemic reduced footfall drastically, but business has picked up and Ayush visas will help the industry grow.\" K. Biju, secretary of Kerala Tourism, identifies a further advantage for destinations from this kind of medical tourism. \"Ayurveda isn't a quick-fix solution; most treatments span 14 to 41 days and necessitate repeat visits,\" making Kerala a long-haul destination in more ways than one. Repeat visits are particularly useful for patients undergoing panchakarma, a holistic treatment to rid the body of toxins. M.G. Menon, director of the Nilayoram Resorts & Ayurvedic Centre, says the monsoon season [April to September] is the ideal time for Ayurvedic treatments. \"The outside temperature and the body temperature are almost in alignment then, which means the body is able to absorb and benefit from oils and decoctions applied during therapies,\" Menon says. The Kerala Tourism Development Corporation is marketing several \"monsoon packages\", ranging from five to eight days, in prime locations. Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, will host the five-day Global Ayurveda Festival from December 1. The event, expected to draw 7,500 delegates from 75 countries, will showcase Ayurveda's potential in addressing modern health challenges and create a global networking platform for practitioners and stakeholders. \"Kerala is going to [ ...] benefit significantly from the promotion of wellness tourism. Numerous big-format wellness resorts that combine the goodness of modern medicine along with traditional and indigenous healing systems are coming up,\" Nooh says. Another attraction, says the tourism director, is that \"many Ayurvedic spas and modern medical institutions are located in panoramic sites like unspoiled beaches, cool and verdant upland towns, or "}
