Toddlers and youth can sometimes be a bit afraid. Here are some helpful tips to reduce the pain of a vaccine. Give it your best shot! |For babies | | | Breastfeed - Breastfeed your baby five minutes before the injection, as well as during and after vaccinations, to reduce pain and to provide comfort. [Breastfeed to minimize vaccination pain - two months - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrKmAth4ZGc&t=84s) [Breastfeed to minimize vaccination pain - six months - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55tejVjzzwE&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parentinginottawa.ca%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title) Hold comfortably - Hold the baby close to your body, in a front-to-front position with both legs exposed. This reassuring close contact can help to reduce pain. Offer sugar water - For babies 12 months of age or less, who are not breastfed, give a few drops of sugar solution (on the tip of the infant's tongue) one minute before the injection. Repeat administration of a few drops of sugar solution just before the injection. The sweet solution provides a few minutes of pain relief during vaccination. - Purchase a pre-mixed sugar solution at a pharmacy or prepare one at home by mixing 5 mL (one teaspoon) sugar with 10 mL (two teaspoons) water. Do not use honey. - Never use sugar water at home to calm a fussy or crying baby, as this can lead to tooth decay. - Feed your baby or give sips of water to clean the baby's mouth after vaccination. |For toddlers and young children | | | Prepare your child ahead of time - Read stories about what happens when you visit the doctor. - Offer an honest explanation about what to expect. Prepare young children (under 4 years of age) just before the injection. Prepare older children the day before. - Describe how vaccination will feel (for example, like a pinch). - Tell your child what they can do to ease the pain (for example, sit still, breathe deeply, relax the arm). Distract your child - Draw your child's attention away from the needle. This is one of the best ways that you can help your child. - Distract your child with a favourite toy or blanket, a book, music, singing, or telling a joke or a story. - Tell your child to take a deep breath and to blow it out slowly. Blowing bubbles or blowing on a pinwheel can help also. Position your child in an upright position Hold your young child securely in a comforting hug, sitting upright on your lap, facing forward, or facing you (front to front), with the arm exposed. Lying flat on their back during an injection, or being held too tightly, can be scary for children and can increase their fear. Older children can sit alone if they wish, with the arm exposed. If your child continues to move, ask your healthcare provider about the proper hold technique that is safest for your child. |Youth | | | Getting a vaccine might be scary for some youth. Try some of these helpful tips; they may be your best shot to help your youth overcome their fear. Offer helpful distractions such as: - Talking to your youth - Having them listen to music with earphones - Getting them to play games or texting on a cell phone For older children and youth who are very fearful, think about medications that numb the skin: - Talk to your health care provider about creams such as EMLA\u00ae or Ametop\u00ae that can help numb the skin. They are available without a prescription. - Ask your health care provider to show you the right locations to apply the cream. Keep in mind that, on some visits, more than one injection may be given. Read the instructions before applying the product. It must be on the skin 30 to 60 minutes before the injection(s). - Offering praise and a reward after vaccinations can help children and youth "}
