Using warming ingredients for meals that are in season to counteract any imbalances created by the cold weather. Warming herbs and foods include cinnamon, ginger, garlic, spicy foods, sweet potatoes, squash, meat and nutrient-dense soups and stews. Save raw, leafy greens for the summer. Eat less We typically are not as active during the winter so we require less food. Cut down on your caloric intake. Sleep More Traditional Chinese medicine recommends following the sun and sleeping more in the fall and winter because we have fewer hours of daylight. It is best to get nine to 10 hours of sleep as opposed to the recommended eight hours in the summer and spring. Slow Down We should expect ourselves to slow down naturally and be less active during winter months. This is a hard concept for many Americans to grasp given our busy culture. Meditate More As our bodies naturally slow down, it is best to slow the mind as well through meditation. Don't resist what the body is naturally meant to do this time of year. Turn to Acupuncture An acupuncture winterizing treatment naturally restores balance and boosts energy levels. Practice Self-Care Get a massage, engage in social activities and take a vacation, if possible. Self-care will help you recharge your body. \"Our immune system is naturally suppressed in the winter,\" said Dr. Michelfelder, who also is a professor at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. \"Try not to fight the seasons. If we are not aligned with the natural cycles of life, we won't be able to recharge our immune system to protect our health.\" From [Newswise](http://www.newswise.com/articles/how-to-stay-healthy-this-winter-following-eastern-medicine-guidelines) *Images of \" "}
