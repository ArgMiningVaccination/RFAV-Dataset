A titer is a test of your pet's blood to look for antibodies against diseases. Titers are available to determine if your pet is still producing antibodies against diseases routinely vaccinated against. Why Titer? You may choose to have your pets blood tested for these antibodies to avoid having to unnecessarily revaccinate your pet for a disease it may already be protected against. Some health problems, such as allergies and autoimmune disease are aggravated by revaccination. This means symptoms may recur or become more severe after a vaccination is given. This can be life threatening. Please discuss titer options for your pet with a staff member prior to your vaccination appointment. "}
