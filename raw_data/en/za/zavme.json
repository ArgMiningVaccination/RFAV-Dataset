Multiple studies over the years have proven chiropractic to be a safe and effective treatment for back and neck pain. The top number one and two reasons people visit a chiropractor every year are for back and neck pain, respectively. Yet, many people don\u00e2\u20act realize that chiropractic is much more than back and neck treatment. Chiropractors treat the entire body and for many conditions. Chiropractic is a holistic practice. A chiropractor sees and treats the body as a whole. While a patient may initially come to a chiropractor for back pain, the chiropractor will heal the body as a whole and not merely treat the back pain symptoms. Chiropractors look at the root cause of the problem and work to correct that root cause along with any residual effects. The body is interconnected and often when a problem exists in one area, other systems are likewise affected. For example, a patient\u00e2\u20acs back pain caused by a misaligned vertebrae could also be causing a patient\u00e2\u20acs digestive problems, breathing problems, and depression. When the chiropractor treats the body as a whole, getting at the root cause, and not just treating the back pain symptoms, the patient may begin to see an improvement in the other areas as well. As an all natural healing practice, chiropractic can safely and effectively treat the mind, body, and spirit and greatly improve a person\u00e2\u20acs quality of life. Chiropractic is non-invasive and relies on manual therapies and natural healing applications. Many people who see a chiropractor are able to avoid costly surgery and drugs. Surgery and drugs carry risks and often unwanted side effects that are just as unbearable as, or worse than, the original condition. Treatment by a chiropractor has helped many people save thousands of dollars and years of pain and dysfunction. Conditions that chiropractors regularly treat include back and neck pain, shoulder impingement syndrome, fibromyalgia, hip pain, knee pain, foot and ankle pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, asthma, digestive disorders, prenatal and postpartum care, colic, bed-wetting, hypertension, headaches, and more. While certainly not an exhaustive list, this is a list of some of the many conditions treated by a chiropractor. In each case, the focus of the chiropractor is to work within the self-healing properties of the body to achieve the best overall possible outcome for the patient. In addition to rehabilitation, chiropractors also regularly work with patients on proactive treatment plans to help people live healthier, more productive lives. Athletes are good examples of proactive patients who seek a chiropractor for prevention and enhancement. But you don\u00e2\u20act have to be a professional athlete to reap the benefits of proactive chiropractic care. Individuals looking to improve work performance, \u00e2\u20acmoms to be\u00e2\u20ac wanting to provide the best possible health environment for their child, and people working to improve the quality of their life\u00e2\u20ac\"mind, body, and spirit\u00e2\u20ac\"are all good candidates for proactive chiropractic care.
