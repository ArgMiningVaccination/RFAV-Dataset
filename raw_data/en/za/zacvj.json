The editors' strict, evidence-based grading system allows them to rate the performance of such remedies for their various indications. Only 46 are considered effective and 72 likely effective. Efficacy is supported by at least two randomized, prospective, controlled, adequately large human studies that give positive results for clinically relevant end-points plus publication in an established refereed journal. The rest of the medicines descend a therapeutic hierarchy: 333 possibly effective, 46 possibly ineffective, 61 likely ineffective, 6 ineffective, and 538 unclassifiable owing to insufficient reliable data (some medicines are given different effectiveness ratings for different indications).
