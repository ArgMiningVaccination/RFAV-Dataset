Overview The shock of COVID-19 on California's economy, combined with the escalating impacts of climate change, underscored the importance of building a more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive economy across California. Rising temperatures are making our winters shorter and our droughts more intense, outpacing our ability to manage water supplies and the natural environment1. At the same time, inequitable access to quality jobs in sustainable industries is preventing the state from accelerating its transition to a carbon-neutral economy. Negative impacts of future disruptions will continue to affect the state's diverse and interconnected regions, industries, and communities in unprecedented ways. Recovery efforts have also revealed that not all Californians have had the same opportunities to participate in the state's vibrant economy. Even prior to COVID-19, equal pathways to economic security were a persistent challenge throughout California; a factor being a lack of access to quality jobs in underserved regions. In 2019, 17 percent of workers in the Bay Area earned less than $15 per hour compared to 40 percent of workers in the Fresno metropolitan area2. Unemployment rates across regions can also illustrate the regional inequities preventing many of our communities from benefiting from California's broad economic success. In October of 2020, Marin County had an unemployment rate of 5.4 percent, while Imperial County's was 18.8 percent3. Uneven economic recovery trends further exacerbate income inequality in the state4. Research shows that a child who grows up in the Fresno area in the bottom 20 percent of family income has only a 7.2 percent chance of making it into the top 20 percent as an adult, compared to 1Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC). \"Managing Drought in a Changing Climate.\" https://www.ppic.org/wp-content/uploads/managing-drought-in-a-changing-climate-four- essential-reforms-september-2018.pdf . https://www.labor.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/338/2021/02/ca-future-of-work- report.pdf . 3California https://www.labor.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/338/2021/02/ca-future-of-work- report.pdf . 4Pew Research Center. \"1. and wealth inequality.\" https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth- inequality/ . Page 3412.9 percent for a child in San Jose5. COVID-19 also clarified ethnic disparities in economic opportunity. In 2019, 44 percent of Latino workers earned less than $15 per hour compared to 20 percent of white workers and 32 percent of Black workers6. Working people of color in California are over three times more likely than white workers to live in poverty7. Additionally, in 2019, women made up the majority of the workers in the state earning less than $15 an hour8. These inequities prevent disinvested communities, particularly low-income communities, California Native American Tribes9, and communities of color from participating fully in California's economic, social, and civic life. California has therefore embraced economic equity as a goal for state policy, forging a new social contract for shared prosperity in a rapidly changing global economy. The state is also striving to enhance economic resilience, especially considering the ongoing impacts of the pandemic and climate change, by supporting the development of more inclusive and resilient regional economies that better withstand acute disruptions and prepare for impending transitions. Legislation On September 23, 2021, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill (SB) 162 (Chapter 259, Statutes of 2021)10, which established the Community Economic Resilience Fund (CERF). SB 162 supports regionally centered plans to respond to the diverse needs across our state and to build sustainable and resilient regional economies. Initially, $600 million was appropriated from the 5Public Policy Institute of California. \"Income Inequality and Economic Opportunity in California.\" https://www.ppic.org/wp-content/uploads/incoming-inequality-and-economic- opportunity-in-california-december-2020.pdf . 6California Future report.pdf . 9Native American Policy.\" http://nahc.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Signed-NAHC-Tribal- 10\"Senate Bill No. 162.\" Bill Text - SB-162 Community Economic Resilience Fund Program.

Purpose The purpose of the CERF funding is to build an equitable and sustainable economy across California's diverse regions and foster long-term economic resilience in the overall transition to a carbon-neutral economy. A single roadmap for California's economic future is not the right approach given California's size and complexity. Rather, a regional approach, which will account for dynamics like shifting industries and talent pools, better suits the state. CERF will use a high- road approach to economic development to support the creation of quality jobs and equal access to those jobs. A high-road economy favors businesses that invest in their workforces, pay living wages, and engage in environmentally sustainable business practices. Community- and worker-centered inclusive economic planning has never been attempted at this scale. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that our economy did not work for all, so the same approach to economic planning is not an option. Although this process will be new and challenging, including voices that have been traditionally left out of economic planning is critical to achieving equitable outcomes. Program Structure CERF has been designed in a two-phase grant structure with the intention of creating inclusive planning processes and meaningful ways to engage diverse communities. Phase I planning efforts will inform regional investment opportunities during Phase II of the program. Inclusive engagement across diverse regional stakeholders will be a foundational step in the diversification of California's economies and the creation of high-quality accessible jobs. CERF planning grants will allow for flexible economic analysis at various geographic scales, including economic flows between different regions, and implementation grants will allow for projects that cross regional boundaries. Participants interested in applying for Phase II implementation grants must participate during the planning phase or receive a letter of support from the High Road Transition Collaborative (HRTC) to be eligible for funding. CERF will also align and leverage state investments (e.g., High Road Training Partnerships, infrastructure investments, community capacity-building programs), federal investments (e.g., Economic Development Administration's Build Back Better Regional Challenge,), and philanthropic and private-sector investments to maximize recovery and planning efforts. 11\"Senate Bill No. 115.\" Bill Text - SB 115-Budget 2022. https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB115 361. Phase I: Planning Phase In Phase I,also referred to as the Planning Phase, the CERF program will provide $5 million dollar planning grants toeach region tosupport one High Road Transition Collaborative (HRTC) per region12. Regions were developed to prioritize recovery and transition strategies and to be consistent with existing economic development efforts, as well as other state definitions of regional economic and labor markets. HRTCs will be composed of an administrative Fiscal Agent, a Regional Convener, and a wide range of partners reflecting the diversity of each region. Planning grants will be awarded to one HRTC and be administered jointly by the Fiscal Agent and Regional Convener; the Fiscal Agent will legally and financially represent the HRTC throughout Phase I. The HRTCs will implement transparent and inclusive processes to advance long-term prosperity and equity, work directly with Regional Climate Collaboratives (RCC) Program13where applicable, and include balanced representation from labor, business, community, government, and other stakeholders, including, but not limited to, economic development, philanthropy, education, and workforce partners14. Together, these partners will form their respective regional HRTC to engage in strategic planning for economic resilience and equitable pathways to high road opportunities. HRTCs will work across industries, agencies, and communities to encourage engagement from all stakeholder groups, create inclusive and equitable economic plans, build capacity, break down silos to maximize the effectiveness of planning and implementation projects, and generate systemic changes to advance economic resilience. Planning grants can be used for a wide range of planning activities including capacity-building, community engagement, and research. Plans developed during the Planning Phase will inform projects eligible for funding during the Implementation Phase of the program. Plans will be based on actionable research in partnership and shared decision-making with communities and in consultation with expert institutions, with a focus on the CERF Objectives of equity, sustainability, job quality, economic competitiveness, and resilience. Strategies will complement, incorporate, or expand on existing plans such as Comprehensive Economic Development Strategies (CEDS) as applicable and relevant. 12OPR, LWDA, and GO-Biz. \"Finalized CERF Regions CERF_Final_Regions_FAQ.pdf . 13Leyva. \"Senate SB-1072 Regional Climate Collaborative Program: technical assistance.

Page 372. Phase II: Implementation Phase In Phase II,EDD will fund implementation projects on a rolling basis identified in the planning phase based on criteria such as demonstrated community support, alignment with state climate goals, and demonstration of labor standards and job quality. Implementation Phase solicitation and detailed criteria will be released in Fall 2022. Participants interested in applying for Phase II implementation grants must participate during the planning phase or receive a letter of support from the HRTC to be eligible for funding. 3. CERF Tribal Funding Opportunity The CERF Interagency Leadership Team has allocated $20 million dollars available for California Native American Tribes15out of the $600 million dollars for economic planning and implementation projects. This funding opportunity reserves a portion of CERF funding exclusively for tribal use and is intended to be designed with maximum flexibility to meet the needs of California Native American Tribes in their economic development processes. CERF recognizes the critical role that tribes play in transforming the state's economy and respects the sovereignty of tribal governments and their decision of how they engage with the program. The CERF team is working to ensure funds are accessible and can support tribal-led economic recovery and resilience projects. To allow ample time for outreach and engagement with tribes, and to inform program design and reflect Planning and Implementation Phase criteria, the proposed timeline calls for the release of the Tribal Funding Opportunity solicitation after release of solicitations for both the Planning and Implementation Phases of the CERF program. Tribes interested in applying for the CERF Tribal Funding Opportunity may still also apply for CERF funding through the Planning and Implementation Phases described in this solicitation. Tribes are highly encouraged to participate in the CERF Planning Phase HRTCs and to apply for funding during the Implementation Phase. Tribes are not required to participate in their region's Planning Phase processes to be eligible for Implementation Phase funding. The CERF Tribal Funding Opportunity will be open to California Native American Tribes regardless of their participation in the Planning and Implementation Phases. Additional information and application requirements for the CERF Tribal Funding Opportunity is forthcoming. 15Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC). \"Native American Heritage Commission Tribal Consultation Policy.\" http://nahc.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Signed-NAHC-Tribal- Consultation-Policy.pdf .Page 38B. Availability Each of the CERF Regions outlined in Appendix I will receive one award in the amount of up to $5,000,000 for the Planning Phase. The Period of Performance (POP) for planning projects funded under this SFP will be between 18 to 24 months with an anticipated start date of October 2022. No obligation of funds will be allowed before or beyond the grant POP. Any grant funds not expended during the grant agreement period shall be returned to the state. C. Target Regions and Populations All the CERF Regions will receive funding during the Planning and Implementation Phases. CERF emphasizes inclusive planning to ensure equitable outcomes for each region's disinvested communities. Disinvested communities face many challenges resulting from inequitable land use and zoning policies, exclusionary economic development processes, underinvestment, and a lack of meaningful engagement with community residents in planning and policy decisions. Investments that benefit disinvested communities will be a priority for proposed projects in the Implementation Phase. More details on required project criteria are forthcoming in the Implementation Phase solicitation guideline period. CERF defines 'disinvested communities' as any of the following: Census tracts identified as 'disadvantaged' by the California Environmental Protection Agency16. Census tracts with median household incomes at or below 80 percent of the statewide median income or with the median household incomes at or below the threshold designated as low income by the Department of Housing and Community Development's list of state income limits adopted pursuant to Section 50093 of the California Health and Safety Code. 'High poverty area' and 'High unemployment area' as designated by the California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development California Competes Tax Credit Program17. 16California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). \"CalEnviroScreen.\" https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen . 17GO-Biz. \"California Competes Tax Credit and High Unemployment Areas.\" https://static.business.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/High-PU-Fiscal-Year-2021-2022- P3-List.pdf . Page 39California Native American Tribes as defined by the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) Tribal Consultation Policy18. CERF recognizes that the term \"disinvested\" may overlook the ongoing work in these communities, and particularly the residents for whom these communities are home. In many of these communities, residents and community leaders are actively engaged in local planning, economic development processes, campaigns, and other activities to improve their communities' quality of life. These efforts are extremely important, especially since these communities disproportionately experience the negative impacts of the pandemic and climate change. CERF is structured to ensure these communities enjoy the benefits of investment. CERF also highly encourages HRTCs to work with tribal governments that want to participate in the Planning Phase. HRTCs must respect and uphold sovereign status throughout the development of the HRTCs and other deliverables of the Planning Phase. Proposed Governance Structures19should additionally outline measures that will be taken to protect the confidentiality of Tribal data and Traditional Ecological Knowledge collected or shared as part of the planning process. The CERF team will provide additional guidance on respectful and meaningful collaboration with California Native American Tribes in the post-award phase. D. Eligibility Applications for planning grants must include both an organization that will serve as the Fiscal Agent and an organization that will serve as the Regional Convener. Both organizations will hold equal importance and value throughout the CERF Planning Phase. A single organizationmay serve as both Fiscal Agent and Regional Convener in the case that it meets all desired qualifications. Fiscal Agent:The Fiscal Agent will act as the intermediary in grant management. The Fiscal Agent is a legal entity representing the HRTC and is responsible for submitting the Planning Phase Application Package. The Fiscal Agent must have legal authority, history, and capacityto administer state funds. The Fiscal Agent will represent the HRTC and make disbursements on behalf of the region. Regional Convener:The Regional Convener is the lead organization tasked with organizing an inclusive group of regional stakeholders to form the HRTC and implement the planning grant in its region. The Convener should possess all or most of the following characteristics: 18Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC). \"Native Consultation Policy.\" http://nahc.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Signed-NAHC-Tribal- Consultation-Policy.pdf . 19SeeSection C. Collective Partnership Agreement LetterinSection IV. Application Package Requirements and Submissionfor more information on the Proposed Governance StructurePage 40A proven track record of coordinating across sectors. Strong knowledge of the CERF Region and its economic needs, challenges, and opportunities across sectors. The ability to lead diverse stakeholders to successful action with a proven history of successful organizing in the designated CERF Region. Proven relationships and credibility with labor organizations; employers, businesses, and business associations; grassroots and community-based organizations, community organizers, and community members; government agencies; economic development agencies; philanthropic organizations; education entities15; environmental justice organizations; worker centers; disinvested communities ; California Native American Tribes (if applicable); and other regional stakeholders capable of contributing to the success of the project. Demonstrated commitment to advance equity outcomes in the region. Familiarity with grantmaking and knowledge of philanthropic ecosystems. Types of entities that are eligible to serve in the Fiscal Agent and/or Regional Convener role include, but are not limited to: Non-profit organizations and foundations. Community-based organizations. District organizations of an EDA-designated Economic Development District. Institutions of higher education or consortium of institutions of higher education California Native American Tribes or a consortium of California Native American Tribes. Local governments, Special Districts, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO), etc., may apply if they meet desired qualifications and if 80 percent of jurisdiction boundaries overlap with the CERF region. For-profit entities are not eligible to serve in the Fiscal Agent or Regional Convener role but can be subcontracted to provide research or other services. See Appendix C: \"Fiscal Agent and Regional Convener Responsibilities\" for more details on Convener and Fiscal Agent roles and responsibilities, as well as required evidence of a partnership between the two parties where applicable. E. Collaboration with the Interagency Leadership Team The success of the CERF program will require the interagency team comprised of the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA), the Office of Planning and Research (OPR), and the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz) to collaborate on a wide range of activities related to the management, design, oversight, and administration of the program. Throughout the life of the program, the interagency team will participate in regularly scheduled reporting meetings to discuss stakeholder input, agendas, policyPage 41recommendations and program guidelines. Each agency is tasked with a different responsibility ranging from grant administration, program design, and technical assistance. Below are brief descriptions of the responsibilities of each agency: Employment Development Department (EDD):EDD's Workforce Services Branch shall be responsible for the management and execution of all grants and contracts including the administration of and accountability for both the planning and implementation grants. The Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR):OPR will manage the design and operations of the program in addition to providing technical assistance to support and guide processes and deliverables for Phase I. The Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz):GO-Biz will support with outreach, technical assistance, and capacity building. Collaboration across regions will be required to create collectively a more resilient statewide economy that brings equal opportunities to every region. Awardees will be required to participate in Communities of Practice meetings. These convenings will ensure progress, share best practices and lessons learned across the regions, and provide technical assistance by the state. F. Collaboration with the Evaluation Team An independent team will conduct a developmental evaluation to explore the success of the CERF program and the HRTCs. Awardees must collaborate with and be responsive to the process evaluation team. This includes providing information to the evaluators, allowing the evaluators to join meetings or sessions for information gathering purposes, and joining partnership sessions for planning, discussion, or technical assistance. II. Post-Award Program Requirements and Deliverables A. Planning Phase (Phase I) Requirements Overview The Planning Phase requirements involve building inclusive planning tables, which will result in developing 1) High Road Transition Collaboratives, and 2) Regional Plans. Inclusive Table-Building The awardees must employ inclusive table-building strategies during the Planning Phase. These strategies will help the Collaborative ensure that it is accountable, addresses the needs of disinvested communities, represents the diversity of the region, and transparently oversees the facilitation of the planning process. Page 42Awardees will conduct a detailed stakeholder mapping analysis (see the Regional Plans section) to create a profile of the diverse stakeholders in the CERF Region and design their planning tables accordingly. To ensure buy-in to the region's vision for CERF, awardees must use inclusive table-building strategies during Application Package development (e.g., Collective Partnership Agreement Letter, Outreach and Engagement Plan, etc.), and throughout the planning process. These strategies must consider the strength and diversity of the Collaborative's partnerships, ongoing regional processes, and a Collaborative Governance Structure. Strength and Diversity of Collaborative Partnerships The HRTC needs to be representative of the diversity of each region. The HRTC partnerships should account for diversity across sectors, subject matter expertise, lived experience, and inter-generational perspectives to serve the CERF Region effectively. Ongoing Regional Processes The Fiscal Agent and/or Regional Convener must identify other ongoing planning processes or projects across the CERF Region to ensure the alignment between these processes and CERF and to ensure a coordinated response to reaching the state's goals. Examples of such efforts include: CEDS, climate plans, High Road Training Partnerships, General Plans, Regional Transportation Plans, and other community-led initiatives. Collaborative Governance Structure The Collaborative Governance Structure will play a key role in supporting HRTCs to build robust governance processes, align with economic planning and other ongoing processes, and overcome challenges inherent in shared decision-making. The Collaborative Governance Structure must illustrate transparent decision-making processes that not only center disinvested communities and impacted workers, but actively shift decision-making power to those groups. The Collaborative Governance Structure must also reflect that no individual member of the HRTC governance committee has more decision-making power than the other. The Collaborative Governance Structure will represent entities that are traditionally involved in economic development, as well as entities and communities that have historically been excluded from economic development processes to collectively develop a vision that will serve the CERF Region. The Regional Convener must ensure that the HRTC includes balanced representation from: Labor organizations. Employers, businesses, and business associations. Grassroots and community-based organizations, community organizers, and community members. Government agencies. Economic development agencies.Page 43Philanthropic organizations. Education and training providers. Workforce entities20. Environmental justice organizations. Worker centers. Disinvested communities. California Native American Tribes. Other regional stakeholders capable of contributing to the success of the project. If the HRTC does not include representation from any of the entities listed above, the Proposed Governance Structure must include a thorough explanation of the decision or circumstances. The state may reach out to various stakeholders in each CERF Region as part of its work on reviewing inclusive table-building processes. The following sections describe the deliverables awardees will produce during the POP. B. High Road Transition Collaboratives: Collaboratives will provide information about the formal and informal partnerships and coalitions they have developed and discuss how they did so. Formal partnerships are legally bound (e.g., through MOUs, contracts, etc.). The informal partnerships are not legally bound but have the potential to lead to formal partnerships in the near future. The reports must include the following: Governance Structure:Lay out the governance structure and explain whether and how the structure evolved over time to respond to the region's needs. If the structure has evolved, explain why. Outreach and Engagement Plan:Summarize the engagement plan and explain whether it has evolved over time. If the plan has evolved, explain how and why. Partnerships:Discuss the formal and informal partnerships and coalitions that are built throughout the process. Provide details such as: The coalitions and partnerships developed. Provide the name of the organizations and parties involved. The number of MOUs or other formal agreements (e.g., collective partnership agreements, data sharing agreements) created. The potential to develop formal partnerships in the future. 20Entities listed up until this point are as specified in SB-162 Community Economic Resilience Fund Program Section 14531. (c) (4).Page 44The strategies for keeping these coalitions active to ensure long-term and sustainable economic development and recovery. Note that after plans are developed and adopted, GO-Biz plans to work with conveners to ensure they are accepted as regional CEDS and will work to establish Economic Development Districts in regions without an existing organization. Inclusivity:Discuss how these partnerships and coalitions advance the goals of responding to the needs of diverse stakeholders and especially disinvested communities. C. Regional Plans Collaboratives will develop a regional economic recovery and transition plan that addresses essential elements of a High Road strategy. The plan will be co-developed with diverse stakeholders throughout the process, from visioning to analysis, and to strategy and roadmap creation. Analyses and plans must account for sub-regional and inter-regional dynamics. The plans must also build on existing regional and/or subregional economic development plans and strategies as appropriate. The Regional Plan includes two parts. Part 1 presents a snapshot of socio-economic conditions in the region: mapping stakeholders, providing a regional summary, and conducting analyses. Part 2 establishes a forward-looking economic development and transition roadmap using the information obtained in Part 1. HRTCs will develop a series of investment strategies that will be informed by the forward-looking economic transition roadmap. The state understands that awardees may need to apply an iterative process as they develop their plans and collaboratives. For example, awardees may need to modify their goals and plans based on their analysis and findings. Each of the following analyses and the roadmap must address the CERF Objectives: Equity:Analyses must consider the needs and the interest of diverse communities across the region, with an explicit intention to include populations historically excluded from planning and economic development processes, especially disinvested communities. Sustainability:Analyses must focus on economic development that is self-sustaining and aims at a carbon-neutral, climate-resilient economy addressing the needs of the region's communities. Job quality and access:Analyses must prioritize jobs that provide a family-sustaining wage, health benefits, a pension, worker advancement opportunities, a safety net, and collective worker input. These jobs are stable, with predictable schedules, and safe working conditions. Economic competitiveness and resilience:Analyses must focus on strategies to avoid, withstand, and recover from economic shocks so that the CERF Region can compete effectively in the global economy and deliver prosperity to communities in the region.Page 45Regional Plan: Part 1 The first part of the regional plan presents a baseline of the region. It considers the region's stakeholders, assesses the factors affecting the region's economic, environmental, and health conditions, and conducts detailed economic and workforce analyses. The intention is to ensure that the plans take a full account of the factors shaping economic development in the region before developing strategies for recovery and transition. Conduct the following analyses. In each section, summarize findings and explain how these findings inform the planning process and how they correspond with the Collaborative's goals. 1. Stakeholder Mapping A snapshot of the historically active stakeholders that can influence creating a High Road economy in the CERF Region and/or benefit from it. Provide the list of organizations and entities and discuss their potential role in developing the plan and engaging in the Implementation Phase. These stakeholders may include but are not limited to employers, businesses, community-based organizations, community members and residents, government and economic development agencies, labor organizations, philanthropic organizations, academic institutions, education and training providers, workforce entities, and industries. Overview of the state of disinvested communities in the region. Discuss how and in which areas these communities face economic barriers. Include a snapshot of the plan to outreach to organizations that represent these communities and how the HRTC intends to ensure their active participation. Create and show a network of existing partners and their existing regional and subregional plans, strategies, and related reports to demonstrate synergies, potentials, and challenges. Clarify opportunities for collaborations and partnerships. 2. Regional Summary A summary background of the demographic and socio-economic conditions of the region, highlighting areas with low and high economic diversification and resiliency, as well as any industry trends that impact the regional economy. The regional summary must identify regional inequities, such as economic, health, and environmental inequities, currently facing communities in the region. The regional summary must include the following analysis and discussion: i. Economy and Economic Development Identify economic development opportunities and forces in the region. Review inequities in economic development across the region. Identify major low- and high- wage industries and occupations in the region.Page 46Explore economic well-being and cost of living across the region. Economic Shocks: Discuss the impacts caused by economic shocks (e.g., pandemics, natural disasters) or longer-term economic shifts (e.g.., global market signals, automation, policy levers) in the region. These include economic harm to communities (i.e., workers, small businesses, impacted industries, the public sector, and selected regions and populations) as well as the potential for new economic development opportunities. ii. Climate and Environmental Impact: Identify anticipated climate impacts and the factors that increase the region's vulnerability to those impacts Identify short term and long-term impacts of climate change on the people and economy of the region. These include disproportionate impacts on disinvested communities and expected increases in occupational hazards for workers. Identify major sources of air pollution, water pollution, toxic and hazardous waste and their impacts on diverse communities, especially disinvested communities. Identify major sources of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and their impacts on diverse communities, especially disinvested communities. Assess impacts of climate change on targeted emerging industries, sectors, or clusters and how these impacts might hinder success of the proposed plans and transition strategies (e.g., damage to critical infrastructure, loss of productivity, loss of population). iii. Public Health Analysis: Provide a snapshot of the impacts of the current economic trends and climate change effects on public health, especially the impacts on disinvested communities. Explore the main causes of chronic illnesses and diseases in the region, and whether and how they are related to economic inequalities, climate impacts, environmental factors, etc. Analyze health disparities across the region, disaggregated by race, gender, and other demographics. 3. Labor Market Analysis A snapshot of labor and workforce dynamics in the region, including an overview of major employers, occupations, and wages, the impacts of the recent trends, changes, and forces on the labor market, and projected labor trends in existing key industries. The analysis must also identify the following: Industry-specific labor standards that meet high-road priorities. Barriers that limit access to high-quality jobs. Relevant training programs, apprenticeships, or high road training partnerships in the region.Page 474. Industry Cluster Analysis: A snapshot of current major industries as well as industry trends and projections. The analysis must also: Include an in-depth analysis of potential growth clusters based on the region's comparative advantages, market trends, workforce, infrastructure assets, policy trends, aligned state/federal investments, supply chain, and innovation ecosystem. Identify major sources of GHG emissions, air and water pollution, and toxic or hazardous waste from existing or proposed clusters. Conduct measurements of potential for job growth within industries. Identify workers and sectors at risk of displacement due to identified trends and analyses. 5. SWOT Analysis An in-depth analysis of regional Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (i.e., SWOT), especially as it relates to equitable economic resilience and growth of sustainable industry clusters. The SWOT analysis will draw from data and components through conducting the above analyses. Regional Plan: Part 2 HRTCs will also be required to develop a holistic economic development and transition roadmap with strategies that prioritize the creation of high-quality jobs, equitable access to jobs and resources, and emphasizes developing sustainable and resilient economies and industries. These industries include but are not limited to renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon removal, zero-emission vehicles, advanced manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, artificial intelligence, and climate restoration and resilience. The roadmap and strategies must refer to the findings of the analyses in Part 1. The roadmap must include: 1. Vision and Goals Develop a vision and specific regional goals for creating a High Road economy that is sustainable, inclusive, and equitable. 2. Strategies for the growth of targeted industries: i. Industrial Cluster Development: This section will provide a snapshot of current trends and projected growth. It will consider, but is not bound by, existing relevant plans such as CEDS (if applicable and appropriate) along with the following elements that work together to support creation of quality jobs: Clear Local Market Signals: Assess how proposed industries and affiliated investments align with market trends and local/state/federal policies. Page 48Value Chain and Infrastructure: Explain how investments support the growth and clustering of businesses in the value chain of the proposed industry. Identify specific infrastructure required to grow the industry. Innovation Ecosystem: Describe how investments connect the private sector to local innovation resources, facilitate the movement of new technologies to market, incubate early-stage businesses, etc. ii. Workforce Development: Explain how the industrial strategy plans to match skills to available jobs, address talent and recruitment, and facilitate strategic collaboration among businesses, training and education institutions, labor, etc. 3. Strategies for increasing economic diversification Strategies must focus on economic diversification in at-risk locations (i.e., considering the impacts of economic disrupters such as climate change on the local workforce and economy). Investments must clearly address barriers to attraction and retention of businesses, as well as barriers to quality job access for disinvested communities. 4. Strategies for responding effectively to economic shocks. These include the following: Protecting diverse communities, especially disinvested communities. Using economic shocks and disasters as opportunities for growth. 5. Strategies for increasing economic equity. These strategies must refer to the analyses of workforce and demographic trends, and focus on closing gaps, reaching universal levels of service, or disaggregating results by race, ethnicity, income, etc. Strategies must create and sustain pathways into quality jobs and family-sustaining careers and improve job quality and wages in sectors that do not offer quality jobs. Analysis and recommendations must highlight how they propose to serve historically marginalized and disinvested groups and how those groups will learn about proposed interventions. Strategies must support workers potentially impacted by at-risk industries and must prevent displacement of incumbent workers or replacement of high-road jobs with low-quality jobs. 6. Strategies for increasing health and environmental equity. These strategies must include limiting the impacts of economic development activities on the natural environment. They must also avoid exacerbating the effects of climate change and include pathways for mitigating the effects of anticipated climate impacts on targeted industries and occupations. They must also address public health needs, with special attention to the needs of disinvested communities.Page 497. Strategies for aligning with State strategies. An assessment of how regional economic development strategies (i.e., planning priorities, grant programs, and regulations) can align with, support, and be supported by existing state strategies in areas like clean energy, air pollution reduction, transportation decarbonization, climate adaptation, sustainable water management, and natural and working lands. Strategic Investments and Projects The Collaboratives will also identify 2-5 strategic investments or projects to enact recovery and transition to be funded in Phase II (Implementation) that meet the following criteria, which are currently presented at a high-level. Clarify Investments or Project Goals in Detail: Proposed projects must layout goals and success points in detail and provide threshold(s), benchmark(s), or target(s) for measuring or tracking success. Projects must provide the methodology for tracking or measuring the defined threshold(s), benchmark(s), or target(s). 1. Demonstrate Proposed Impacts to Communities/Industries: Proposed investments must mitigate economic harm to workers, households, small businesses, impacted industries, and the public sector, and especially disinvested communities. 2. Demonstrate Project Feasibility, Commitments, and Community Support: Proposed projects must demonstrate support from the HRTC. Projects should show support from various stakeholders (e.g. community-based organizations, governmental, non-governmental entities, tribal entities, businesses, industries). Letters of support, meeting minutes, MOUs, court hearing minutes, or other documentation may demonstrate support. 3. Promote State Climate Goals: Investment projects lead to the development of low-carbon or regenerative industries. Investments that support economic diversification are designed to minimize GHG emissions and/or water or energy usage. 4. Support Labor Standards and Job Quality: Projects must include labor standards where applicable such as prevailing wage, project labor agreements, or community workforce agreements. Page 50Projects need to create high-quality jobs21that bring sustainable income to the regions. Projects must define a plan with goals, targets, strategies, and activities to recruit, train, re-train, and support workers from disinvested communities. 5. Demonstrate Clear Role in Regional Strategy: Industrial development should consider existing CEDS along with the following elements that work together to support the creation of quality jobs: i. Clear Local Market Signals: Explain how investments align with market trends: Value Chain and Infrastructure: Describe how investments support the growth and clustering of businesses in the value chain. Identify specific infrastructure required to grow the industry. Innovation Ecosystem: Describe how investments connect the private sector to local innovation resources, facilitate the movement of new technologies to market, incubate early-stage businesses, etc. ii. Workforce Development: Explain how the industrial strategy plans to match skills to available jobs, address talent and recruitment, and facilitate strategic collaboration among businesses, training and education institutions, labor, etc. iii. Economic Diversification: Describe how strategies will address specific barriers to attraction and retention of businesses, as well as barriers to access for disinvested communities. iv. Complement Existing Funding: If state or federal funding is available elsewhere for a proposed project (e.g., broadband), Collaboratives must improve equity outcomes, which include but are not limited to job access for those in disinvested communities, income inequality, income growth, business ownership, business revenue, job and wage growth, among others. v. Achieve Timely Implementation: Funds must be encumbered by October 2026. Examples of projects include, but are not limited to, the following: Technical assistance, counseling, or other services to assist with small business planning needs. Programs that support economic diversification and the development of sustainable industries. Entrepreneurship and commercialization programs. 21SeeAppendix B: Glossary of Termsfor a definition of high-quality jobsPage 51Programs to connect small and minority-owned businesses to industrial hubs and research institutions.

We had contemplated whether 7334, 7335 made sense but it seemed those job classes were focused on larger scale equipment and given the OEM needs for the security system, we felt it wouldn't be able to fall to civil service. If you feel otherwise, we arene to add those job classes but it would be great if we could get some language to include around what SOW will stay with civil service. Thank you.

Scope of Work/Services to be Contracted Out: The contractors(s) will provide access to a variety of online applicaons such as Health Informaon Exchanges which collect, store, benchmark clinical outcomes, share data between providers, and provide online educaonal and or reference resources to the Department of Public Health. B. Explain why this service is necessary and the consequence of denial: In order to provide eecve health care services to paents and clients of the Department there is an ever- present need to subscribe, procure, or collaborate and share data with other health care providers by using online applicaons or informaon exchanges. In addion, many resources which were previously procured through commodies such as books or stand-alone DVDs and CD-ROMs have moved to online Soware as a Service (SaaS) models of delivery. The transion to an SaaS model has also moved the procurement vehicle used by the City from a tradional commodity Purchase Order (PO) to a formal contract. Denial of this request will result in the Department being unable to parcipate in Health Informaon Exchanges, which will result in a lack of visibility when providing health care services to paents, and which will in turn result in substandard paent care. C. Has this service been provided in the past? If so, how? If the service was provided under a previous PSC, aach copy of the most recently approved PSC. Services have been provided in the past through earlier PSC request. See 41289 - 16/17 D. Will the contract(s) be renewed? Yes, if there is a connued need. E. If this is a request for a new PSC in excess ofve years, or if your request is to extend (modify) an exisng PSC by anotherve years, please explain why: The requested approval is in excess ofve years because the Department will have an ongoing need to access and ulize informaon in these applicaons. Typically, these applicaons contain data that is either proprietary to the vendor, or in the case of a Health Informaon Exchange or clinical data sharing applicaon, data that is collected by a vendor and shared among all parcipang users of a given applicaon. Hence, no one user of a shared applicaon could recreate the full funconality aorded to all the users of a system if they were to develop there own standalone applicaon. Therefore, the Department forecasts a connuing need to access such applicaons for a period of longer thanve years. 2.Reason(s) for the Request A. Display all that apply Page 107Services that require resources that the City lacks (e.g., oce space, facilies or equipment with an operator). Explain the qualifying circumstances: Proprietary soware and naonal access to paent data and best pracces is needed in order to obtain the needed services for access to Health Informaon Exchanges and online educaonal/reference resources, which are not available through the City/civil service due to the proprietary nature of the informaon systems and the specic knowledge required to bring this new technology to full producon status in the DPH environment. B. Reason for the request for modicaon: This modicaon extends the term of the PSC and increases the amount of the approved PSC in order to access addional online informaon plaorms for clinical informaon tools for pharmacy and nursing. 3.Descripon of Required Skills/Experse A. Specify required skills and/or experse: Contractors must have a commercially available applicaon(s) in a variety of healthcare focus areas. Applicaons may range from in-producon Healthcare Informaon Exchanges which compile paent data from other healthcare providers throughout the country, current and updated resource material available through online portals, compiled and curated data from various healthcare providers used for paent outcomes and benchmarking or best pracces processes, to online reference materials used in treatment plans or to establish baseline pharmaceucal formularies and/or listed benets and adverse reacons or drug interacons of specic drugs.

The Contractor will provide the proprietary soware over a SaaS (Soware as a Service) model over the internet as well as the proprietary soware and required hardware for remote data processing services. 4.If applicable, what eorts has the department made to obtain these services through available resourceswithin the City? Not Applicable 5.Why Civil Service Employees Cannot Perform the Services to be Contracted Out A. Explain why civil service classes are not applicable. Civil service classes are not applicable due to the proprietary nature of the informaon systems and the specic knowledge required to bring this new technology to full producon status in the DPH environment. It is also necessary to augment exisng DPH informaon systems posions with contractual support services to complete the healthcare business project deliverables, due to DPH's specic customizaon needs. Civil service stawill work with the Contractor in order to obtain the necessary knowledge for the day-to-day maintenance of the applicaon. B. If there is no civil service class that could perform the work, would it be praccal and/or feasible to adopt a new civil service class to perform this work? Explain: No, it is not praccal to adopt a new civil service class because the new class would need to develop the relevant applicaon, gather all of the resources and or data to populate the applicaon, and most importantly in the case of a Health Informaon Exchange, the new class would need to establish ongoing relaonships with the various health care providers which Page 108would need to be willing to share their health informaon with the developer of the applicaon and in turn manage the informaon exchange on a naonal or regional level. 6.Addional Informaon A. Will the contractor directly supervise City and County employee? If so, please include an explanaon. No. B.

Scope of Work/Services to be Contracted Out: Emergency Fireghng Water System (EFWS), historically referred to as the Auxiliary Water Supply System (AWSS), is an independent high pressure water supply system dedicated tore protecon. It was installed in 1913 in response to the Great Earthquake and Fire of 1906 and consists of a 135-mile-long pipeline network, a high elevaon reservoir with two large capacity tanks, two pumping staons, threereboats and underground water storage tanks (cisterns). The selected Consultant will work under the direcon of the SFPUC to provide planning and engineering design services for the EFWS and City's Water Distribuon System pipelines. Some assignments may require SFPUC engineering stato be integrated into the consultant project team. The Consultant's work objecve will be to perform planning and engineering design services applying all applicable codes and SFPUC Procedures and regulatory requirements/guidelines administered by the State Water Resources Control Board, Division of Drinking Water. Projects are expected to pertain to pipelines, pump staons andreboat manifold systems. B. Explain why this service is necessary and the consequence of denial: The Emergency Fireghng Water System (EFWS) has unique capabilies, including the ability to deliver water at extremely high pressures and to use water from the Bay to balere. The EFWS is used as the secondary defense against largeres, specically those that could occur aer a large earthquake when the domesc water system may be impacted. If the City's domesc water system is damaged because of an earthquake - as it previously has been - sucient water from the domesc water system will not be available to suppressres. The EFWS will serve as the alternave water source and will be vital to exnguishing largeres, thus saving lives and protecng against the loss of buildings and homes aer a large earthquake or other disaster. C. Has this service been provided in the past? If so, how? If the service was provided under a previous PSC, aach copy of the most recently approved PSC. Similar specializedreow hydraulic modeling and seismic planning services to address delivery of the AWSS were performed under PSC 4114 10/ 11 for Contract CS199, Planning Support Services for Auxiliary Water Supply System. D. Will the contract(s) be renewed? No Page 123E. If this is a request for a new PSC in excess ofve years, or if your request is to extend (modify) an exisng PSC by anotherve years, please explain why. The duraon of the projects from planning, design, engineering services during construcon, and project closeout will take approximately 8 years, due to complexity of the planning, design and construcon support given the various exisng underground ulies that will need to be relocated and the major construcon impacts along the streets of San Francisco. 2.Reason(s) for the Request A. Indicate all that apply (be specic and aach any relevant supporng documents): Immediately needed services to address unancipated or transional situaons, or services needed to address emergency situaons. Short-term or capital projects requiring diverse skills, experse and/or knowledge. Services required on an as-needed, intermient, or periodic basis (e.g., peaks in workload). Services that require resources that the City lacks (e.g., oce space, facilies or equipment with an operator). Cases where future funding is so uncertain that the establishment of new civil service posions, classes or programs is not feasible (including situaons where there is grant funding). B. Explain the qualifying circumstances: This project requires specialized skills, experse and knowledge to complete the work. The SFPUC will provide project engineer(s) to lead, coordinate and oversee consulng engineers. In addion, the SFPUC project engineer(s) will ensure the project meets SFPUC-Infrastructure standards and procedures. 3.Descripon of Required Skills/Experse A. Specify required skills and/or experse: The Consultant will be asked to provide supplemental geotechnical informaon, perform condion assessment tasks, prepare operaons and maintenance plans, or develop designs for porons of the EFWS and City's Water Distribuon System.

Which, if any, civil service class(es) normally perform(s) this work? 5241, Engineer; C. Will contractor provide facilies and/or equipment not currently possessed by the City? If so, explain: Yes, drilling and other equipment for geotechnical/hazardous material invesgaon and pipeline condion assessments that will be required. 4.If applicable, what eorts has the department made to obtain these services through available resourceswithin the City? SFPUC has reviewed the stang plan and conrmed that such experse is not available within current City resources for the trenchless installaons,reow hydraulic modeling, seismic, and geotechnical services. All related services that City can provide such as project engineering eorts, coordinaon with ulity conicts, environmental approval work, pump staon, water distribuon pipeline design will be performed by City resources, in collaboraon with the selected consultant team. Page 1245.Why Civil Service Employees Cannot Perform the Services to be Contracted Out A. Explain why civil service classes are not applicable. Typically, the design of large diameter pipelines, earthquake resistant ducle iron pipes, and trenchless installaons in seismically acve areas requires extensive specialized engineering support services (e.g., geotechnical, ulity engineering and potholing, and pipelinenite element modeling in seismic hazard zones). These projects will be led by City staand consultant stasupport as needed. Depending on available funding, porons of the work can be intermient and of a short-term duraon and/or these engineering services will be ulized as needed during peak workloads. B. If there is no civil service class that could perform the work, would it be praccal and/or feasible to adopt a new civil service class to perform this work? Explain. No, there is insucient connuous, long- term workload to support the stang of these types of specialized trenchless installaons,reow hydraulic modeling, seismic, and geotechnical services. 6.Addional Informaon A.

Explain why this service is necessary and the consequence of denial: The Employment Training Panel (ETP) strongly recommended that the Department seek assistance from a contractor with previous experience reporng on ETP acvies due to the complex and laborious nature of the paperwork and the intricacies of the reporng system. Though the prior contractor performed the work exceponally, OEWD is in the process of rebidding these services to ensure that the City is paying a fair and current price for the services. If the request to contract out is not approved, OEWD may not be able to secure the full reimbursement amount set aside as each request must be submied with extensively documented post-training work hours from parcipants. Addionally, OEWD would like to use the consultant to review other currently oered training programs to assist with determining if it's appropriate to apply for ETP grants to diversify the funding streams on locally resourced programs.
