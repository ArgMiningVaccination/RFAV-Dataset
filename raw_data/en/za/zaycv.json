So, since you are ready to embrace Ayurveda, you need to know about these skin care factors. Read on and start taking the Ayurvedic way. Understanding different skin types as per Ayurveda Image Source: Photo by KamranAydinov: Freepik [Ayurveda](https://zanducare.com/blogs/exploring-ayurveda/significance-of-ayurveda-during-holi) believes that the human body is composed of three main doshas: kapha, pitta, and vata. The balance of these doshas at any point in time can determine each biological function of the human body, along with the Ayurvedic skin types. The balance of vata, kapha, and pitta doshas is different for different individuals, which gives them a separate skin type. Ayurvedic treatments for skin are basically focused on determining the dosha type and recommending the treatment plan that suits the dosha type the best. Ayurvedic experts also try to decipher a person's doshas to understand their skin problems. Here is how different doshas impact the skin in separate ways: Vata skin type - When you have vata skin, it is going to seem dry and rough and need ample moisturizing. The kind of moisturizers that have a bit of oil present in them work the best for this type of skin. Many experts suggest using Ashwagandha supplements or [Ashwagandha](https://zanducare.com/collections/ashwagandha/products/zandu-asvagandha-60-capsules-pack-of-2) [improve skin brightness](https://zanducare.com/products/zandu-kumkumadi-taila-30ml). Pitta skin type - This skin type is the exact opposite of a vata skin type. So, when pitta becomes the dominant dosha, the skin of the person seems greasy. They are much more susceptible to developing a wide range of skin problems, allergies, and acne. Pitta skin type needs the cooling effect of Aloe Vera, sandalwood, and the likes. Kapha skin type - Kapha skin types are a lot similar to the pitta skin type. Since this dosha leads to an oily skin, it makes the skin prone to pimples, acne, and several other skin problems. It is a skin type that benefits immensely from exfoliation. Now that you know the dosha skin types, let's help you understand things better by explaining the popular terms used for the skin types: Dry skin This skin type tends to generate less [sebum](https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-sebum-1069375) compared to a normal skin. It does not have the lipids necessary to hold moisture in and offer a protective cover against most external influences. It mostly happens because of a lack of sebum that disrupts the function of the skin barrier. Normal skin Normal skin is the skin type that's well-balanced. The ones with this particular skin type have oily T-zone and that includes the chin, nose, and forehead. Even then, skin moisture and sebum stay in perfect equilibrium. So, the skin will not feel too greasy or dry in these circumstances. Oily skin Oily is the term used to describe the skin type that produces excess sebum. Also, oily skin is usually accompanied by visible, larger pores that tend to shine brighter. Oily skin is usually bothered by acne, whiteheads, and blackheads. Mild acne is usually found on the face, chest, shoulders, and throat. Combination skin Combination skin types have different cheek and T-zone features, which range from a majorly enlarged area to a highly narrow zone. Also, overproduction of sebum triggers the oilier areas of this skin type. A lipid deficit and inadequate sebums might make parts of a combination skin drier.
