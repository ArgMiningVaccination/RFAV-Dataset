SafeWork NSW has [COVID-19 guidance for employers](https://www.safework.nsw.gov.au/resource-library/COVID-19-Coronavirus). This page has been prepared to assist businesses and is not a substitute for legal advice. Keeping your business safe Businesses are required to keep their premises safe and minimise the risk of infection and transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace. Employers should continually assess the health and safety risks to their employees in their particular industry, and can use the [Safety Plan Checklist ](https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/business/safety-plans/checklist)if needed. Asking employees about proof of vaccination - Employers can generally ask their employees to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination or evidence of a medical contraindication to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine if collecting such information is reasonably necessary for managing work, health and safety risks. - Such information is \"health information\" or \"sensitive information\" under the various privacy laws that may apply to employers, so should be stored in a secure manner, not kept for longer than necessary and only used for the purpose(s) for which it was collected. Read more about [proof of vaccination](https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/vaccination/proof) and find out about [vaccination requirements for workers](https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/vaccination/requirements-for-workers). Refusing unvaccinated people entry - Businesses may choose to refuse entry to unvaccinated people as long as they comply with their obligations under anti-discrimination and privacy laws. - Businesses should not refuse entry to people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. - When asking to see proof of vaccination, businesses should generally inform people why they are asking for the information (i.e. to manage work health and safety risks). - If any business records are kept that identify people's vaccination status, businesses must ensure the information is stored in a secure manner, not kept for longer than necessary and only used for the purpose for which it was collected.
