Waage's perspective seems to represent a view that is fairly widespread among educated and well-intentioned people. We hope that we can contribute to a more accurate view of the political implications of anthroposophy by correcting several of the misconceptions exemplified by Waage's reply. Oxford Handbook of Environmental Ethics, ed. Stephen Gardiner & Allen Thompson Local Natures, Global Resposibilities. Anthropocentrism and the Environment Humans and our ethical principles make us brilliant being compare to other realities, and this centrality of humans in the created cosmos is the very essence of anthropocentrism. Only humans have personalities, emotions and can communicate on a high level who are not controlled by instincts (Mikl\u00f3s, 2014). Our rationality enabled us to know what is right or wrong and made us greater over other existence. It is an undeniable fact that the capacity of humans made us flourished in the area of medicine and technology. The developments and discoveries in Science, which contributed to the body of knowledge, are all product of the rationality of humans. Anthropocentrism came from the Greek word, \"Anthropos\" that means \"human\", highlighting the centrality of human in the created cosmos originated in Western philosophy and religion. However, this claim of centrality destroys the social dependency of all existence and imbibes the supremacy one entity. Our inevitability to be connected with other realities seems now to be non-existent, thus, giving more value on humans. The creation of pyramidal structure among existent beings and putting humans on the top of it is a great perplexity. Our claim of being at the top of hierarchy of species led to the destruction of all those that are below us, an inevitable result of our egoistic claim. This taxonomic or biological privilege is used as an ideology, which supports the domination of nature. In the modern period, the humanistic view that human being is the center of all things enters the picture. In fact, this period is characterized as anthropocentric because it is the human who is the source of truth and not mythologies or religion or the Bible. The rise of rationalism considering humans as greater entities because of their rational faculty is the prevailing philosophy. In addition, the rise of scientific discoveries fuels the claim that human and the power of mind can define anything. There is a great detachment from the belief with gods and nature, from religion and just focuses on humans as the prime center. The dilemma is, if the measure of all things is human and his rational capacity, how about the other beings which do not have this faculty? Thus, anthropocentrism is an exclusionary view system whether or not it linked to any specific ideologies (Mikl\u00f3s, 2014). Furthermore, anthropocentrism intrinsically value humanity but intrinsically value nonhumanity [nature] (Burchett, 2018). This leads to the pure socioeconomic intention of looking at the nature as an instrument for monetary gain. This objectification of the earth is an ecological predicament caused by selfishness of people. This does not give an avenue of concern but purely economical intention. In addition, the rise of capitalism as a social system gave license to those who simply made profit from the nature. The technological prowess of human societies has enabled [us] to rapidly extract and exchange vast amounts of natural resources with one another in a feverish, never-ending stream (Varner, 2006). Social ecologists argues that the exploitation of nature just for self-interest is denial of inherent value of the nature. Our existential claim over the nature resulted not only its destruction but also extinction of other species and global climate change. \"God said. 'Let's make man in our image, after our likeness.' Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. God created man in his own image\" (Gen 1:26). This Bible passages elevates the role of human creating a hierarchy among creations. It highlights dominance and Godlike of human. Furthermore, this is a classical way of justifying the superiority of everything including animals, plants and the nature at large. The words \"dominion\" and \"subdue\" is a hermeneutical display of the positioning of human on the top of the levels of creation. Actually, man was even responsible of the naming of animals and plants (Gen. 2:20). Thus, the authority was vested to human uplifting him from brute animals and plants. This classical claim of Journal of The History of The Behavioral Sciences 1983 The Trumpeter 2017 The concept 'human' has to be more-than-humanized, a project Abram initiated but left incomplete in his study of language. Doing so is a powerful antidote to some of the more anthropocentric consequences of Anthropocenic thinking. Crucial to this project is uncovering the ways in which human agency is permeated by and circulates within vast causal relationships. Shifting from ecologically destructive patterns suggests completing this phenomenological project by uncovering the sense that the 'human' is in no simple sense, 'steering this vessel.' Not even the pervasive and perpetual arrogance about our own powers is incontrovertibly 'our own.' Humility and awe before these wild and undomesticatable processes cycling through us and carrying us in their currents can correct hubristic assumptions about our power for good or evil, and thereby also perhaps these destructive patterns. Due to the manifold ecological problems associated with exponentially growing human populations and their collective interactions with Earth's various ecosystems, many environmentalists have lamented that nature is being destroyed by humanity. The theoretical framework which presumably accounts for our species' destructiveness is pejoratively referred to as anthropocentrism, the view that humans are the sole bearers of intrinsic value on our planet, whereas all nonhuman aspects of the biosphere, whether biotic or abiotic, are of merely instrumental value to the satisfaction of human interests. I argue, however, that environmental thinkers' critiques of anthropocentrism are ultimately misplaced. Humanity's ecological predicament is not the result of overvaluing humanity as such but of permitting institutionalized forms of ethical egoism to underlie policies that narrowly focus on the short-term, frivolous interests of current individuals at the expense of the vital interests of future generations.
