There are many types of MDS. An MDS is a type of blood cancer. Between 2011 and 2015, there were about 70,000 new cases of MDS in the United States (an average of about 14,000 cases per year). Today, there are many treatments to help people who have MDS. Yet there is more work to be done. New treatment options are available through clinical trials.

PART 1 Understanding MDS Overview of This Section {{Blood cells are made inside the bones in the bone marrow. They begin as stem cells. Stem cells develop in the bone marrow and normally become healthy red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets. Then they leave the bone marrow and enter the bloodstream. {{MDS affects the blood and the bone marrow. {{MDS is diagnosed with blood and bone marrow tests. {{The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and other scoring systems are used as guides for doctors to determine the best treatment for a person who has been diagnosed with MDS.The MDS Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 3About Bone Marrow, Blood and Blood Cells The general descriptions below may help you understand the information in the rest of this Guide. Bone marrow is the spongy center located inside the bone where blood cells are made. Blood cells begin as stem cells in the bone marrow. Stem cells grow and mature into different types of cells: red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. After the cells have matured, the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets enter the bloodstream. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. When the number of red blood cells is below normal, a condition called anemia usually develops. Anemia may make you feel tired or short of breath. It may make your skin look pale. White blood cells fight infection in the body. There are two major types of white blood cells: lymphocytes and germ-eating cells. {{Lymphocytes are {{NK cells {{Germ-eating cells are called {{Neutrophils {{Monocytes Platelets help stop bleeding by clumping together (clotting) at the site of an injury. Plasma is the liquid part of the blood. Although mostly water, plasma also has some vitamins, minerals, proteins, hormones and other natural chemicals in it.4 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgNormal Blood Cell Count Fast Facts The ranges of blood cell counts below are for adults. They may be a little different from lab to lab and for children and teens.

There is no way to prevent MDS and you cannot catch it. MDS is a cancer. This means: {{A normal cell changes (mutates). {{Changed cells act differently in the body. Doctors also believe MDS are more frequently found in people who: {{Are older {{Have had certain types of cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy and/or radiation {{Have rare inherited bone marrow disorders, such as Fanconi anemia, aplastic anemia or dyskeratosis congenita There are two types of MDS: primary (no cause can be identified) and secondary (treatment-related and less common). Most people diagnosed with MDS have primary MDS. Signs and Symptoms Healthy people often have a sign or a symptom when they get an illness or a disease. {{A sign is a change in the body that the doctor sees in an exam or a test result. {{A symptom is a change in the body that the patient can see or feel. Diagnosing MDS can sometimes be hard. Often the signs and/or the symptoms can also be caused by another disease. Signs and symptoms of MDS may include {{Fatigue {{Shortness of breath during physical activity {{Pale skin {{Dizziness {{Increased risk of bleeding and bruising {{Infection Diagnosing MDS There are many tests that will confirm a diagnosis of MDS. 6 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgThese tests may include: {{A physical exam. {{Blood tests. One common blood test is called a complete blood count (CBC). This lab test counts the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in the blood. Usually, patients with MDS have lower-than- normal numbers of red blood cells, neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) and platelets. {{Bone marrow tests. There are two tests used most commonly to find the percentage of abnormal blood cells in the bone marrow and to confirm a diagnosis of MDS. These two tests are bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. {{FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). This is a test that uses light and probes to identify damaged DNA in chromosomes. FISH is done using a blood or bone marrow sample. {{Molecular testing. These tests can be done on either a sample of blood or bone marrow to look for mutations in genes that are associated with MDS. Certain mutations are linked with either a better or a worse outcome. Doctors use the results of molecular testing to help plan treatment. How Are the Blood and Bone Marrow Tests Done? Blood Test \u2014 A small amount of blood is taken from the patient's arm with a needle. The blood is collected in tubes and sent to a lab. Bone Marrow Aspiration \u2014 The removal of a sample of fluid with cells from the bone marrow. Bone Marrow Biopsy \u2014 A very small amount of bone filled with marrow cells is taken from the body. Both bone marrow tests are done with a special needle. Some patients are awake for the procedure. They get medication first to numb the part of the body that will be used to take the sample of cells. Some patients are given a drug that makes them sleep during this procedure. The sample of cells is usually taken from the patient's hip bone. Blood and marrow tests may be done in the doctor's office or in a hospital. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are almost always done at the same visit.The MDS Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 7Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy Common site where sample is takenA Bone Marrow Aspiration samples fluid and cells A Bone Marrow Biopsy samples bone and marrowNeedles Skin and fat MarrowPatient position Spongy boneCompact bone Left: The place on the back of the patient's pelvic bone where a bone marrow aspiration or biopsy is done. Right: Where one needle goes into bone marrow to get a liquid sample for aspiration and the other needle goes inside the bone for a bone biopsy. The needles are different sizes. Here are some questions you may want to ask your healthcare team. See pages 33-38 for a full list of questions. 1. What kind of testing will be done to diagnose my disease and to monitor my treatment? 2. How long does it take to get the results? 3. How are the results communicated to me? 4. How often will testing be needed? 5. Where will the testing be done? Once all the tests are complete, a hematopathologist (a doctor or scientist who studies the blood cells and blood tissues to identify disease) will review the results. It is important to talk to your doctor about the results of the tests. The results are needed for treatment planning. A diagnosis of MDS requires that you have at least one low blood cell count (of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets), and one of the following problems must be present in your bone marrow: {{Blast cells (immature cells) make up more than 5 percent of the marrow cells {{Damage to the chromosome DNA {{Changes to the structure or form of the bone marrow8 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgThe International Prognostic Scoring Systems and MDS Classification Doctors often use different types of scoring systems for people who have MDS. These scoring systems were created to figure out the severity of a patient's disease. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) is a guide, used along with your doctor's observation, to determine how to best treat you. It is the guide most commonly used by doctors. Although the IPSS does not take into account many factors, such as aging and its effect on the treatment of older patients, it does assign a patient's risk. The risk tells the doctor how quickly the disease will progress into one of four categories: {{Low {{Intermediate-1 {{Intermediate-2 {{High Doctors also use The International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised (IPSS-R) score, a recent update of the IPSS. It assigns patient risk into five groups: {{Very low {{Low {{Intermediate {{High {{Very high The classification of MDS was originally created by the French-American- British (FAB) Work Group, which classified MDS into five subtypes. In 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed another classification that was modified from the original FAB, incorporating molecular and cytogenetic factors. Since then, the WHO classification has been updated twice, once in 2008 and again in 2016. The current WHO classification guidelines identify six subtypes of MDS based on the results of tests of the blood and bone marrow. The subtypes are: 1. MDS with single MDS with multilineage dysplasia (MDS-MLD) 4. 6. MDS unclassifiable For definitions of these subtypes, see Health Terms on page 27.

This type of doctor is called a hematologist-oncologist. {{Ask questions about your treatment choices and do not be afraid to be involved in making decisions about your own care. See the question guides My First Doctor's Visit and Treatment and Follow-Up Care on pages 33-38. {{People diagnosed with MDS can be treated by observation (watch-and-wait approach), clinical trials, supportive care, drug therapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Finding the Right Doctor Choose a doctor who specializes in treating MDS and knows about the most up-to-date treatments. This type of specialist is a hematologist-oncologist. A hematologist is a doctor who has special training in disorders of the blood. An oncologist is a doctor who has special training in cancer. A hematologist- oncologist has special training in blood cancers. Your local cancer specialist may work with an MDS specialist. Always check to see if the doctor's affiliated hospital or your chosen hospital is covered under your health insurance plan. How to Find an MDS Specialist {{Ask your primary care doctor for a recommendation. {{Contact your community cancer center. {{Reach out to doctor and/or health plan referral services. {{Call an LLS Information Specialist at (800) 955-4572. {{Use online doctor-finder resources, such as {{The American Medical Association's (AMA) \"DoctorFinder\" online at https://doctorfinder.ama-assn.org/doctorfinder/ {{The American Society of Hematology's (ASH) \"Find a Hematologist\" online at https://www.hematology.org/Patients/FAH.aspx When you meet with the specialist, ask questions to get a better idea of the doctor's experience and to understand how the office works. Some sample questions are on page 11. See pages 33-34 for a full list of questions.The MDS Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 111.

You may also want to check with your health insurance plan to ensure that a second opinion will be covered. Treatment Planning There are many treatments for MDS. Your doctor will create a plan that is best for you. Treatment goals for lower-risk MDS patients include: {{Managing the disease by reducing transfusion needs {{Improving blood counts {{Decreasing the risk of infection {{Increasing the number of good-quality years of life Treatment goals for higher-risk MDS patients include: {{Increasing life expectancy (shorter for high-risk than it is for low-risk MDS patients) {{Slowing or preventing MDS from progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), another type of leukemia About MDS Treatments New treatments may have been approved since this book was printed.

What are the treatment options, including clinical trials? 3. What is the goal of treatment? The MDS Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 134. What are the benefits and risks of these treatments? 5. Is one treatment recommended over others? Treatment options include: {{Observation with regular blood counts (watch and wait) {{New approaches under study (clinical trials) {{Supportive therapy {{Blood transfusions {{Iron chelation therapy {{Blood cell growth factors {{Managing infections {{Drug therapy {{Allogeneic stem cell transplantation Observation (Watch and Wait). Sometimes patients do not need treatment right away. A \"watch-and-wait\" approach allows the doctor to check the patient's condition and blood count, but not to actually start treatment with drugs or other therapy until it is needed. Patients may think that they should have treatment right away. But watch-and-wait with monitoring allows the patient to avoid the side effects of therapy until treatment becomes necessary. Patients in watch-and- wait protocols: {{Need to continue to see their doctor regularly {{Should undergo regular tests and exams, as advised {{Tell their doctor about any changes or symptoms {{Understand that if there are signs that their MDS is progressing, treatment may become necessary Blood Transfusions. Some patients with symptoms are treated with either transfusions (the process of taking blood from a donor and giving it to the patient intravenously) or with growth factors. Both these processes increase low blood counts and can help make patients feel better. Before a blood transfusion, doctors will: {{Check a patient's hemoglobin levels (the protein in the red blood cells that carries oxygen) {{Look for symptoms (such as fatigue or shortness of breath) and possibly identify other health problems, such as heart disease Platelet transfusions may also be needed.14 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org You can view, print or order the free LLS booklet Blood Transfusion at www.LLS.org/booklets, or contact our Information Specialists for a copy.WANT MORE INFORMATION? Iron Chelation Therapy. Iron chelation therapy uses medicine to remove the extra iron in the body, a condition called \"iron overload.\" Because anemic patients get many blood transfusions, they may be at risk for iron overload, a disorder that can damage the heart and liver. This therapy may be used for anemic patients, who depend on frequent transfusions. The common FDA-approved drugs used for iron overload include: {{Deferasirox (Exjade\u00ae or Jadenu\u00ae)\u2014This oral medication is in pill form and taken daily. Jadenu and Exjade are the same medication, but Jadenu may be easier to digest. {{Deferoxamine mesylate (DFO; Desferal\u00ae)\u2014This drug is administered as a slow subcutaneous (under-the-skin, called SC) or intramuscular (into a muscle, called IM) infusion. Blood Cell Growth Factors. Agents called growth factors help your body make blood cells. There are red blood cell and white blood cell growth factors. Red Blood Cell Growth Factors Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone created in the kidneys. It helps the production of red blood cells when your body has low oxygen levels. A shortage of EPO can also cause anemia. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are red blood cell growth factors that are man-made versions of natural EPO. They are used to treat MDS patients who have anemia associated with low EPO levels. Examples of these include darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp\u00ae) and epoetin alfa (Procrit\u00ae). Most patients with MDS do not have low EPO levels, so administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) is not useful in treating their anemia. Nonetheless, all MDS patients should have their EPO levels checked. White Blood Cell Growth Factors {{Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a hormone that increases white blood cell production. Some MDS patients with low EPO levels may not benefit from an ESA alone, but if an ESA is given along with a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), the combination may increase a patient's hemoglobin levels. Examples of these drugs include filgrastim (Neupogen\u00ae) and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta\u00ae).The MDS Guide: Information Caregivers I 15{{Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is another growth factor. Sargramostim (Leukine\u00ae) is also an example of a GM-CSF medication. These drugs can help patients with low neutrophil (white blood cell) counts who develop infections. Managing Infections. A low number of white blood cells can increase a patient's risk for infection. In some cases, infection occurs frequently and it can sometimes be severe. It is important for patients to pay close attention to any infection or unexplained fever, because antibiotics or antiviral drugs may be needed. Drug Therapy. The following drugs have been approved by the FDA for patients who have MDS: {{Azacitidine (Vidaza\u00ae)\u2014This drug, given by intravenous (IV) infusion or subcutaneously (under the skin), is approved for the treatment of both low- risk and high-risk patients. It helps the bone marrow begin to work more normally. It also kills the unhealthy cells in the bone marrow. In studies, treatment with azacitidine has led to improved quality of life along with blood transfusions, as needed. It has also reduced the need for transfusions. {{Decitabine (Dacogen\u00ae)\u2014This drug, given through a slow IV infusion and must be given in a hospital setting, is approved for the treatment of both low-risk and high-risk patients. In studies, decitabine reduced the need for blood transfusions and improved blood counts in some patients. {{Lenalidomide (Revlimid\u00ae)\u2014This drug, taken by mouth, is approved for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia caused by low- risk or intermediate-1-risk MDS. This drug works best for patients who have certain cytogenetic changes. Talk to your doctor for more information. {{In specific situations, imatinib mesylate (Gleevec\u00ae), taken by mouth, is myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms associated receptor (PDGFR) gene rearrangements. Chemotherapy regimens may consist of a single drug or combinations of two or three different drugs. Chemotherapy is treatment with drugs that kill or damage cancer cells. Each drug type works in a different way. Newer drugs are being tested in clinical trials. Patients with intermediate-2 and high-risk International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) categories may need treatment similar to that given to patients who have acute myeloid leukemia (AML).16 I 800.955.4572 or order the free LLS fact booklets Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid Leukemia at www.LLS.org/booklets, or contact our Information Specialists for copies.WANT MORE INFORMATION?The MDS Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 17Central Lines, Ports and PICCs Central Line (catheter) \u2014 A thin tube that is put under the skin and into a large vein in the chest. The central line stays firmly in place. \"Indwelling catheter\" is another word for central line. Port \u2014 This is a small device that is used with a central line. The port is placed under the skin of the chest. After the site heals, no dressings are needed and no special home care is required. The doctor or nurse can give medicines or nutrition to the patient or take blood samples from the patient using the port. A needle is simply inserted through the skin into the port. A numbing cream can be put on the skin before the port is used.

Your doctor will talk with you about whether stem cell transplantation is a treatment option for you. Intensive radiation and/or chemotherapy, followed by an allogeneic stem cell transplantation, has the best-known potential to cure MDS. This treatment is not 18 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgfor all patients and it has a high risk of serious complications. Talk to your doctor to see if stem cell transplantation is a treatment option for you. In allogeneic stem cell transplantation, stem cells from another person (a donor) are infused into your body. The donor may be a brother or sister. Or the donor can be an unrelated person with stem cells that \"match\" the patient's. Stem cells may also come from cord blood (the blood in the umbilical cord retrieved after a baby's birth). The goals of an allogeneic transplant are to: {{Restore the body's ability to make healthy blood cells after high-dose chemotherapy {{Cure the patient by killing remaining MDS cells This procedure may be done in the hospital. First, the patient is given high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Stem cells are collected from a donor. The donor stem cells are given to the patient through an IV (intravenous) line or a central line. The donor stem cells go from the patient's blood to the marrow. They help start a new supply of healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Stem cell transplant may be an option for MDS patients if: {{They are either IPSS intermediate-2 or high-risk category, or if they have therapy-related (secondary) MDS {{The expected benefits of an allogeneic transplant exceed the risks {{There is a stem cell donor Reduced-Intensity Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation. Your doctor will talk to you about whether a reduced-intensity allogeneic stem cell transplant is a treatment option. This procedure uses lower doses of chemotherapy than the doses that are used in a standard allogeneic transplant. Some older and sicker patients may be helped by this treatment. The goal of a reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant is to cure the patient of his or her MDS by killing remaining MDS cells and to start a new supply of healthy cells.

Clinical trials are careful studies done by doctors to test new drugs or treatments, or to test new uses for approved drugs or treatments. For example, changing the amount of the drug or giving the drug along with another type of treatment might be more effective than a standard treatment. Some clinical trials combine drugs for MDS in new sequences or dosages. There are clinical trials for: {{Newly diagnosed MDS patients {{MDS patients of all ages {{Patients who have relapsed, or patients who do not get a good response to treatment A carefully conducted clinical trial may provide the best available therapy.

Side Effects of MDS Treatment A side effect is an unintended result from a treatment or a drug. Sometimes the side effects are bad, but often they go away once the treatment ends. Ask your doctor about what side effects to expect from your treatment. Learn what they are. Side effects can be managed. Here are some questions you may want to ask your healthcare team. See pages 33-38 for a full list of questions. 1. What side effects should be reported to the team right away? 2. What are the common side effects of this treatment? 3. How long will the side effects last? 4. How can potential side effects be prevented or managed? Side effects that affect your blood counts include {{Anemia. A health condition caused by a reduction in the number of red blood cells. People with severe anemia may be pale, weak, tired, and become short of breath very easily. To help increase the red blood cell count, doctors often use a red blood cell transfusion, a process in which red blood cells are donated and given to the patient intravenously. {{Thrombocytopenia. A health condition caused by a drop in the number of platelets. To help increase the number of platelets, doctors often do a platelet transfusion, a process during which platelets are donated and given to the patient intravenously. {{Neutropenia. A health condition diagnosed when there is a big drop in the number of white blood cells (WBCs) called neutrophils. A large decrease The MDS Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 21in the number of neutrophils may result in an infection. The doctor may talk about the \"absolute neutrophil count\" (ANC), which is the number of neutrophils a person has for fighting infections. Infections are usually treated with antibiotics. MDS patients are more likely to get infections than other people. Look out for the following symptoms and tell your doctor right away if you experience any of them: {{Fever {{Chills {{Coughing {{Sore throat {{Pain when urinating lower the risk of infection: {{Use good handwashing skills\u2014patients, their visitors and medical staff need to wash their hands well. {{Keep the patient's central line clean. {{Practice good dental hygiene\u2014patients should take good care of their teeth and gums.

Ask your doctor about how often you should have follow-up visits. At these visits, the doctor will check you and learn how you are doing. Additional blood tests or even bone marrow tests may be needed to evaluate your treatment progress and to learn if more treatment is needed. The doctor may advise longer periods of time between follow-up visits; however, follow-up visits should be ongoing. You can also ask the doctor what tests will be needed, and find out how often you should have these tests. It is important to get and keep a record of your cancer treatment, including the drugs you receive and the time period you receive them, so that your doctor can follow up on specific long-term effects that may be associated with your treatment. See page 39 for a place that you can list your treatments. Here are some questions you may want to ask your healthcare team. See pages 33-38 for a full list of questions. 1. Who will I work with to ensure life-long follow-up care? 2. Will I continue to see this healthcare team? 3. What information can be given to my primary doctor about past treatment and what may be needed in the future? Take Care of Yourself Whether you still have MDS or if you have been treated for it, it is very important that you take good care of yourself. Review the following tips to keep yourself healthy and happy: {{Keep all doctors' appointments. {{Talk about how you feel with the doctor at each visit. {{Ask any questions you may have about side effects. {{People with MDS may have more infections. Follow the doctor's advice for preventing infection. {{Receive certain vaccinations including flu, pneumonia and shingles vaccines. Vaccines should not be \"live vaccines\" and your doctor will know the difference. For example, patients who have MDS can receive the shingles vaccine Shingrix\u00ae because it is an \"inactivated\" rather than a \"live\" vaccine. Speak to your doctor for more information. {{Eat healthy foods each day. It is okay to eat four or five smaller meals instead of three bigger ones.The MDS Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 23{{Contact the doctor about tiredness, fever or other symptoms. {{Do not smoke. Patients who smoke should get help to quit. {{Get enough rest. {{Exercise, but first talk with your doctor before starting an exercise program. {{Keep a healthcare file with copies of lab reports and treatment records. {{Have regular cancer screenings. {{See your primary care doctor to keep up with other healthcare needs. {{Talk with family and friends about how you feel. When family and friends know about MDS and its treatment, they may worry less. {{Seek medical advice if you feel sad or depressed and your mood does not improve over time. If you feel sad or depressed every day for a 2-week period, seek help. Depression is an illness. It should be treated even when a person is being treated for an MDS. Treatment for depression has benefits for people living with cancer. Resources and Information LLS offers free information and services for patients and families affected by blood cancers.
