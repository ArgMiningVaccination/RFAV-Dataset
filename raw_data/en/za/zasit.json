These patients are eating only a handful of 'safe' foods, they have a long list of supplements that they react to and their symptoms are unusual and hard to pin down to one precise thing. Histamine intolerance or histamine sensitivity is a major player in many of these patients' presentations and it shows up in a multitude of ways. Runny or stuffy noses, chronic sinusitis and itchy eyes tend to be the more common symptoms with headaches, migraines and sore lymph nodes coming in a close second. When things get more severe patients note that exercise, heat and even the computer screen can set off symptoms. Primer on Histamine intolerance For a great update on how histamine affects your digestion check out our previous article [Histamine Intolerance & the Gut](https://www.byronherbalist.com.au/gut-health/histamine-intolerance-gut-health/). My approach to treating histamine intolerance ranges from client to client but today I wanted to share some top herbal medicines that I might choose to include in a protocol. Herbal Medicine and Histamine Intolerance There is the difference between herbs that I use and have observed helping clients with histamine intolerance and digging up every obscure reference in the scientific literature. I prefer to use tried and tested therapies first. If we are having trouble getting results I will do a deep dive into the literature to find more supportive treatments. I will list the following histamine intolerance herbs in order of priority. The ones I find more effective and use frequently will be listed first.

Looking for gut support If you live in Australia or New Zealand then book your initial appointment here. I consult with patients via video conferencing and phone, order specialised at home labs to find to the root cause and ship herbs and supportive nutrients direct to your door. Baical skullcap for histamine intolerance Baical skullcap is a popular herb in Chinese Medicine. I frequently use baical skullcap as a potent antiviral, inflammation modulating, antimicrobial and anti-allergy herb. When focusing in on the allergy side of things baical skullcap has been shown to inhibit anaphylactic-like reactions, stabalise mast cells and inhibit plasma histamine release in animals. The fascinating image below shows a mast cell from a rat (A). They then introduced a potent mast cell degranulation mix that forces mast cells to release upwards of 90% of their histamine (C) Finally in the bottom left box (D) we can see a mast cell that had been pretreated with the baical skullcap extract that then had the mast cell degranulation mix added ( [1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345745556_Scutellaria_baicalensis_Inhibits_Mast_Cell-Mediated_Anaphylactic_Reactions)). Pictures really are worth a thousand words! This same effect has been noted in another study where they found the flavonoids to be the most potent mast cell stabilising constituents in the herb ( [2](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/cpb1958/32/12/32_12_5051/_article/-char/ja/)). This is interesting as quercetin, which we will cover in a future article on the supplements I use for histamine intolerance and mast cell activation, is a flavonoid. From the supplement side of things quercetin is my top therapy for allergic and histamine related conditions. Finally, research has shown that baical skullcap decreases inflammatory mediators of the allergic response and helps to modulate the Th1/Th2 balance ( [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28713616/)). Clinical note I use baical skullcap frequently in patients with histamine intolerance and mast cell activation syndrome. It is a very cold herb so should be formulated with warmer herbs to balance the coldness and prevent loose, sticky stools. Perilla for histamine intolerance Perilla frutescens is a top anti-allergy herb I turn to when histamine intolerance is evident. This herb is a member of the mint family and has a tradition of use as a food and medicine in China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and India for a range of conditions ( [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30597896/)). There have been over 270 different phytochemicals isolated from the perilla plant ranging from polyphenols, volatile compounds, fatty acids and even tocopherols ( [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30597896/)). This is why it can be so hard to pin down exactly how a plant is having an effect on a person. Sometimes I have found it helpful to use isolated and refined extracts that can be found in perilla, specifically luteolin and rosmarinic acid, but the whole herb is a great place to start and build up from there. One animal study showed perilla could inhibit the release of histamine and upregulate cyclic AMP from rat mast cells ( [5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10946827/)). In an in vitro study luteolin, a polyphenol flavonoid found in perilla, was shown to inhibit proinflammatory messenger molecules from human mast cells. Animal studies showed luteolin to reduce histamine release from mast cells that had been stimulated by a histamine liberator ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6271665/)). Nigella sativa for histamine intolerance Black cumin or nigella is a herbal medicine that has always attracted me. There is something to this plant that is hard to pin down. A properly extracted herbal tincture has an oily and earthy taste, somewhat muted compared to other essential oil rich herbs and just a touch of acridness on the back of the throat. We could spend the next 10 articles reviewing the long history and extensive research on black cumin but I will keep it brief. Used by cultures around the world, Nigella sativa is known by many different names. In Prophetic Medicine of Islam it was said that nigella could cure anything but death ( [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28603137/)). One review outlined nigella's actions on ( [8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28603137/)). The seed of nigella has a number of active constituents including fixed oils, volatile oils and even pyrazole alkaloids, vitamins and minerals. Much of the research focuses on thymoquinone which makes up between 30-48% of the volatile oils in nigella ( [9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27364039/)). Interestingly nigella seeds also contain thymol and carvacrol some of the major active constituents in both thyme and oregano which we commonly use in the Byron Herbalist clinic to treat [methane](https://www.byronherbalist.com.au/bacterial-infection/sibo-methane-dominant-treatment-plan/) and hydrogen SIBO, [overgrowths and infections in the large bowel](https://www.byronherbalist.com.au/bacterial-infection/how-to-treat-bacterial-infections-a-holistic-approach/) and even lung infections. Summarising the antihistamine in vitro and animal studies we see that thymoquinone, the principle active constituent in nigella, improved allergic conjunctivitis, blocked histamine receptors in the trachea and inhibited histamine release in an animal model of colitis ( [10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25829334/)). Nigellone, a carbonyl polymer of thymoquinone, has been shown to improve asthma and bronchitis due to its mast cell stabilising effects. Nigellone has also been shown to inhibit the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme which is the rate limiting enzyme in the pro-inflammatory pathway of leukotriene synthesis ( [11](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27364039/)). The research supporting the use of nigella in histamine intolerance and mast cell activation is sparse but don't let that fool you. Nigella is in the top 5 herbs I recommend to support histamine intolerant patients. As with most herbs it doesn't work for everyone but is well tolerated and effective for many. Nettle leaf for histamine intolerance Often I am attracted to herbs that are commonplace and considered boring by some. Nettle is one of those underappreciated herbs by some herbalists. We use the leaf, root and even the seeds for different conditions. As we are discussing histamine intolerance today we will be covering nettle leaf. It may seem like a bizarre herb to turn too as nettle leaf actually contains histamine. Nettle leaf can be poorly tolerated in a small number of histamine sensitive patients but I still frequently recommend trialling the herb in most. Nettle has been shown to inactivate and inhibit the H1 receptors (H1 blocking medications are used to treat allergies) and stabalise mast cells which prevents extra histamine being released in your body. The downstream effect is a reduction in the messenger molecules that contribute to inflammation and allergy symptoms ( [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19140159/)). Nettle leaf has also been shown to inhibit mast cell tryptase. Tryptase is an enzyme that speeds up the breakdown of proteins. It regulates mast cell degranulation, a process whereby mast cells release their pro-inflammatory and immune stimulating messengers. This humble leaf has also been shown to block COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes resulting in lowered prostaglandin synthesis ( [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19140159/)). Other Herbs For Histamine intolerance I like to start with strong and well studied antihistamine herbal medicines like perilla, baical skullcap, nigella and nettle leaf. Occasionally if a patient is very sensitive I will start with one herb at a time or even pair it back to the extract to start the process of stabilising mast cells and lowering the histamine load on the body. There are a number of other herbs that I will frequently use if I feel they will be tolerated. Ginger is potently anti-inflammatory, soothes the gut and stimulates motility. If a patient is constipated then histamine intolerance will be soooo much worse. Albizia can be very helpful and has been shown in invitro studies to lower histamine levels by downregulating gene histamine-1 receptors which converts histidine to histamine. Demulcent herbs that help protect the gut lining and build up the beneficial mucous layer can be helpful with some. My favourites here are marshmallow root and licorice. Ribwort can be helpful and slippery elm is great but less sustainable and best avoided if possible. Finally anti-Inflammatory herbal medicine can help patients with histamine intolerance The process of inflammation is complex. In the most basic summary, mast cell degranulation resulting in histamine liberation in the body, is part of the inflammatory cascade. I describe them as 'messengers of inflammation' to my patients. Not a bad thing for an acute injury, very problematic if it is ongoing and chronic. It is often caused by insult or damage to the body which then results in a spurring on of this inflammatory process. Many classic inflammation modulating herbs can be helpful as background support in histamine intolerance. My favourites are curcumin extracts from turmeric as well as boswellia also known as frankincense. Approaching Histamine intolerance in practice As a clinician my goal is to help people regain their health. When someone presents with histamine intolerance symptoms it is important to improve those symptoms by blocking or downregulating the inflammatory process, stabilising mast cells and reducing the histamine load produced in the gut and from food sources. The most important thing is to find and address why the body has kicked over into a proinflammatory state and address that. Sometimes correcting the root cause takes time but thankfully the herbal medicines listed here help many feel better and regain their tolerance to common foods over time.
