The following study is a result of my stay in Dharamsala, a cultural heart of Tibetan Buddhism and medicine being the headquarters for the the main Men Tsee Khang Clinic and College and the home of the Dalai Lama. During the month of November 2013, I had the opportunity to meet with many Tibetan doctors, Buddhist practitioners and scholars, and people who deal with rlung related illness. It is from these meetings that I have gathered a fuller understanding of rlung and its effects. I have supplemented this knowledge with readings about Tibetan Medicine and Buddhism written by great scholars.
