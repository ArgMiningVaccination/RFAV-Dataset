Conventional medicine tends to place a strong emphasis on diagnosing disorders which reflect a collection of behaviors or symptoms, rather than identifying the underlying cause of the disorder. Common treatment methods for conventional medicine include surgery, invasive procedures, and/or synthetic medications. While this model of medicine has resulted in significant medical advances, particularly in fields like surgical interventions, infectious diseases, and emergency medicine, it has come at the cost of other important aspects of healthcare. When thinking about what it means to be in good health, we believe it is important to go beyond the simple definition of health as simply being the absence of disease or ailment. Integrative and functional medicine take a more holistic approach to treating patients. By adopting an integrative and functional approach to providing you with care, you can be confident that you will receive care that still makes use of traditional medical treatment methodologies, but also takes in to account environmental, emotional, spiritual, and physical factors that may be negatively affecting your health. By identifying these underlying issues, you can begin looking forward to improved overall health and maximum vitality and happiness.

Although there are many areas in which they overlap, there are several distinct differences between integrative and functional medicine. Integrative medicine is an approach to medicine that implements both conventional and alternative treatments, with a focus on viewing the patient holistically. Integrative medicine approaches treatment with a broader set of therapies, and focuses on determining the root cause of illnesses or imbalances. Functional medicine embraces many of the same fundamental principles of integrative medicine, but is primarily focused on using a systems-oriented approach to diagnose and better understand the root causes of a disease, particularly chronic conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune issues. To help provide you with this level of care, we will take a deep dive into your history and biochemistry to develop a detailed analysis of your genetic makeup and better understand your unique needs.
