Fourteen countries and one region have joined together under the 4E TCP platform to exchange technical and policy information focused on increasing the production and trade in efficient end-use equipment. However, the 4E TCP is more than a forum for sharing information: it pools resources and expertise on a wide a range of projects designed to meet the policy needs of participating governments. Members of 4E find this an efficient use of scarce funds, which results in outcomes that are far more comprehensive and authoritative than can be achieved by individual jurisdictions. The 4E TCP is established under the auspices of the International Energy Agency (IEA) as a functionally and legally autonomous body. Current members of 4E TCP are: Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Denmark, the European Commission, France, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, Sweden, UK and USA. Further information on the 4E TCP is available from: www.iea-4e.org The EDNA Annex (Electronic Devices and Networks Annex) of the 4E TCP is focussed on a horizontal subset of energy using equipment and systems - those which are able to be connected via a communications network. The objective of EDNA is to provide technical analysis and policy guidance to members and other governments aimed at improving the energy efficiency of connected devices and the systems in which they operate. EDNA is focussed on the energy consumption of network connected devices, on the increased energy consumption that results from devices becoming network connected, and on system energy efficiency: the optimal operation of systems of devices to save energy (aka intelligent efficiency) including providing other energy benefits such as demand response.

Effective demand response /flexibility can reduce the maximum electricity generation capacity required and improve economic use of existing generation capacity. Reducing required gener ation capacity and optimising use of existing capacity can in turn reduce the transmission and distribution infrastructure needed for a grid. These benefits can reduce customer bills and the need for government support for the electricity sector from the g eneral budget . As well as benefits from traditional grid load management, e lectricity demand response /flexibility can realise new opportunities from variable renewable generation. Ubiquitous, cheap, easily deployed, interoperable networking technology can support more flexible demand management than older methods. Using these techniques facilitates demand management at site or ho usehold level from an energy management system as well as traditional centralised control from grid operators and aggregators. The massive d ecentralisation of energy generation from PV installed in communities and individual sites combined with other distr ibuted energy resources including batteries, thermal storage using heatpumps and resistive hot -water heaters , and load management of other distributed energy resources including HVAC, pool -pumps and other devices increases demand management potential. Electric Vehicles ( EVs) in particular are a challenge for grids and a significant demand management opportunity. To assist policy makers responsible for demand management outcomes , this brief report covers aspects of application layer protocols that can be use d for demand management in networked devices. Definitions ( Section 1.2) are followed by a n introduction to the protocol stack concept (Section 2) and some brief notes on cybersecurity (Section 3). Common energy device control functions are listed (Section 4). Energy management a pplication protocols are split into categor ies and characterised by a selection of criteria (Section 5): Protocols designed to support device energy management Protocols for EV charging Building, industrial and home automation protocols with some device energy management support Internet of Th ings (IoT) protocols Energy devices that can achieve required energy management outcomes with simpler hardware interfaces can implement several open platform initiatives ( Section 6). Future work can build on this report to cover important topics including vendor lockin, mandatory device support for control and state persistence , and open access within an appropriate cybersecurity framework to energy device control an d state . Animations and graphics can illustrate how application protocols work to sectoral stakeholders and other parties. Relevant physical/network layer protocols are listed ( Appendix A ) as are common internet stack application protocols (Appendix B ) which can be used for many purposes including energy management. 9 Introduction EDNA considers that device communication protocols have a significant impact on device energy consumption in these areas: Energy management functionality can be implemented in the application layer of protocol stacks1. Energy management application layers are used to facilitate systems of devices as well as managing individual devices . Energy management functionality includes : o saving energy - EDNA call s this \"intelligent efficiency \" o responding to the needs of the grid - EDNA call s this \"demand flexibility \". Protocols that reside in the physical/ne twork layers are essential for devices to communicate , including during periods when the device primary function is not being performed but the device is maintain ing its network connection . The power used in this \"network standby \" mode is heavily dependant on the communications protocol used . Physical/network layer protocols include Wifi, Zigbee, Bluetooth, Ethernet, etc. (refer Appendix A for more information). EDNA has produced a number of reports related to these protocols and their relevance to network standby power draw. These reports can be found in the publications area of the EDNA website2. This report is focussed on energy management protocols that reside in the application layer , which are used to facilitate intelligent efficiency and demand flexibility. Intelligent efficiency is defined as the operation of device (s) such that they respond to the changing conditions of th e external environment, in order to maximise energy savings3. Demand flexibility - with respect to devices - in other words 'demand flexible devices' - are defined as devices with advanced communication and control capabilities which can automatically and dynamically change energy use in response to changing electricity prices and grid system needs3. This report is a short guide for policy makers interested in energy management protocols used with devices to increase efficient energy usage. This focus intersects with traditional energy efficiency, demand management and demand response /flexibility as well as more recent initiatives managing distributed energy resources with site and grid level variable renewable energy. The report includes: A general overview of energy management protocols including some categorisation by functionality Some details of market uptake of relevant protocols How v arious protocols affect device and broader energy consumption Protocol descriptions and relevance to energy system device management 1 'Layers' refers to where a protocol resides in the 'la yered protocol stack '. This concept is described in more detail in Section 2. 2 https://www.iea -4e.org/edna/publications/ 3 https://www.iea -4e.org/publications/?_sf_s=policy%20guidance%20for%20smart%20energy%20saving%20consumer%20devices . Accessed May 4th, 2022 10 Scope There is an extensive range of devices that have energy consumption affected by communications protocols. This could range from include 500MW steam rankine cycle turbines to electronic consumer devices powered by tiny button batteries or ambient energy har vesting technology . To keep scope manageable for a short guide this work will build on definitions in \"More data, less energy\" (IEA 2014) to exclude devices whose primary function is: data storage or use entertainment communication network connectivity network infrastructure . to focus on other networked edge devices such as inverters, batteries, electric vehicles, water heating, water pumps, kitchen and laundry appliances, space conditioning ( heating and cooling ) equipment and lighting at residential and sm aller commercial and industrial scale. Further scope limitation exclusions are: specialised commercial and industrial equipment such as machine tools, industrial hydraulics and pneumatics and other. electricity and gas metering However, while these devices are treated as outside scope for this report, it should be noted that common energy efficiency goals include: Reduce the volume of energy consumed Reduce the peak demand Move load to off -peak periods where possible . To achieve aims such as: Saving custome rs money by: o reducing the volume of energy subject to a tariff o moving energy consumption to a cheaper tariff o increasing onsite consumption of behind -the-meter PV generation and storage o reducing critical peak demand charges . Reducing thermal loads and overvoltage on electricity grids . Reducing gas or electricity grid load to below maximum capacity for the relevant grid section . Sites can also manage loads to avoid exceeding switchboard or grid connection (substation, transform er) maxima. Sites managing loads and PV export can also contribute to grid stability by reducing overvoltage and undervoltage . These goals and aims can exist at : 11 a grid -connected house with energy system devices including an inverter, rooftop PV, battery, heatpump and resistance hot -water systems, space conditioning heatpump and EV charger or at a 1GW green hydrogen plant with an onsite windfarm and solar farm, rapidly rampable PEM electrolyser, grid connection for opportunistic energy sales and purchases, onsite battery and hydrogen storage, pumps and EVs (and chargers) for onsite and road use. Some e xisting energy system communications protocols - perhaps with some additions where necessary - implement use cases applicable across a range of devices beyond those covered in this report and can already be flexible enough to cope with more specialised use cases. This can have other customer benefits such as access to proven technology stacks and existing expertise, quicker implementation and reducing vendor lo ckin. Experience with what has contributed to the remarkable progress in the ICT sector over the last 30+ years should encourage the energy sector as it transitions to renewables to consider factors including open platforms, standardisation and plug and pl ay user experience. Definitions Energy management systems are used to manage onsite networked devices at homes, offices, farms, factories and other sites to achieve outcomes including: minimising energy cost by: o load management o maximising financially beneficial onsite consumption of onsite PV generation o optimising tariff use for residual grid supply and storage o optimising battery and thermal storage charge and supply o exporting energy from a site to be paid by feedin tariffs, market spot pri ces and network support reducing grid impact of site demand and export where required or financially incentivised by an external party participation in aggregated/orchestrated mechanisms such as virtual power plants to support frequency control and ancilla ry services . Smart grid technology supports two way communication and power flow across a grid. Typically this will involve management and interaction with distributed energy resources such as PV, thermal and battery storage, wind, despatchable devices such as pool pumps and electric vehicle chargers, demand response participating devices such as air -conditioners and other energy system devices. Note that smart grid technologies can be deployed at national or regi onal grid level but also in microgrids or behind -the-meter at individual sites. An aggregator will manage a cohort of energy devices across multiple sites to achieve a demand management/response outcome. Aggregators might be electricity retailers, electricity distribution services operators , grid operators (most likely in smaller grids) or entities specialising in this service. 12 Introduction to the Protocol ' Stack ' The Australian Research Data Commons4 (ARDC) defines a communications p rotocol as \" a set of formal rules describing how to transmit or exchange data, especially across a network. \" The ARDC states that a \"standardised communications protocol is one that has been codified as a standard. \". Regulators will find it easier to develop device demand management frameworks where there are standardised protocols available that support the functionality required. Ad hoc device demand management functionality which changes without notice and which ma y suffer from inadequate documentation complicates regulatory development of device demand management frameworks Communications protocol developers, industry associations and standards bodies have found that developing protocols as layered stacks simplifie s definition, development, testing and deployment. A protocol stack at a networked device takes data from a human or other source and passes it through each layer until it is sent by the physical layer across the network to another networked device . At the recipient device data is passed up through each layer of the protocol stack to the application layer. The application layer at the sending and recipient device is the interface to other software like email clients and web browsers. HEMS and aggregators re quiring demand management services can interface with the application layer of protocols that support demand management . Layer s in the protocol stack : pass protocol data units upwards or downwards through the stack add layer specific information (encapsul ation) to protocol data units going down the stack from the application layer to the physical layer remove the layer specific header added by the corresponding layer at the sending device (de-encapsulation) for protocol data units heading up the stack to the application layer . As well as print textbooks, there is a wealth of online tutorials, YouTube videos5 6, animations, books, training manuals and other relevant material covering protocol stacks including encapsulation and de-encapsulation. The Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol7 (TCP/IP) stack is widely used in the Internet. Another influential protocol stack is Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)8. 4 https://ardc.edu.au/resources/standardised -communications -protocols/ . 27th August, 2022. 6 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv4y_uOneC0 7 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1122 Accessed 29th April, 2022 8 https://www.iso.org/ics/35.100/x/ Accessed 29th April, 2022. 13 Figure 1 OSI and TCP/IP protocol stack layers OSI Protocol Stack Layer Purpose Application Data to and from user application s such as a web browser Presentation Manage information presentation including conversion to and from standard network format.

Network Access Sends and receives TCP/IP packets on the physical network. Table 2 TCP/IP protocol stack layers and purpose Appropriately defined and standardised application protocols like IEEE2030.5 and Open ADR can support a rich set of demand management use cases across many device types. Other protocols may support a smaller range of use cases on a more limited set of device types. 15 Cybersecurity Cybersecurity for networked energy devices is a large area which is currently the subject of considerable attention in governments, standards bodies, trade and industry associations and other. Networked energy devices that don't implement dat a encryption, access control and other cryptosecurity requirements may allow access to entities with malicious intent. For example, rapidly turning on and off a large cohort of heatpumps could damage the heatpumps and cause considerable grid operation issu es. A relevant recent National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL) report discusses cybersecurity certification for networked grid -edge devices.9 NREL developed the Energy Resource Cybersecurity Framework \"to evaluate the cybersecurity postu re of federal sites that employ distributed energy systems or plan to implement distributed energy resources (DERs) for day -to- day operations\".10 The National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework aims to help \"organizations to bett er understand and improve their management of cybersecurity risk\"11 Industry bodies are active in DER cybersecurity. The Sunspec Alliance DER Cybersecurity working group publish Certification Procedures for Data and Communications Security of DER and other relevant material.12 Singapore has a cybersecurity labelling program for internet connected devices. The US has announced the intention to introduce internet connected device cybersecurity device labelling. 9 https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/80581.pdf Accessed August 24th, 2022 10 https://dercf.nrel.gov/about Accessed August 24th, 2022 11 https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework Accessed August 24th, 2022 12 https://sunspec.org/specifications/ Accessed August 25th, 2022 16 Common energy device control function s Devices will (or should) share some common control function s. The communications protocol stack directly or indirectly supports this commonality . Relevant network device protocol implementations need to receive data and instructions from external agents suc h as Home Energy Management Systems ( HEMS ) and aggregators. The agents and devices also need to check and co-ordinate factors state such as when they are operational and available. Polling and pub/sub are common methods to access data , instructions and sta te. Polling has the software stack in the networked device regularly checking the external agent for data, instructions and relevant external agent state . Polling is often described as synchronous as the polling response is expected on receipt of the poll . In contrast, p ub/sub mechanisms are typically asynchronous. A device will subscribe to a topic and go on with other processing. Once a message is published at some future time to a topic the subscribing device will be informed. Standards such as IEEE2030. 5 and OpenADR (Section 5) and EN 50631 -113 suggest indicative demand flexibility use cases which rely on energy device control functions. Common energy device contr ol functions follow. Turn off/on A device may be turned on and off . Register with management entity A device may actively register with a management entity. Device discovery A device may be discovered on a network by a management entity which registers the device . Start/stop device control A device may on command enter or leave a controlled mode. Some devices under some protocols can tell a controlling entity that they are leaving the controlled mode. Scheduling Actions at a device may be scheduled to occur or not occur during specified periods. Tariff information A device with onboard scheduling or a device controlling schedules for other devices can use tariff information in scheduling. Set device state A networked energy system device may have configuration state that can be set by an external party November 9th, 2022 17 Report device state A device can report current configuration and operational state on request or on a regular interval . Update device software Devices with software stored in writable memory may support over -the-air upgrades. This requires access protection and a n update delivery chain that ensure what's installed is the upgrade without any tampering by external parties. Setpoint set and report Temperature s etpoints are a commo n example of system state used to manage HVAC equipment. Reduce /increase energy consumption Some devices may be capable of reducing or increasing energy consumption on demand or following a schedule . The reduction might be an absolute amount or relative to or offset from some system value or parameter (such as a reduction to 75% or 50% operating capacity) . This is useful for critical peak demand management in response to a grid event or to minimise critical peak demand charges. Reduce/i ncrease energy export Some DER devices such as home batter y systems, EV batteries and inverters can export to the grid on d emand or following a schedule . A device with this capability may be told to reduce or increase export. 18 Relevant energy management protocols Overview For the purpose of this report, protocols used for energy management can be categorised into the following areas : Protocols designed to support device energy management Protocols for EV charging Building, industrial and home automation p rotocols with some device energy management support Internet of Things (IoT) protocols As well as the energy management protocols listed in this section , there are a number of workflow/integration tools such as If This Then That ( IFTTT )14 and Node -RED15 that can be used to build applications with networked energy devices and relevant exposed APIs to deliver energy management services. Advanced Message Queueing Protocol ( AMQP )16 could also be used to link networked energy devices in frameworks.

Protocols for EV charging EV charging themes Charging electric vehicles is widely forecast to drastically increase the amount of electricity consumed in many grids. Commentators have suggested a pocalyptic scenarios of distribution section s and grid s overwhelmed by peak load s caused by large numbers of EV chargers running simultaneously at times such as weekday evenings after the daily commute . These scenarios have been used as an argument for expensive grid upgrades. Increasing the regulated asset base in many jurisdictions flows through directly to utility/distributor revenues. Electricity customers commonly pay for grid upgrades through network tariffs. Direct government subsidy of grid upgrades from the general budget increases taxation or reduces expenditure on other programs. Many EV model s have extensive connectivity and onboard load management support. Where these are accessible through open protocols, EV ch arging can be an excellent use case for intelligent energy supply management from third parties whether these be onsite EMS, agg regators, electricity distributors or grid operators . Site level energy management can optimise EV charging with time -of- use or dynamic tariffs, controlled load tariffs and availability of onsite PV. Site charging can cater for multiple chargers at sites w ith carparks including apartment blocks, factories, offices, supermarkets and others. 23 Charging management can also be centralised by aggregators, distribution services organisations or at grid level where the computational load and other software issues ca n be managed . Centralised charging management is popular with grid operators as it facilitates transparency and a higher level of hierarchical control over EV charging. How to co -optimise onsite energy use optimisation by energy management systems with ext ernal control of EV chargers is a challenge. Vehicle -to-grid (VTG) and vehicle -to-home (VTH) have received significant attention with mostly trial deployment at the time of writing. VTG and VTH once available and implemented by car manufacturers can use an EV battery as a networked energy device with similar use cases to behind - the-meter batteries. How best to deploy EV charging , vehicle -to-home and vehicle -to-grid is beyond this report's scope but will be a topical, important and fascinating policy area ov er the next 20 years .

Various control approaches have sought to avoid these issues by, for example, using hardware such as timers for hot -water sys tems or simple on/off control elements operated by utilities during periods of low demand on the grid. Hardware interface solutions can raise other issues: Non-standardisation replicates work over multiple platforms. This cost needs to be recouped Vendor lockin can restrict third -party access to these devices . A related issue is interface devices designed only to support control from a utility , restrict the use of onsite control in energy management systems to, for example, maximise PV onsite consumption, dynamic tariffs and other use cases Limited functionality supported can restrict use cases. For example, a simple on/off device communicating with a utility would not support setpoints for a resistance element in a hot - water heater which restricts load -management options . Industry and standards association s have developed solutions that specify a simplified set of control s that can be used by a more fully -feature d software stack to drive device energy management. These solutions include: Consumer Technology Association standard CTA -204544 Demand Response Enabling Device (DRED, Australian Standard 4755)45 SG Ready initiative46 An application protocol can manage energy devices by using lower levels of the protocol stack to control a device through these interfaces. For example, an application layer protocol use case interfacing to a SG Ready compatible heatpump might tell a heatp ump to operate for a specified 2 44 31 hour period. Software controlling an AC unit might use the DRED interface to run the AC unit at no more than 50% of its maximum continuous rating. While supporting limited functionality with upgrades difficult to implement, these initiatives: Require minimal energy to support device energy management Are protocol agnostic. Local energy management system or other agent can support protocols as required Minimise device energy management interface installation Reduce device cyb ersecurity requirements which are now primarily managed by local or remote agent Standardised interface facilitates open platform and standard implementations . CTA-2045 The Consumer Technology Association (CTA) states that:47 \"ANSI/CTA -2045 specifies a mo dular communications interface (MCI) to facilitate communications with residential devices for applications such as energy management. The MCI provides a standard interface for energy management signals and messages to reach devices .\" The CTA-2045 socket c an be connected to a management platform for local or remote control. Devices implementing CTA -2045 can support : load up load shed critical peak event grid emergency time -of-use tariffs real-time pricing. This range of device use cases can be controlled by OpenADR , IEEE2030.5 and other software stacks with a suitable application protocol and physical and link layer capability to interface with the socket . CTA-2045 has been used in several US demand manageme nt programs for HW heaters . Implementations for EV charging and other use cases are becoming commercially available. 47 https://standards.cta.tech/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=192 . Accessed 15th March, 2022 32 Demand Response Enabling Device Australia has developed the Demand Response Enabling Device (DRED) as defined in t he AS/NZS 47 55 standard s. Devices such as resistive hot-water heaters, air -conditioners and pool -pumps supporting DRED Demand Response Mode s from the following list can be managed by onsite or offsite platforms mapping application layer use cases to the DRED DRMs. AS/N ZS 47 55 defines these demand response modes (DRM) : DRM 0: Disconnect DRM 1 Do not consume power DRM 2 Do not consume at more than 50% of a reference value DRM 3 Do not consume at more than 75% of a reference value DRM 4 Start or increase load DRM 5 Do not export power to the grid DRM 6 Do not export at more than 50% of a reference value DRM 7 Do not export at more than 75% of a reference value DRM 8 S Start or increase export to grid The physical interface to the DRED controlled device is specified in the standard. Appliance manufacturers may supply an adaptor that can communicate with an onsite or offsite platform to implement DRED functionality. There is also an AS/NZS standard for inverter DRED support. DRED has seen limited international uptake . If Aus tralia mandates DRED compliance for appliances sold in Australia, manufacturers wishing to sell in Australia may need to support DRED as well as any international standards. SG Ready initiative The Bundesverband Warmepumpe e. V. (German Federal Heatpump Association) state that Smart Grid Ready labelling is awarded for systems in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. SG R eady devices are required to support 2 or more of 4 operating states which control energy consumption. The operating states are driv en by two contacts which are each set to on or off. Operating state 1: Switched off Operating state 2: Normal energy efficient mode Operating state 3: Recommended to r un in boost mode possibly during low tariff period or taking advantage of onsite PV Operating state 4: Start command working with tariffs and with options including higher temperature in the storage tank and using the room temperature - for relevant devices - as a referen ce variable . 33 A the t ime of writing the SG Ready interface supports a useful but limited set of use cases primarily in AC units and heatpumps used to heat water. SG Ready is implemented on a range of heatpumps made by German and other manufacturers and AC u nits from several manufacturers. 34 Relevant physical/network layer protocols The layers below the application layer in the TCP/IP stack and the bottom 4 layers in the OSI stack are referred to by EDNA as the physical/network layers. These layers collectively support the application oriented functionality in the layers above. There is a wealth of academic, institutional, government and other authoritative information covering the physical/network layers. Physical/network layer relevance for this report is to support application layer protocols communicating with energy devices and the network standby energy consumption. The EDNA report \"Network Standby Power Basics\"48 covers networked device protocol standby energy consumption topics in detai l. The EDNA report \"Energy Efficiency of the Internet of Things\"49 discusses the following protocols used for the physical layer: ANT+50 Bluetooth And Bluetooth Smart also covered -2011 this has been superseded by IEEE 802.15.4 - 202060. A recent protocol development is Thread61 which the Thread Group state \"is a low -power and low - latency wireless mesh networking protocol built using open and proven standards .\" The Matter 48 https://www.iea -4e.org/edna/tasks/task -5-network _Technical_Report_FINAL.pdf https://www.thisisant.com/ Accessed 4th May, 2022 51 https://www.bluetooth.com / Accessed 4th May, 2022 52 https://www.etsi.org/technologies/dect Accessed 4th May, 2022 53 4th 2022 -solutions/zigbee/ 4th May, Accessed May, 2022 56 May, 2022 59 https://lora -alliance.org/ Accessed 4th May, 2022 60 https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.15.4/7029/ Accessed 4th May, 2022 61 https://www.threadgroup.org/ Accessed 7th May, 2022 35 application protocol (see Section 5) can run on Thread. There is an open source implementation62 of Thread with a permissive license. Thread/Matter is supported by a large range of companies. There is a Thread certification process for third -party products. 62 https://openthread.io/ Accessed 7th May, 2022 36 Common Internet stack application protocols These protocols can be used for energy management at devices without any specific energy management use cases defined for the protocol. Some open platform application protocols are used for generic support of use cases from a sweep of problem domains. While not developed specifically for energy management, benefits of using these protocols may include: Flexible data and control application layer contents Widespread availability on multiple CPUs, micro -controllers, platforms and operating systems Broad, deep techn ical experience Well -proven, well -tested protocols Using these protocols raises issues including: User defined shared, accurate application layer data layout and definition is required for network nodes to communicate using these protocols. This contrasts with a well -designed application protocol used in part or primarily for energy management with standardised application layer contents. General purpose protocols may cater for functionality not needed for energy management which may complicate system conf iguration and implementation. Deploying device energy management as simple plug -and-play may encourage electricity customers to adopt demand response /flexibility at scale.
