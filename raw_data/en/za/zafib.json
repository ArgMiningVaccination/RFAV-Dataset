Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) is a very heterogeneous disease. 2. The incidence of cHL is age dependent and both the overall incidence and the age dependent incidence are influenced by ethnic origin. 3. Immune control of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection depends on polymorphisms within the Human leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes. 4. EBV-positive cHL is different from EBV-negative cHL in terms of epidemiology , association with ethnic origin and genetic predisposition. 5. The increased risk of individuals carrying the HLA-A *01 allele to develop EBV-positive cHL presumably relates to a less effective immune response against EBV derived peptides. 6. HLA-A *02:07 is an ethnic-specific HLA-A*02 allele variant that is related to a higher risk to develop EBV-positive cHL in the Chinese population. 7. I dreamed a thousand new paths ...

It has an incidence of~S per 100, 000 inhabitants in Western Europe and USA, but is less common in Asia with an incidence of <1 per 100, 000(1-3). HL can occur at any age, but is more frequent in young adults and elderly(4, 5). HL comprises two clinicopathological entities, namely nodular lymphocyte predominant HL(NLPHL) and classical HL(cHL)(6, 7). The latter is further subdivided based on the morphology of tumor cells and the composition of the background into four subtypes, i. e. thesis focuses on cHL, which accounts for about 95% of all HL cases. CHL is characterized by a unique morphology in which the major part of the tumor mass is made up of various inflammatory cells, while the neoplastic cells, termed Hodgkin Reed-Stemberg(HRS) cells account for less than 1% of the cells. The HRS cells are identified as large, sometimes bi-nucleated cells with prominent nucleoli and an unusual/CD45-, CD30+, CD15+/-immunophen otype(9). The lineage of HRS cells has been enigmatic for a -very long time. After successful introduction of the single cell isolation technology approximately two decades ago, HRS cells were pro-ven to be of germinal center B-cell origin based on presence of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements with a high load of somatic mutations(8, 9). Although the exact pathogenesis of cHL is still unknown, there is mounting evidence that a complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors contributes to the neoplastic dewlopm ent(10). Familial clustering of cHL and a 3~7 fold increased risk for cHL obseMd in siblings(11, 12) indicates that certain inherited traits increase the risk of de-veloping cHL. A major environmental factor 11 Chapter 1 is the Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) which is present in the HRS cells in a considerable proportion of cHL cases(13). 1. 2 Epstein Barr virus(EBV) The Epstein-Barr virus(EBV), human herpesvirus 4(HHV-4), is a B lymphotropic y-herpes virus that establishes a lifelong infection in > 90% of the total population wor1dwide, usually without causing symptoms (14). EBV is an enveloped virus with a 172-kb double-stranded DNA genome. Two EBV strains have been described: EBV-1 and EBV-2 (15). These two Vdriants differ in the sequence of genes coding for the EBV nuclear antigens(EBNA-2 and.EBNA-3) as well as in their efficiency to transform 8-cells in vitro. The EBV-2 strain is less efficient in transforming B cells than the EBV-1 strain ( 15 ). Epidemiological studies demonstrated that the preVdlence of theses two strains Vdries by geography. EBV-1 preVdils in Europe, America and Asia, while EBV-2 is predominant in Africa(16). The contribution of the different EBV strains to specific diseases is still not known, but it has been found that the virus Vdriant that preVdils in a certain geographic region is also predominant in the EBV-related diseases(17). The only known resen.oir for infectious EBV is in the oropharynx and EBV is transmitted by saliva. Besides being the causal agent of infectious mononucleosis (IM), EBV is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of several carcinomas and malignant lymphomas, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), Burkitt lymphoma(BL), cHL and lymphoproliferative disorders(LPD) arising in immuno-compromised individual s(18, 19). EBV can establish a productive(lytic) infection within its host cells, but its lifelong persistence depends on a nonproductiw(latent)cycle, in which six EBV nuclear antigens(EBNA -1, -2, -3A, - 38, 3C and LP) and three membrane proteins (LMP-1, -2A and -28) can be detected( 19). All EBV-associated malignancies in\\Olve the virus's latent cycle, 12 Introduction although in most tumors some of the EBV latency associated genes are not expressed(18). Three different types of latency have been established. Type I latency is generally found in BL with a predominant expression of EBNA 1. Type II latency, as seen in NPC and cHL, is characterized by expression of EBNA1 and two membrane proteins(LMP-1 and -2A). In Type Ill latency, all latency genes are expressed. Besides the latency type specific genes, EBERs(EBER -1 and -2) and BARF0 are usually also expressed in all types of latency. LMP1 and LMP2a, the two membrane proteins exclusively expressed by the HRS cells of EBV + cHL are well known for their ability to rescue pre-apoptotic germinal center B-cells, by mimicking CD40 and BCR signaling pathways (20) thereby contributing to or causing cHL development. 1. 2. 1 Immune control of EBV infection In healthy carriers, EBV infection is under the control of strong host immune surveillance. Only some indi\\iiduals develop cancer in spite of the strong oncogenic potential of EBV(21). Moreover, the observation of a high frequency of EBV-associated cHL and other EBV or immunodeficient indi\\iiduals ( 22) suggests that a defective immunity results in an impaired EBV-specific immunosurveillance and permits tumor development. It has been well-established that cellular immune responses are mandatory for protective immunity against EBV infection, consisting mainly of Natural Killer(NK} cell mediated lysis and T cell adaptive immune responses (23, 24). Especially CDS+ cytotoxic T-cell responses are considered to be of central importance in both limiting the primary infection and controlling the numbers of latently infected B cells (24, 25). To initiate an EBV\u00ad specific immune response, EBV-derived antigenic peptides need to be presented by HLA class I \\iia the endogenous processing pathway(2 3). In addition, there is accumulating e\\iidence that supports an essential role for HLA class II-restricted 13 Chapter 1 CD4+ T cell immune responses in the efficient eradication of EBV-infected cells (26, 27). 1. 2. 2 Infectious mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis(IM) was first described in 1920, but only until the late 1960s EBV was identified as its cause(28). The epidemiological features of IM with regard to its incidence and age distribution are in line with that of EBV infection. In Western populations, IM predominantly occurs in adolescents and is one of the most common infectious diseases in this age group ( 28, 29 ). In contrast, in Oriental populations, IM is a rather rare disease and more often occurs in childhood(30, 31 ). The obsen.etion that IM and EBV+ cHL ha\\e an o\\erlap in age peak has led to a linkage hypothesis between these tVvO diseases. Indeed, an excess risk for EBV-associated cHL was found in people with a history of IM with a typical incubation period from IM to cHL of 4~ 5 years(32-34 ). 1. 2. 3 Hodgkin lymphoma and associatioos with geography, age and subtypes The prevalence of EBV infection in cHL is known to be highly variable in different geographic regions and racial groups, ranging from 20% in western countries to nearly 100% in South-America. In Asia the percentage is around 60% (4, 5, 35, 36). The fact that EBV can only be detected in a proportion of cHL cases suggests that another infectious agent or a different pathogenic pathway is im,olved in the development of EBV negative cHL cases. Thus, EBV-associated and non-associated cHL may represent two distinct etiological entities (37). In different racial groups a high incidence peak of non-EBV-associated cHL is always present in young adults. However there is marked heterogeneity in the prevalence of EBV-associated cHL with respect to patients' age, gender, race, and histological subtype (21, 38). In Western countries, a first incidence peak 14 Introduction occurs in adolescence and in young adults(15~ 34 years) and a second peak in older adults(> <50 years). In contrast, in Oriental countries a first peak presents much earlier in childhood. A second incidence peak in the elderly is similar to western countries. A male predominance in the prevalence of cHL, especially in EBV-associated cases has been reported by numerous studies(4, 5). In addition, EBV-associated cHL has a strong association with the MC subtype. 1. 3 Human Leukokocyte Antigen associations The genes encoding the human major histocompatibility antigen, also called human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) encompass 7. 6 Mb of the short arm of chromosome 6 and can be subdivided into HLA-class I and class II genes. This region is the most gene dense locus in the human genome and some of its extremely polymorphic genes code for the antigen-binding groows of multiple HLA molecules. These highly polymorphic genes and codominant HLA expression result in a great variation in the repertoire of antigenic peptides that can be presented to the immune system. HLA class I is constitutiwly expressed on the membrane of all nucleated cells and presents proteasome degraded endogenous peptides of 8-11 amino acids in length to CDB+CTLs. In contrast, HLA class II has a restricted pattern of expression and can be detected on the surface of professional antigen-presenting cells(dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells), activated T cells and activated endothelium. The HLA class II molecule binds and presents antigenic peptides of 11-17 amino acids in length to CD4+ T cells via exogenous processing pathways. The potential role of immune-dysregulation in the pathogenesis of human cancers in concert with the vital importance of the HLA system in the regulation of host immune responses haw attracted special attention on HLA-based disease associations. Aberrant expression of classical and non-class ical HLA class I and II molecules by tumor cells obsen.ed in a number of human 15 Chapter 1 malignancies indicates that downregulation or complete loss of HLA molecules is a mechanism for tumor cells to escape from host immune surveillance (39-42). Moreover, certain HLA alleles have been reported to be associated with disease susceptibility and resistance in more than 40 different diseases(41, 42). Certain HLA alleles were found to be the most significant genetically determined factor in predicting a high or low risk for several common autoimmune diseases, such as HLA-B27 and ankylosing spondyli tis(AS), ( CD ) ( 43 ). With accumulating evidence supporting a role of host immunos urveillance in cancer de\\elopment and progression, HLA and cancer associations attracted a lot of attention and have been investigated in different human malignancies. HLA\u00ad DQB1*0301 and HLA-DRB1*04051 were reported to confer an increased risk for gastric adenocarcinoma in Caucasians and Japanese respectively(44, 45). HLA\u00ad DQB1*0301 also was linked with genetic predisposition melanoma in Caucasians ( 46 ). HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*11 were associated with genetic susceptibility or resistance to NPC in the Southern Chinese population. 1. 3. 1 HLA antigen expression in HRS cells Expression of HLA class I and class II antigens by HRS cells in cHL have been investigated in the western population by several research groups ( 47-49 ). Downregulation or absence of membranous expression of HLA class I by HRS cells in cHL ranged from 30 to 40% of cases in different studies. Studies showed a positive correlation between HLA class I expression and EBV status in cHL. Downregulation or lack of HLA class II expression was observed in the HRS cells of 40~ 50% cHL. Diepstra et al(50) reported that HLA class II expression was closely correlated with positive EBV status. Although this association was not statistically significant in the study of Oudejans et al. , a trend to maintain the expression of HLA class II was observed in EBV+pa tients(49 ). Another interesting 16 Introduction finding was the negative association between HLA class II expression and response to first line therapy as well as relative sur..Aval in cHL reported by Diepstra et al(SO). 1. 3. 2 HLA-lin ked genetic susc eptibility in cHL patients CHL was one of the first diseases for which an association was observed with HLA serotypes and the first description dates back to 1967 (51 ). An important rationale for a particular interest in exploring HLA associations with cHL is its well-documented infectious etiology. As mentioned earlier, the immune control of EBV infection mainly depends on HLA-restricted T-cell responses. Moreover, it is well-known that different HLA alleles possess different abilities to bind and present EBV-derived antigenic peptides to effector cells. This indicates that the specificity of HLA alleles is an important determinant for the effectiveness of controlling EBV infection. Thus, certain HLA alleles may predispose to the development of EBV-related diseases. An extensive literature search on the relationship between HLA and cHL susceptibility reveals that specific HLA serotypes and alleles can confer a decreased or increased risk for both familial and sporadic cHL in Caucasians(52 - 54). In a genetic screening approach using polymorphic microsatellite markers, two markers located in the HLA class I region were reported to be associated with EBV-positive cHL in a Dutch population ( 54 ). Subsequent studies demonstrated that two specific HLA-A alleles, HLA-A*01 and A*02 are associated with an increased and decreased risk for EBV-associated cHL respectively in a Dutch and Scottish population (55). Moreowr, recent studies also proposed that individuals carrying the HLA-A * 01 allele have an increased risk to dewlap IM(56), further substantiating the etiological linkage(EBV infection) between the two diseases. 17 Chapt er 1 In conclusion Classical HL is a distinct malignancy of the lymphoid system with an unusual and complex morphology, epidemiology and etiology. It's evident that the HRS cells employ multiple strategies to escape from host immune surveillance and the quality of antigen presentation in the context of HLA might be a crucial pathogenic factor. Accordingly, multiple HLA associations with cHL have been reported. Moreowr, associations specifically with EBV associated cHL strengthen the importance of HLA in cHL. The potential effect of HLA alleles on the outcome of EBV infection suggests a HLA-linked genetic susceptibility to EBV-associated cancers. Furthermore, because of the highly polymorphic nature of the HLA system and its ethnic linkage, the HLA associations may explain the epidemiological heterogeneity of this disease. In addition, it might also prode an opportunity for the generation of rus-specific HLA-restricted T-cells to be used in immunotherapeutic approaches. 1. 4 The scope of this thesis This thesis focuses on the comparison between cHL patients with a different ethnic background for the association of EBV, HLA antigen expression as well as HLA-based immunogenetics. A description on epidemiological features of 371 cHL patients from Northern China diagnosed during 1997 -2008 is giwn in chapter 2. In chapter 3, for the first time, the expression of HLA antigens by HRS cells in association with EBV status is shown in a group of Chinese cHL patients. Since the highly prevalent HLA-A * 02 allele was found to be protective against EBV+ cHL in a Dutch population, we next studied the significance of this allele in Chinese cHL patients in chapter 4. In chapter 5, a comprehensive screening of all classical HLA alleles was carried out using DNA samples from 338 Dutch cHL patients to further define the most relevant candidate genes or SNPs associated with(EBV -associated) cHL. 18 Introduction References (1) Clarke CA, Glaser SL, Keegan TH, Stroup A.

PLoS One; provisio nally accepted Chapter 2 Abstract Background: The incidence of classical Hodgkin lymphoma ( cHL) and its association with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV) varies significantly with age, sex, ethnicity and geographic location. This is the first report on epidemiological features of cHL patients from Northern China. These features are compared to data from a previously published Dutch cHL population. Methodology/ Principal Findings: 371 cHL patients diagnosed between 1997 and 2008 in the North of China were included. EBV status was determined by immunoh istochemistry for latent membrane protein 1 and/or in situ hybridization of EBV-encoded small RNAs. The Dutch population -based cohort included 515 cHL patients diagnosed between 1987 and 2000. In the Chinese populatio n, tumor cells of 41% of the cHL patients were EBV+and this was significantly associated with male sex, mixed cellularity subtype and young age(<20y). Median age of Chinese patients was 10 years younger than that of Dutch patients(27y vs 37y). In addition, the age distribution between the two populations was strikingly different in both the EBV+subgroups( p=1. 8x1O8) and the EBV-subgroups(p =1. 8x10-4). Chinese patients had a higher male-to-female ratio than Dutch patients(2. 1 vs 1. 4 in all patients and 3. 3 vs 1. 9 in the EBV+subg roup). Conclusion/ Significance: CHL patients from Northern China show a distincti\\e age distribution pattern with a striking incidence peak among children and young adults. In comparison to Dutch cHL patients there are pronounced differences in age distribution, sex, subtype and EBV status, presumably caused by complex gene-environmental interactions . 26 Epidemiology of Chinese cHL Introduction Classical Hodgkin lymphoma ( cHL) is a heterogeneous malignancy with a complex etiology and epidemiology. In general, cHL accounts for about 1% of all cancers and~ 30% of the lymphoid malignancies worldwide ( 1 ). Epidemiologic studies of cHL demonstrate a remarkable di\\ersity of the incidence according to age, sex, ethnic background, geographic location and socioeconomic status (2, 3). The highest incidence was reported among Caucasians, followed by African Americans and Hispanics, and the lowest incidence was found in Orientals (3). Data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (http://globocan. iarc. fr/) shows a nearly 6-fold difference between Western Europe and East Asia with an incidence of 2. 3 and 0. 4 per 100, 000 inhabitants per year respecti\\ely in 2008. A genetic explanation for this difference has been shown in a multi-ethnic study of cHL in the United States that reported the lowest incidence rate in Asian immigrants in comparison to other ethnic origins ( 4 ). Howe\\er, a trend of increasing incidence of HL was reported among Chinese immigrants in western countries(4, 5), suggesting an influence of westernization. The incidence pattern by age was also shown to be different between Caucasian and Oriental population s(6, 7). Western populations typically haw a bimodal age distribution with two peaks near 25 and 60ys. In Orientals, a first incidence peak usually presents in childhood with a second peak in the elderly, although in Japanese cHL patients the early incidence peak was reported to be absent(4, 8). In a proportion of cHL patients, Epstein-Barr \\1rus (EBV) is present in the tumor cells and EBV is accepted as a causal agent in these patients(?, 9). There is a striking variability in the percentage of EBV im,olwd cases between racial groups and geographic locations (2, 10). The proportion of EBV in\\Olwment is almost 100% in Hispanic cHL patients( 11), much lower in Caucasians(20 ~40%) (2, 12) and intermediate in Orientals (13, 14). In general, the EBV association with 27 Chapter 2 cHL is related to age, being the strongest in children and the elderly(15, 16). In addition, male sex and the mixed cellularity (MC) histological subtype are associated with EBV+cHL worldwide( 15, 17). The current study was undertaken to in\\\u20acstigate the epidemiolog ical characteristics of cHL patients from Northern China. In addition, these characteristics were compared to data from a previously reported Dutch cHL patient population(18). Materials and Methods Patient sele ction and data collect ion 371 cHL patients, of whom sex, age, histological subtype and EBV status were known, were included in this study(19). These patients resided in the Northern area of China and were diagnosed with cHL during the period of 1997 to 2008 at the Dept. of Pathology, Health Science Center, Peking University. 198 of these cHL patients were diagnosed and treated in the affiliated hospitals of Peking University. The other 173 patients were submitted for consultation to confirm the diagnosis and were mainly from other hospitals in Beijing City and the hospitals of its neighboring city or provinces including Tianjin City, Hebei Province, Shanxi Province and Jilin Province. For all patients we retrieved the original data including patients' sex, age, histological subtype and tumor cell EBV status at the time of diagnosis from the pathology database. Ethical approval for this study was not required by these institutions as the experiments carried out did not elate to patients privacy or treatment. Research was conducted adhering to the Declaration of Helsinki and according to Dutch regulations (http://www. federa. org/). The institutional review board (the Medical Ethics Review Board of the University Medical Center Groningen) specifically waived the need for ethics approval. 28 Epidemiol ogy of Chinese cHL Histopat hological reclassification Haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from 157 formalin paraffin embedded tissue blocks were available for histological reclassification according to the most recent WHO classification system ( 1 ) which categorizes cHL into four histological subgroups, e. mixed cellularity (MC), lymphocyte rich(LR) and lymphocyte depletion(LD). Cases without enough tissue for proper evaluation of the background architecture were designated as cHL not otherwise specified(NOS). EBV status For 246 cases latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) staining was performed by immunohistochemis try ( IHC) in a routine diagnostic setting to determine the presence of EBV using the CS1-4 antibody(DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). For 236 cHL cases, presence of EBV in tumor cells was determined by EBER in situ hybridization(ISH) with a fluorescein-conjugated PNA probe specific for the EBV\u00ad encoded EBER RNAs ( DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) using standard laboratory protocols. Appropriate positive and negative controls were included in all analysis. Statistical analysis Differences between EBV + and EBV-groups in relation to age, sex and histopathological subtype were assessed by Chi square test, Fisher's exact test or Mann Whitney U test. The data were analyzed with SPSS for Windows, version 17. 0. A p-value<0. 05 was considered significant. 29 Chapter 2 Results Detection of E BV IHC for LMP1 was performed in 246 patients and was positiw in 32%. ISH for EBERs was carried out in 236 cHL patients and rewaled presence of EBV in 44%. For 111 cases EBV status was determined with both methods and the concordance rate was 87. 4% {Table 1 ). In the 14 discrepant cases, 12 were negatiw for LMP1 and positiw for EBER and 2 were negative for EBERs and positiw for LMP1. Since EBER ISH has been widely accepted as\u00b7 the golden standard for detection of EBV latent infection, we used the results of the EBER ISH for these 14 cases. Taking the results of the EBER ISH(n=236 ) together with those of the cases that were analyzed only by LMP1 staining(n= 135) rewaled EBV positivity in 41% Table 1 EBER ISH and LMP-1 IHC in Chinese cHL patients EBER + EBER - 32(28. 8%+) 79 111 157 cHL cases were re-evaluated for histological classification of the subtype. The histological subtype could not be unequi\\Ocally determined in 29(18%) cases and was designated cHL-NOS. Six and 9 of these cases were previously classified as LR and MC subtype respectiwly. Discrepancies in the classification were obserwd in 5 out of 13 LR cases and 6 out of 57 MC cases which were reclassified as MC and NS subtype respectively. All original NS diagnoses were 30 Epidemiology of Chinese cHL reclassified as NS subtype. A consistent classification was achie\\ed for 117 of 128(91. 4%} cHL cases. In the total Chinese patient population, NS was the most common subtype, accounting for 48% of cases(n= 161 }, 1) of 2). Distribut ion of age, sex and histological subtypes The male to female ratio was 2. 1: 1 in the total group, 3. 3: 1 in the EBV + group and 1.6mm:1 in the EBV-group(p=O. 001}. The MC subtype(63%} was more common in EBV+cHL patients and the NS subtype(69%) was more common in the EBV-group(p =1. 9x10-20). The median age of cHL patients in the EBV+group was similar to that of the EBV-cHL patient group (27 years, range:3-76ys and 27 years, range:6-75ys respecti\\ely)(Table 2). Howe\\er, comparison of the 10 years age group distribution between EBV + and EBV-patients did show a highly statistically significant difference (p = 2. 6x10-12 )(Figure 2). Patients in the age groups from Oto 20 and from 70 to 80 years of age were significantly more often EBV+, while patients aged 20 to 30 were significantly more often EBV-. 31 w I Table 2 Distribution of age,sex and histology by EBV status in Chinese cHL patients I Reclassified Not reclassified All patients EBV+ EBV- 152 n= 219 p n % n % n % n % n % Sex Male 101 64 149 70 250 67 117 77 133 61 o.oof Female 56 36 65 30 121 33 35 23 86 39 Histological subtype NS 80 62.5 81 39.7 161 48 24 18 137 69 1.9X10' 20t MC 46 35.9 84 41.2 130 39 83 63 47 24 LR 2 1.6 38 18.6 40 12 27 20 13 7 LD 1 0.5 1 0.3 1 0.5 NOS 29 10 39 18 21 Median age(range) 28 (4~ 74) 27 (3~ 76) 27 (3~ 76) 27 (3~ 76) 27 (6~ 75) 0.298i Chi square test,t Fisher's exact test, NOS cases were excluded ,+Mann Whitney U test, NS of Chinese cHL Comparison betvveen Chinese and Dutch cHL patients The median age of Chinese patients(27ys, range: 3-76ys} was 10 years younger than that of the Dutch population(37ys, range: 8--94ys }(p= 1. 3 X 10-11 } and distribution in 10-year intef'Vclls was significantly different(p=1. 3X 10-11)(Figure 1, Table 3 }.

Comparison of the EBV+Chinese patient group with the EBV + Dutch patient group showed a striking difference in the age distribution (p= 1. 8 X 108 )(Figure '2A, Table 3). Also the age distribution of the EBV-Chinese patients was significantly different from the EBV\u00ad Figure 1 Age distribution of Dutch and Chinese cHL patients in consecutiw 10-year inten.els. Age distribution is shown for 371 patients from Northern China{black) and 515 patients from the Northern part of the Netherlands (grey). A significant difference was obser\\ed in the age distribution between these two patients groups (p = 1. 3 X 10\"11 ). These two cunes exhibit a somewhat similar trend with apparent differences at the first and sixth decades between the Chinese and the Dutch population {9% w 1% and 7% w 12% respectiwly). The Chinese population has more patients among the first three decades as compared to the Dutch population, both ha\"1ng the highest peak in the third decade. The Chinese population does not show a second incidence peak at around 60 years. 33 Chapter 2 30% ,,,..,,-,,.,- Figure 2 Age distribution of Dutch and Chinese cHL patients stratified by EBV status.

This difference was more pronounced in the EBV + group where males were owrrepresented in the Chinese as compared to the Dutch population (3. 3: 1 vs 1. 8: 1 )(p = 0. 016), whereas in the EBV-group there was no significant difference. The differences in the male to female ratio in the Dutch population were less pronounced(1. 4: 1 in the total, 1. 2: 1 in the EBV-and 1. 8: 1 in the EBV + group) as compared to the Chinese population (Table 4).

The results of this comparison were comparable 35 Chapter 2 to those of the total Chinese patient group(data not shown). Discus sion Epidemiological studies on cHL haw shown significant variation in age and EBV distribution in relation to ethnic background and geographic location. Asians are known to haw the lowest incidence of cHL and an intermediate proportion of EBV-associated cHL(3). Previously, a few studies reported on cHL epidemiology in Taiwan and Hong Kong, populations that are closely related to the Southern Chinese population (13, 20-22). Importantly, the Northern Chinese population is genetically different from the Southern Chinese population, especially in the distribution of Human Leukocyte Antigen(HLA) types. Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( UNPC ), another EBV-associated malignancy with a latent EBV expression pattern similar to EBV+cH L, is endemic in Southern China but not in Northern China. Previous studies proposed that the geographic- restricted distribution of the UNPC susceptibility allele HLA-A*02:07 might well explain the high incidence of UNPC in the Southern Chinese population . Thus, differences in cHL incidence and epidemiology might also be expected in different Chinese regions. The main aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiology of cHL in the Northern part of China, a population that has not been studied before. Previous studies found that cHL was EBV+at a frequency of 65% (n=23) and 61% (n=28) by combining the results of LMP1 IHC and EBER ISH in cHL patients from Hong Kong, China and Taiwan respectiwly (13, 14, 21 ). These frequencies are higher than the 41% of EBV positivity identified in the present patient group. Howewr, the patient cohort size in the current study(n=371) was much larger than these previous studies. The difference in EBV positivity was only marginally influenced by determination of EBV status by LMP1 IHC in a subset of patients. EBER ISH only slightly increased the percentage of EBV positivity from 41 % to 44%. Besides the population size, 36 Epidemiology of Chinese cHL differences in EBV prevalence might also be influenced by intra-ethnic en\\Aronmental and genetic variations. Consistent with pre\\Aous findings in Chinese and other ethnic groups of cHL patients, the incidence of EBV+cHL was significantly higher in males and the MC subtype(2}. A shift in the histological classification upon histopathological re\u00ad examination was obserwd in 8. 6% (n = 11} of the cases, partly explained by changes in the WHO classification guidelines. Agreement was specifically poor for the LR and MC subtypes. Due to the lack of enough tissue for evaluating the background architecture, 15 cases pre\\Aously diagnosed as LR or MC subtype were re-assigned as cHL-NOS. O\\erall, the histological distribution was similar to those reported in pre\\Aous Chinese populations from Hong Kong and Taiwan(13, 23). Until now, there are four studies that inwstigated the age distribution of cHL in the Chinese population (13, 20-22}. Three studies, including two from Hong Kong(n=23 and n=92)(13, 20) and another one from Taiwan(n=70)(21 ), identified a bimodal age distribution with two peaks at the second and sixth decades respecth,ely, whereas another study from Taiwan(n=42}(22) found a single age peak at the 3rd decade. Only consistent with this last study, we also found a unimodal age distribution with a distinctiw peak incidence occurring at the 3rd decade. Only two of the four studies (Hong Kong and Taiwan) included EBV status into the analyses(13, 21}. Our results were consistent with these studies for EBV-cHL patients with a single incidence peak in young-adults. Howewr, our EBV+cHL patients did not show an incidence peak in the elderly, in contrast to both other studies. Comparison of the Chinese and Dutch cHL populations rewaled an inter\u00ad ethnic significant difference in the age distribution in the total patient groups and also in the EBV+and EBV-subgroups separately. A bimodal pattern for the age distribution of cHL in general as well as in the EBV + subgroup is considered 37 Chapter 2 typical for the Western population and this was also present in our Dutch cohort. It has been reported that in the Asian cHL population, an early peak should be less ob'Aous and at a younger age compared to the Western population, whereas a second peak at older age should be similar(4, 8). Intriguingly, our Chinese population had an e\\1dent early peak similar to the Dutch population but lacked the peak at older age. It is unlikely that this could be the result of an age dependent selection bias in the Chinese population. According to the literature, EBV+Asian cHL shows a similar age distribution as EBV-Asian cHL. Howe'ver, in the present study EBV+cHL had a different and pronounced incidence peak at adolescence. In both the Chinese and the Dutch populations a clear peak for the EBV-patients was obser'ved at the 3rd decade. Remarkably, this peak was higher in the Chinese population than in the Dutch population(38% vs 27% ). An inter-ethnic difference was also obseMd for the sex distribution of all patients and of the EBV+cHL patients. In general, the Chinese population had a higher male-to-female ratio than the Dutch population (2. 1 vs 1. 4) and this difference was elven more prominent in EBV + cHL patients (3. 3 vs 1. 9) and \\1rtually absent in EBV-cHL patients(1. 5 vs 1. 2). In conclusion, we demonstrate a distincti've age distribution pattern in by far the largest reported group of Northern Chinese cHL patients with a striking incidence peak among young adults. Moreo'ver, we identified large inter-ethnic differences in the distribution of age, sex, EBV status and histological subtype in comparison to a Caucasian population. Both genetic and en\\1ronmental factors are expected to play a role in these differences. 38 Epidemiology of Chinese cHL References (1)Swerdlow SH, Campo E, Harris NL, et al.

PloS One 2010, 5(5):e10865 Chapter 3 Abstract Background: In Caucasian populations, the tumor cells of Epstein Barr rus (EBV }-positi-ve classical Hodgkin Lymphomas ( cHL) patients more frequently express HLA class I and HLA class II molecules compared to EBV-negati-ve cHL patients. HLA expression(in relation to EBV) in Asian cHL patients has not been preously inwstigated. Methodology /Principal Findings: We randomly selected 145 cHL patients with formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue blocks available from 5 hospitals from the Northern part of China. Hematoxylin & Eosin-stained slides were used to reclassify the histological subtypes according to the WHO classification. EBV status was determined by sualization of EBERs in tumor cells using in situ hybridization. Membranous expression of HLA molecules was detected by immunohi stochemistry using antibodies HC-10(class I heavy chain) and anti- 2- microglobulin for HLA class I, and CR3/43 for HLA class II. EBV+tumor cells were obserwd in 40% (58/145) of the cHL patients. As expected, the percentage of EBV+cases was much higher in the mixed cellularity subtype(71%) than in the nodular sclerosis subtype (16%) (p < 0. 001 ). Expression of HLA class I was obserwd in 79% of the EBV+cHL cases and in 30% of the EBV-cases(p<0. 001). For HLA class 11, 52% of EBV+cHL cases were positi-ve, compared to 43% in EBV-cases(p=0. 28). Conclusions:The results in the Northern China population were similar to those in the Caucasian population for HLA class I, but not for HLA class II. 42 HLA expression in Chinese cHL patients Introd uction Classical Hodgkin lymphoma ( cHL} is a malignant neoplasm of the immune system, characterized by a minority of B cell deriwd tumor cells, named Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells ( HRS cells} and numerous reactiw cells consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells. The HRS cells are large, sometimes bi-or multinucleated cells vvith prominent nucleoli and a and CD15 +/-immunophenotype ( 1 ). The presence of HRS cells in an abundant inflammatory infiltrate indicates that anti\u00ad tumor immune responses apparently are insufficient for the eradication of HRS cells. It has been shown that the tumor cells of cHL employ sewral mechanisms to escape from immune responses, ewn more so in Epstein Barr virus (EBV) associated cases (2-4 ). EBV has been acknowledged as the major infectious agent causing cHL, although the proportion of EBV associated cHL varies from 20% to nearly 100% in different populations (3, 5). In addition, the proportion of EBV+cases is also age-dependent with a first high incidence peak in children and a second peak in adults around age 60 (3, 5). EBV-infected HRS cells consistently express a limited set of proteins, consisting of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1 ). latent membrane protein 2(LMP2} and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA 1 } ( 5 ). Antigenic peptides deriwd from these three proteins can be processed and presented by the human leukocyte antigen(HLA} class I and class II pathways, the efficiency of which largely depends on the peptide binding affinity of the highly polymorphic HLA alleles (6-9}. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes {CTLs) are known to be the primary effector cells to eradicate EBV-infected B cells that present LMP1 and LMP2 antigenic peptides in the context of appropriate HLA class I molecules (6, 7). In addition, there's in \"1tro evidence that EBV infection and the related malignant transformation are controlled by CD4 + T cells, depending on HLA class II restricted antigen presentation (10}. In other words, 43 Chapter 3 both HLA class I-restricted CTL responses and HLA class II-restricted CD4 + T\u00ad cell responses are essential for a successfu l anti-tumor immune defense. Therefore, downregulation of HLA class I and HLA class II antigens might be implicated in the pathogenesis of cHL by allowing tumor cells to escape host immunosurveillance. Sewral research groups haw studied the association between HLA expression and cHL in the Western population (11-16), but nothing is known for the Asian population. Since HLA types are known to widely differ between Caucasians and Asians, we set out to inwstigate the expression of HLA molecules in Chinese cHL cases for drawing comparison between the two populations. We studied HLA class I as well as HLA class II expression in relation to EBV status in a population from the Northern part of China. Materials and Methods Patient material Formalin-fixed paraffin-emb edded tissue blocks of lymph node biopsies from 145 cHL patients were obtained from 5 hospitals in northern China(Dept. of Pathology, Health Science Center, Peking Uniwrsity; Dept. of Pathology, First Hospital of Jilin Uniwrsity; Dept. of Patholog y, Shougang Hospital, Peking Uni\\ersity; Dept. of Pathology, Beijing Air Army General Hospital; Zhanye Regional Hospital, Gansu Pro\\tince ). The biopsies were stained with hematoxylin & eosin(H&E) and histopathological subtyping was performed according to the WHO classification. In situ hybridization Detection of EBV in tumor cells was performed by in situ hybridization(ISH) on paraffin sections with a fluorescein-conjugated PNA probe specific for the EBV\u00ad encoded EBER RNAs(DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). A known EBV+tissue section 44 HLA expression in Chinese cHL patients was used as a positive control. lmm unohistoch emical staining xylene and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series into water. Microwave antigen retrieVal was performed with Tris-EDTA solution (10mM Tris Base, 1mM EDTA Solution, PH 9. and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked in 3% H2O2. The expression of HLA class I was detected using monoclonal antibody HC-10 at a dilution of 1: 200 (kindly provided by Prof. dr. J. Neefjes, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam}, which recognizes HLA Band C molecules, as well as a few HLA-A molecules (17). In addition, the polyclonal rabbit anti human 2-microglobulin (DAKO} at a dilution of 1: 200 was used as an additional marker to detect HLA class I. For detection of HLA class 11, we used the CR3/43 monoclonal antibody (DAKO} that binds to a specific monomorphic epitope in the chain of HLA-DP, HLA-DQ and HLA-DR. All antibodies were detected using a standard Avidin Biotin Complex(ABC} immunoperoxidase method. Diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogen and hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. Evaluation of HLA class I and class II staining HLA class I heavy chain (HC-10} staining was scored simultaneously with 2- microglobulin staining. The same scoring rules were used for HLA class II. The surrounding inflammatory cells were used as an internal positive control and also as a reference for assessing the intensity of HLA expression by HRS cells. A strong membranous staining on at least 50% of the tumor cells was identified as positive. In case the staining intensity on the tumor cells was similar to the intensity on the surrounding \u00b7 reactive cells, membranes in between adjacent tumor cells were eValuated. 45 Chapter 3 Statistical analysis HLA expression was determined in relation to EBV status. Differences between EBV + and EBV-neg groups in relation to HLA expression as well as sewral clinicopathologic variables were assessed by Chi square test, Fisher's exact test or Mann Whitney U test. The correlation between HLA class I and class II expression was evaluated with Chi square test. In addition, multivariate analysis using logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounders. The data were analyzed with SPSS for windows, wrsion 16. 0. A p-value <O. 05 was considered significant. Results Clinicopa thologic features 145 patients diagnosed with cHL were subdided into histological subtypes according to the WHO classification. Subtype could not be unequi\\Ocally determined in 18% ( n = 26 ), usually because there was not enough tissue to properly evaluate the background architecture. These patients were classified as cHL, not otherwise specified ( NOS ). In the remaining patients the nodular sclerosis(NS) subtype was the most common one, accounting for 63% (n=75) of patients, followed by mixed cellularity (MC) with 35% (n = 42) of patients. The rich(LR) subtype was rare(n=2) and the lymphocyte depleted subtype was absent. The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 28 years, ranging from 4 to 74 years. There was a clear male predominance with a male to female ratio of 2: 1. EBV statu s and clinicopat hologic variables EBER staining showed consistent nuclear labeling in all HRS cells in 40% of the 46 HLA expression in Chinese cHL patients patients(n=5 8)(see figure 1 ). A low numb er of positi\\\u20ac small bystander cells were obseMd in some cases . Subtype and sex demonstr ated ally signi differences between EBV+ case s . As expected , the MC subtype showed the highest percentage of EBV + cases (30 of 42 case s [71%]). In addition, males more frequently had EBV + cHL than female s ( 48% compar ed to 24% ). In terms of patients' age, no significant difference was found between EBV -asso ciated and non-EBV -associa ted cHL(Table 1 ). 1 Distribution of age, sex and histology by status All patients 13. :tMann Whitney U test, \u00b7 Chi square test, tFisher's exact test, NS indicates nodular sclerosis; MC, mixed cellularity; LR, lymphocyte rich; Chapter .. , -ti , ' ' signal in the nucleus of all Hodgkin a'ld Reed--Stemberg(HRS) cells as well as in some small reactM cells (orinal magnifica tion HC-10 antibody) expression in cHL.

In most patients with HLA class I positive tumor cells, the HRS cells showed a higher staining intensity than the reactive background cells, especially in EBV+cases(see figure 2A). For HLA class II expression by tumor cells, 46% of patients (n = 67) were positive. Usually, the HRS cells were surrounded by HLA class II negative reactive cells (see figure 28 ). In 26% of patients(n=38) there was co-expression of HLA class I and class 11, whereas in 30% of patients(n=44) the tumor cells were double negative. Although there was a trend for HLA class I negative cases to also be HLA class II negative, and vice versa, this correlation was not statistically significant (Table 2). Correlat ion between expression of HLA, EBV status and clinicopa thologic variab les The results of HLA class I and HLA class II expression in relation to EBV status, the different histological subtypes, sex and age are summarized in Table 3. Expression of HLA class I was significantly more frequent in EBV+ than in subtypes correlated with HLA class I expression, with the highest frequency of positive expression in the MC subtype (32/42=76% ) and the 3% )(P<0. 001 ). Using multiVdriate logistic regression analysis a significant effect of EBV status on HLA class I expression was observed after adjusting for histological subtype (P<0. 001). Howewr subtype did not remain significant when correcting for EBV status implying that EBV status explained the observed association between histological subtype and HLA class I expression. In contrast, HLA class II expression was not associated with EBV or subtype. Neither HLA class I nor 49 Chapter 3 HLA class II expression was found to correlate with patients' age. In addition, our data showed that Chinese female cHL patients more frequently maintained expression of HLA class ll(P=O. 01 ), but not expression of HLA class I. Comparison betvveen Chinese and Dutch cHL patients The data from the current Chinese population were compared with data from a population based study in the Netherlands, performed by our group(12). EBV positivity and MC subtype were more common in Chinese cHL patients than in Dutch cHL patients (40% vs. 33% and 29% vs. 11%, respectiw ly). In the Chinese cHL patients, the proportion of children was higher(age<18:22. 8% vs. 9. 2% ). while that of the elderly was lower (age>60: 9. 0% vs. 15. 8% ). A similar association of HLA class I expression with EBV status was obserwd in both populations. Howewr, expression of HLA class II highly correlated with HLA class I in the Dutch population, which was not the case in Chinese patients. Loss of HLA class II expression by HRS cells was more common in Chinese compared to Dutch patients(54% vs. 41% ). This difference was independent of sex, EBV status and histological subtype, shown using a multivariate logistic regression model (P=O. 012). Table 4 shows that in Dutch patients the expression of HLA class II was strongly associated with EBV positivity (P = 0. 005). Also, the NS subtype was more frequently deficient in HLA class II expression than the MC subtype (P=O. 016). Neither of these associations was obserwd in the Chinese cHL patients. Howe\\er, only in the Chinese cHL patients an association between sex and HLA class II expression was obserwd (P=O. 01 ). 50 HLA expression in Chinese cHL patients Table 2 Correlation between HLA class I and class II expression HLA class I p+ Positiwn=72 Negatiwn=73 HLA 1\u00b0/o(n=34) 60. 3% (n=44) + Chi square test Table 3 HLA class I and class II expression by HRS cells in relation to EBV status, histology, sex and median age HLA class I 0. 666t + Chi square test,\u00b7 Fisher's exact test, NOS histology not included, + Mann Whitney U test, NS indicates nodular sclerosis; MC, mixed cellularity; LR, lymphocyte rich; NOS, not otherwise specified. 51 Chapter 3 Ta ble 4 Comparison of the associa tion of HLA class II expression with EBV status and histological subtypes between Dutch* and Chinese cHL patients Dutch patients\u00b7 Chinese patients HLA class II P* HLA class II P* Positive Negative Positive Negative (n =171) (n =121) (n =29) =30) 3% 64. 1% 62. 1% NS 0. 016 + 0. 795 + (n =143) (n =103) (n =34) 57. 9% 58. 7% 55. 2% 75. 6% Male 0. 89 0. 01 (n =99) (n =71) (n =37) (n =19) age 34(8~88) 32(8~ 88) 0. 85 28(4~ 74) 28(4~ 74) (ra nge) iChi square test, \u00b7 Data haw been publis hed(Diepstra A et aI(12), t Comparison was made between NS and MC subtype only, # Mann Whitney U test, s Classical Hodgkin lymphoma not otherwise specified excluded, HLA sion in Chinese cHL patients Discussion This study imolved the largest group of northern Chinese cHL patients evaluated for expression of HLA class I and HLA class II by HRS cells. HLA class I expression was strongly associated with EBV-positi\\Aty, similar to the Caucasian populations. However, an association between HLA class II expression and EBV status was not apparent, in contrast to the data from Western Europe. The EBV association with cHL has been investigated by several research groups within different geographic locales and ethnicities, showing a common association between EBV-associated cHL, male sex and MC subtype (3, 5). These associations were also present in this northern Chinese patient population. Although the pathogen esis of cHL is still not clearly established, immune escape mechanisms seem to play an important role, especially in cases that are EBV-associated. Downregula tion of HLA on the surface of tumor cells has been obserwd in various types of human malignancies, including cHL{1 8). Our present data demonstrate that deficiency in membranous expression of HLA antigen by tumor cells is quite common in EBV-neg cHL, since 49. 7% and 46. 2% cases expressed HLA class I or class II respectively and only 26. 2% cases expressed both. Lack of HLA expression is generally thought to be advantageous for the persistence of tumor cells by escaping T cell mediated immunosurveillance. An intriguing finding is that HLA class I expression is usually retained in EBV+ cases, although HLA class I-restricted CTL responses in general play a major role in eliminating \\Arus infection. This correlation is consistent with the results of four previous studies performed on Caucasian cHL populations from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom(13, 14, 16). Our data also show a correlation between HLA class I expression and MC subtype, which can be attributed to the 53 Chapter 3 close relationship of EBV im,oh,ement with MC subtype. It is apparent that not only the quantity, but also the quality of HLA molecules determines the ability to mount an immune response. The composition of HLA alleles determines the peptide-binding ability and the subsequent immune response. A recent report on a detailed im,estigation within the HLA region lends proof to this concept, as patients with EBV-associated cHL more frequently carry HLA-A *01 in comparison to EBV-negati\\e cHL patients who usually carry HLA-A * 02 instead (11, 15). It should be noted that persistence of HLA class I expression can be advantageous for the tumor cells to survive Natural Killer cell-mediated lysis(19). HLA class II-restricted CD4 T cell immune responses are largely, but not exclusiwly restricted to exogenous antigens and it has become evident that these responses are essential for an efficient eradication of EBV infection (10). Our group previously reported a significant association of HLA class II expression with EBV status in 292 Dutch cHL patients. In contrast, we did not find this association in the Chinese population in the current study, although we could see a slight non-significant tendency to maintain the expression of HLA class II in EBV-associated cHL. In addition, the previously reported correlation between the expression of HLA class I and class 11(12) was absent in the present study. A major difference between the Dutch and Chinese population is the percentage of MC subtype patients with 10. 6% and 28. 9% of patients respectively. Strikingly, the expression of HLA class II in MC subtype patients was wry different between the two populations and was much more frequently downregulated in the Chinese patients. Since we used the same antibody, staining protocols and scoring criteria for evaluating HLA class II expression in both populations, the differential expression likely reflects a biological difference between the two different populations which presumably relates to HLA-based genetic heterogeneity. The 54 HLA expression in Chinese cHL patients HLA system is extremely polymorphic and allelic frequencies vary dramatically between racial groups. A certain HLA allele that is relath.ely uncomm on in one population can be highly prevalent and associated with a specific disease in another. In the Chinese population one or more preVcllent HLA class II allele(s) might present immunodominant EBV antigenic peptides to the immune system, thereby exerting selection pressure to downregulate this molecule. Thus, yet-to\u00ad be-defined ethnic-specific HLA alleles are likely to affect the strength of association between HLA class II expression and the strongly EBV associated MC subtype. It should be noted that Oudejans et al ( 16} also studied the expression of HLA class II in Dutch cHL patients, but did not find the same association. Howe'ver, they used another antibody, recognizing HLA-DR only, the sample size of their study was much smaller(n= 63) and they used a different set of scoring criteria(16). An additional association found in the Chinese population was a strong correlation between downregulation of HLA class II with male sex. Since male sex is associated with EBV + tumor cell status in general, this might partially explain the lack of association of HLA class II with EBV status in the Chinese patients. Howe'ver, there is no obvious explanation for the associati on of HLA class II expression with sex. Interestingly, lack of HLA class II expression is related to inferior failure free SUNVcll in the Dutch population(12). An important consequence of the differences in HLA class II expression between the Chinese and Dutch patients might be that this adwrse prognostic impact of HLA class II absence is not necessarily present in other populations. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that in northern Chinese patients, EBV + cHL tumor cells more frequently retain HLA class I expression, similar to Caucasian populations. Howewr, the association of HLA class II expression with positi\\e EBV status, as obseMd in Caucasians, is not present in the northern 55 Chapter 3 Chinese population. Investigation at the molecular level is needed to further explore the role of anti-tumor immune responses in the pathogenesis of cHL. Differences in ethnic background should be taken into account and might explain discrepancies in incidence pattern, EBV association and other aspects in different populations. 56 HLA expression in Chinese cHL patients Refe rences (1)Swerdlow SH, Campo E, Harris NL, et al.

Submitted Chapter 4 Abstract Background: HLA-A2 a(cHL) in Caucasian population, whereas HLA-A 1 is a risk allele. In the Chinese population HLA-A 1 is uncommon and the prevalence of HLA-A2 subtypes is quite different from that in Caucasians. In this study, we investigated the association between HLA-A* 02 and specific HLA-A* 02 subtypes with EBV+cHL Chinese population. Methodology/ Principal Findings: Formalin -fixed, paraffin embedded tissue blocks of 161 cHL patients and 119 controls with benign lymphadenopathy from the northern part of China were retrieved. EBV status was determined by in situ hybridization for EBERs. DNA was extracted from the tissue blocks and HLA-A2 quantitative(q)PCR was performed to discriminate between negative and positive (including both homozygous or heterozyg ous) samples. HLA-A2 positive samples were subtyped discriminate \"common and well-documented\" HLA-A2 subtypes by sequence-based typing. 67(43%) of the cHL patients were EBV+. There were no significant differences in percentages of HLA-A2 positivity between cHL and controls(65% The frequency distribution of HLA-A2 subtypes was similar for patients and controls. The HLA-A * 02: 07 allele frequency was significantly higher in the EBV+cH L(36%) as compared to the EBV-(7%) and the control group(19% ). The frequency of all other HLA-A2 subtypes combined was clearly decreased in EBV +patients(3 0%) all other HLA-A*02 subtypes are protective in the Chinese population. Our findings demonstrate the influence of HLA allele differences in ethnic groups on epidemiological heterogeneity of cHL. 60 HLA-A * 02: 07 is a risk allele for EBV+ cHL in China Introduction Classical Hodgkin lymphoma(cHL) has a complex multi-factorial etiology with both genetic and en\\1ronmental factors contributing significantly to its de\\elopment(1, 2). Epstein-Barr infects o\\er 90% of the population worldwide (3), has been consistently linked to the pathogenesis of a subset of cHL(1 ). Despite its strong potential, only a minority of EBV-infected indi\\Aduals de\\elop EBV + cHL (3 ), probably because of effecti\\e anti-\\Aral immune responses. The incidence of EBV + cHL is strikingly increased in immunocompromised patients( 4) indicating the importance of an effectiw immune system in controlling the EBV+cell population. The human leukocyte antigen(HLA) is a crucial element of the human immune system and HLA class I restricted, CD8+cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses are known to play a pi\\Otal role in the control of EBV infection(5). In EBV+cHL, expression of \\Aral genes by the tumor cells is restricted to the two latent membrane antigens( LMP1 and LMP2) and EBV nuclear antigen II infection(6). Induction of LMP/EBNA 1-specific immune responses has been successful in the context of appropriate HLA molecules(7 -9). Genetic association between HLA and cHL has been widely inwstigated in the Caucasian population and HLA-A2 has been consistently reported as a protecti\\\u20ac allele for de'A9Ioping EBV + cHL, while HLA-A 1 is considered a risk allele(10, 11). HLA-A2 has a high prevalence worldwide(12) and is one of the most diwrse allele families of the HLA-A locus consisting of o\\er 300 allelic variants (IMGT/HLA database v 3. 3. 0). These alleles show a marked difference in the capacity of peptide binding and presentation (13). For example, presentation of EBV deri'A9d peptides by the HLA-A*02: 01 allele induces stronger immune responses as compared to other HLA-A*02 sub alleles, including HLA-A *02: 07 61 Chapter 4 (14 ). The distribution of these HLA-A*02 allelic variants differs widely by geography and ethnicity( 12). In the Caucasian population, > 90% of the HLA-A2 positiw indi\\Aduals carry the HLA-A*02:01 allele (12), whereas in the Chinese population there are multiple common and these marked differences, it can be postulated that inter-racial variations influence the host immune response and this may lead to different HLA-A2 disease associations in different populations. Consistent with Caucasian populations, in the \\0St majority of Chinese EBV+cHL patients the tumor cells express HLA class I at the cell surface(16). In this study, we determined the HLA-A*02 phenotype frequency in the same group of Chinese cHL patients as well as in controls from the same geographic region. The CWD HLA-A*02 allelic variants were determined by Methods Study Population Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks of lymph node biopsies from 185 cHL patients obtained from 5 hospitals in northern China (Dept. of Pathology, Health Science Center, Peking Unh.ersity; Dept. of Pathology, First Hospital of Jilin Uniwrsity; Dept. of Pathology, Shougang Hospital, Peking Uniwrsity; Dept. of Pathology, Beijing Air Army General Hospital; Zhanye Regional Hospital, Gansu Pro\\Ance) v.,ere used for this study.

DNA was extracted from the tissue blocks. Of the 121 cHL patients for whom the HLA-A*02 DNA quality was sufficient for HLA\u00ad A*02 qPCR, 44(36%) patients were EBV+as pre\\Aously determined by ISH for EBERs.

FFPE tissue blocks of 21 cHL patients with known HLA genotype were retriewd from the Uniwrsity Medical Center Groningen(UM CG), the Netherlands. These samples were used to optimize and validate the HLA-A *02 specific quantitatiw(q )PCR. These 21 cases consisted of A*02-homozygotes, 7 A*02- heterozygotes and 8 non-A* 02 genotypes.

All data were analyzed by using ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detector Systems software wrsion 2. 3 (Applied Biosystems). Samples with poor DNA quality were excluded based on lack of a specific peak in the melting cul'\\e or a Ct \\0lue higher than 36 for PTP4A 1 ( 5 controls and 24 patients were excluded). HLA-A* 02 Ct \\0lues were normaliz ed against the Ct 1, resulting in a delta Ct. Relatiw abundanc e of HLA-A* 02 was calculated by using the formula 2 Ct. Based on the 21 previously HLA-A typed samples, cut-off lewis for HLA-A* 02 positivity were set at a 2-Ct \\01ue of 0. 1. A 2-Ct value of 0. 05 or less was considered to indicate absence of HLA-A*02. HLA -A* 02 subtypes Subtyping of HLA-A2 positiw cases was performed by amplification and sequence analysis of exon 2 and exon 3 regions that contain a number of SNPs that discriminate between the common and well-documented ( CWD) allelic variants in the Chinese population (Table1, Figure 1 ). DNA samples were amplified in a \\Olume of 25\u00b5.I containing 5\u00b5.I(10ng/\u00b5.I) DNA, 5\u00b5.I(2mM) of 95\u00b0C and 40 cycles of 15s at 95\u00b0C, 30s at 65\u00b0C, and 1 min at 68\u00b0C, followed by a final 1 0min extension step at 68\u00b0C. PCR products were visualized on a 1 % agarose gel and purified by Exo-SAP treatment(USB products, Affymetyrics, aewland, USA).

In the EBV-cHL group the OR for HLA-A*02:07 was reduced(OR= 0. 33, Cl 0. 13-- 0. 86) but it was not changed for HLA-A*02(non 02:07) in comparison to normal controls(Table 5). 69 -...J 0 Table 5 HLA-A * 02:07 allele frequency in controls and cHL patients stratified by EBV status Controls '6 chi-squar e test comparing A*02:07,A*02:XXand A*02 negatiw frequencies between groups (') Dl CD -, HLA- A*02: 07 is a risk allele for EBV+ cHL in China Discussion HLA-A2 has been identified as a protecti\\e allele and HLA-A 1 as a risk allele for the de\\elopment of EBV+cHL in the Western population(10, 11). In this study, we found no difference in the HLA-A2 allele carrier frequency between EBV + cHL patients and controls from Northern China. A further discrimination between the CWD HLA-A2 subtypes in the Chinese population re\\ealed that HLA-A 02: 07 allele was a other HLA-A *02(non 02:07) were protecti\\e. The HLA-A 1 frequency was not tested because this allele is uncommon in the Chinese population. HLA-A*02:07 is almost exclusi\\ely present in the eastern Asian population and is the second most common allele just after the HLA-A*02:01 allele(13). In the southern Chinese population the HLA-A * 02: 07 allele frequency was reported to be e\\en higher than the HLA-A*02:01 frequency (15). The proportion of HLA\u00ad A*02:07 positi\\e individuals was slightly higher than the frequency reported in the northern Chinese population (15). Difference between the HLA-A*02:01 allele and the HLA-A*02:07 allele at the protein le\\el is only one amino acid(Y99 to C) and this variation is not present in the HLA-A*01 allele. The question arises if this single amino acid difference can indeed make a difference between a risk and a protecti\\e allele. An explanation for the obseMd differences might be found in differential specificity of binding and presentation of antigenic peptides(13). Indeed, HLA-A *02:01 has been shown to be more effecti\\e in binding and presentation of EBV-deri\\ed peptides in comparison to other HLA-A*02 subtypes ( 17-19 ). Interestingly, the HLA-A*02:07 allele is also associated with an increased risk of undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( UNPC) in the southern Chinese population(20). UNPC is an EBV-associated malignancy and has an identical latency type of infection as compared to cHL with an expression pattern that is 71 Chapter 4 restricted to LMP1, LMP2 and EBNA1(6, 21). In the Caucasian population HLA-A *02:01 was associated with a decreased risk for UNPC(22). These findings are similar to our findings in cHL and support a role for the effecti\\eness of the immuneresponse against latency type II proteins in the pathogene sis of both diseases. In conclusion, our study reported for the first time that the HLA-A *02:07 allele has a strong predisposing effect for EBV+ cHL in the Chinese population, while other HLA-A*02(non 02:07) alleles were protecti\\e. Discrimination between HLA-A*02 subtypes was of central importance for in\\estigating the genetic association of HLA-A*02 with EBV+ cHL. Differences in Chinese and Caucasian populations prodes a unique opportunity for further understanding the influence of genetic heterogeneity in HLA and its role in the pathogene sis of EBV+ cHL.

Submitted Chapter 5 Abstract Background: The pathogenesis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and genetic factors. Methodo logy/Principal To explore the role of the human leukocyte antigen(HLA) genes, we performed a case-control genotyping study in 338 Dutch cHL patients and more than 5,000 controls using a PCR-based sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe(SSOP) hybridization approach. HLA-DR7 was significantly decreased and HLA-B51 significantly increased in the cHL patient population as compared to the controls. Three class II associations were obseMd in the EBV\u00ad cHL population with an increase of HLA-DR15(2) and a decrease of HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR7. Allele frequencies of HLA-A1, HLA-B37 and HLA-DR10 were significantly increased in the EBV+cHL population and these alleles are in strong linkage disequilibrium forming a common haplotype in caucasians. The allele frequency of HLA-DR11 ( 5) was significantly decreased in the EBV + cHL population. SSOP analysis re\\\u20acaled significant differences between EBV + and EBV-cHL patients for 19 probes that discriminate between HLA-A*01 and Conclusi on/Significance: ln conclusion, the antigens and not a specific single nucleotide variant shared by multiple alleles are responsible for the association with EBV+cHL. Se\\\u20acral new protecti\\\u20ac or predisposing HLA class I and II associations for the EBV+, the EBV-and the entire cHL population were identified. 76 HLA associations in Dutch cHL Introduction Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is a typical multi-factorial disease with both em,konmental and genetic factors acting together to cause disease ( 1, 2 ). Epidemiological studies reporting familial clustering of cHL(3) and racial variation in the incidence of cHL(4) ga\\e substantial support for an inherited risk to cHL. Genetic associations with specific human Leukocyte Antigen(HLA) alleles ha\\e been reported in both sporadic and cHL(5, 6). Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is a well-established causal factor in a subset of cHL patients ( 7 ). The expression pattern of EBV genes in Hodgkin Reed\u00ad Stemberg(HRS) cells is restricted to the two latent membrane proteins( LMP1 and LMP2) and the EBV nuclear antigen 1 ( EBNA 1 ( EBV proteins, LMP and EBNA 1-specific T cell responses can be efficiently induced in the context of specific HLA class I or class II molecules (8--10 ). The extreme di\\ersity of HLA genes influences both the affinity and specificity of antigenic peptide binding and is responsible for variations in host anti-viral immune defenses. Genetic variation in host anti-viral immune responses related to HLA polymorphisms might be an important contributor to the de\\elopment of virally induced malignancies. Initial HLA association studies in cHL were performed without taking EBV status into account and associations of HLA-A1, HLA-B5, HLA-88 and HLA-B18 with cHL ha\\e been described, although the degree of reproducibility has been low(6, 11-13). More recently, we focused on the EBV+cHL subgroup by genetic screening the entire HLA region and subsequent finescreening and found a strong association of specific HLA-A alleles with susceptibility to EBV + cHL in Dutch and English patients5, (14). The HLA-A 1 was associated with an increased risk for EBV+cHL, whereas the HLA-A2 was associated with a decreased risk for EBV+cHL(15). This association was confirmed in 934 Scandinavian and English 77 Chapter 5 cHL patients in a recent study by Hjalgrim et al(16). In the present study, we performed an extensive screen of the HLA class I and II genes to investigate possible associations of HLA alleles in the total, the EBV + , and the EBV-cHL (sub) populations. Furthermore, we intended to establish whether specific single nucleotide polymorphis m(SNP) positions in the HLA genes that might be shared by multiple HLA alleles are responsible for the observed genetic associations rather than specific HLA alleles. Materials and methods Patients and controls 183 Dutch cHL patients who participated in the previous genotyping study 5 were included in the present study. 155 additional patients diagnosed and/or treated between 2000 and 2010 at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands were also included. Data on gender, age, and histopathological diagnosis was available for all these patients. Classification according to the WHO was performed consistently with the previous study and cHL cases that could not be unequiwcally subtyped ( usually because of little tissue) were classified as cHL not otherwise specified (Table 1 ). The presence of EBV in tumor cells was detected in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections by in-situ hybridization(ISH ) with a fluorescein-conjugated PNA EBV\u00ad encoded EBER RNAs (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). All participants gave written informed consent. The protocol was approved by the medical ethics board of the University medical Center, Groningen. The control group consisted of blood bank donors from the same geographical region typed for HLA-A(n=7, 099), HLA-B (n=7, 283) and HLA-DR(n=5, 922) by serological methods and in case of unclear results or apparent class II homozygosity additionally by DNA based methods. 78 HLA associations in Dutch cHL HLA genotyping Blood samples of cHL patients were collected and genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cell pellets using standard laboratory protocols. The HLA genotype was analyzed at medium resolution by a polymerase chain reaction-based sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization ( PCR-SSOP) approach and Luminex xMAP technology (Luminex Corp. , Austin, TX). The assays were performed according to the manufactur er's instruction in a European Federation for lmmunogenetics accredited laboratory. Briefly, biotin\u00ad labeled amplification products were generated the HLA genes, followed by a hybridization reaction with a series of SSOPs. Of the 401 PCR\u00ad SSOP probes 43 were either positi\\e or negati\\e for all samples and were therefore excluded from the analyses. Of the 358 included probes, 63 were for the HLA-A locus, 83 for the HLA-B locus, 53 for the HLA-C locus, 72 for the HLA-DR locus, 41 for the HLA-DQB1 locus and 46 for the HLA-DPB1 locus. Each probe co\\ered 1 to 3 SNP positions. The HLA alleles were defined by specific hybridization patterns of multiple probes. HLA genotype was ascertained according to the manufacturers instructions using the manufacturer 's software and additionally by the SCORE sofl:ware(18), enabling the exclusion of .probes with borderline hybridization signals. The presumed antigen or T cell receptor binding function of the SNPs were identified according to Bjorkman and Parham (18). HLA allele frequencies of the cHL patients were deducted from the PCR\u00ad SSOP genotyping data based on the Nomenclature for factors of the HLA system (http://hla. alleles. org/nomencl ature/naming. html). Split antigens were used as indicated in the tables. In case of ambiguous results, the allele combination only 79 Chapter 5 consisting of common and well documented alleles (19} were used. For HLA\u00ad DPB1 one ambiguity remained (DPB1*04 :02/105:01} which was analyzed as one group of alleles. Statistical analysis For each indi\\ndual PCR-SSOP association with EBV status was tested by logistic in PLINK v1. 07 (20)(http://pngu. mgh. harvard. edu/purcell/ plink/) with EBV status as a dependent variable, SSOP as an independent variable, and age and histopathological diagnosis of cHL as confounding covariates. Allele frequencies of HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR of the total cHL group, the EBV+subgroup and the EBV-subgroup were compared with allele frequencies of the controls and significant differences were assessed by Chi-square tests. Allele frequencies for HLA-C, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ of the controls were not available. Significant differences in allele frequencies between EBV + and EBV\u00ad cHL patients were also assessed by Chi-square tests. Alleles with a frequency< 1% in our population were excluded for all these analyses. For each phenotype and PCR-SSOP a test was performed, hence a correction for multiple testing was required. Because linkage disequilibrium exists between the PCR-SSOPs and between the HLA phenotypes, and because the HLA-phenotypes are deri'.Ed from the PCR-SSOPs, a Bonferroni test for 401 PCR-SSOPs and 7 4 phenotypes would be too conservatiw. Therefore, we considered p-values smaller than 0. 001 to be significant at a le\\\u20ac1 of 5% and p\u00ad values <0. 003 to be suggestiw for association. Results Clinicopathological characteri stics Characteristics of the patient population in terms of age, gender and 80 HLA assoc iations in Dutch cHL histopath ological subtype in relation to EBV status is summarized in Table 1. EBV was present in the tumor cells in 78(25%) of the 311 cHL patients (for 27 patients EBV status was unknown). In the total group, median age at diagnosis was 35 years(range 13 to 81) and the percentage of males was 52%. 43 of 338 cHL patients could not be subtyped and were designated cHL NOS. In the remaining patients, nodular sclerosis (NS) was the most common subtype accounting for 87%. Mixed cellularity (MC) and lymphocyte rich (LR) subtypes common frequencies of and 3% , respectively. The lymphocyte depletion (LD) subtype was absent in this patient group. These characteristics are largely consistent with those published for Caucasian cHL populations. Allele frequency differences compared to controls An overview of all allele frequency data, odds ratios and p-values is given in supplementary Table 1. HLA phenotype frequencies(frequencies of allele carriers) including odds ratios and p-values are giwn in supplementary Table 2. This paper focuses on the HLA allele frequency analysis and in most cases similar results were obserwd for the HLA phenotype frequency analysis. In the cHL patient group the allele frequency of the HLA-A68(28), HLA-DR11 (5) and HLA-DR15(2) was significantly increased as compared to the controls{5. 0% vs 0. 9%; p<10-10, 11. and HLA-DR15(2) were also obserwd in the EBV-cHL subgroup and not in the EBV+cHL group(see below)(Figure 1). In EBV-cHL patients a significantly decreased allele frequency was found for and as 81 Chapt er 5 compared to the controls and a significantly increased frequency for HLA-A68 (28), HLA-DR11(5) and HLA-DR15(2) for HLA-DR4, HLA-DR7 and HLA-DR15(2) are also obseMd in the total cHL subgroup, but not in the EBV+group, whereas the associations for HLA\u00ad A68(28) and HLA-DR11(5) are also observed in the EBV+cHL(see below). For the EBV+cHL subgroup strong associations were observed HLA-A 1, HLA-A2, HLA-B37, HLA-DR10 and HLA-DR11(5)(Table 3; Figure The was increased compared to the controls(33% vs 19%; p= 4. 6x10-6), whereas 1. 0%; p=4. 7x10-4) an increased frequency was observed in the EBV+cHL patients as compared to the controls. For HLA-DR11(5) the allele frequency was decreased in the EBV+cHL population as compared to the controls(4. 5% vs HLA-DR10 were obseMd only in the EBV+cHL subgroup and not in the EBV-cHL subgroup. 82 HLA associations in Dutch cHL Table 1 Distribution of sex, histological subtype and age in cHL population stratified by EBV status All patients EBV-Positiw EBV-Negatiw n % n % n % Sex Male 177 52 60 77 107 46 Female 161 48 18 23 126 54 Histological subtype NS 256 87 46 69 192 92 MC 29 10 18 27 10 5 LR 10 3 3 4 7 3 NOS 43 11 24 Median age (range) 35 (13--81) 37 (17-70) 32 (13--81) Table 2 HLA and-DR alleles with a (near1y) significant difference betvleen controls and cHL patients Controls cHL patients Controls w cHL n % n % p* HLA-A68(28) 124 o. 9 34 5. 0 <10-10 HLA-B51 (5) 745 5. 1 52 8. 0 1. 2X10-3 HLA-860(40) 1037 7. 1 26 4. 0 2. 3x10\u00b73 HLA-DR4 2146 18. 1 85 12. 6 3. 1 X 10\"4 HLA-DR7 1320 11. 1 35 5. 2 1. 4X10-6 HLA-DR1 1(5) 87 0. 7 77 11. 5 <10-10 HLA-DR15(2) 1690 14. 3 142 21. 1 9. 8x10-1 Significant differences (p<O. 001) are shown in bold, suggestiw ones (p<O. 003) in italic 0.5 2 5 10 20 OR Figure 1 Odds ratios and 99. 9% confidence intervals of the phenotype allele frequencies.

Ten of the PCR-SSOPs were specific for the HLA-A*01 allele and were more common in EBV+cHL patients, while the other nine PCR\u00ad SSOPs specific for the HLA-A*02 allele were less common in this patient group (Table 2). The 19 SSOPs with significant differences contained polymorphic residues within eight of the HLA-A*02-specific and ten of the HLA-A*01 specific SSOPs that are located at key positions in the peptide binding pockets(18)(Table 5). PCR-SSOPs that were less specific for the HLA-A * 01 or HLA-A * 02 alleles showed a similar trend in the odds ratio as the significant PCR-SSOPs but with lower p-values(supplementary Table 3). 86 CX) -....J 0\u00b70000 1 i i i I I I ' ' ' ' ' ' . i ., i i i i t : . : : : ' : ... !\\ l ,. 0.1-l \u00b711 .... i \u00b7\u00b7, i - t. ! : ! 1 i .. ! i \u00b7 - .. ! indhAdual in EBV + cHL.

A number of HLA genes, alleles and serotypes haw pre\\Aously been reported to be imolwd in the pathogenesis of cHL(5, 6). In this study we obserwd multiple associations that are specific for the EBV + , the EBV-or the total cHL subpopulations. HLA-A68 (28) and HLA-DR11 (5) are risk alleles for cHL irrespectiw of the EBV status. HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR7 are associated with decreased susceptibility and HLA-DR15(2) with an increased risk in the EBV-cHL groups. In the EBV+cHL population an increased susceptibility was obserwd for HLA-A 1, HLA-B37 and HLA-DR10, whereas resistance to disease dewlopment was obserwd for HLA-A2. The pre\\Aously reported association of the HLA-A gene with EBV+cHL(5, 14, 15) was confirmed both in comparison to EBV-cHL and in comparison to healthy controls with an increased risk for HLA-A*01 and a reduced risk for HLA-A*02. A tentatiw explanation for this association is the known presence of multiple cytotoxic T cell epitopes for LMP2 deriwd antigenic peptides restricted HLA-A * 02(8), whereas HLA-A * 01 restricted epitopes to the latent EBV peptides haw not been found (22). Analysis of the indi\\Adual PCR-SSOPs rewaled a significant difference for 19 out of the 358 probes in EBV+as compared to EBV\u00ad cHL. These probes discriminated between the HLA-A*01 and HLA-A*02 alleles and showed only a limited number of cross reacting other alleles. The other, less significant HLA-A*01 and HLA-A*02 identifying probes showed a similar risk pattern. The less significant lewl of these probes can be explained by their broader specificities including some common HLA-A alleles. For example, several probes share specificity for both HLA-A 1 and HLA-A 11. HLA-A* 11 was pre\\Aously reported to be a protective allele in EBV-associated undifferentiated 89 Chapter 5 nasopharyngeal both non-endemic regions(23, 24}. UNPC has the same EBV latency pattern as cHL with expression of only LMPs and EBNA 1 and it was suggested that HLA-A* 11 can efficiently present antigenic peptides from these proteins(24, 25}. Therefore, specificity of a probe for both HLA-A * 11 and HLA-A *01 might diminish the strength of its association with EBV+ cHL. Owrall, our genotype analysis clearly demonstrated that not the individual probes but the complete HLA-A*01 and HLA-A*02 alleles are important for this association. The allele frequency analysis supported the importance of HLA A1 and HLA-A2 in the association with EBV+cHL. The strong linkage disequilibri um obsel'\\\u20acd in the HLA region might affect the results of our HLA association studies. The HLA-A 1 antigen is known to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B8 and in contrast to HLA-A1, HLA-B8 is capable of presenting EBV-deriwd peptides(26}. We obseMd that in the EBV+ cHL population 53% (23/43} of the HLA-A 1 positive patients also possessed the HLA-B8 allele, whereas in the EBV-cHL population this percentage was 66% (46/ 70}. In theory, presence of HLA-B8 in HLA-A1 carrying EBV + cHL, might owrcome the less effectiw presentation of EBV deriwd peptides by HLA-A 1. Newrtheless we saw a wry significant effect for HLA-A in this study consistent with previous studies(5, 14, 15}, and no significant differences for HLA-B8. The predisposing effects of HLA-B37 and HLA-DR10 for EBV+cHL might at least be partly attributed to their strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-A 1 since HLA-A1-83 7-Cw&DR 10-DQ5 is a rather common haplotype in the Caucasian population. In our study, 13 of 14 HLA-B37+ and five of six HLA-DR10+EBV+cHL patients also carried HLA-A 1. Although we do not have haplotype data available, sewn patients were found to potentially possess the HLA-A1-B37-DR10 haplotype, in which fiw were EBV+. Two associations(HL (5}} were present in both the EBV-and EBV+cHL subgroups and are thus specific for the total cHL subgroup 90 HLA associations in Dutch cHL irrespecth ,e of the EBV status. These associations have not been reported previously. An association with HLA-DRS has been reported previously by Robertson et al (27) in familial cHL. Significant effects of HLA-A 1, HLA-88 and HLA-818 for cHL that have been reported in previous publication s(11-13) could not be confirmed in the total patient group in our study, whereas the previously reported association with HLA-85 (28) was borderline significant in our study. These differences might be explained by differences in sample size, patient selection, and proportion of EBV+cases. The previous studies were carried out in relatively small numbers of patients ranging from 11 to 137 within different countries such as Egypt, Czech Republic, Sweden, Denmark, and United States. Distribution of HLA alleles varies widely by ethnicity and geography, which might lead to differences in disease-ass ociated HLA alleles among different ethnic groups and geographic locations. In addition most case-control studies used low\u00ad resolution serological HLA typing. A limitation of this approach is the inability to discriminate between specific allele variants, which might be more or less common in different populations. The HLA-DR4, HLA-DR7 and HLA-DR15(2) class II associations were not obseMd in the EBV+subgroup and represent associations specific for the EBV\u00ad cHL subgroup. The HLA-A 1 and HLA-A2 class I associations were specific for the EBV + cHL subgroup. HLA class II molecules mainly function as binding and presenting exogenous antigenic peptides to CD4+ helper T cells, whereas HLA class I is known to bind and present peptides derived from endogenous proteins to CDS+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (29). Our findings thus support a differential immunogenic basis with a more prominent role in the effector phase of the immune response for HLA class I in EBV+cHL and an immunoregulatory role for HLA class II in the pathogenesis of EBV-cHL. This suggests presence of a specific HLA class II restricted antigen im,olved in the pathogenes is of EBV-cHL. Whether this is a pathogen-derived antigen or an antigen derived from a mutated 91 Chapter 5 protein remains unknown. In conclusion, the current study confirms the previously reported genetic association of the HLA-A 1 and HLA-A2 in EBV + cHL. The genetic influence of these two HLA antigens is more important than individual SNPs that might be shared by multiple HLA-A alleles. In addition, we demonstrated two significant associations for the cHL population, three significant HLA class II associations specific for the EBV-cHL population and one additional association for the EBV + cHL subgroup. This implies an influence of the interaction between environmental and genetic risk factors in the dewlopment of cHL and supports heterogene ity in the genetic predisposition to EBV+and EBV-cHL. work Bernouilli Bursary, Uniwrsity Medical Center Groningen and by a grant from the Dutch Cancer Society(KWF: RUG 2009--4313 ).

In this thesis both enronmental and genetic risk factors are explored in a Northern Chinese and in a Northern Dutch cHL population. Epidemiology of cHL CHL accounts for about 1% of all cancers and-30% of the lymphoid malignancies worldwide(1 ). Interestingly. a striking variation in the incidence of cHL has been obseMd between different geographic locations and/or racial groups (2). An almost 6-fold difference in the incidence of cHL was reported between Western and Oriental population groups with an incidence of 2. 3 and 0. 4 per 100, 000 inhabitants per year respecth,ely (http://globocan. iarc. fr/). In addition, the age distribution pattern of cHL also differs between high and low incidence areas. In Western countries, it exhibits a distinctiw bimodal pattern with one peak at young adult age and a second peak in the elderly (3, 4 ). In the few available studies in Asians, the first incidence peak is obserwd at a younger age, i. e. in adolescents. whereas the second peak is usually obseMd at the same age as in Western countries, with the exception of a single study from Japan in which a unique peak in the elderly was reported (5, 6). It should be noted that these studies are based on a limited number of patients varying from 23 to 70(7-9). Infection with Epstein Barr Virus(EBV) was identified to play a causal role in the pathogenesis of cHL(10, 11 ). Howe\\er, the frequency of EBV-associated cHL ranges from 30% in Caucasians to an intermediate frequency in Orientals to almost 100% in Hispanics (4, 12). EBV + cHL was always obseMd more frequently in children and elderly as compared to the other age groups regardless of the ethnic background(13, 14). 122 Sum mary , discussion and future perspectiws In chapter 2 of this thesis, we performed a large epidemiological study including 371 cHL patients from the northern part of China. We demonstrated both distinctiw and consistent features when comparing the data with previous findings in the Asian population. The percentage of EBV + cHL patients was around 41% in the Northern Chinese patients, only a little bit higher than in Caucasians. Howewr, a comparison between the Chinese and Dutch patient populations showed significant differences in terms of patients' age and gender distribution in relation to EBV status. Expression of HLA antigens by cHL tumor cells in the Chinese cHL patients Deficiency in the expression of Human leukocyte antigen(HLA) antigens by tumor cells is thought to be an important strategy for malignant cells to escape from host immunosurwil lance(15, 16). This might be especially important in EBV+cHL, because EBV-deri\\ed antigenic peptides are known to consistently ewke immune responses. Previous studies performed in the Caucasian population ha\\e found that retention of HLA class I and HLA class II molecules is much more common in EBV+cHL as compared to EBV-cHL patients( 17-19). Although there is no clear explanation for this paradox, the highly polymorphic nature of the HLA genes and the resultant functional variation between the HLA molecules might play a role. In addition, persistence of HLA class I expression is advantageous for the tumor cells to a\\Oid Natural Killer cell-mediated lysis(20). In chapter 3 we analyzed HLA class I and class II expression in a group of 145 Chinese cHL patients. In agreement with previous findings in the Caucasian population, membrane expression of HLA class I was strongly associated with positiw EBV status in the Chinese cHL patients. In contrast, we found no significant association of membrane expression of HLA class II with EBV status in Chinese cHL. In Chinese EBV+cHL patients, HLA class II expression was lost 123 Chapter 6 more often than in Caucasians (48% w 30% ). There is in vitro evidence that EBV infection and the related malignant transformation are controlled by CD4+ T cells, depending on HLA class II restricted antigen presentation(21 ). Based on extreme differences in allele frequencies between racial groups, it can be hypothesized that HLA class II alleles that are prevalent in the Chinese population might effectiwly present EBV-deriwd peptides to the immune system, thereby exerting selection pressure to downregulate HLA class II expression. Genetic associ ations bebNeen HLA alleles and cHL The HLA complex, being an essential element of the human immune system, has been widely studied in various human diseases for its potential disease contribution (15, 16). Since virally infected cells can be strictly controlled by host immune surwillance, it is plausible to expect a difference in the HLA associations between EBV + and EBV-cHL. Previous studies on HLA and cHL associations were mainly performed among Caucasians and significant effects of specific HLA genes were found in both sporadic and familial cHL patients (reviewed in (22)). Most of the abow mentioned studies applied serologic al determination of usually only a few HLA antigens and EBV status was not taken into account. Each HLA serological type usually encompasses a group of distinct allele variants and the alleles of a serological group are functionally different in peptide binding and presentation ( 23 ). This implies that HLA association studies based on serology might giw biased results. In addition, the extensiw linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the HLA region between different HLA genes and between HLA genes and non-HLA genes might also affect association outcomes. Previous results from our research group based on a genetic screening analysis of the entire HLA region and subsequent detailed DNA based HLA-typing, sho'Ned that HLA-A 1 is clear1y owrrepresented whereas HLA-A2 is underrepresented in EBV+cHL patients from the Northern part of the Nether1ands(24). 124 Summa ry, discussion and future perspectives Very recently, a study from Scandina\\4a and the United Kingdom showed that HLA-A1 homozygosity renders an approximately 4-fold increased risk of HLA-A*02 is the most common HLA-A allele in most populations worldwide. In Caucasians, HLA-A*02:01 is by far the most common allele variant and has been found to be a protecth,e allele for the de\\elopment of EBV+cHL(24, 25). In the Chinese population there are other HLA-A*02 allele variants with a high frequency in addition to HLA-A*02:01 such as HLA-A*02:06 and HLA-A*02:07 that are \\ery infrequent in Caucasians (26). Notably, the HLA-A * 02 subtypes differ in their capacity of peptide binding and presentation as well as the subsequent immune response (23). HLA-A*01 was found to be a risk allele for EBV + cHL in the Caucasian population, howe\\er HLA-A*01 is rare in the Chinese population. Because of the strong correlation between EBV + cHL and HLA-A*01 in Caucasian populations, one would expect that the proportion of EBV+cHL in the Chinese cHL patients would be lower. Howe\\er, this proportion was consistently reported to be higher than in Caucasian patients(4, 12). Therefore HLA-A * 01 is \\ery unlikely to be a predominant susceptibility gene for EBV + cHL among the Chinese population. A possible minor effect still needs to be studied by determining the allele frequency of HLA-A*01 in the Chinese EBV+cHL patients. In chapter 4 we analyzed the HLA-A*02 frequency in the Chinese population and obseMd similar frequencies in EBV + and EBV-cHL patients. Subsequent sequence based typing of the most common HLA-A*02 alleles re\\ealed that HLA\u00ad A * 02: 07 is a risk factor for de\\eloping EBV + cHL in the Chinese population, whereas the other alleles are protecti\\e similar to the Western population. HLA\u00ad A*02:07 is a distincti\\e HLA-A*02 subtype that is almost exclusiw to Orientals and has been found to confer a significant risk for the de\\elopment of 125 Chapter 6 Undifferentiated Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma ( UNPC) in the southern Chinese population (27). A possible explanation for this finding was giwn by the less efficient presentation of EBV-deriwd peptides by HLA-A*02:07(28, 29). At least in the Chinese population, this allele can wry well explain the distinctiw geographic distribution of UNPC. These findings illustrate that HLA-linked ethnic diwrsity can explain geographical variation in disease incidence as is seen for cHL. In addition, it demonstrates that knowledge of the ethnic background is of particular importance for genetic association studies. HLA-base d genetic susceptibility to cHL in th e Dutch population In chapter 5 of this thesis, we studied a group of Dutch cHL patients(n =338) by detailed DNA-based HLA typing. HLA-B51 and HLA-DR7 were found to be a susceptible and a protectiw HLA allele for cHL irrespectiw of the EBV status. Three class II associations were observed in the EBV-cHL population with an increase of HLA-DR15 (2) and a decrease of HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR7. Besides confirmation of the strong genetic effects of HLA-A 1 and HLA-A2 in EBV + cHL patients, we also found an association of HLA-DR1 O and HLA-837 with EBV + cHL. It should be noted that these alleles are in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-A *01. The allele frequency of HLA-DR11 (5) was significantly decreased in the EBV +cHL population. SSOP analysis re-..,ealed significant differences between EBV+ and EBV-cHL patients for 19 probes that discriminate between HLA-A*01 and HLA-A*02. In conclusion, the HLA-A1 and HLA-A2 antigens and not a specific single nucleotide variant shared by multiple alleles are responsible for the association with EBV + cHL. The differential HLA-based genetic background between the EBV + and EBV-cHL suggests that an undefined infectious agent other than EBV or a(group of) specific tumor-associated antigen(s) im,olwd in the pathogenesis of EBV- cHL. 126 Summ ary, discuss ion and future perspecth ,es In conclusion In this thesis we showed marked differences in cHL epidemiology between Caucasian and Oriental populations. The complex nature of the disease may at least be partially explained by differences in genetic background, which is most notably in the HLA genes. Future pers pecth es In this thesis, we describe the epidemiological features of a group of cHL patients from Northern China in which both similarities and differences were found in comparison to the published data. Howewr, as there is only limited data regarding the epidemiological features of cHL among Asians, it is worthwhile to identify and study more cHL patients to further illustrate the similarities and differences. Moreo\\er, it should be noted that the previous studies reported on the epidemiological features of cHL in Chinese subpopulations from Hong Kong and Taiwan, consisting mainly of descendants from the Southern Chinese population who are genetically different from the Northern Chinese population. Giwn the large differences in the frequency distribution of HLA alleles between Southern and Northern Chinese populations, it would be of great value to separately analyze and compare cHL patients from Southern and Northern China. Currently, a strong association between tumor cell membrane expression of HLA class I and EBV+cHL was obser\\ed in both Caucasians and Chinese cHL patients. Howewr, we did not find an association of membrane expression of HLA class II with EBV+cHL in the Chinese population. Our group previously reported that in the Dutch population, absence of HLA class II expression was associated with ad\\erse outcome(30). We found a relati\\ely higher frequency of loss of HLA class II expression in the Chinese cHL patients compared to the Dutch population(46. 2% expression vs 58. 6% expression). Whether the prognostic 127 Chapter 6 significance of HLA class II expression in cHL would also be present in the Chinese population needs to be studied. Three microsatellite markers within the HLA class II region haw been reported to be in close relationship with HLA class II expression in cHL in the Dutch population( 30). One or more specific HLA alleles could be im,olwd, but this association could also be caused by transcriptional regulation sites or a non-HLA gene. In the future, a fine screening of the class II region should be done to identify which genetic locus or loci account(s ) for this association. Linking of the HLA typing data to the expression of HLA class II molecules may be helpful for illuminating the abow association. Ideally, as a next step we should study these HLA class II alleles in combination with HLA class II downregulation in the Chinese population. Due to differences in the distribution of common and well documented HLA alleles between different population groups, it can be expected that different HLA\u00ad linked genetic associations with certain diseases can be found in different ethnic groups. We found that the ethnic difference in the distribution of HLA-A*02 subtypes alters the association between HLA-A*02 and EBV+cHL. In addition to HLA-A *02, HLA-A * 01 is also wry common in the Caucasian population, which has been identified to confer a significant risk for EBV + cHL. Although the frequency of HLA-A*01 is rather low in the Orientals, its frequency in the Chinese EBV+cHL patients should be explored since it may be an additional risk factor to HLA-A*02:07. Some other HLA alleles such as HLA-A*11 are common in the Chinese population but not in the Caucasians. Notably, an effectiw anti-EBV immune response can be elicited in the context of HLA-A * 11 and this may wry well explain the protective effect of HLA-A * 11 in UNPC(31 ). Therefore, it would be ideal to perform a detailed screening of the HLA genes that are imolwd in the pathogenesis of cHL in the Chinese population. This would be of particular benefit for better understanding the genetic variation of cHL between the Dutch and Chinese populations. A small proportion of the Dutch EBV+cHL patients possess 128 Summary, discuss ion and future perspecth ,es the HLA-A*02 allele and it is unclear how the EBV positi've tumor cells escape from an effecti've anti-EBV cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immune response. It might be hypothesized that the HLA-A*02 allele is no longer functional in the tumor cells of these patients. HLA-A * 02 expression might be decreased or completely lost on the cell surface of the tumor cells. This could be studied by immunohist ochemistry using a HLA-A*02-specific antibody. In addition, the peptide-binding cleft of the HLA molecule, encoded by exons 2 and 3 of the gene, determines the characteristics of presented peptide and hence influences the immune response. Therefore, we plan to sequence exons 2 and 3 of the HLA-A * 02 gene in Dutch EBV + cHL patients to screen for putati've mutations and/or deletions that could alter the peptide-binding affinity and/or specificity. 129 Chapter 6 Refe rences (1)Swerdlow SH, Campo E, Harris NL, et al.
