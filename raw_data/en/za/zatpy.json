ADVERTISING \"SPECIALIST\" OR \"EXPERT\" The Board of Chiropractic Examiners has determined that advertisements incorporating the words \"SPECIALIST\" or \"EXPERT\" constitute advertising of a nature likely to deceive or defraud the public. Arizona law authorizes the practice of two chiropractic specialties after certification by the Board: Acupuncture and Physiotherapy. The Board will view advertising such as \"Specialist or \"Expert\" as being potentially deceptive advertising. An example of acceptable language would be \"Practice limited to ... \" only if such can be proven to be the case. Techniques such as \"Palmer\", \"Applied Kinesiology\", \"Activator\", \"Grostic\", etc. may be listed, but the advertising may not infer that one technique is superior to another, or that the chiropractor is somehow superior to others because he/she uses that procedure. Certification by any specialty council of A.C.A. or specific technique certification by any similar professional association is not recognized by statute or rule in Arizona. A.R.S. \u00a732-924.A.13 provides the \"Advertising in a false, deceptive or misleading manner\" is grounds for disciplinary action.

PRACTICE GUIDELINES The Board of Chiropractic Examiners has determined that the Board will not use The practice guidelines developed by either the Mercy or Wyndham Conferences as a regulatory standard in Arizona. In particular, the board notes that those guidelines do not define the term \"recognized standards of the profession\" occurring in A.R.S. \u00a732-924(A)(15). The Board recognizes that its decision not to use those particular guidelines does not prevent or deter other agencies and private businesses from adopting those guidelines to advise or regulate chiropractic physicians participating in those agencies' or business' programs.

PROCEDURES FOR REVIEWING STUDENT LOAN DEFAULTS The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General, will notify the Arizona State Board of Chiropractic Examiners when an Arizona chiropractor has defaulted on a Health Education Student Loan. The default will normally result in exclusion from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid, and all federal health care programs as defined in 1128B(f) of the Social Security Act. Section 1128(e) of the Act requires the appropriate licensing or certification authority be notified of such exclusion and requested to make appropriate investigations. When a notice of student loan default is received, the following actions will be taken: 1. Notify the doctor in writing of the notice with instructions to respond in writing. A copy of this letter will be sent to HHS (Attention: Health Care Administrative Sanctions) 2. If the doctor acknowledges the default and indicates he/she is attempting to rectify the matter, it will be placed in a hold file and followed-up at least quarterly to ensure that the doctor is still attempting to resolve the matter. 3.

The physician shall determine that the service is medically appropriate, necessary to meet the patient's health needs, consistent with the diagnosis, and consistent with widely accepted clinical standards of care concerning reliability, validity, and timing of the test. The physician must clearly document that the chosen diagnostic test is the best or most appropriate test available and that it will provide results that will support a diagnosis and/or assist in clinical decision-making regarding treatment and/or referral. The physician must be sufficiently trained in the utilization of the diagnostic equipment to be able to perform the chosen test and to supervise (as defined in R4-7-101 (18)) the performance of the test.
