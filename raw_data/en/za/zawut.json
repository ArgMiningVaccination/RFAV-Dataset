We understand that many of the students we serve are impacted by actions that aim to restrict, diminish, make invisible, or force the erasure of their lived experience and histories. We also recognize that these decisions disproportionately impact students from limited income backgrounds and students of color. Our work will always be to elevate voices, center experiences, provide care and resources, and advocate for an inclusive experience at WashU for transgender, gender-expansive, and minoritized students.
