THIS BOOKLETABOUT 4 5 SECTION 1Understanding Medicare Part A & Part B Review the questions and answers below before you read this booklet. They explain information that's important in understanding Medicare Part A and Part B coverage and costs. What's the Part A deductible? In 2023, you'll pay a $1,600 deductible for each inpatient hospital benefit period ( defined on page 7 ). The Part A deductible covers your share of costs for the first 60 days of Medicare-covered inpatient hospital care in a benefit period. There's no limit to the number of benefit periods you can have in a year. This means you may pay the deductible more than once in a year. What's the Part B deductible? In 2023, you pay a yearly $226 deductible for Part B-covered services and supplies before Medicare begins to pay its share, depending on the service or supply. What's assignment for Part B services, and why is it important? Assignment is an agreement by your doctor, provider, or other supplier to be paid directly by Medicare, to accept the payment amount Medicare approves for the covered service, and not to bill you for any more than the Medicare deductible and coinsurance. Depending on the service or supply, the amount you pay may be higher if the doctor, practitioner, or other supplier doesn't accept assignment. Doctors and other health care providers who don't accept assignment can charge you 15% over the Medicare-approved payment amount for most Part B-covered services. This is called the \"limiting charge. \" The limiting charge doesn't apply to some supplies and durable medical equipment (DME). When getting certain supplies and DME, Medicare will only pay for them from Medicare- enrolled suppliers, no matter who submits the claim (you or your supplier). 6 Section 1: Understanding Medicare Part A & Part B What if my doctor recommends a service more often than Medicare covers it? Y our doctor or other health care provider may recommend you get services more often than Medicare covers. Or, they may recommend services that Medicare doesn't cover. If this happens, you may have to pay some or all of the costs out- of-pocket. It's important to ask questions, so you understand why your doctor is recommending certain services and if Medicare will pay for them. What if I disagree with a coverage or payment decision? Y ou have the right to appeal. For more information on how to file an appeal, read your \"Medicare & Y ou\" handbook, download and read the Appeals\" at Medicare.gov/publications , or visit Medicare.gov/appeals . What if an item or service isn't listed in this booklet, or I need more information? Visit Medicare.gov/coverage and type the item or service into the search box for more information. Or, you can call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. Does Medicare have a coverage app I can use on my mobile device? Y ou can get Medicare coverage information on your mobile device from Medicare's free \"What's covered\" app. Download the app from the App Store or Google Play. Preventive services Preventive services help you stay healthy. Throughout this booklet, you'll see a picture of an apple next to preventive services that Medicare covers. Talk with your doctor about which preventive services are right for you.7 Section 1: Understanding Medicare Part A & Part B Other helpful terms to understand as you read this booklet (visit Medicare.gov/glossary for additional terms): Benefit period: This is the way Original Medicare measures your use of hospital and skilled nursing facility (SNF) services. A benefit period begins the day you're admitted as an inpatient in a hospital or SNF. The benefit period ends when you haven't gotten any inpatient hospital care (or skilled care in a SNF) for 60 days in a row. If you go into a hospital or SNF after one benefit period has ended, a new one begins. Y ou must pay the Part A inpatient hospital deductible for each benefit period. There's no limit to the number of benefit periods you can have in a year. Coinsurance: This is an amount you may be required to pay as your share of the cost for services after you pay any deductibles. Coinsurance is usually a percentage (for example, 20%). Copayment: This is an amount you may be required to pay as your share of the cost for a medical service or supply, like a doctor's visit, hospital outpatient visit, or prescription drug. A copayment is usually a set amount, rather than a percentage. For example, you might pay $10 or $20 for a doctor's visit or prescription drug. Deductible: This is the amount you must pay for health care or prescriptions before Original Medicare, your prescription drug plan, or your other insurance begins to pay. Medicare-approved amount: In Original Medicare, this is the amount a doctor, provider, or other supplier that accepts assignment can be paid. Assignment is an agreement by your doctor, provider, or supplier to be paid directly by Medicare, to accept the payment amount Medicare approves for the service, and not to bill you for any more than the Medicare deductible and coinsurance. It may be less than the actual amount a doctor or supplier charges. Medicare pays part of this amount and you're responsible for the difference.8 Section 1: Understanding Medicare Part A & Part B Notes 9 SECTION Items & services 2 Abdominal aortic aneurysm screenings Part B covers an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening ultrasound if you're at risk.
