Xenobiotics may accumulate from our toxic environment, such as air pollution, drinking or eating from plastic container, pharmaceuticals, hormone replacement, pesticides and more.

Each of the Lymph BioToxicosis remedies is synergistically compatible with all botanicals, homeopathics and nutritionals, or can be used as a stand alone remedy. They are designed to provide biotoxicological clarification at the appropriate level to ensure well tolerated and clinically-specific lymphatic drainage.
