Safe and effective vaccines against gonorrhea are needed urgently. A candidate vaccine that targets a lipooligosaccharide (LOS) epitope recognized mAb 2C7 attenuates gonococcal burden in the mouse vaginal colonization model. Glycan extensions from the LOS core heptoses (HepI and HepII) are controlled by phase-variable LOS genes; we to 2C7 function. mAb (lgtG) was genetically locked required for HepI variation (lgtA, lgtC, and lgtD) were genetically locked on or off in different combinations were created. We observed 100% complement-dependent killing by mAb 2C7 of a mutant that expressed lactose (Gal-Glc) from HepI, whereas a mutant that expressed Gal-Gal-Glc-HepI fully resisted killing (>100% survival). Mutants that elaborated 4- (Gal-GlcNAc-Gal-Glc-HepI) and 5-glycan (GalNAc-Gal-GlcNAc-Gal-Glc-HepI) structures displayed intermediate phenotypes (<50% killing and >95% killing with g/ml mAb 2C7). The contrasting phenotypes of the lactose-HepI and the Gal-Gal-Glc-HepI LOS structures were recapitulated with phase variants of a recently isolated clinical strain. Despite lack of killing of the Gal-Gal-Glc-HepI mutants, mAb 2C7 deposited sufficient C3 on these bacteria opsonophagocytic killing by human neutrophils. In conclusion, mAb 2C7 showed functional activity against all gonococcal HepI LOS structures defined by various lgtA/C/D on/off combinations, thereby providing further impetus for use of the 2C7 epitope in a gonococcal vaccine. Introduction Gram-negative diplococcus Neisseria gonorrhoeae (the gonococcus) is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide (second most common in the United States). Although most cases result in uncomplicated infections of the lower genital tract (urethritis in men and cervicitis in women), gonorrhea may sometimes lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and disseminated gonococcal infection. Serious sequelae of gonorrhea include infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Infected individuals who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic constitute an important reservoir for the transmission of infection. Globally, 78 million new cases of gonorrhea occur annually ( [1](javascript:;)). As a result of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, including strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins such as cefixime and ceftriaxone or novel anti-infective therapeutics, gonorrhea has become a major public health concern. A safe and effective vaccine would be a key step in curbing the spread of multidrug-resistant gonorrhea. An obstacle to gonococcal vaccine development is the wide antigenic variation and/or variable expression of Ags that may elicit a protective response (e.g., pilin, opacity [Opa] proteins, elicit nonprotective and, in some instances, subversive responses; an example of the latter is reduction modifiable protein ( [6](javascript:;)). Despite its phase-variable nature ( [7](javascript:;)), gonococcal LOS has been considered as a potential vaccine Ag ( [8](javascript:;), [9](javascript:;)). Men who were experimentally infected with N. gonorrhoeae were less likely to become infected upon rechallenge when they elicited an anti-LOS IgG response following the initial infection ( [10](javascript:;)). Previous work by our group identified an epitope on gonococcal LOS that is recognized by a mAb called 2C7 (and therefore referred to as the 2C7 epitope) and was expressed on 94% of gonococci (64 of 68) recovered directly from human cervical secretions ( [11](javascript:;)). Gonococcal infection in humans against the 2C7 epitope ( [11](javascript:;)). Expression of a lactose residue from heptose (Hep) II is required for binding of mAb 2C7 ( [12](javascript:;)). Addition of an -linked Glc residue at the 3 position of HepII represents the first step in synthesis of the lactose extension from HepII and is mediated by the phase-variable LOS glycosyltransferase G (lgtG) ( [13](javascript:;)). ( [14](javascript:;)). Passive administration of mAb 2C7, as well as active immunization with a peptide mimic (mimotope) of the 2C7 epitope that was configured as a multiantigenic peptide on a poly-l-lysine backbone significantly shortened the duration and burden of infection in the murine vaginal colonization model of gonorrhea ( [14](javascript:;)). Taken together, these data suggest that the 2C7 epitope represents a promising gonococcal vaccine candidate. Phase variation of LOS glycan extensions is mediated by slipped-strand mispairing at homopolymeric tracts within the coding regions lgt genes; lgtC, permits glycan extensions from HepII, as discussed above. Phase variation permits gonococci to express several distinct LOS structures that differ in their glycan composition ( [7](javascript:;), [15](javascript:;)). variations in HepI glycans has not been studied, yet it is an important consideration that may impact the efficacy of a 2C7 epitope-based vaccine and forms the basis of this study. Materials and Methods Bacterial strains and culture conditions The neisserial strains used in this study are described in [Table I](javascript:;). N. gonorrhoeae MS11 4/3/1 pilE that controls pilus expression ( [16](javascript:;)). UMNJ60_06UM was recovered in 2013 from a symptomatic male with urethritis in Nanjing, People's Republic of China ( [17](javascript:;)), and shows intermediate resistance to ceftriaxone (Etest minimum inhibitory concentration = 0.38 g/ml and disc 35 mm [sensitive 35 mm]). UMNJ60_06UM belongs to NG-MAST sequence GGGGCGGAGG. Gonococcal strains were routinely cultured at in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 on chocolate agar enriched with a chemically defined supplement (termed isovitalex) used as an additive for cultivation of nutritionally fastidious microorganisms. For growth in liquid culture, Morse A supplemented with Morse B and isovitalex were used ( [18](javascript:;)). When used, antibiotics were added to GC agar plates at the following concentrations: erythromycin (Kan), (Sm), 10 mg/ml. induce pilus expression and enable transformation, strain MS11 4/3/1 was cultured on GC agar on Luria-Bertani agar supplemented, as needed, with antibiotics at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 125 g/ml; Kan, 50 g/ml; Erm, chloramphenicol, 50 g/ml. INVF, a naturally Sm-sensitive strain, was used for propagation of all plasmids containing the ErmR-SmS cassette. Construction of mutants We LOS mutants in MS11 4/3/1 ( I](javascript:;)), 1A](javascript:;)]) either off (or modal](javascript:;) (provided by Dr. William Shafer, Emory Atlanta, GA) using lgtG_F and lgtG_R primers ( [Supplemental Table MS11 4/3/1 with the purified PCR product. The Kan marker in lgtG in FA19 was derived from was fixed on (G+ mutants; HepII substituted with lactose) by first exchanging the lgtG with lgtG containing the ermC-rpsLF62 cassette (pRYGW2ES1; [Supplemental Table II](/jimmunol/article-supplement/104942/pdf/ji_1600374_supplemental_material_1/)) that to Sm ( [20](javascript:;)). Erm-resistant transformants were [Supplemental Table II](/jimmunol/article-supplement/104942/pdf/ji_1600374_supplemental_material_1/)) in which the C11 to the non-phase-variable sequence 5-CCCCTCCGCCA-3. lgtG-on (G+) mutants were selected for resistance to Sm for sensitivity to Erm ( [20](javascript:;)). HepI glycan mutants were made in both the MS11 G+ and G backgrounds by first exchanging each of the three phase-variable HepI lgt Table II](/jimmunol/article-supplement/104942/pdf/ji_1600374_supplemental_material_1/)), followed locked on (plgtA-on, plgtC-on, plgtD-on; [Supplemental Table II](/jimmunol/article-supplement/104942/pdf/ji_1600374_supplemental_material_1/)), locked off (plgtC-off; [Supplemental Table II](/jimmunol/article-supplement/104942/pdf/ji_1600374_supplemental_material_1/)), or the mutated (segment deleted) form of each gene (plgtA-del and plgtD-del; [Supplemental Table II](/jimmunol/article-supplement/104942/pdf/ji_1600374_supplemental_material_1/)). To insert the ermC-rpsLF62 cassette into each lgt, the homopolymeric phase variation sequence in each lgt was deleted and an SmaI restriction site was incorporated by overlap extension PCR (using the respective Fwd-Ext/Rev-Int and Fwd-Int/Rev-Ext primers; [Supplemental Each was amplified (Fwd-Ext and [Supplemental TOPO TA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The ermC-rpsLF62 cassette was extracted from pFLOB4300 (provided by Dr. Janne G. Cannon, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) with pvuII and inserted into the SmaI site of each maintained in the Sm-sensitive E. coli INVF (Life Technologies, San Diego, CA). Wild-type lgtC, and were amplified from TOPO TA cloning vector (Life Technologies) and transformed into chemically competent E. coli TOP10 (Life Technologies) per the manufacturer's instructions lgtD locked on and lgtC locked off were generated using a QuickChange Lightning multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, with the corresponding mutagenic primers ( [Supplemental Table I](/jimmunol/article-supplement/104942/pdf/ji_1600374_supplemental_material_1/)) and transformed into chemically competent XL-10 Gold E. coli cells per the manufacturer's recommendations ( [Supplemental Table II](/jimmunol/article-supplement/104942/pdf/ji_1600374_supplemental_material_1/)). Double digestion (with BbsI/SspI subsequent of plasmids with wild-type lgtA and lgtD lgtD ( [Supplemental Table II](/jimmunol/article-supplement/104942/pdf/ji_1600374_supplemental_material_1/)). Replacement of the lgtC locked on in the mutant that expressed the 3-Hex HepI/lgtG+ LOS structure with lgtC locked off yielded the 2-Hex-HepI/lgtG+ mutant. Conversely, locking lgtC on in the 2-Hex-HepI/lgtG+ mutant yielded a lgtG+ mutant that expressed 3-Hex from HepI. UMNJ60_06UM lgtA::kan was constructed as previously described ( [21](javascript:;)). Inactivation of lgtA was confirmed by PCR and Western blot using mAb L8 but mAbs are described below), and UMNJ60_06UM lgtA::kan 3-Hex reacted with mAb L1 (recognizes the globotriose Gal1,4-Gal1,4-Glc structure, also called the Pk-like structure) but not mAb L8 (data not shown). All UMNJ60_06UM strains reacted with mAb 2C7 by Western blot (data not shown) and by flow cytometry (FCM; see [14Results](#s14)). Mass spectrometry Fresh chocolate agar plates were inoculated with bacteria harvested from cultures grown overnight for 15 h, and bacteria were grown for 6 h. LOS was extracted, de-O-acylated, and analyzed by mass spectroscopy as described previously ( [22](javascript:;)). Abs A schematic of the epitopes recognized by these mAbs is provided in [Fig. 1A](javascript:;). mAb 2C7 was purified from tissue culture supernatants over protein A/G (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Affinity-isolated goat anti-human factor H (FH) was prepared from anti-FH antiserum (Complement Technology, Tyler, TX) by passage over were from Sigma-Aldrich. mAb 104 that binds to domains 1 and 2 of the -chain of human C4b-binding protein (C4BP) ( [27](javascript:;)) was provided by Dr. Anna M. Blom (Lund University, Malm\u00f6, Sweden). mAb 104 blocks C4BP function [27](javascript:;)) [28](javascript:;)) when serum. However, mAb 104 does not displace C4BP already bound to the gonococcal surface and was used as the detection reagent for C4BP binding, as previously described ( [28](javascript:;)). was detected C3c (AbD Serotec/Bio-Rad), which detects both C3b as well as iC3b, at a dilution of 1:100. To demonstrate that mAb 104 blocked C4BP binding to bacteria, complement was incubated with mAb 104 (9 g mAb 104 was added to 30 l complement) on ice for 10 min, added to bacteria. C4BP bound to bacteria was detected with anti-human C4BP mAb 67 (provided by Dr. Anna M. Blom) that recognizes domain 4 of the -chain of C4BP, followed by anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (Sigma-Aldrich) both at a dilution 1:100. SDS-PAGE and Western 12% Bis-Tris gels with MES running buffer (Invitrogen) and LOS was visualized by silver stain (Bio-Rad). LOS was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Billerica, MA) by Western blotting; membranes were blocked with PBS/1% milk for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and probed with tissue culture supernatants containing anti-LOS mAbs 2C7, 3F11, L1, and L8 (described above) for h at 4\u00b0C, as described previously ( [29](javascript:;)). 3F11). Hexosaminidase treatment To ascertain whether a terminal hexosamine (in this instance, GalNAc) was present on the lgtD-on (D+) mutants, bacteria were suspended in water, frozen at 20\u00b0C, and thawed at 37\u00b0C to osmotically lyse them and treated with 10 U DNAse I in DNAse buffer (Ambion) for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. Treatment with DNAse I was carried out to reduce viscosity of the sample prior to electrophoresis. Proteins were digested with 1 mg/ml protease K (Calbiochem) in SDS (final concentration of 0.01%) for 1 h at 50\u00b0C. Protease K activity was destroyed by heating at 100\u00b0C for 20 min. Terminal N-acetyl hexosamine from LOS was released by treating the sample with 30 U -N-acetylhexosaminidase in G2 buffer (both from New England Biolabs) for 15 h at 37\u00b0C. Samples were electrophoresed on a 16.5% Tris-Tricine gel (Bio-Rad) at 100 V at 4\u00b0C and LOS was visualized with silver staining as described above. Human complement Blood was obtained from human volunteers (informed consent approved by the University of Massachusetts Institutional Review Board) and serum was immunodepleted of IgG and IgM by passage over protein A/G plus agarose (Pierce) and anti-human IgM agarose columns (Sigma-Aldrich) to prepare complement ( [30](javascript:;)). flow-through was spin concentrated, equilibrated with PBS/0.1 mM EDTA, and sterilized by passage through a 0.22-m filter (Millipore). Hemolytic activity was determined using a total hemolytic complement kit (Binding Site, Birmingham, U.K.). FCM using FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG and anti-human IgM (Sigma-Aldrich) showed no detectable IgG or IgM binding in the depleted serum to strains that were used in experiments. Ab-depleted serum (henceforth referred to as complement) was aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. In some experiments C4BP function and binding to gonococci was blocked by adding mAb 104 ( [28](javascript:;), [31](javascript:;)) to complement (30 g mAb 104/100 l complement). Flow cytometry FCM was used to measure binding of mAb 2C7, C4BP, and deposition of complement C3 to bacteria as described previously ( [32](javascript:;)- [34](javascript:;)). All Abs were diluted in HBSS containing 2 mM each of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (HBSS++). Data were collected from a BD LSR II or FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and analyzed using a FlowJo analysis software program (version 7.2.5; Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Serum bactericidal assays ( [18](javascript:;), [29](javascript:;)). Briefly, bacteria harvested from an overnight culture on chocolate agar plates were repassaged onto fresh chocolate agar and grown for 6 h at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Approximately 2000 CFU gonococci in HBSS++ were incubated with complement (concentration specified for each experiment) either in the presence or absence of mAb 2C7 (concentration specified for each experiment). In some experiments, C4BP function was blocked by preincubating complement with 30 g/ml mAb 104 as described above. Final bactericidal reaction volumes were maintained at 150 l. Aliquots of 10 l were plated onto chocolate agar plates in duplicate at the beginning of the assay (t0) and again after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30 min (t30). Survival was calculated as the number of viable colonies at t30 relative to t0. Opsonophagocytosis assay using human polymorphonuclear neutrophils Human neutrophils were isolated from human blood over a Percoll gradient, and opsonophagocytosis assays were performed using freshly isolated IL-8-primed adherent neutrophils as previously described ( [35](javascript:;)). Briefly, bacteria were incubated with mAb 2C7 (4 g/ml) and/or human complement (20%), or with HBSS++ alone (controls) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C to permit IgG binding and C3 deposition. Reaction mixtures were added to IL-8-primed, adherent polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) at a multiplicity of infection of 1:1 and centrifuged at 400 \u00d7 g for 4 min at 10\u00b0C to achieve synchronous infection ( [35](javascript:;)). Cells were washed once with 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated were washed and lysed using 1% saponin in PBS at 0 min (taken immediately after the 10\u00b0C centrifugation step), and parallel wells were similarly treated at 60 min, serially diluted in GC broth, and plated to determine viable CFUs. Survival was expressed as the percentage of CFUs at 60 min relative to CFUs at 0 min. Statistical analysis Comparisons between two groups were made using the two-tailed unpaired t test. One-way ANOVA was used to compare multiple groups; pairwise comparisons were made by a Tukey post hoc test, whereas comparisons with a control group were made by a Dunnett test. Two-way ANOVA was employed to compare groups when time or concentrations were independent variables. Results Characterization of the LOS of the mutant strains A schematic of potential gonococcal LOS structures, the relevant enzymes involved in biosysthesis of the outer core, and the specificity of anti-LOS mAbs used to characterize LOS glycan extensions are shown in [Fig. 1A](javascript:;). Phase-variable expression of lgtA, C, and D in the HepI glycan extensions: HepI off, lgtC on, and lgtD on or off; expression of lgtD is extraneous in an lgtA off background), HepI 4-Hex on, lgtC and and D on, lgtC off). Phase-variable expression of lgtG controls expression of lactose on HepII. To investigate the role of HepI glycan extensions on the function of mAb 2C7, we constructed a series of mutants in the background of MS11 4/3/1 in which the phase-variable lgt loci (lgtA, C, D, and G) were genetically fixed either on or off. Lgt loci were fixed on by mutating the repetitive homopolymeric sequence found in each gene such that the homopolymer was removed but the coding sequence was not altered, as previously described ( [36](javascript:;)). The lgt loci were fixed off by deletion lgtD), insertional inactivation (lgtG), or by removing the homopolymeric sequence and inserting stop codons in all three reading frames (lgtC). The LOS structures expressed by individual mutants were characterized by Western blotting using the anti-LOS mAbs described in [Fig. 1A](javascript:;); relative masses of the LOSs were determined by SDS-PAGE ( [Fig. 1B](javascript:;)). For simplicity, we refer to the mutants used in this study by their longest predicted HepI structures assuming activity of all expressed Lgt enzymes. The on and off status of lgtG is indicated as G+ and G, respectively. For example, in lane 1 of [Fig. 1B](javascript:;), the mutant with lgtA and lgtD on is expected to have a 5-Hex HepI structure (note the use Hex in the text includes both hexoses and N-acetyl hexosamines). lgtG in this mutant is fixed on, so the mutant is referred to as 5-Hex/G+. This simplified designation for each mutant is provided at the bottom of [Fig. 1B](javascript:;) and in [Table I](javascript:;). Note that fixing an lgt on does not ensure that all of the LOS displayed on the bacterial surface will be substituted with the glycan added by the encoded Lgt enzyme(s) because transport of incomplete LOS molecules to the outer membrane from the site of assembly on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane may occur prior to the addition of a glycan by all Lgts that are fixed on. The amount and efficiency of each Lgt enzyme will determine the ratio of complete to incomplete LOS expressed ( [37](javascript:;)). An example of the transport of incomplete LOS shows that >50% of the LOS expressed by the two strains in which lgtD has been locked on (5-Hex/G+ and 5-Hex/G) reacts with mAb 3F11 and represent 4-Hex structures with a terminal lactosamine (the lower, more prominent band in lanes 1 and 2 shown in the silver stain row in [Fig. 1B](javascript:;)), indicating that, despite expression of lgtD, most LOS in these mutants is exported to the surface prior to the addition of the terminal GalNAc to LOS. Another example is provided by mAb L8, which reacts specifically with LOS structures that contain a lactose on HepI and no glycans from the 3-position of HepII (i.e., lgtA off and lgtG off, respectively) ( [23](javascript:;)). Thus, if all the LOSs expressed by mutants with lgtA off and lgtC and/or lgtG on were substituted with a terminal (1,4)-linked Gal on HepI and/or a proximal Glc on HepII, these mutants react with mAb L8. In fact, mAb L8 reacted with all three mutants that had lgtA off and lgtC and/or lgtG on (lanes 5-7 in the L8 blot in [Fig. 1B](javascript:;)), indicating export of LOS structures to the surface in these mutants prior to addition of Glc on HepII by LgtG (lanes 5 and 7) and/or the distal (1,4)-linked Gal on HepI (LgtC; lane 5). In contrast, fixing lgtA on (lgtA+) did not result in any detectable short LOS structures (no L8-reactive bands seen in lanes 2 and 4 of [Fig. 1B](javascript:;); mutants with lgtA on and lgtG off), suggesting that LgtA efficiently added GlcNAc to the proximal lactose on HepI. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed loss of HepII glycan extensions in the lgtG off mutants and the HepII mutants ( Mass spectrometry that all mutants expressed the expected HepI glycan extensions shown in [Table I](javascript:;), as well as incomplete structures as noted above. Further evidence that supported the presence of a terminal HexNAc residue in the 5-Hex/G+ and 5-Hex/G mutants was provided by -N-acetyl hexosaminidase treatment, which resulted in almost complete disappearance of the highest molecular mass band on silver staining of their LOS ( mAb 2C7 (concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 g/ml) to the LOS mutants was studied by FCM. The amount of mAb 2C7 bound to bacteria measured by FCM varied across the mutants ( [Fig. 2](javascript:;)). The 2-Hex/G+ mutant showed 3-Hex/G+ the least; 4- and 5-Hex/G+ mutants bound intermediate amounts of 2C7. Binding of mAb 2C7 requires lactose extension from HepII. As expected, none of the lgtG deletion (G) mutants showed binding above conjugate control levels (data not shown). [Close modal](javascript:;) HepI glycan extensions modulate The ability of mAb 2C7 to kill each of the four G+ mutants was studied next. Bacteria were incubated with either 2 or 4 g/ml mAb 2C7 and 20% human complement (normal human serum [NHS] depleted of IgG and IgM); survival at 30 min was measured by bacterial CFUs relative to CFUs at 0 min ( [Fig. 3](javascript:;)). As expected, control reactions (no mAb 2C7 added) showed no killing (>100% survival). Additional controls with mAb 2C7 alone (no added complement) or heat-inactivated complement also showed no killing (data not shown). The 2-Hex/G+ mutant showed >90% killing in the presence of 2 g/ml mAb 2C7; the 3-Hex/G+ mutant was fully g/ml mAb 2C7. The 4-Hex/G+ and 5-Hex/G+ mutants showed an intermediate pattern; that is, resistance (50% survival) to 2 g/ml 2C7, but sensitivity (<50% survival) to 4 g/ml 2C7 (in this instance, >90% killing was observed). The bactericidal data followed a hierarchy similar to that seen with mAb 2C7 binding ( [Fig. the efficacy of mAb 2C7 ( [29](javascript:;)) and could have contributed to differences in susceptibility to mAb 2C7. We measured binding of C4BP to the four G+ mutants using heat-inactivated serum as a source of C4BP and found that all G+ mutants bound high and similar amounts of C4BP ( [Supplemental Fig. 1](/jimmunol/article-supplement/104942/pdf/ji_1600374_supplemental_material_1/)). These findings are consistent with prior data showing that MS11 and its LOS derivatives that expressed at least two hexoses from HepI bound >100 phase-variable genes. confirm that differences in the binding of mAb 2C7 and killing between the 3-Hex/G+ and 2-Hex/G+ mutants were specifically related to LOS structure, lgtC was fixed on in the 2-Hex/G+ strain, permitting addition of Gal-(1,4) to HepI (strain designated as 23-Hex/G+), and lgtC was fixed off in the 3-Hex/G+ strain, which blocked addition of Gal-(1,4) to HepI (strain designated as 32-Hex/G+). The LOSs expressed by the mutants were verified by silver staining and with Western blots using mAbs mutants, 23-Hex/G+ and 32-Hex/G+, were next examined for their ability to bind and be killed by mAb 2C7 ( [Fig. 4B](javascript:;), [4C](javascript:;)). mutants, respectively. [Close modal](javascript:;) Serum resistance of 3-Hex/G+ is overcome by increasing complement concentrations or blocking C4BP binding We next asked whether serum resistance of the 3-Hex/G+ mutant could be overcome by either increasing complement concentrations or by blocking C4BP binding to bacteria. As shown in [Fig. 5A](javascript:;), in the presence of 4 g/ml 2C7, killing of 3-Hex/G+ was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the concentration of complement. Complement alone (mAb 2C7 absent), even at the highest concentration tested (70%), did not result in killing. Similar to our prior observations with strain MS11 ( [28](javascript:;)), mAb 104 mutant ( [Fig. 5B](javascript:;)), which resulted in enhanced killing by mAb 2C7 compared with control reactions that lacked mAb 104 ( [Fig. 5C](javascript:;)). Thus, increasing complement activation on the 3-Hex/G+ mutant either by increasing the concentration of complement or by decreasing complement inhibition by C4BP the 3-Hex/G+ mutant C3 fragments, in particular iC3b, deposited on bacteria enhance opsonophagocytosis. mAb 2C7 did not promote direct killing by complement of the 3-Hex/G+ mutant in serum bactericidal assays that used that C3 deposition on the 3-Hex/G+ mutant supports opsonophagocytic killing and constitutes a potential mechanism of protection by vaccine Ab. Total C3 (C3b and iC3b) deposition on the 3-Hex/G+ was measured by FCM; the three other G+ mutants were included as comparators. Bacteria were incubated with or 4 g/ml mAb 2C7 and 20% complement; C3 deposited at 15 and 30 min was measured. In the absence of mAb 2C7 there was minimal C3 deposition on all fluorescence intensity ( [Fig. 6](javascript:;))]. As expected, the 2-Hex/G+ mutant that was highly susceptible to complement-dependent killing showed the most rapid accumulation and the highest levels of C3 deposition. An intermediate amount of C3 was deposited on the 4-Hex mutant. The 3- and 5-Hex/G+ mutants bound the least; there was a trend toward less C3 on 3-Hex/G+ compared with 5-Hex/G+, but the differences were not significant. [Close modal](javascript:;) The Opa proteins of N. gonorrhoeae encompass a phase-variable family of proteins. Gonococci possess 11 opa genes and can express three or four Opa proteins simultaneously ( [39](javascript:;)) that can engage CEACAM3 on PMNs and mediate opsonophagocytic killing independent of Ab and complement ( [40](javascript:;), [41](javascript:;)). To address the potential role of mAb 2C7-dependent complement activation in facilitating opsonophagocytosis of the 3-Hex/G+ mutant, we recreated the 3-Hex/G+ LOS structure in the background of an Opa MS11 strain ( [42](javascript:;)). The 3-Hex/G+ Opa MS11 mutant strain bound similar (low) levels of mAb 2C7 and was fully resistant (>100% survival) to killing g/ml mAb 2C7 plus 20% complement ( [Fig. 7](javascript:;), far left), analogous to the 3-Hex/G+ in MS11 with its native opa genes intact. In the presence of both mAb 2C7 and complement (bar to the extreme right), PMNs caused a 60% decrease in bacterial survival (p < 0.01 compared with the control reaction with bacteria alone plus PMNs [second bar from left]). Compared to the control with bacteria and PMNs (second bar from left), reactions that contained bacteria, PMNs, and 2C7 (third bar from the left) or bacteria, PMNs, and complement (fourth bar from the left) did not show increased killing. [Close modal](javascript:;) Relative resistance of a 3-Hex-expressing lgtC phase variant of a clinical isolate to killing by mAb 2C7 To ascertain whether the decreased mAb 2C7 binding and increased resistance of the 3-Hex/G+ mutant was generalizable and not unique to strain MS11 alone, we identified 2-Hex and 3-Hex phase variants of an lgtA mutant (lgtA) of a minimally passaged isolate called UMNJ60_O6UM. Two natural variants of UMNJ60_O6UM lgtA were selected, one that expressed lactose on HepI (UMNJ60_O6UM 2-Hex; analogous with lgtC phase varied off and therefore did not react with mAb L1) and one that expressed 3-Hex Pk-like LOS on HepI (UMNJ60_O6UM 3-Hex; analogous with lgtC phase varied on and therefore reacted with mAb L1; see Ref. [43](javascript:;)). Both variants had lgtG phase on and therefore expressed lactose from HepII. The two variants were examined for mAb 2C7 killing in ( was killed >99 and 100% by complement in the presence of 2 and 4 g/ml 2C7, respectively; the 3-Hex variant survived 70 and 50% under similar conditions. [Close modal](javascript:;) Unlike the MS11 3-Hex/G+ mutant that was fully resistant (>100% survival) to killing by even 4 g/ml 3-Hex variant was partly susceptible to killing under similar conditions. As noted above, C4BP binds to certain N. gonorrhoeae strains, including MS11, serum resistance UMNJ60_O6UM C4BP, we compared C4BP binding to the two UMNJ60_O6UM LOS variants with the corresponding MS11 LOS mutants. Both UMNJ60_O6UM variants bound significantly lower amounts of C4BP did the corresponding MS11 LOS mutants ( [Fig. 8C](javascript:;)), thus providing a probable explanation for the greater sensitivity to complement of UMNJ60_O6UM variant 3-Hex compared with MS11 3-Hex/G+. Collectively, these data suggest that the 3-Hex HepI structure negatively affects mAb 2C7 binding and function. Discussion The role of LOS glycan extensions in the pathogenesis of N. gonorrhoeae, including their role in immune evasion, is well recognized. Much attention has been directed to LOS that expresses the LNnT structure on HepI, which mimics to male urethral epithelial cells ( [45](javascript:;)). A lectin-like interaction between the terminal lactosamine residue of LNnT and gonococcal Opa proteins plays a role in intergonococcal adhesion and the degree of colony opacity a surface-exposed the transfer of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) from the donor molecule CMP-Neu5Ac present in host secretions ( [48](javascript:;), [49](javascript:;)) onto the of the terminal Gal residue of LNnT. LNnT sialylation is involved in the inhibition of all three pathways of complement and enables gonococci to resist killing by natural IgG/IgM and complement in has electron micrographs of organisms in human secretions ( [53](javascript:;)). Schneider et al. ( [54](javascript:;)) also demonstrated the importance of phase variation of gonococcal LOS and LNnT sialylation in humans. They inoculated male volunteers intraurethrally with a variant of strain MS11 that expressed a (nonsialylated) 2-Hex HepI structure predominantly. At the onset of symptoms, several days later, almost all men shed bacteria that expressed LOS with predominantly longer (including the 4-Hex HepI), sialylatable HepI structures ( found that gonococci present in urethral exudates of infected men displayed an lgt genotype that sialylation of terminal whereas lgtC and lgtD were out-of-frame in most cases. The importance of LOS sialylation in pathogenesis has also been demonstrated in the mouse vaginal colonization/infection model; gonococcal mutants that lack mAb 2C7 against phase-variant and sialylated bacteria has been demonstrated both in vitro (organisms grown in media containing 2 g/ml CMP-Neu5Ac) ( [29](javascript:;)) and in vivo in mice, where LOS sialylation occurs ( [56](javascript:;)). Diversity of surface Ags generated by phase variation confers a survival advantage to microbes and enables them to adapt to different niches in the host. Phase variation of LOS also modulates resistance of N. gonorrhoeae to killing by NHS, independent LOS lgtA and lgtD binding of natural IgM present in NHS ( [60](javascript:;)) and enhances bacterial killing by complement ( [57](javascript:;)). Although the terminal GalNAc enhances killing by NHS, gonococci that possess LOS with this terminal residue interact with macrophage galactose-type lectin on dendritic cells. This may result in more pronounced Th2 and Th17 responses ( [61](javascript:;)), instead of [lactosyl] HepI), which also is a host glycan mimic, is also associated with increased resistance to NHS because most humans lack natural (IgG/IgM) Ab against this epitope ( [58](javascript:;)). Our studies of IgG/IgM in bactericidal assays. In contrast to previous studies where mutants with short HepI glycan extensions (e.g., lgtA off) were more resistant to killing by NHS ( [57](javascript:;), [59](javascript:;)), the 2-Hex/G+ mutant in the present study was more susceptible to killing by mAb 2C7 and complement (i.e., NHS depleted of IgG/IgM) than were the three remaining mutants because it bound the most mAb 2C7, which resulted in overwhelming complement activation. By comparison, the 5-Hex/G+ strain, ordinarily more sensitive to killing by IgM in NHS ( [60](javascript:;)), was relatively resistant to killing by mAb 2C7 plus complement because it bound less mAb 2C7. We replicated previous studies and showed killing (100% killing in 10% serum [IgG and IgM intact]) of the 5-Hex/G+ mutant; 2- and 3-Hex/G+ strains were fully serum (>100% survival in 10% NHS). The 2C7 LOS epitope represents a promising vaccine candidate. Separately, we have shown that HepII glycan extension, required to generate the epitope, is also important in the mouse model of gonococcal colonization/infection, where an lgtG deletion mutant of strain FA1090 was shown to be less fit ( [14](javascript:;)). A role for HepII glycans in gonococcal pathogenesis is supported by the observation that >95% (96 of 101) of minimally passaged clinical isolates reacted with mAb 2C7 ( [11](javascript:;)). A contemporary analysis of >70 gonococcal isolates recovered from men with urethritis attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases in Nanjing, China, has substantiated these findings; all the recovered isolates bind mAb 2C7 (P.A. Rice, L.A. Lewis, and S. Ram, unpublished observations). A potential reason for 2C7 vaccine resistance would be selection of LOS variants that show decreased binding of Ab. One explanation would be natural selection of variants expressing LOS with lgtG off. However, loss of LgtG expression may reduce fitness and therefore not be favored ( [14](javascript:;)). The hypothesis addressed in our study was that other different HepI LOS structures may affect binding and function of mAb 2C7, an important consideration in predicting vaccine efficacy and coverage. Strains that expressed the Pk-like LOS structure (represented by the 3-Hex/G+ mutant) bound the least amount of mAb 2C7 and were relatively resistant to complement-mediated killing by mAb 2C7. With the exception of LgtC, which adds the terminal Gal on HepI of the 3-Hex/G+ mutant via an -linkage, glycans added by enzymes the 3-Hex/G+ may hinder access of mAb 2C7 to its epitope. Several microbes bind C4BP, an inhibitor of the classical pathway, to evade killing by complement ( [66](javascript:;)). MS11 binds C4BP and mAb 2C7 must surmount this barrier to mediate killing through membrane attack complex insertion. The inhibiting role of C4BP was evident when C4BP binding to bacteria and C4BP function were blocked using mAb 104, resulting in increased killing of bacteria. Moreover, the 3-Hex variant of a clinical strain that bound low levels of C4BP (UMNJ60_06UM) was more susceptible to killing by mAb 2C7 than was the MS11 3-Hex/G+ that binds high levels of C4BP. Despite the absence of killing through the membrane attack complex, mAb 2C7 deposited sufficient C3 on 3-Hex/G+ bacteria to enable human PMNs to decrease CFUs by >50%. Of note, maximal opsonophagocytic killing by PMNs required both Ab and complement; either one alone did not result in killing above baseline levels when bacteria only were incubated with PMNs. The neisserial Pk-like LOS sialylation of LNnT LOS, sialylation of Pk-like LOS does not enhance FH binding to bacteria and confers resistance to only low, but not high, concentrations of NHS ( [43](javascript:;)). Whereas McLaughlin et al. ( [55](javascript:;)) found that lgtC was out-of-frame in all seven samples of N. gonorrhoeae obtained directly from male urethras, Mandrell ( [68](javascript:;)) reported that as many as 36 of 70 (51%) of strains surveyed in vitro bound mAb 3D9, which reacts with the Pk Ag. The advantage conferred by the gonococcal Pk-like LOS in vivo remains to be elucidated. How mAb 2C7 decreases gonococcal burden and duration of infection in vivo\u2014that is, the specific contributions of direct complement-mediated killing, opsonophagocytosis, or other novel mechanisms of Ab-mediated clearance\u2014remains to be elucidated. Notwithstanding the differences in direct killing of the mutants by mAb 2C7 and complement, enhanced C3 deposition occurred on all the HepI/G+ mutants; in particular, the 3-Hex/G+ mutant, which was not killed directly, was opsonophagocytosed and killed. Our findings support the inclusion of the 2C7 LOS epitope in a vaccine candidate against N. gonorrhoeae.
