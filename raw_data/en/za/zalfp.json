Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1 2007 Review Article Page 25Abstract The common cold is the leading cause of doctor visits in the United States and annually results in 189 million lost school days. In the course of one year the U.S. population contracts approximately 1 billion colds. Influenza infection is still a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for 20- 25 million doctor visits and 36,000 deaths per year in the United States. Conventional therapies for colds and flu focus primarily on temporary symptom relief and include over-the- counter antipyretics, anti-inflammatories, and decongestants. Treatment for influenza also includes prescription antiviral agents and vaccines for prevention. This article reviews the common cold and influenza viruses, presents the conventional treatment options, and highlights tinctoria ) and nutritional considerations (vitamins A and C, zinc, high lactoferrin whey protein, N-acetylcysteine, and DHEA) that may help in the prevention and treatment of these conditions. (Altern Med Rev 2007;12(1):25-48)Colds and Influenza: A Review of Diagnosis and Conventional, Botanical, and Nutritional Considerations Mario Roxas, ND and Julie Jurenka, MT (ASCP) Introduction The common cold, also referred to as acute viral nasopharyngitis, is a mild, self-limiting infectious disease that can be caused by more than 100 different viruses. Of these, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are re - sponsible for approximately 50-70 percent of all colds.1,2 Colds were known to man even in ancient Egypt where they were depicted in hieroglyphs. The Greek physician Hippocrates described the disease as early as the 5th century BC. In 1914, W alter Kruse, a German profes - sor, demonstrated that viruses, not bacteria, cause the common cold,3 but the finding was not widely accepted until the 1920s when Alphonse Dochez confirmed it in chimpanzees and humans. The term \"cold\" was likely derived from ancient physicians who described \"cold conditions\" and \"warm conditions\" that were dependent on or caused by cold or warm environments. In modern times the misnomer has persisted, possibly due to the viruses' effect on thermogenesis. People are thought to associate the shivering from a viral-induced fever with shivering from being in a cold climate.4 Although generally benign in symptomol - ogy, cold viruses are the most common infectious dis - eases humans contract and result in significant costs to the economy in lost workdays and school attendance. Adults average 2-4 colds per year and children 6-10, depending on age and exposure.5 A 2003 study found common colds resulted in more than 100 million phy - sician visits annually, at a cost of $7.7 billion.

The study also found Americans spend nearly $3 billion annually on over- the-counter drugs that may not provide any symptom relief. In addition, an estimated 189 million school days are missed due to colds, which consequently result in 126 million missed workdays by parents who stay home to care for sick children.6 Influenza is an acute respiratory illness caused primarily by the influenza virus (serotypes A and B). It occurs worldwide and is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. The first report of what was likely an influenza epidemic was noted in 1173-1174,7 and the first definitive report occurred in 1694.8 During the 18th century, data on flu epidemics increased con - siderably, with comprehensive reports appearing in the 19th century.7,9-11 Influenza A viruses were first isolated in the laboratory from human specimens in 1933,12 and in 1957 the virus was made available for labora - tory analysis.13 Subsequent studies have demonstrated the influenza virus mutates rapidly (antigenic drift), creating difficulties each year for researchers trying to develop effective vaccines.14 Influenza - usually more severe than the com - mon cold - typically causes fever, headache, muscle aches, and a more significant cough; however, mild cases of influenza are similar to colds. Of the two serotypes, influenza A occurs more frequently and is more dan - gerous. Although most epidemics and pandemics are caused by influenza A, both A and B serotypes fre - quently co-circulate during yearly outbreaks. Although influenza B is usually less severe, in children the clinical presentation may be similar to that of influenza A.15 In- fluenza-like illness is clinically similar to true influenza but is caused by a virus other than influenza A or B (e.g., the respiratory syncytial virus).16 In the United States, influenza epidemics typi - cally occur during the winter months; the influenza \"sea - son\" stretches from fall to spring in the Northern Hemi - sphere, with peak activity from December through early March. Between 1990 and 1999, 36,000 deaths per year were attributed to influenza in the United States.17,18 In influenza epidemic years, 10 percent or more of the population is typically infected, with about 50 per - cent of those infected showing symptoms.19 Although influenza viruses infect every age group, children have the highest infection rates. Serious illness and death rates are highest among the elderly, young children un - der age two, and those with medical conditions placing them at increased risk for influenza complications.17 Because of the potential severity and epidemic/ pandemic possibilities, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends annual immunizations for persons at high risk for influenza- related complications, persons who live with or care for persons at high risk, and health care workers. The objec - tive is that immunizations will prevent hospitalization and/or death and reduce influenza-related respiratory illnesses, decrease physician visits among all age groups, prevent otitis media among children, and decrease work absenteeism.17 Incidence and Etiopathology Common Cold Although acute upper respiratory tract infec - tions can be attributed to several different viral agents, over 50 percent are caused by rhinoviruses. Coronavi - ruses account for 10-20 percent, followed by influenza viruses (10-15%) and adenoviruses (5%).20,21 Rhinoviruses belong to the Picornaviridae family, (i.e., \"pico\" for small and \"RNA \" because they are RNA viruses). Other Picornaviridae family mem - bers include enteroviruses and hepadnaviruses (such as hepatitis A); there are over 100 different rhinovirus serotypes.20 Rhinovirus infections are typically limited to the nasopharynx but may also affect the middle ear and sinuses. Rhinoviruses grow in a fairly narrow temperature range (33-35\u00b0 C/91.4-95\u00b0 F), a range ac - commodated by the upper respiratory tract. The lower respiratory tract, however, is warmer and consequently inhospitable to the virus. Because rhinoviruses cannot tolerate an acidic environment, the warmer temperature and acidic environment of the stomach render these vi - ruses unlikely to cause gastrointestinal infections. Although rhinovirus infections can occur any - time, they are more prevalent in the fall and spring; whereas, coronaviruses seem to occur more often in the winter and early spring.20 Approximately 70-80 per - cent of exposed individuals present with symptoms.20 The virus is spread by direct person-to-person contact, Copyright \u00a9 2007 Thorne Research, Inc.

Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1 2007 Review Article Page 27contact with contaminated surfaces (e.g., telephone re - ceivers, stair rails, etc.), and inhalation of large-particle aerosols. Rhinoviruses bind to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) sites on the epithelium of the nasopharynx. T ypically the infected areas tend to be isolated, dispersed foci that account for a relatively small portion of epithelium.22 Infected cells release interleukin-8 (IL-8), a strong chemo-attractant that stimulates the release of inflammatory mediators, such as kinins and prostaglandins. Presence of these sub - stances can increase vasodilation, vascular permeability, and exocrine gland secretion, ultimately leading to - sic cold symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. Higher concentration of IL-8 translates to greater intensity of symptoms.20 Medical evidence suggests that, despite com - monly held beliefs, exposure to cold temperature or getting chilled or overheated does not increase suscep - tibility to infection. Furthermore, upper respiratory tract abnormalities (e.g., enlarged tonsils or adenoids) are not thought to place an individual at greater risk of contracting a cold. However, studies have demonstrated that psychological stress and allergic conditions affect - ing the nose and throat influence susceptibility to infec - tion.23 Influenza Although there are three classified serotypes of influenza viruses (A, B, and C), only the previously mentioned A and B types are associated with the human disease most commonly referred to as \"the flu.\" These viruses are divided into various subgroups based on an - tigenic characteristics. For instance, influenza A viruses are typically divided into two general subtypes that cor - respond to two different antigens on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin and neuramidase. Hemagglutinin antigen (HA) is a glycoprotein that allows the virus to bind to cellular sialic acid and fuse with the host mem - brane. Neuramidase antigen (NA), on the other hand, breaks down sialic acid, allowing the virus to disperse from the infected cell. Point mutations occur in influenza A and B viruses, resulting in the frequent emergence of new vi - ral strains (antigenic drift). Consequently, antibodies generated to the previous strain have limited protection against an infection of a new variant, placing the body in a constant game of \"catch-up\" with the virus. Influenza epidemics are usually associated with a single serotype. However, it is possible for different in - fluenza viruses to appear sequentially in one location or to have multiple influenza strains infect the same area simultaneously.24 In the United States, an epidemic oc - curs every 2-3 years, most often caused by influenza A viruses.24 Influenza B viruses typically produce milder disease and do not undergo antigenic drift as rapidly as influenza A viruses.25 Signs and Symptoms Common Cold Cold symptoms occur within 1-2 days after inoculation, and peak 2-4 days later, although some ac - counts report symptoms presenting less than 24 hours after exposure.20 Symptoms often start with a tickle or soreness in the throat, followed by sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, and general malaise. T emperature is usually normal. Nasal discharge is clear, watery, and can be quite profuse initially, subsequently turning more mucoid and purulent. If a cough is present it is gener - ally mild and may persist up to two weeks. A simple, uncomplicated cold usually resolves within 10 days. Influenza The incubation period for an influenza infec - tion is 1-4 days. Mild cases of the flu present very much like a common cold (e.g., sore throat, rhinorrhea); mild conjunctivitis may also occur. However, in a typical flu presentation an individual rapidly experiences chills and high fever, prostration, cough, body aches and pains, headache (particularly behind the eyes), increased sen - sitivity to light, and generalized malaise. Respiratory symptoms include sore throat, coryza, and a productive or non-productive cough. Children may also experience nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain; infants may pres - ent with a sepsis-like syndrome. Acute symptoms usually subside within 2-3 days, although fever may last up to five days. The illness typically resolves after 3-7 days if no complications are present. However, cough and general malaise can last for weeks. T able 1 compares the characteristics of influ - enza and the common cold.Copyright \u00a9 2007 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1 2007 Colds and Influenza Page 28Potential Complications Common Cold Although most rhinovirus infections are self- limiting, they can act as a secondary insult to the upper respiratory tract in the presence of conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, or any lower respiratory tract illness in infants, elderly, smokers, or immune-compromised patients. The presence of puru - lent sputum or significant lower respiratory tract symp - toms can be indications of more than a simple rhinovi - ral infection. One study of 533 individuals (ages 60- 90) revealed chronic medical conditions increased the likelihood of lower respiratory complications from rhinovirus infections by 40 percent. Smokers had a 47-percent increased risk of developing complica - tions.26 Diagnosis of bronchitis usually involves pulmo - nary function tests, chest x-ray, and possibly a sputum culture.27 Viral pneumonia is another potential com - plication. Usually the pneumonia is mild and resolves without treatment within a few weeks, but some cases are more serious and can require hospitalization. As with bronchitis, populations at risk for developing se - vere viral pneumonia are those with impaired immune systems, chronic medical conditions, impaired lung function, young children (especially those with heart defects), and the elderly.

Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1 2007 Review Article Page 29may require blood tests, chest x-ray, and possibly naso - pharyngeal or sputum cultures.27 A viral infection can also travel to the sinus - es or ears and cause excessive mucus secretion. Sinus openings or ear canals can become blocked as mucus accumulates, becoming a breeding ground for bacteria and other organisms. Even if a bacterial infection does develop, antibiotics may not speed recovery of an ear or sinus infection and the infection will usually resolve on its own. It is estimated 80 percent of children with otitis media get better without antibiotics.28 There is minimal convincing evidence that children prescribed antibiotics for otitis media have shorter symptom dura - tion, fewer recurrences, or better long-term outcomes than those who do not receive antibiotics.29 Despite this, in the case of ear infections in young children who are very uncomfortable and crying, physicians will often prescribe an antibiotic to placate a stressed parent, even if the physician suspects a viral agent. Unfortunately, over-prescribing systemic antibiotics (particularly peni - cillin derivatives such as amoxicillin) has resulted in sig - nificant antibiotic resistance for the two bacterial patho - gens most commonly isolated from the nasopharynx of children with otitis media - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza .30Although bacterial sinus infections secondary to the common cold usually resolve within two weeks with self-care, antibiotics are often prescribed when a bacterial infection develops. Diagnosis is typically via exam of sinuses and ears with a fiber-optic scope, sinus x-rays, or nasal swab cultures.27 Influenza In addition to the complications observed with the common cold, influenza can on rare occasions re - sult in encephalitis. When the virus enters the blood - stream it can localize in the brain, causing inflammation of brain tissue and membranes. In an effort to fight off the infection, white blood cells invade the brain tissue, causing cerebral edema and destruction of nerve cells, bleeding within the brain, and brain damage. Symp - toms can include fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, drowsiness, muscle weakness, or seizures.31 Certain population groups have been identi - fied as high risk for influenza and its potential compli - cations. These groups are considered top priority for attention when it comes to prophylactic and treatment measures and are identified in T able 2. Diagnosis Because the signs and symptoms of the com - mon cold occur so often, most people are familiar with them and are able to self-diagnose. When a health care provider is seen, diagnosis will likely be via recent pa - tient history, fiber-optic scope examination of the ear, nose, and throat, lymph node palpation, and stethoscope evaluation of the lungs. The provider also determines whether symptoms of more serious respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia or bronchitis are present. Although no laboratory tests are available to detect cold viruses because of myriad viral agents, throat cultures, blood tests, or x-rays can rule out a secondary infection. Influenza diagnosis based on clinical symptoms alone can be difficult because infections caused by other viral agents, including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza viruses, can pres - ent with the same early symptoms. Diagnosis involves a recent patient history, checking body temperature, fiber-optic examination of ears, nose and throat, and stethoscopic evaluation of the lungs.

Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1 2007 Colds and Influenza Page 30or other closed communities, laboratory testing for in - fluenza can help confirm influenza as the cause of the outbreak.32 Preferred samples for influenza testing include nasopharyngeal swab or nasal swab, wash, or aspirate; sample collection should take place within a few days of symptom onset. Results from rapid influenza tests are available in 30 minutes or less, but viral culture can take 3-10 days. Most of the rapid tests are >70-percent sensitive for detecting influenza and >90-percent spe - cific. Viral culture of respiratory samples is the only way to determine which influenza A or B strain is causing illness. Viral culture also allows researchers and epide - miologists to watch for outbreaks of influenza and in - fluenza-like illness in order to develop vaccines for the coming year.32 Conventional Prevention and Treatment Over-the-Counter Treatments Because colds and influenza are usually self- limiting, treatment tends to focus on reducing symptom duration and intensity and minimizing risk of compli - cations. For the common cold, a warm and comfort - able environment and rest and hydration are often all that is needed. If additional intervention is necessary, over-the-counter anti-inflammatory agents, analgesics, and nasal/oral decongestants can be used for temporary symptom relief. Potential drawbacks do exist to symptom sup - pression by over-the-counter medications. For instance, - rine) dry nasal secretions. Although this is the desired effect, an excessively dry mucosa can increase risk of infection, not only in the nasopharynx but the sinuses as well. In addition, when nasal decongestants are used for an extended period of time (more than five consecu - tive days) and then discontinued, a rebound effect of worsened symptoms can occur due to mucosal depen - dence on the drug.33 Furthermore, use of decongestants are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular dis - ease, hypertension, diabetes, prostatic hypertrophy, and thyroid conditions because decongestants can increase blood pressure, exacerbate thyroid symptoms, and cause difficulty in urination.Because influenza is often accompanied by a fe - ver, an antipyretic (most frequently aspirin or acetamin - ophen) is often added to over-the-counter analgesics, antihistamines, and anti-inflammatory agents used for symptom relief. When treating children, however, using aspirin should be avoided because of concerns linking its use to Reye's syndrome. Fever is an important clinical indicator and is generally a healthy reaction by the body to combat in - fection and regain homeostasis. Although a low-grade fever (37.2-38.3\u00b0 C/99-101\u00b0 F) can facilitate healing, fe - vers are commonly suppressed for the purpose of patient comfort. Body temperature can rise to 41\u00b0 C/105.8\u00b0 F without harm.34 There are, however, instances when a fever can place the patient at risk and use of antipyretics may be indicated. Several non-pharmacological thera - pies, such as tepid baths and body sponging, may be employed as alternatives. Antiviral Agents Antiviral drugs limit the ability of the influ - enza virus to infect respiratory epithelial cells and can offer modest symptomatic relief. Although treatment is generally recommended for high-risk patients who develop influenza-like symptoms, there is no evidence these drugs decrease the risk of serious complications in these patients.24,35 Furthermore, they must be adminis - tered within 48 hours of symptom onset to be effective. Although antiviral medications can be used to prevent influenza infection, immunization is the preferred mea - sure for prophylaxis in the conventional medical model. In the United States, four antiviral agents are available for use against influenza: reduce the dura - tion of uncomplicated influenza A infection by inhibit - ing virus penetration or uncoating. Adamantine deriva - tives were the first effective antiviral agents for treatment of influenza. Although some reports claim amantadine or rimantadine can prevent 70-90 percent of influenza A illness, the drugs must be taken from 10 days to six weeks for effectiveness,36 and are not effective against influenza B infections.Copyright \u00a9 2007 Thorne Research, Inc.

Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1 2007 Review Article Page 31Resistance to amantadine and rimantadine can develop rapidly, rendering the drugs ineffective. Approximately 30 percent of treated individuals start shedding resistant variants 2-5 days after beginning treatment.36 Although the drug resistance that develops during treatment does not affect the efficacy of treat - ment for the patient, it can result in transmission of a resistant virus to contacts.21 T o reduce the potential for drug resistance, treatment should be stopped after 3-5 days (or 1-2 days after symptoms resolve). Side effects such as nervousness and/or insom - nia occur in 10 percent of individuals receiving aman - tadine and two percent receiving rimantadine, and are more prominent in the elderly and in those with CNS disease or impaired renal function. Other possible ad - verse effects include anorexia, nausea, and constipa - tion.24 In patients with impaired renal function, dosage is decreased according to creatinine clearance. Rimanta - dine dosage should not exceed 100 mg/day in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Zanamivir and Oseltamivir Zanamivir and oseltamivir are newer anti-in - fluenza drugs that can reduce the duration of uncom - plicated influenza A and B infections. These drugs are neuramidase inhibitors, meaning they essentially block the activity of the neuramidase enzyme on the surface of the influenza virus, consequently preventing the spread of the virus to uninfected cells. Drug resistance with neuramidase inhibitors is also a concern, although not to the same extent as the adamantine derivatives. Fewer adverse side effects are associated with neuramidase inhibitors compared to the adamantine counterparts. Clinical trials on zana - mivir and oseltamivir show headache and gastrointes - tinal disturbance to be the most common side effects (oseltamivir produced occasional nausea and vomiting), with occurrence comparable to that of placebo.37-40 Al- though neuramidase inhibitors work on both influenza A and B and are associated with fewer side effects, they are significantly more expensive than adamantine de - rivatives. Because zanamivir is only available as an orally inhaled powder, it can cause bronchospasm and should be avoided in patients with underlying reactive airway disease.24,36,41Influenza V accinations Although antiviral medications offer preven - tive support, conventional medicine regards vaccination as the standard of care for preventing influenza and its complications.25 V accines are typically modified each year to include the most prevalent strains from the previous season: usually two influenza A viruses (e.g., H3N2 and H1N1) and one B virus, as the vaccine is only effec - tive against three particular strains in any given season. When the vaccine contains the same hemagglutinin an - tigen and/or neuramidase antigen as the strains in the community, vaccination can decrease infections by 70- 90 percent in healthy adults under age 65.24 There are, however, several hundred strains of influenza circulat - ing at any time, and healthy adults are not the popula - tion in most need of vaccination. Interestingly, vaccines appear to be less effec - tive in institutionalized elderly patients. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), even when the match between the vaccine and the circulating virus is close, the efficacy rate of the flu vaccination drops to 30-40 percent for institutionalized individuals over age 65.32 A report on the influenza vaccination effect on seasonal mortality in the elderly revealed that, although in the United States the number of individuals age 65 and older getting flu vaccinations increased from 15-50 percent before 1980 to 65 percent in 2001, the actual rate of flu-related deaths did not decline.42 V accine-induced immunity decreases with an - tigenic drift; therefore, prior vaccinations provide less or no protection as the viruses mutate. Furthermore, vaccination offers no protection against antigenic shift, which occurs when two different strains of influenz a combine to form a new subtype having a mixture of the surface antigen s of the two original strains. T wo forms of influenza vaccines are available for administration, an inactivated influenza vaccine and a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), both of which are antigenically equivalent to the annually rec - ommended strains. Because both vaccines use influenza viruses initially grown in embryonated hens eggs, they may contain trace amounts of residual egg protein and are contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphy - lactic reactions to chicken or egg protein.24,25Copyright \u00a9 2007 Thorne Research, Inc.

Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1 2007 Colds and Influenza Page 32Although inactivated influenza vaccines con - taining killed viruses do not produce signs or symptoms of influenza virus infection, LAIV has the potential to produce mild flu-like signs or symptoms. In the United States, the LAIV is administered intranasally to healthy individuals, ages 5-50 years. The vaccine should not be given to patients in high-risk groups, pregnant women, household contacts of immune-deficient patients, or children receiving chronic aspirin therapy. Children, ages 5-8 years, not previously vaccinated with the LAIV , should receive a second dose at least six weeks after the first dose. The most common adverse effects associated with flu vaccines range from localized pain at the injec - tion site (for the inactivated vaccine) to rhinorrhea, fe - ver, fatigue, painful joints, and headache.24,25,43 Guillain- Barre syndrome has been reported as a possible serious adverse effect occurring within two weeks of vaccina - tion.43 Although some studies assess the risk at 10 cases per million persons vaccinated,44 it is recommended that individuals with a history of Guillain-Barre syn - drome not be vaccinated.32 In an interesting blend of conventional treat - ment and alternative therapies, a small randomized, controlled, eight-week study was conducted on 41 adult participants exploring the alterations in brain and im - mune function produced by mindfulness meditation. Brain activity was measured before, immediately after, and four months after an eight-week clinical training program in mindfulness meditation. At the end of the eight-week period, subjects in both the experimental and control groups were inoculated with influenza vac - cine. Results of the study revealed significant increases in left-sided anterior brain activation and antibody ti - ters to the influenza vaccine in meditators versus non- meditators, indicating meditation might improve one's response to flu vaccines.45Alternative Treatments for Cold and Flu Nutritional Considerations Vitamin C Since the 1940s, numerous studies have sug - gested high doses of vitamin C both prevent and reduce the effects of the common cold. And, ever since Linus Pauling - a highly respected, two-time Nobel prize winner - advocated large doses of vitamin C in his 1970 bestseller, Vitamin C and the Common Cold, interest in vitamin C for treating colds and other viruses has sky - rocketed. A meta-analysis of 29 controlled trials investi - gated the benefits of 200 mg vitamin C daily for the common cold in 11,077 subjects.46 The meta-analysis revealed vitamin C prophylaxis does appear to reduce the duration and severity of colds, but not the incidence. However, regarding incidence, in a subgroup of six studies in which subjects were under significant physi - cal stress from exercise training in cold northern cli - mates (soldiers, skiers, or marathon runners), subjects on vitamin C prophylaxis demonstrated a 50-percent reduction in incidence of the common cold.47 The 29- trial meta-analysis also examined the effect of vitamin C prophylaxis on cold duration (n=9,676 colds). Doses of 200 mg daily shortened cold duration in children by 14 percent and eight percent in adults. The effect of prophylactic vitamin C on cold severity was examined in several of the trials, (7,045 respiratory episodes) and those taking vitamin C experienced slightly fewer \"at home\" days than those not taking vitamin C, suggesting a less severe infection.46 T able 3 summarizes the preven - tion studies from this meta-analysis for which full text was available. The meta-analysis also evaluated the efficacy of vitamin C taken at the onset of cold symptoms (for treatment rather than prevention) and found no statis - tically significant benefit in cold duration or severity,46 with the exception of one large trial that reported a reduction in duration with 8 g vitamin C at symptom onset.55 T able 4 summarizes the treatment studies from this meta-analysis for which full text was available.

However, in a subgroup of six trials involving 642 soldiers, skiers, and marathon runners exercising in cold climates, individuals on vitamin C prophylaxis had only a 50-percent chance of developing a cold compared to subjects exercising in cold climates and not taking vitamin C (pooled RR: 0.50). Cold duration: In trial comparisons involving 9,676 respiratory episodes, adults on vitamin C prophylaxis experienced an eight-percent reduction in cold duration compared to placebo, while children on prophylaxis experienced a 15-percent reduction in cold duration compared to placebo. Cold severity: Pooled analysis of trial comparisons involving 7,045 respiratory episodes among adults and children revealed a modest, yet statistically significant, decrease in cold severity in those taking vitamin C prophylaxis. The main outcomes measured were missed school or work days and mean symptom severity score. However, results were inconsistent and parameters used to measure severity varied greatly among the trials.

Summary of Vitamin C Studies for Treatment of the Common Cold55,58,66-70The following is a summary of meta- analysis conclusions.46 Prophylaxis trials (vitamin C given to prevent colds): Copyright \u00a9 2007 Thorne Research, Inc.

Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1 2007 Review Article Page 35One drawback to trials using high-dose vitamin C is that gastrointestinal side effects make it difficult to keep the trials double-blind. Consequently, any effective trial using therapeutic doses of 2-10 g daily is met with skepticism by the conventional medical community.71 Some of the studies in the meta-analysis showing little or no effect used vitamin C dosages considered \"small\" by vitamin C advocates (100-500 mg per day). Another factor is the plasma half-life of high- dose vitamin C, which is approximately 30 minutes.72 This suggests most studies are methodologically flawed because vitamin C, when not dosed frequently enough, would be expected to show only minimal benefit. The Vitamin C Foundation (formed by a group of highly- regarded physicians and researchers specializing in or - thomolecular medicine and headed by Abram Hoffer, MD, PhD) recommends very high doses of vitamin C for the common cold - an initial dosage of up to 8 g every 20-30 minutes.73 Unfortunately, oral doses of this magnitude are not feasible for most people due to gas - trointestinal symptoms, with supplementation often be - ing discontinued. Vitamin C supplementation in large, divided doses over several days is likely to be the most effective at alleviating symptoms or shortening cold du - ration. In the case of influenza, few clinical trials have examined the efficacy of vitamin C. In a controlled trial of 226 patients with influenza A, 114 patients received 300 mg vitamin C daily, while 112 patients served as controls; outcomes measured were development of pneumonia and duration of hospital stay. Pneumonia was reported in two cases in the treatment group and 10 in the control group, while hospital stays for influ - enza or related complications averaged nine days in the vitamin C group and 12 days in the control group.74A two-year, controlled trial of 715 students (ages 18-32) examined the effect of high-dose vitamin C in preventing and relieving the symptoms of viral-in - duced respiratory infections (colds and flu). In the con - trol group of 463 students, those reporting symptoms were treated with decongestants and pain relievers. The 252 students in the treatment group were divided into those reporting symptoms and those who were asymp - tomatic. Symptomatic individuals were given hourly doses of 1 g vitamin C for the first six hours, and then 1 g three times daily until symptoms subsided; asymptom - atic students received 1 g three times daily throughout the test period. In the test group, vitamin C administra - tion resulted in an 85-percent decrease in cold and flu symptoms compared to the control group. The results of this study are difficult to interpret, however, as the study period was not clearly defined and data did not separate the incidence of colds versus the flu.75 Zinc Zinc plays an important role in maintaining healthy immune function. Human studies have ob - served even a mild zinc deficiency can elicit changes in immune status, such as defective natural killer (NK) cell function, decreased interleukin-2 production, and anergy.76 Zinc supplementation has long been considered an effective means of reducing the duration of the com - mon cold. In a randomized study, 200 healthy children were assigned to receive either oral zinc sulfate (15 mg elemental zinc) or placebo daily for seven months, with an increase to 15 mg twice daily at the onset of a cold. The mean number of colds in the zinc group was sta - tistically significantly fewer than the placebo group (1.2 versus 1.7 colds per child, respectively; p=0.003), while mean cold-related school absences was 0.9 days for the zinc group versus 1.3 days in the placebo group.77 Several trials have examined the use of zinc lozenges for colds, with mixed results (T able 5).78-84 One placebo-controlled, seven-day study observed 65 indi - viduals who took either a loading dose of 46 mg zinc (two zinc gluconate lozenges) followed by 23 mg zinc (one lozenge) or placebo every two wakeful hours until symptoms were absent for six hours. After seven days 86 percent of the zinc group were symptom-free com - pared to 46 percent of the placebo group (p=0.0005).78 Cold duration: In an analysis of seven trials involving 3,294 respiratory episodes, vitamin C provided no significant benefit to duration of cold symptoms compared to placebo. Cold severity: No statistically significant effect of vitamin C on cold severity was observed in treatment groups compared to placebo when four trials involving 2,753 respiratory episodes were analyzed.Therapeutic trials (vitamin C given at onset of a cold): Copyright \u00a9 2007 Thorne Research, Inc.

Zinc lozenge shortened the duration of cold by 7 days. Study Length Study (year) Sample Size Zinc Form Dosage of Zinc Findings One study involving 48 adults found zinc acetate loz - enges (12.8 mg zinc per lozenge) taken every 2-3 hours while awake reduced the duration of cold symptoms compared to placebo (4.5 versus 8.1 days).84 In a seven-month, phase IV trial, 134 school children were given 13.3 mg zinc (one zinc gluconate lozenge) daily as a preventive and 53.2 mg zinc (four zinc gluconate lozenges) daily at cold onset until symptoms resolved. Previously collected data was used as a control. Average cold duration of the zinc group was 6.9\u00b13.1 days versus 9.0\u00b13.5 days for the control group.80 Several studies have concluded, however, that zinc lozenges fare no better than placebo.81-83 One study involving two arms (273 adults with induced colds; 281 adults with natural colds) examined the effects of zinc gluconate (13.3 mg zinc) or zinc acetate (5 or 11.5 mg zinc) lozenges compared to placebo. The treatment groups took six lozenges daily of their respective prepa - ration from cold onset until symptoms resolved, for a maximum of 14 days. The subjects with induced colds Copyright \u00a9 2007 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved. No Reprint Without Written Permission. Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1, March 2007. Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1 2007 Review Article Page 37taking zinc gluconate demonstrated a median duration of illness of 2.5 days compared to 3.5 days in the pla - cebo group (p=0.35); no significant change was noted in symptom severity compared to placebo. The zinc ac - etate group yielded no significant change in cold dura - tion or symptom severity compared to placebo. In the experimental arm involving subjects with natural colds, none of the zinc groups yielded any significant change in duration of cold and/or severity of symptoms com - pared to placebo.82 In another study, the efficacy of zinc gluconate lozenges (10 mg zinc per lozenge) compared to placebo was examined in 249 school children. Lozenges were dosed at one lozenge five times daily (grades 1-6) or six times daily (grades 7-12) from cold onset until symp - toms were absent for six hours. No significant differen- ces were noted between the zinc and placebo groups.83 A meta-analysis of the effect of zinc gluconate lozenges for the common cold analyzed eight random - ized, clinical trials. Although the researchers cited limi - tations to their analysis (e.g., dependence on the validity of the studies and the fact that their analysis was limited to a single variable [presence of \"any\" cold symptom af - ter seven days of treatment]), the authors found weak evidence for the efficacy of zinc gluconate lozenges in reducing cold duration.81 Differences in zinc preparations, including form (zinc gluconate versus zinc acetate), amount (elemental zinc per lozenge; ranges from 5-23 mg), and composi - tion of the lozenge have been identified as possible ex - planations why study results are inconsistent.79,85 Intranasal zinc preparations are often sold as over-the-counter cold remedies. However, studies have not shown this route of administration to be as effec - tive as lozenges. T wo placebo-controlled trials found in - tranasal zinc gluconate slightly reduced the duration of cold symptoms.86,87 In one study, 78 adults took 2.1 mg zinc daily (one spray in each nostril four times daily) or placebo for 10 days from cold onset. Mean duration of cold was 4.3 days in the zinc group versus six days in the placebo group (p=0.002).86 Similarly, another study ob - served 213 adults taking either 2.1 mg zinc (one spray in each nostril every four hours) or placebo from cold onset until symptoms resolved. Duration of cold was 2.3 days in the zinc group versus nine days in the pla - cebo group (p<0.05).87These findings contrast with two other placebo- controlled studies that found no benefit from zinc nasal spray.88,89 One study followed 91 individuals with in - duced colds using either zinc gluconate nasal spray (one spray in each nostril five times daily) or placebo for three days before the challenge and six days after.88 The sec - ond study involved 160 adult participants taking 0.044 mg zinc (zinc sulfate nasal spray) or placebo daily from cold onset until symptoms resolved or up to 14 days.89 In both cases, the respective researchers concluded that changes in cold duration or symptom severity were no different between the zinc and placebo groups. T able 6 summarizes the studies of zinc nasal spray. In an interesting footnote, several cases report individuals experiencing loss of the sense of smell (an - osmia) after using intranasal zinc as a cold remedy.90 Zinc at doses of 30 mg and above can cause stomach upset, nausea, and/or vomiting, which can be reduced when taken with food. Prolonged excessive zinc intake can result in copper deficiency, as documented in a case of zinc gluconate supplementation at 850-1,000 mg per day for one year. Signs and symptoms included fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, anemia, neutropenia, pal - lor, and orthostatic pulse changes.91 Vitamin A Clinical trials examining vitamin A to boost immunity and treat respiratory infections have yielded conflicting results. The majority of studies have been conducted in children malnourished, underweight, and/or deficient in vitamin A. No consistent benefit has been observed in healthy children or adults with viral- induced respiratory infection.92,93 One study analyzed the effect of 50,000-100,000 IU vitamin A given as a single dose to children under age five years with pneu - monia, a potential cold/flu complication. No significant differences were reported between the treatment and placebo groups with respect to duration of respiratory symptoms.94 N-acetylcysteine N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an ester of the amino acid L-cysteine, is a potent antioxidant.95 It has been used for over 30 years to treat bronchitis and other lung conditions due to its expectorant and mucolytic properties.96,97 In a 1988 randomized controlled trial, Copyright \u00a9 2007 Thorne Research, Inc.

Over the four winter months, subjects in the NAC group expe - rienced a 65-percent reduction in sick leave days from bronchitis exacerbation (173 days versus 456 days in the placebo group), indicating less severe infection in the NAC group.98 A larger trial involving 262 elderly subjects investigated the effect of oral NAC prophylaxis on the occurrence and severity of influenza-like episodes and influenza A infection during the cold and flu sea - son. Subjects received 600-mg NAC tablets or placebo twice daily for six months. Over the six-month period, the number of subjects with influenza-like episodes in the NAC group averaged 29 percent, compared to 51 percent in the placebo group. In regard to severity of influenza-like episodes, 72 percent of those in the NAC group who became ill reported mild episodes, 26 percent reported moderate episodes, and two percent reported severe episodes. In the placebo group 48 percent re - ported mild episodes, 47 percent moderate episodes, and six percent severe episodes, indicating that a greater percent of the placebo group experienced a severe infec - tion. Of the 262 subjects in the study, 65 became in - fected with influenza A virus. Although infection rates between placebo and NAC groups were similar, only 25 percent of the NAC group who became infected with influenza A was symptomatic compared to 79 percent in the placebo group.99 Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) Influenza is particularly dangerous to older people with weakened immune systems. Age-associ - ated DHEA deficiency may be partially responsible for an age-related decline in immune function.100,101 One study demonstrated a metabolite of DHEA enhanced T able 6.

High Lactoferrin Whey Protein Whey protein supplementation appears to en - scavenge radicals,107 and al, antimycotic, and immune-modulating have shown protein110 that is present in exocrine nasal exudates, saliva, and bronchial mucus.111 Lactoferrin is also a major constituent of circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs)112 and is re - leased on degranulation in septic areas.113 T o date, no clinical trials have been conducted on the use of high lactoferrin whey protein to prevent or treat colds or flu, but because of its demonstrated antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory proper - ties, it may be of benefit in alleviating the symptoms or complications of these viral infections. The primary function of lactoferrin is to scavenge free iron in fluids and inflamed areas,114 suppressing free radical-mediated damage and decreasing the availability of the metal to invade microbial and neoplastic cells. Lactoferrin has also been shown to bind to viral receptor sites and in - hibit in vitro growth of several viruses, including HIV , Herpes simplex 1 and 2, hepatitis C, and human cyto - megalovirus.112 Botanicals for the Prevention and Treatment of and Flu Echinacea ( Echinacea spp ) iden - tified for generations by traditional herbalists as in - valuable medicinal plants.115,116 Although traditional herbalists used Echinacea for various conditions, from alopecia to cancer, its modern application is primarily for immune support. T oday, Echinacea is arguably the most recognized herbal supplement for prevention and treatment of colds and flu. Despite this long history in traditional herbal medicine, or perhaps because of it, Echinacea has come under much scientific scrutiny to determine its effectiveness for colds and flu. Different species of Echinacea demonstrate immuno-supportive properties. Both Echinacea pur - purea and Echinacea angustifolia appear to activate non- specific cellular and humoral immunity and the comple - ment system.117-121 Polysaccharides from E. purpurea have been shown in vitro to preferentially stimulate the mononuclear immune system and release of interleu - kin-1 (IL-1).117 Similarly, in vitro studies on arabinoga - lactans from E. purpurea have been observed to induce a dose-dependent release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) from peritoneal macrophages.117 In another study, glycoproteins known as arabinogalactan-proteins isolated from E. pallida demonstrated marked immuno- modulatory effects by stimulating IgM production and proliferation of lymphocytes in mice.122 A randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial observed 48 adult female participants over a period of four weeks to determine the immuno - logical activity of various Echinacea preparations and larch arabinogalactan versus placebo.123 Of the various preparations used in the study, complement properdin (a protein in serum used as a marker for assessing im - mune response) increased by 21 percent over placebo in participants taking a combination extract of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia and by 18 percent in subjects taking a combination of E. purpurea , E. angustifolia , and larch arabinogalactan. The other forms did not provoke a sig - nificant response. Clinical studies have shown mixed results re - garding Echinacea's effect on reduction and duration of symptoms associated with common cold, influenza, and other acute respiratory infections.

Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1 2007 Colds and Influenza Page 40adults examined the effect of an Echinacea formulation (0.25 mg/mL alkamides, 2.5 mg/mL chicoric acid, and 25 mg/mL polysaccharides=1 unit) or placebo for sev - en days from cold onset. The dosage was 10 units on the first day of cold symptoms, followed by four units per day for the next seven days. T otal daily symptom sever - ity scores, recorded on a 10-point scale (0=minimum; 9=maximum), were 23.1-percent lower in the Echina - cea group compared to placebo (p<0.01).124 In a related placebo-controlled trial on 150 adults using the same Echinacea formula (dosage=eight 5-mL units on the first day and three units daily on subse - quent days for the next seven days), researchers observed decreased daily symptom scores and increases in the num - ber of total white blood cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells in the Echinacea group versus placebo.125 In another placebo-controlled, blinded study assessing changes in cold duration, 80 adult participants were randomly assigned to take E. purpurea herb extract or placebo at the onset of cold symptoms until symp - toms subsided. The median duration of illness was six days in the Echinacea group compared to nine days in the placebo group (p=0.0112).126 Conversely, some studies have reported no sta - tistically significant improvement from Echinacea for the common cold.127-130 For example, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 148 college stu - dents were given an encapsulated mixture of unrefined E. purpurea herb (25%) and root and E. angus - tifolia root (50%) or placebo; 1 g doses were taken six times on the first day of a cold and three times daily on each subsequent day for a maximum of 10 days. There were no significant differences in severity or duration of symptoms between the Echinacea and placebo groups.131 In another placebo-controlled trial, 128 adults were ad - ministered 100 mg E. purpurea or placebo three times daily until cold symptoms were relieved, up to a maxi - mum of 14 days, with no statistical difference observed between the two groups.130 There is a clear controversy within the estab - lished scientific community regarding the efficacy of Echinacea. Differences in study results might be associ - ated with the preparation used in a given study ( E. pur - purea , E. angustifolia , or E. pallida , or a combination), the part of the plant used, and the method of extraction. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence to warrant fur - ther investigation of Echinacea Caprifolia - ceae or honeysuckle family. Extracts of the berries are used primarily as antiviral agents for colds, influenza, and Herpes virus infections. Research demonstrates Sambucus nigra possesses immune-modulating and an - tioxidant properties.132,133 Constituents the berries include the flavonoids quercetin anthocya vitamins A and C.133 The antiviral properties of elderberry were first studied by Mumcuoglu, an Israeli virologist, who demonstrated elderberry constituents neutralize the activity of the hemagglutinin spikes found on the sur - face of several viruses, including influenza A and B and the Herpes virus. When these hemagglutinin spikes are deactivated, the viruses can no longer pierce cell walls or enter the cell and replicate.138 Elderberry extracts also exert an immune-modulating effect by enhanced cytokine production, which activates movement possess significant antioxi - dant potential.140 Although no clinical trials have been conducted, the German Commission E reports that constituents of Sambucus provide effective relief for colds, fevers, and catarrh.141 Anecdotal reports indicate elderberry extracts can shorten the duration or lessen the severity of the common cold, particularly when used in combination with vitamin C and zinc. T wo randomized, double-blind, placebo-con - trolled studies demonstrate the elderberry extract, Sambucol, effectively inhibits both influenza A and B strains when given orally to patients in the first 48 hours of influenza symptoms. In one study, 27 individuals (23 with laboratory confirmation of influenza B) experienc - ing typical early flu symptoms were given Sambucol (n=15) or placebo (n=12) daily for three days - two ta - blespoons (30 mL) for children or four tablespoons (60 mL) for adults - and symptoms were monitored for six days. Serum from all subjects was analyzed for antibod - ies to influenza A and B at the initial dose and during the convalescent phase.

Clinically however, significant improvement in flu symptoms was observed in 14 of 15 subjects in the treatment group two days after initial dosing, with complete symptom resolution in 13 of 15 subjects af - ter three days. In the placebo group, complete symptom resolution was only achieved by 4 of 12 subjects within three days and 5 of 12 subjects after five days.142 In a second study, 60 patients (ages 18-54 years) experiencing early influenza symptoms were given 15 mL (1 tablespoon) Sambucol or placebo syrup four times daily for five days; symptoms were monitored for eight days. In the treatment group, the majority of patients reported \"pronounced improvement\" after an average of 3-4 days, while the placebo group required 7-8 days to reach the same level of improvement.143 Garlic ( Allium sativa ) Although clinical research examining garlic's effect on colds and flu is minimal, one study did evalu - ate an allicin-containing garlic supplement on cold inci - dence and duration in 146 volunteers. Subjects received one capsule daily for 12 weeks between November and February, and symptoms were assessed via a symptom diary using a five-point scale. In the garlic-supplemented group, 24 colds were reported compared to 65 in the placebo group; the treatment group experience shorter duration of cold symptoms compared to placebo - 1.5 versus 5.0 days, respectively.144 Panax quinquefolium Panax quinquefolium (North American ginseng) has been shown in controlled trials to reduce the incidence, duration, and severity of colds and flu in both ill and healthy individuals. A four-month study that commenced at the beginning of cold and flu season evaluated 323 healthy adults (ages 18-65 years) with a history of at least two colds the previous year. Those in the treatment group received two 200-mg capsules daily of a standardized extract of P . quinquefolium containing 80-percent poly-furanosyl-pyranosyl-saccharides, while the placebo group received 200 mg rice powder (encap - sulated) twice daily. Outcomes measured were number of colds, symptom severity, and total number of symp - tomatic days. In patients taking the ginseng extract the mean number of reported colds was reduced by 9.2 percent, and the risk of developing a cold was reduced by 12.8 percent compared to the placebo group. In ad - dition, the ginseng group reported a 31-percent lower symptom score (severity) and 34.5-percent fewer symp - tom days (duration) than the placebo group.145 In a second study using a proprietary extract containing highly concentrated poly-furanosyl-pyrano - syl-saccharides, 43 community-dwelling elderly adults were given 200-mg capsules of the extract or placebo twice daily for four months. One month into the study, all participants received an influenza vaccination. Dur - ing the first two months, incidence and duration of re - spiratory infections did not differ significantly between the two groups. During the last two months, however, 32 percent of subjects taking the herbal formula report - ed an upper respiratory tract infection compared to 62 percent in the placebo group. In addition, the treatment group reported average symptom duration of 5.6 days compared to 12.6 days in the placebo group.146 A Combination of Eleutherococcus senticosus and of paniculata was found effective for influ - enza infections. The combination formula, also known as Kan Jang\u00ae, was studied in a pilot trial involving 540 adults with influenza. Subjects (n=71) were given two tablets containing standardized extracts of Androgra - phis (88.8 mg) and Eleutherococcus (10.0 mg) three times daily for 3-5 days, while individuals using con - ventional antiviral medications (n=469) - amantadine or other physician-preferred medication - served as the control group. Primary outcome measures were severity of disease (measured by development of complications) and disease duration (measured by number of days on sick leave). In the herbal formula group, 30.1 percent progressed to complicated influenza compared to 67.8 percent in the control group. Likewise, those in the herbal group experienced a shorter duration of symp - toms (approximately 6-7 days) compared to 9-10 days in the control group.147 A second phase of the trial, involving 66 influ - enza patients (n=31 herbal treatment; n=35 controls [conventional treatment]) using the same protocol, re - vealed comparable results. Days on sick leave were sig - nificantly fewer in the herbal group (7.2 days) than in Copyright \u00a9 2007 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved. No Reprint Without Written Permission. Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1, March 2007. Alternative Medicine Review Volume 12, Number 1 2007 Colds and Influenza Page 42the control group (9.2 days). In addition, 31.4 percent of patients in the herbal-treatment group developed post-influenza complications, while that rate more than doubled to 71.0 percent in the control group. These studies appear to indicate Kan Jang extract is an effec - tive herbal therapy that may be superior to conventional antiviral medications for reducing severity and duration of influenza infections.147 Larch Arabinogalactans Larch arabinogalactans, Larix occidentalis (W estern larch), stimulate the immune system by activating phagocytosis and potentiating the effect of the reticu - loendothelial system. Because of these properties, larch arabinogalactans may be an effective adjunct for the treatment of colds and flu.148,149 Recurrent otitis media is common in pediatric populations and a frequent complication of colds. Im - proving immune system function might lead to a de - crease in both frequency and severity of this common complication. Research has demonstrated larch and other arabinogalactans enhance the immune response to bacterial infection via stimulation of phagocytosis, competitive binding of bacterial fimbriae, or bacterial opsonization. D' Adamo reports a decrease in occur - rence and severity of otitis media in pediatric with larch tan.148 Larch arabinogalactan's mild taste and excellent solubility in water and juice make it a relatively easy therapeutic tool to employ in pediatric populations.148 Olive Leaf Extract Constituents of the olive tree, Olea europaea , have been studied and utilized in folk medicine for centuries. Olive leaf extract, derived from the leaves of the olive tree, contains phenolic compounds, specifi - cally oleuropein, that have demonstrated potent anti - microbial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activity. Oleuropein and derivatives such as elenolic acid have been shown to be effective in in vitro and animal studies against numerous microorganisms, including retrovi - ruses, coxsackie viruses,150 influenza, and parainfluenza 3,150,151 as well as some bacteria.152 Research suggests that olive leaf constituents interact with the protein of virus particles and reduce the infectivity and inhibit rep - lication of viruses known to cause colds, influenza, and lower respiratory infection.150,151,153 Olive leaf extract has also been shown to stimulate phagocytosis, thereby enhancing the immune response to viral infection. An - ecdotal reports indicate olive leaf extract taken at the onset of cold or flu symptoms prevents or shortens the duration of the disease. For viral sore throats, gargling with olive leaf tea may alleviate symptoms, possibly by decreasing inflammation and viral infectivity. Astragalus ( Astragalus membranaceus ) Astragalus membranaceus has traditionally been used as a tonic and treatment for colds and flu, either alone or in conjunction with other herbs.154 Astraga - lus is rich in polysaccharides, flavonoids, multiple trace minerals, and amino acids, all of which contribute to its immuno-supportive properties. Animal studies demon - strated oral administration of Astragalus root extract to mice infected with Japanese encephalitis virus increased survival rates by 30-40 percent compared to 20 percent in the untreated control group.155 The researchers attri - bute this to increased phagocytic activity. In a small, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial participants took oral extracts of , Astragalus membranaceus , or Glycyrrhiza glabra singly, a combination of the three herbs, or placebo twice daily for seven days, to determine whether intake of the herbal tinctures (singly and/or in combination) stimulated activation and/or proliferation of immune cells. Of the herbs tested, Astragalus demonstrated the strongest activation and proliferation of immune cells, particularly CD8 and CD4 T-cells, compared to place - bo. Furthermore, the combination herbal formula dem - onstrated an additive effect regarding activation, but not proliferation, of T-cells.156 Baptisia ( Baptisia tinctoria randomized, double-blind, placebo-con - trolled trial of 238 subjects with acute cold symptoms demonstrated that a formula of Baptisia tinctoria root (30 mg), Echinacea purpurea root (22.5 mg), and Thuja occidentalis leaf (6 mg) three times daily for 7-9 days significantly reduced intensity and duration of symp - toms compared to placebo. In subjects who suffered from moderate-symptom intensity at baseline, at least 50-percent improvement by day 5 was experienced in Copyright \u00a9 2007 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The common cold, although relatively mild in symptomolo - gy and severity, accounts for a significant number of lost work or school days. Influenza, although considered a preventable disease, accounts for 36,000 deaths annu - ally in the United States. Although vaccinations and an - tiviral drugs can be helpful in prevention and treatment of influenza, their scope and effectiveness are limited. Consequently, most conventional interventions for colds and flu involve symptomatic relief with over-the-coun - ter medications. Natural therapeutics in the form of nu - tritional supplementation and immune-stimulating and antiviral botanicals can support the body's natural de - fenses, potentially decreasing the incidence of colds and flu, shortening the duration and decreasing the intensity of symptoms, and preventing complications.References 1.
