Indian Pediatrics, 42(7), 653-63. - Urban poor, many residing in slums, comprise about a quarter of India's urban population. Immunization coverage among urban poor children is a dismal 43%. This paper attempts to understand the current scenario and challenges in improving immunization coverage in urban slums in India. It also discusses possible mechanisms for effectively reaching the often left-out urban poor. Coordinated activities by the multitude of providers, accurate information based outreach, effective monitoring and community enablement to demand quality services are critical for improving utilization of immunization services by a heterogeneous urban poor population. - Andrus JK, de Quadros CA, Sol\u00f3rzano CC, et al.

Vaccine, 29(S4), D91-96. - The challenge for regions embarking on measles elimination will be to maintain high population immunity with excellent vaccination coverage and high-quality surveillance. Meeting this challenge will be especially critical for dealing with importations of measles virus that will occur as long as the virus is circulating anywhere in the world. Implementation of measles elimination strategies will uncover the hidden disease burden of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome. As was the experience in countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), integrating the elimination of measles with the elimination of rubella will greatly enhance the capacity of countries to sustain progress in the reduction of measles mortality. Countries of LAC prioritized the routine national immunization program over short-term successes. While doing so, they have also encountered new opportunities to expand the benefits of disease control and elimination activities to other aspects of public health, most importantly towards improving health care for women and newborns and reducing inequities in health in the region's poorest communities. Implementation of similar strategies could lead to the global eradication of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome early this century, while strengthening routine immunization programs, and developing the capacity to introduce new and underutilized vaccines. - Assi TM, Brown ST, Kone S, et al. (2013). [Removing the regional level from the Niger vaccine supply chain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23602666). Vaccine, 31(26), 2828-34. - These authors created a detailed simulation model of Niger's vaccine supply chain and compared the current four-tier structure with a modified three-tier structure to investigate if removing a level could improve efficiency. They conclude that removing the regional level from Niger's vaccine supply chain could substantially improve vaccine availability as long as certain adjustments to shipping policies and frequencies are implemented. - Burton A, Monasch R, Lautenbach B, et al.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 56(13), 304-07. - From 2000-01, South Korea experienced a measles epidemic that affected tens of thousands of children. In response, in 2001, South Korea announced a 5-year National Measles Elimination Plan. This report describes the activities and summarizes the results of that plan, which enabled South Korea to announce in late 2006 that interruption of indigenous measles transmission had been achieved, making South Korea the first country in the World Health Organization's Western Pacific Region declare measles eliminated. - Dabbagh A, Patel MK, Dumolard L, et al.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. 66(42), 1148. - This report updates a previous report (Patel et al., 2016) and describes progress toward global measles control milestones and regional measles elimination goals during 2000-2016. During this period, annual reported measles incidence decreased 87%, from 145 to 19 cases per million persons, and annual estimated measles deaths decreased 84%, from 550,100 to 89,780. Measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.4 million deaths. However, the 2015 milestones have not yet been met and only one WHO region has been verified as having eliminated measles. Improved implementation of elimination strategies by countries and their partners is needed, with focus on increasing vaccination coverage through substantial and sustained additional investments in health systems, strengthening surveillance systems, using surveillance data to drive programmatic actions, securing political commitment, and raising the visibility of measles elimination goals. - Datta SS, O'Connor PM, Jankovic D, et al.

Vaccine, 36(36), 5408-15. - Despite the availability of safe and cost-effective vaccines to prevent it, measles remains a significant cause of death among children under five years of age globally. The World Health Organization European Region has witnessed a drastic decline in measles and rubella cases in recent years. However, programmatic challenges exist in disease surveillance, vaccination service delivery and communication in endemic countries and should be addressed through periodic evaluation of the strategies by all stakeholders and exploring additional opportunities to accelerate the ongoing elimination activities. - Duclos P, Okwo-Bele JM, Gacic-Dobo M, et [future](https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-698X-9-S1-S2). BMC International Health and Human Rights, 9(S1), 2-13. - Vaccines have made a major contribution to public health, including the eradication of one deadly disease, smallpox, and the near eradication of another, poliomyelitis. Through the introduction of new vaccines, such as those against rotavirus and pneumococcal diseases, and with further improvements in coverage, vaccination can significantly contribute to the achievement of the health-related United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS) was developed by WHO and UNICEF as a framework for strengthening national immunization programmes and protect as many people as possible against more diseases by expanding the reach of immunization, including new vaccines, to every eligible person. This paper briefly reviews global progress and challenges with respect to public vaccination programmes. - Durrheim DN, Crowcroft NS, Strebel PM. (2014). [Measles - The epidemiology of elimination](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25444814). Vaccine, 32(51), 6880-83. - The Global Vaccine Action Plan has targeted measles elimination in at least five of the six World Health Organisation Regions by 2020. This is an ambitious goal, as measles control requires the highest immunization coverage of any vaccine-preventable disease. Importations can also result in local transmission and outbreaks in areas that have interrupted local endemic measles circulation. One of the lines of evidence that countries and Regions must address to confirm measles elimination is a detailed description of measles epidemiology over an extended period. This information is incredibly valuable as predictable epidemiological patterns emerge as measles elimination is approached and achieved. These patterns are discussed with illustrative examples from the Region of the Americas, which eliminated measles in 2002, and the Western Pacific Region, which has established a Regional Verification Commission to review progress towards elimination in all member countries. - Hinman AR, Hutchins SS, et al.

Journal of Infectious Diseases,189(S1), 146-52. - The gap in measles vaccine coverage between white and nonwhite children was as large as 18% in 1970. During the measles epidemic of 1989-1991, attack rates among nonwhite children <5 years of age were 4-7 fold higher than rates among white children. Because of the epidemic and of the known disparity in vaccine coverage and risk of disease, a dual strategy to eliminate measles in the United States was implemented: universal interventions likely to reach the majority of children and targeted interventions more likely to reach nonwhite children. By 1992, the gap in coverage between white and nonwhite children was reduced to 6% and the risk of disease among nonwhite children was narrowed. During the 1990s, further implementation of the dual strategy resulted in narrowing the gap in vaccine coverage to 2% and elimination of endemic disease in all racial and ethnic populations. This dual strategy deserves close scrutiny by health professionals and policy makers in devising programs to meet future health objectives. - Hinman AR, Orenstein WA, Papania MJ. (2004). [Evolution of Measles Elimination Strategies in the United States](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15106084).

[Reducing routine vaccination dropout rates: evaluating two interventions in three Kenyan districts, 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4754928/). BMC Public Health, 16, 152. - Globally, vaccine-preventable diseases are responsible for nearly 20% of deaths annually among children younger than 5 years old. Worldwide, many children drop out from vaccination programs, are vaccinated late, or incompletely vaccinated. Here, Haji and colleagues evaluated the impact of text messaging and sticker reminders to reduce dropouts from the vaccination program. They found that text message reminders reduced vaccination dropout rates in Kenya and recommend the extended implementation of text message reminders in routine vaccination services. - Humpreys G.

Journal of Infectious Diseases, 204(S1), 312-17. - Despite enormous challenges, Somalia has been successfully implementing accelerated measles control activities. Through innovative strategies and with the support of local and international partners, the country has shown potentials of implementing measles mortality reduction activities in complex emergencies. However, the near collapse of the health care system and the ongoing insecurity continue to hamper the implementation of recommended measles control and elimination strategies in some parts of the country, making these achievements fragile. - Kartoglu U, Milstien J.

Expert Review of Vaccines, 13(7), 843-54. - Cold chains have been developed for the transport and storage of heat liable vaccines and established in all countries, despite limited access to resources and electricity in the poorest areas. However, cold chain issues occur in all countries. Recent changes to vaccines and vaccine handling include the development and introduction of new vaccines with a wide range of characteristics, improvement of heat stability of several basic vaccines, observation of vaccine freezing as a real threat, development of regulatory pathways for both vaccine development and the supply chain, and emergence of new temperature monitoring devices that can pinpoint and avoid problems. With such tools, public health groups have now encouraged the development of vaccines labeled for use in flexible cold chains and these tools should be considered for future systems. - Kaufmann JR, Miller R, Cheyne J. (2011). [Vaccine Supply Chains Need To Be Better Funded And Strengthened, Or Lives Will Be At Risk](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0368). Health Affairs, 30(6), 1113-21. - In the next decade, at least twelve additional vaccines that target such diseases as typhoid, malaria, and dengue will become available to lower- and middle-income countries. These vaccines must travel along what are called supply chains, which include all personnel, systems, equipment, and activities involved in ensuring that vaccines are effectively delivered from the point of production to the people who need them. But for various reasons, supply chains are already strained in many developing countries, and the potential inability to distribute new vaccines will place lives at risk. Among the many steps needed to strengthen the global vaccine supply chain, we suggest that the international community pursue improved coordination between organizations that donate and ship vaccines and the host-country officials who receive and distribute the vaccines, as well as better training for supply-chain managers. - Kieny MP, Costa A, Hombach J, et al.

Vaccine, 24(40-41), 6367-70. - In case of an influenza pandemic, the world will be in a situation where potential vaccine supply will fall short by several billion doses from global needs. In 2006, the World Health Organization convened a consultation of stakeholders in influenza vaccines and immunization to identify practical solutions to fill this gap. The consultation resulted in a global action plan outlining promising specific strategies to increase influenza vaccine production and surge-capacity before and during an influenza pandemic. - Kumru OS, Joshi SB, Smith DE, et al.

[Vaccine instability in Biologicals, 42(5), 237-59. - Instability of vaccines often emerges as a key challenge during clinical development (lab to clinic) as well as commercial distribution (factory to patient). To yield stable, efficacious vaccine dosage forms for human use, successful formulation strategies must address a combination of interrelated topics including stabilization of antigens, selection of appropriate adjuvants, and development of stability-indicating analytical methods. This review covers key concepts in understanding the causes and mechanisms of vaccine instability. Several illustrative case studies are described regarding mechanisms of vaccine instability along with formulation approaches for stabilization within the vaccine cold chain. - Ma C, An Z, Hao L, et al.

[The immunization system in the United States \u2014 The role of school immunization laws](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10559531). Vaccine. 17(S3), 19-24. - School immunization laws have had a remarkable impact on vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States, particularly in school-aged populations. Enforcement of laws through the exclusion of unvaccinated children from school is a critical factor in assuring success. All laws have exemptions for medical contraindications, 47 states have exemptions for persons with strong religious beliefs against vaccination and 15 states have exemptions for persons philosophically opposed to vaccination. Although school immunization laws establish a safety net to assure high levels of coverage, they cannot replace efforts to assure age-appropriate immunization in the first two years of life. - Orenstein WA, Cairns L, Hinman A, et al.

During this time, an estimated 20.3 million deaths were prevented by measles vaccination, and measles incidence decreased 75%, from 146 to 36 cases per 1 million population. The number of countries providing the second dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) nationally through routine immunization services increased to 160 (82%) in 2015, and global MCV2 coverage was 61%. In 2015, a total of 184 million persons were vaccinated against measles during supplementary immunization activities. Although measles vaccination has saved millions of lives since 2000, data indicate that the progress toward elimination goals has slowed since 2010. - PATH, World Health Organization. (2011). [An Assessment of Vaccine Supply Chain and Logistics Systems in Thailand](https://www.path.org/publications/files/TS_opt_vac_sup_thai.pdf). Seattle: PATH. - Improper storage and transportation can put vaccine products at risk of degradation. Therefore, an effective vaccine supply chain and logistics system is essential to ensure product quality. In 2009, the government of Thailand launched a pilot project to outsource vaccine supply management and distribution to the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO), which in turn introduced and managed a vendor-managed inventory system (VMI) and subcontracted with a private logistics company to distribute vaccine products. The system gradually expanded nationwide by late 2010. Given the lack of empirical evidence to support the benefits of VMI or the benefits of outsourcing vaccine distribution to the GPO, this report sought to better understand the vaccine supply chain system in Thailand and the challenges of implementing the VMI system. - Peltola H, Heinonen OP, Valle M, et al.

Storage capacity bottlenecks occur at national, regional, and district levels and system inefficiencies threaten vaccine access, availability, and quality. As countries adopt newer and more expensive vaccines and attempt to reach people at different ages and in new settings, their logistics systems must be strengthened and optimized. - Zell ER, Ezzati-Rice TM, Battaglia, MP, et al. (2000). [National Immunization Survey: the methodology of a vaccination surveillance system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1308558/). Public Health Reports, 115(1), 65-77. - The National Immunization Survey (NIS) was designed to measure vaccination coverage estimates for the US, the 50 states, and selected urban areas for children ages 19-35 months. The NIS includes a random-digit-dialed telephone survey and a provider record check study. Data are weighted to account for the sample design and to reduce nonresponse and non-coverage biases in order to improve vaccination coverage estimates. Adjustments are made for biases resulting from nonresponse and non-telephone households, and estimation procedures are used to reduce measurement bias. The NIS coverage estimates represent all US children, not just children living in households with telephones. NIS estimates are highly comparable to vaccination estimates derived from the National Health Interview Survey. The NIS allows comparisons between states and urban areas over time and is used to evaluate current and new vaccination strategies. - Zheng X, Zhang N, Zhang X, et al. (2015). [Investigation of a Measles Outbreak in China to Identify Gaps in Vaccination Coverage, Routes of Transmission, and Interventions](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133983). PLoS ONE, 10(7), e0133983. - A measles outbreak occurred in a western county of China in 2013, the year after China's historic nadir of measles. This study report on a field investigation to identify gaps in measles vaccination coverage and immunization program weaknesses, and to provide recommendations for measles outbreak response and immunization program improvement.
