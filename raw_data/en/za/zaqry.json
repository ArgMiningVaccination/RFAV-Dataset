Catalog Description Introduction to Traditional Mongolian Medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, massage, and cupping integrated with western medical practices. Students will interact with Mongolian Nomads, a Kazakh community, Reindeer Herders and Shamans. Community, family and individual health care will be observed in urban and rural settings. Course Description \"Traditional Mongolian Medicine has a history of more than 5000 years\"1 Traditional Mongolian Medicine (TMM), was developed from Mongolian folk medicine, was influenced by the Mongolians' lifestyle as nomads and herdsmen, their culture, by the harsh climate conditions, Ayurveda and Traditional Tibetan Medicine. Knowledge was passed from the elders through educational systems established in the 16th century. In 1921, the first hospital to combine Traditional and Western medicine was established in Mongolia.1 Traditional Mongolian Medicine was forbidden by the Soviet Union from the late 1920's to 1990, when it experienced a revival after perestroika. The current Mongolian government considers Traditional Mongolian Medicine to be an important component of a comprehensive, medical service integrated with western medical practice. Students will attend lectures and have an opportunity to learn from healers, doctors and nurses of Traditional Mongolian Medicine. Didactic content includes an introduction to Traditional Mongolian Medicine; examination of historical, environmental, social, and political forces that impact the health of Mongolians. Study includes lectures and labs at the Institute of Traditional Mongolian Medicine in the capital city, Ulaabaatar.

Treatments student can choose to experience include acupuncture, cupping, moxibustion, massage, water therapy & balneo therapy. Students will experience plant harvesting, medicine preparation, and Shaman healing ceremonies. Mongolia is a land-locked country with a population of three million, 54.3% of whom reside in rural areas. On average, fewer than two people occupy each square kilometer. Although the distributions of health care resources per population are adequate for the population size, there is a striking difference in terms of the distributions per geographical area. Students will visit Terelj National Park to interact and study the specific health care needs and health services of the Mongolian Nomads; travel to Lake Khuvsgul to interact and study the specific health care needs and health services of the Tsaatan, ethnic reindeer herders of the north and their use of Shamanism; and visit a Kazakh community who hunt with trained Golden Eagles to interact and study their specific health care needs and health services Community, family and individual health and health care will be observed in urban and rural settings. By discovering the ideologies, policies, and practices of culture and health care in a cross-cultural context, students will explore optimal health care practices for themselves. Students will complete a health self-assessment, develop and implement a self-care plan to augment our daily faculty led practice of Yoga, Mindfulness and Energy Balancing.
