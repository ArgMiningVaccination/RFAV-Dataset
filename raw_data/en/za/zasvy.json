Background: Smoking is the most common etiology for lung cancer. Smoking cessation, even when successful, does not eliminate risk of lung cancer. With inconsistent results of lung chemoprevention trials, an emerging area of interest is immunoprevention, in particular vaccines. MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein aberrantly overexpressed in adenocarcinomas, including lung cancer. Abnormal MUC1 expression is also characteristic of premalignant lesions, including bronchial dysplasia and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. This suggests that immunization with a MUC1 vaccine in the premalignant or high-risk setting, before the tumor and cytotoxic therapy could suppress the immune system, might be effective in inducing strong immunity and reducing cancer risk.Trial design: Leveraging the infrastructure of the NCI-funded Cancer Prevention Network (CPN) consortium, we are conducting a two-center pilot trial to evaluate co-primary endpoints: immunogenicity of the MUC1 peptide plus polyICLC adjuvant vaccine (assessed at 12 weeks) and safety (assessed at up to 24 weeks) in current and former smokers who are at high risk for lung cancer. 50 participants will be screened in order to have 40 evaluable participants for baseline and 12-week immunogenicity assessments.Eligibility: Smoking history of 30 pack-years and either current smoker (still smoking or quit < 1 year prior to pre-registration) or former smoker (quit 1-15 years prior to pre-registration); ages 55-80 years; ECOG performance status 1; CT scan of the chest done  6 months prior to pre-registration showing either negative findings (no nodules) or solid or part-solid nodules < 6 mm in size (consistent with < 1% probability of malignancy, Lung-RADs Version 1.0). Exclusion criteria are standard.Immunogenicity and safety: MUC1 peptide plus polyICLC adjuvant vaccine will be administered at week 0, 2 and 10. The primary endpoint is anti-MUC1 IgG titer that is 2 fold higher at week 12 compared to baseline. Based on previous studies of this vaccine, we expect that 40 evaluable participants will provide 96% power to detect immunogenicity response rate of 15% versus 40% using a 2-sided test of proportions with type I error rate of 0.05. AEs and toxicities will be monitored for up to 24 weeks from the first vaccine.Secondary Objectives: We will explore differences, if any, in vaccine immunogenicity in current vs. former smokers. Smoking induces chronic inflammation (hallmark of cancer) associated with immunosuppression. We will evaluate pre-vaccination levels of circulating myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and correlate with the response to the vaccine. We will explore the impact, if any, of this vaccine on the markers of inflammation (hsCRP, IL-6) and the effect of baseline levels of these markers on the ability to successfully vaccinate. We will also assess the relationship between COPD status and immune response in current versus former smokers.The trial is open to accrual.Citation Format: Olivera J.
