Today I am very excited to have Dr. Taylor Bean from TaylorMade Wellness, here to chat with us all about vaccines. So welcome Dr. Taylor. Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure to be here. I'm so excited that you're willing to chat with me about this, vaccines is a bit of a touchy topic. And I really connected with you right away with your message on social media and your openness to have a conversation. Because I feel like so much with vaccines, it's very much different sides, right versus wrong, no matter what side you happen to lay on. And it's really stifling for conversation. And it's really difficult for people that are curious to feel comfortable asking questions and having that conversation. So I really appreciate that about what I connected with on social media about your stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's pretty much why I'm doing this, is the biggest part is the inability to have a conversation. And sort of the black and white nature of the conversation has made me even more curious, partially why one can't have a conversation. And when you don't have a conversation, what comes out of that? And what can happen with that? And so why I enjoy being in the arena of vaccines. Absolutely. And just for clarification for those tuning in and listening. This is a general overall kids vaccination conversation, and we will dig into COVID vaccines specifically in one part, as well as optimization for vaccines and immune system. So I just wanted to be very upfront about that for those tuning in. So let's dig into it. Who are you? What do you do and why are you so passionate about it? So I'm a naturopathic doctor, licensed naturopathic doctor here in British Columbia, in Salmon Arm. My journey working with vaccines started when I was living and working overseas in Singapore. And at that point, I was a new grad and a brand new mom. So I was having more moms come in talking to me about vaccines, query and having questions. And I had two situations of two different parents come in that had some pretty detailed questions around vaccines that they could not find the answers about anywhere else in Singapore. And I as a new grad, well thought I had all the answers, which you don't, but you think you do. And I was embarrassed that I didn't have the answers which they were looking for. So that started my journey. In Singapore, there's mandated vaccines. So it wasn't about not being vaccinated, but they wanted to explore and had these questions. And I thought, as a naturopathic doctor who looks outside the box, would have these answers, and I didn't have the answer. So that started and then we moved from Singapore back to Canada six years ago. And as a naturopathic doctor in British Columbia, we can administer vaccines as part of our scope. So I got that certification, and can administer vaccines in my office from age five and over, same as pharmacists. So with that came, education with conversation. When I offer and market the fact that I am an ND that can administer vaccines, I share in a way that, you know, I'm open to having a conversation, we will have a dialogue when you come in, then more and more people, of course, are coming in for a vaccine consultation to have a discussion. And what happens over and over and over again within those conversations has been their experience when they've asked their other health care providers around vaccines and the treatment that which they received from those individuals led them basically to not vaccinate because their practitioner would either not answer the question or would gaslight them and shame them as a result of the question. So you don't exactly want to return back to that person to have any more conversations around vaccines knowing you're going to be treated that way. So what happens is you don't, a lot of people just don't as a result of that treatment. So when we talk about vaccine hesitancy and where that movement comes from - and a lot of people want to point their fingers at somebody - that somebody usually is back onto naturopathic doctors, we are the catalyst. And we are the reason for vaccine hesitancy. And that is not the case. The biggest reason why people are hesitant, is as a result of how they were treated in the office when they had questions when they were curious. So it is the gaslighting and shaming that is actually probably the number one reason I have seen for vaccine hesitancy, is when you will not answer those questions, when you will shame someone and even call them vile names as a result of being curious. Don't expect them to come back and get their kiddos vaccinated. So that has been a theme that still today continues. If not, it's even worse. But this has been going on forever. This is not new, this has been going on for decades, in terms of the conversation about it. It's just getting worse and worse. It used to be you can have a bit more openness and conversation on vaccines. And now it's just black and white. If you don't, get out of my office, that's the treatment. And so seeing that, and hearing that over and over again, obviously, no one's acting like the bridge, nobody is. Part of me doesn't know why no one's acting like the bridge, why they're not allowing to have a conversation. Because to me it is - some patients have experience, to them traumatic experiences, it is traumatizing, to be belittled and yelled at as a brand new parent, you know, you have your week old baby in your hand, and what you're receiving from your health care practitioner is just vile. And, you know, now you're just like, what do I do, I don't know what to do. I mean, I just want to have a conversation, I can't have this conversation. And, you know, this panic comes over you. And they were just like, I can't deal with this. I'm not even gonna do it, I don't know who to talk to now, I just feel like I'm alone in this universe, and if I put anything on social media, I'm just gonna get ridiculed. Where do I go to have a safe conversation. And to me, this is one of the conversations that we must, must must must, make a safe place for people to talk about. And in order to get to that point of that decision, takes time. And unbeknownst to a lot of people in order to achieve full informed consent, one of those is the opportunity to ask questions. And your question should be answered in full, not as just a yes or a no or well, this site says x y z, therefore you do it. That's not how you have a conversation with people, we are in the age of information, give them the information, or that person will go elsewhere to find that information, which may not be where you really want them to go. So this is, you know, a world that I live in now. And I love being here because there's so many components in terms of vaccination, from the psychological component to the actual vaccine component to the infection component, the immunity component, there's so many components to this. And the journey is different for everybody, especially where they're starting at and within their journey or the experience that which they've had. Maybe it's their first child or their fifth child, or they come from overseas, they come from somewhere else. It's quite diverse. And the questions that I get from people are all over the place, be it they have no idea to we want to get really granular with questions, and welcome that, and it should be welcomed. Because if you don't know the answer, then you don't know the answer. And that's how it is and that's okay, to say you don't know the answer. And with this journey, with the multitude of questions, this is why I've created an eight part vaccine webinar series to to dive a little bit more into. Because I'm not someone you come to to say what do I do? What vaccine should I do? I'm not that person. The recommended vaccine schedule is the recommended vaccine schedule. That's the recommendation. If you're deciding to do something different, what is it that you're deciding to do and why are you deciding to do that? So it is for me to be a sounding board to answer questions for you. Not to say what to do. I do not have an alternative vaccine schedule. Never made one. I don't have a handout. Never have never will. Each family is going to be unique in their own their own journey, their needs, where they're going, where they've coming from. I have people that are going to overseas or they're coming from overseas, or international meaning United States, so it's different or your needs are different, or your child's health is different. And so we've talked about even perhaps other vaccines, which aren't on the schedule that may be appropriate for your child. So it's individualized for them. And so this is - we only have an hour to talk about, which seems like a long time. It goes by like that. And so the webinars are almost 10 hours of information, but you can get into those. What I'm hoping that they do is the answer more of your questions, is what it does, so that you can get more detailed and exactly what you want to know, so that you make an informed decision, is the whole point here is to make an informed decision. And that's what people want and should get is to be informed before they make a decision. It's not just do it because I said so. It is, well, why. But what is that? Why is that used? What is that infection? Why are we still doing that? These things, you have the right to know that answer. Of course, when you're working with a medical doctor or nurse and you have 15 minutes, you don't have a lot of time to explore all of those questions. And when you answer one question, maybe something brand new pops up. So it's such an interesting place to be in. Because it's nerve racking for a lot of people and people who come in you can tell that they are really uncomfortable to talk about it, difficulty to make eye contact with me in the beginning, really just, you know, fiddling with their hands because they're just so nervous to talk about. In the end, we've gained and made some headway because of how they've been treated in the past. This is a really uncomfortable place to be and this is a very uncomfortable conversation, as most people are aware now. Now with a COVID vaccine, it's even more uncomfortable. Pre COVID vaccine, most people, the majority of people, never even thought about a vaccine or ever had a conversation about a vaccine, like you've never been here before. Not that this is new, it's not new. You just were never here before. And now you are and now you're like well now I have questions about everything. I didn't even think, know, care. Now I care, I'd like to know a little bit more. So anyway, so that's sort of me and why I'm here and a little bit about what I do. But yeah, to me, it's a very fascinating place to be, in the world of vaccination. It really is, and what an incredible service you provide, to everyone you chat with and all of your patients, because I truly think that's a big part of what Unapologetic Moms Club is about, is that we should have the space to be that bridge. So you are able to ask questions, get information, make informed choices, because it's not black and white, life's not black and white, like there's so much grey area, every family is so unique, every person in that family is so unique. And so we need to be able to get the information we are seeking to be able to make those informed decisions that are truly right for us. And that should be a right, we should be able to access that and not be shut down, and gaslighted. And it just really can deteriorate the relationship as a whole with different family doctors or things like that, when that's how you're being treated over one particular subject. And then you're going to really think about that too for other things as well. So to be able to have someone like you, to be able to have that safe space to ask those questions is just incredible. So let's dig into it. How about kind of a brief rundown of basic scheduled vaccines for kids, kind of birth and up. I know, for my first kid at first, I was like, oh my god, this is like a lot in a very short time span. But it was always also like, okay, this is just kind of what we're supposed to do. People have been doing it for a long time. I know I had some confidence knowing that many of them have been done for long periods of time. But then it came to chickenpox. And I was like, oh, we've had chickenpox. Wem were fine, this is a newer one, do we really need this? So I would love just kind of a basic rundown. I know we only have so much time. Yeah, so yeah, so in Canada, the United States, to Singapore, to the UAE, there's going to be different schedules. And in Canada, each province can be a little bit different. So when I speak to people in Ontario, it's different, to Saskatchewan, Manitoba. It's a little bit different. So it's important to always look at your public health schedule because it does change. So for example, in British Columbia at two months, we're going to do the six in one, which is your diphtheria, tetanus, Pertussis, haemophilus influenza, type B, polio and hepatitis B. So that's six in one vaccine. Now, Saskatchewan or Ontario, for example, will just do a five in one, they do not do the Hepatitis B until grade school. So in BC, we used to do that. Alberta used to do that now they're the six in one. But they changed that a year or so ago from the five to the six. Now at two months, you have the six in one, you also have rotavirus, which is an oral one, then you'll have your PCV 13. And you'll have your min C done at two months here in BC. Then comes four months, and you'll drop the Minsi and you repeat all the other ones. Then come six months, you're going to drop the PCV 13, and you do the rotavirus and the six and once you repeat, repeat, repeat. Then you get to 12 months, and that's where you're going to start your first MMR with chickenpox, plus the PCV 13, third dose of that, plus the min C, so a second dose of that. So that's done at 12 months. Then comes 18 months, then you will do the five in one, and then you're four and six years old, you'll do another MMR, maybe chickenpox. And you'll do the foreign one as well. So that foreign one is diptheria, tetanus, Pertussis, and polio, you'll do that. Then you get to grade school, then grade six and grade nine, and you do some more then. But that's for childhood, so there are multiple and they're repeated, they're just repeated over and over and over again. And there's a bit of history to why things are done in this fashion. So in the United States, mother's typically used to stop breastfeeding around three months, because that's when maternity leave ends. Of course, in Canada, it's different. But the United States that would end about three months. So then we start vaccinating at two months to build some antibodies, and then you've got four months, and then you've got six months, and then you've got your 12 months. So the rest of the world kind of follows that schedule, the CDC schedule, a little bit of difference is there. I mean, the United States does hep B at birth, Singapore does hep B and tuberculosis at birth. Canada, we don't do the hep B at birth. We'll do that two months, typically. So yeah, so the schedule. And all the ones that I mentioned are pretty much all the ones everyone in the world will do, there might be a little bit different, the min C might be different. Some provinces start at four months. the United States doesn't even do a min C until 12 months, they do the quad at 12 months. So the Meningococcal vaccine is a little bit different from where you are in the world and the timing of that, but it's pretty much similar schedules everywhere you go, but little bit of nuances. Yeah, Hepatitis B being the one that changes from where you are. Okay. Yeah, interesting. And I think the fact that it varies depending on your location also speaks to there's no hard and fast rules, things vary. No. So there's some opinion that's in there. Versus frank statistics, and it should be the same across the whole country. But it's different across the country. So it's varying opinions as to really when you should start. Absolutely. And so when you're going over those, there's a bit of like letters and numbers, what exactly are each of those? What are they doing? What are we protecting our children for in doing them? So good question. So actually, in the webinars, I spend a full hour on the bacteria ones that we vaccinate against, and then I spend a whole hour on the viruses that we vaccinate against. So to get into like, statistics, what the symptoms are, what is the worst case scenario with the endpoint of that infection, and then for you to understand the difference between a bacteria and virus. What are those differences between bacterial and viral? Well, viruses are very tiny, versus a bacteria. Viruses, you don't kill them. You allow your immune system to kill them. And so we need certain ammo to help our immune system killed them. But when it comes to antivirals, what you're doing is you are stopping their ability to replicate, is what you're doing, that's when anti viral will do. So there's certain ways of doing that. But when we say an antiviral, that's what we're doing. Now, when it comes to the bacteria, they're big. And they can either have a cell wall or no cell wall, which we'll call gram positive or gram negative, two choices, and then from there is choosing the antibiotic that we use. So either we say broad spectrum, or not really broad spectrum antibiotic, based on not knowing if it's positive or gram negative. It doesn't matter, we're going to use something that would hit both of those. So it's important to know, I suppose the nuances, the difference between. Gram negative species can have another layer of problem which is called LPS, Lipopolysaccharide, which is released by gram negative, which is very inflammatory. And interestingly enough, that's why the D tap changed in the 80s. So we had a whole cell D tap vaccine, now we have an acellular D tap vaccine. So Bordetella Pertussis, which causes whooping cough, is a gram negative bacteria. And it was that LPS that was a problem in that vaccine, which was creating more adverse reactions. So they went to acellular. Now we're not having those frequent adverse reactions, although the vaccine doesn't work as well, it does with a whole cell not with a singular form. So that's sort of the understanding to know those nuances and differences. Viruses as a whole, the conventional side doesn't really know what to do with viruses when you contract a virus because we don't have medications that would go in to kill it. We are wanting, hopefully, that it stops replicating and the immune system just takes over and deals with it. So this is where it comes into vaccine optimization, which is immune optimization as well, for vaccines but on the whole. Because in order to make an antibody, you need a well functioning immune system to make an antibody, period. This is why there's variations in terms of vaccine efficacy, which can be because your immune system isn't making antibodies very well. So you didn't you didn't respond to the vaccine as well as you should have to make antibodies. And there's people that are genetically, there's a genetic predisposition to not be able to make antibodies as well. And there's a higher proponent of people than I think we realize that cannot. And I go into that, specifically to the measles vaccine. There can be a genetic variants for people that don't make antibodies very well, moreso around five to 10% of the population, specifically to measles. So yeah, so it's a higher, you know, we talk about herd immunity. And the goal there is to have the herd 95% immune and there'll be a 5%, you know, buffer of people that can't. And be it those 5% are the elderly, infants, immunocompromised. But it's difficult to be immunocompromised though, people really use that way too loosely. You can make yourself immunocompromised, which I don't think people realize you can. You can do that to yourself, you can suppress your immune system, by way of the food choices and the drink choices that you take in, can suppress your immune system. So this is where this whole realm of the vaccine world, to me, is that accountability, that although you've been vaccinated, if you're not going to take care of your body, you're probably frankly not immune to that antigen. Because you're not doing the things to support your immune system to make an antibody. And then you continue to do things that are suppressing your immune system. So although it's not funny, but it's funny, that they'll give you a doughnut to have a COVID vaccine, and that doughnut, that sugar, suppresses the immune system. So to me is like, Well, that makes absolutely zero logical sense to me, of what you're doing here. You want that vaccine to be effective? Then do not do the things that suppress the immune system, because yes, one teaspoon of refined sugar will suppress your natural killer cells for four hours. If you have diabetes, you're a person that's going to struggle making the antibodies. So there are things in terms of your status, how inflamed you are, which sugar adds to inflammation, you are not going to be able to make antibodies very well. So this is where although you might be vaccinated, you may not have immunity. If you don't make antibodies, you do not have immunity. So it's the goal is to have immunity to have those antibodies. But if you're going to impede that ability to get there by way of your choices, and frankly, because no one's telling you that what you're doing is a problem, you're going to continue doing them. You might not have those antibodies, and therefore, you've negated the work of that vaccine as a result. Because a lot of times, all the time, I'll say a lot of the time, I won't say all the time. Most of the time, when you're in your the phases of research of vaccines, phase one is supposed to be animals. Phase two is going to be a small cohort of people. Phase three is a larger cohort of people. And after phase three, the vaccine gets licensed to either put onto a vaccine schedule or for the general public to use, which is actually phase four. But phase two, you are choosing healthy, typically 20 to 40 year olds, to be in phase two, healthy 20 to 40. You're not choosing ill people to be in your phase two, you want to want to make sure, yes, the antibodies are made in those healthy people right. Phase three, maybe a little bit more unhealthy in phase three, but still, we want to have more healthy people to see that it's effective, that we can make antibodies. And so if we see that it's effective in healthy people I mean, then we just say it's effective for everybody. But if you're unhealthy going in, and you're doing the things that are suppressing your immune system, making you more inflamed, you're not going to make antibodies as well as that healthy person as well. There's so many interesting parts of that. And a lot of things I haven't heard before, which is what I find so frustrating about a lot of the messaging around health is that it's like this medicine will fix this thing. But there's not much talk actually about immune systems. So I would like to dig into that a bit. But I did want to circle back and kind of recap for those listening. So bacteria, the goal is to kill. Viral, we want to stop replication, build up our immune system so that it can fight off whatever it is. Right, right. Because our immune system, they're like Pac Man that go around and just eat, eat, eat. And then what they do is they themselves kill themselves, which is called apoptosis. They basically, they make themselves implode from the inside out, and they die, and everything inside of it dies as well. But that's how you're going to kill something as the immune system will do it. And so we'll do antivirals to reduce that replication and the immune system now can really take over and get at it. Now to even back up further because what's in every vaccine, so the six in one, I said those things, but those are all in one. And then we've got the PCV 13. So that streptococcus pneumonia, 13 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae in that one vaccine. The min C is Mysteria bacteria type C. No, there's other types that you have. So we've got the B and then we've got the quad as well. And then you've got rotavirus, which is a virus and it's oral. All of those vaccines except rotavirus need an adjuvant to stimulate the immune system so it's stimulated to the antigen. So they use aluminum as the adjuvant in those vaccines, is what they're using. Rotavirus, you don't. MMR you don't either. People think there is aluminum in the MMR vaccine, there is not, nor the chickenpox, that's a live viral vaccine. You don't need aluminum. So the other ones you do in order to stimulate the immune system. So when you get an injection of your six and one, they're dead antigens, they're dead. But they're using that aluminum adjuvant to say, hey, we've got tetanus, Pertussis, hib, right here, come on over. And so then we've got the immune system again, that will eat and engulf that antigen, which is actually bound to that aluminum, because the aluminum binds to the antigen so they stay together so that the immune system is activated. And then that immune cell which is either your uniphyl cell or dendritic cells will engulf, or it's called phagocytose, and take that antigen and then present it to a B and T cell within our lymph nodes. And then at that point, it's either killed and our memory is made as a result. It's like oh, that's Pertussis. Ooh, that's tetanus. That's hid. That's polio. Let's make an antibody to that. So that is the General Coles notes of how that happens, so all those vaccines will have aluminum in them. I think it's good to understand that rotavirus does not and nor does MMR, they don't need an adjuvant. So then you MMR is Measles, Mumps, Rubella or viruses. And chickenpox is also a virus, which can be with or without the MMR vaccine. Okay, so the live vaccines they are already live. So the bodies will immediately know what to do or start doing its work. But for the non live, you'd mentioned, dead, they use the aluminum to basically find it and help signal to the body is like, Okay, this is here, you need to start doing what you're doing. Yeah, because if you didn't use an adjuvant, that antigen would just go away, and then you just pee or poop it out, and then it'd be done, nothing would happen. So you have to stimulate the immune system to know that it's there. There's other adjuvants that are used. Aluminum isn't the only one but it's the main one used. And the one thing that just came in mind with you talking about aluminum is aluminum in antiperspirant. And recently, I've decided not to use that and to move towards a more natural deodorant. And so for the aluminum that's in these vaccines, I'm assuming it's a very small, small amount. But what are kind of the thoughts or research on that and kind of the effects of having that aluminum in there. I'm assuming like, comparing it to antiperspirant, that's something you're putting on day in and day out to the same area, that's going to have a way different effect than the individual vaccines. So I go through everything in terms of aluminum on webinar five or six, I can't remember which one, but it go through aluminum start to finish. Now, what's important to understand because people like to share means that aluminum in vaccines is the same as what's in baby formula. And it's not, it's not, because it can't be the same. It's apples and oranges in that comparison. Yes, it's aluminum, but they're completely different. So when you consume aluminum, so be it in baby formula, or aluminum foil that your cooking food in, you absorb only about point one 2.3% of that aluminum, that aluminum form is also water soluble. So when it's absorbed, it's going to be easily moved out and you're gonna pee and poop that out. So you've absorbed very little, and what you absorb is water soluble because of the form of aluminum. Antiperspirant will be the same, it's going to be a water soluble form as well. Now using antiperspirant means you're also right near your lymph nodes as well. And absorption through the skin can be a little bit different versus through the gut. Now, when you inject, it is micrograms worth, it's very little. But you're injecting so you have breached the dermis completely here, you may not completely go through epidermis to dermis, through the guts, again, only point one .1 to .3 percent. Both of these are going to be water soluble. Now when you inject it's a different form of aluminum so that it acts as an adjuvant. When you eat aluminum, that's not an adjuvant. When the form of aluminum that's used i an adjuvant, that form of aluminum binds to the antigen. And two forms do happen, we have a water soluble form and a non-water soluble form, that non water soluble form is going to bind to the antigen. That that water soluble form will work its way out. But that non water soluble form will bind to the antigen. And that form of aluminum is persistent. It's persistent. But it's also going to be now in the in the lymphatic system because it has to be to get to the lymph nodes. So you're B and T cells can do something with that immune cell that's presenting the antigen which is bound to the aluminum. So then that aluminum is - well, we need to work to get that out. And so that's sort of not my work but other people's work in terms of determining how long does that take to get out, what can we do to get it out, because it is persistent. Now it is micro grams, but again, apples and oranges. Safety around aluminum, which is actually interestingly enough, the BC CDC has created a flip chart to go through and actually shares this information around the safety piece. So the safety piece is based on oral aluminum. So we've got an agency called Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry. And basically what they do is they test everything that's toxic, and they use rats to do it. And they just see, well, what's the threshold of where it becomes a problem. Orally, though, on everything, we're talking like arsenic to cadmium to like you name you name it. And aluminum is one of them. So they base it on oral. And so the volume is much more in terms of oral, that they're basing it on, which vaccines fall under that, in terms of its micrograms versus milligrams. But again, it's oral, they're not doing it based on injection, they're basing the safety of it on oral and that is just how it is, that is clearly laid out on the last paper that was written by by the Mitkis in 2008, his last paper that they based it on, and it's in there of how, if one wants to go and read through that, of how this has come about in terms of safety, and volume, and amount, and so forth. Because when you base it on oral you're basing it on when that rat had a problem with oral aluminum, and then they're doing some correction factors to then correlate to humans, but at a much lower level. And that much lower level, vaccines fall below that. And so then that's sort of where like, okay, well then that's the safety that we've determined as a result. And I go through all of that in the webinar, from point A to point B of the forms, the literature, the determination, and that's just how it is. So in order to stimulate the immune system, and aluminum does that. That's because it's an adjuvant, and that's because of the different form. So while it's good to yes, change your antiperspirant, I don't know how much is absorbed through the skin, especially when you're sweating, and it's capable of getting, it's a good idea to stop it. Yep, it is a good idea to stop it, especially because you're right near those lymph nodes. And so once again, the lymphatic system, it's how long does it take to get out of the lymphatic system, because aluminum, it is not part of a healthy diet to have aluminum. Now silica is sort of your antidote. So silica and aluminum go together in the Earth's crust. So when people say, oh, aluminum, Earth's crust, aluminum is all over, we use aluminum all the time. But it also goes hand in hand with silica. Now you can't just take any old silica, you need a specific form of silica, which is actually found in Fiji water. So this is why Fiji water has really made its headway. I'm hoping that there's another water source that you can get that specific form of silica from but silica binds to aluminum and makes it inert and pee or poop it out. So Fiji water is something that I, in terms of vaccine optimization, I will suggest that as something afterwards, maybe even before, certainly afterwards and to continue doing that. Because it takes a while for that aluminum, also from the site of the injection, to turn into water soluble and non-water soluble. It's a process, it doesn't happen right away. So that's where you could just take a drink of Fiji water and call it a day, that's not going to be enough. So that continuation. That's so interesting. All the nuances, yes, there's so many little avenues you can go down with this conversation, which is why an hour goes by really quickly. Absolutely, but it's so nice that you do have all those other webinars available. If any portion of this conversation piques anyone's interest, we'll [make sure to link it](https://vaccineoptimization.com/vaccine-optimization-bundles/), and they can find more information through those. So I think that leads well into how we can optimize for the efficacy and different things that we might want to prepare to help our bodies with all of that. Yeah, exactly. So, to me, there's very little research, but there is a little bit of research. It's more so around the influenza vaccine and to helping increase its efficacy for elderly because that's where we see a lot of, you know, influenza issues is going to be elderly. So is the vaccine working? I mean, as you age, your immune system does not work as well. So we know that. And then is there a portion of we can take accountability, to take certain things to help efficacy and there has been some research. So those things that I'm suggesting for people is going to be vitamin C, possibly zinc, vitamin D, and probiotics. So these are things that research has shown in terms of increasing vaccine efficacy, because you're helping the immune system to actually respond to them, therefore make an antibody. When you're deficient in some of these nutrients, you've got an immune system that's just not, it's like, hey, I'm sorry, I'm peacing out, I don't know what to do with that antigen, so sorry, not today. So this is where it's important to do these things to improve that efficacy and response. So I will do that. And then in addition, I will do glutathione. So glutathione helps the immune system, it's a gentle chelator. And I do it because if a parent is going to use Tylenol, then they will have glutathione on board. So if you're going to do Tylenol, you should always do glutathione alongside it. It's just, it's like taking antibiotics and probiotics, which you do take a probiotic when you take an antibiotic. I know people say you don't, yes, you do, which I can get into. But you definitely need to take a probiotic when you do an antibiotic, just not with each other. Now, when it comes to Tylenol, wipes the body's storage of glutathione. Glutathione is incredibly important for the lungs. And there's research with doing Tylenol increases the risk of asthma. So we're going to take glutathione when we take Tylenol, they go hand in hand. So I have patients do this before a vaccine, we usually start around two weeks beforehand. And we start two weeks so that I know that you're not reacting to the supplements, you don't start one day beforehand, we start, you know, a fair ways beforehand. And we're just seeing, getting in the rhythm of things as well. And so we're doing glutathione for that reason. And then we have it there in case we use use Tylenol, no problem, we've got the glutathione onboard already. And then I also will do some lymphatic support as well. So I want to use support lymphatic as well. So I do that as well. So that's basically the the optimizing we want to work on, optimizing the immune system. And those are the main nutrients that I go towards. Probiotics, there's been some specific key species that are related to vaccine optimization, and even spores. So bacillus subtilis, as well, which is a spore, that has also been linked to better vaccine efficacy as well, which makes sense. Spores release prebiotics. So they're going to feed your key species, which play a role in producing short-chain fatty acids, which are important for the immune system. It's just the domino effect is why that's there. So someone usually talking about children's vaccine, kiddos aren't necessarily like an adult waltzing in to have a vaccine, you know, obese, to massively inflamed, they haven't been on Earth long enough, you know, for these things to have compounded. So I don't need to do those things. But when it comes to an adult, then we might do some other things before we do a vaccine in terms of an adult. With children, it's more so just to support the immune system and be it I'm using mama as a surrogate, so she's taking nutrients which then go to baby, because it's difficult to give an infant some of these things. So we're using mom to do those things. But you can get a lot of these things early and the baby will do them. And then of course nutrition. I mean, if you're a baby, you're either breastfed or you are supplementing. If you are breastfed then for Mama to be to be very, I think, changing nutrition of course, that is going to help not play into being inflammatory. And that wouldn't be suppressing the immune system. So for mom to eat clean whole foods as well will affect baby's response too, so especially if you're breastfeeding. Interesting, another side note in terms of getting the TD vaccine in pregnancy, so third trimester, you can do the booster X vaccine, you're doing it so that you make antibodies towards Pertussis, which then you pass those antibodies on to your baby, which you do. So, in the webinars - I talk about this in webinar two, which is about pregnancy and breastfeeding. But there's a paper that came out looking at Mama's that did the booster X vaccine and then mamas that did not, they did the TD vaccine. So they didn't do the booster, they didn't have the Pertussis portion. Looked at her antibodies and so they they mama who got the boosters vaccine made antibodies to Pertussis of course, and then the others did not because they didn't get the vaccine. Okay, so then baby is born. And then baby has vaccines at two, four, and six months. And then what they're doing is they're measuring the antibodies of Pertussis in the babies as well. And what's interesting is babies that were born to moms that got the booster X vaccine that had the Pertussis and then those babies got their six in one vaccine, their antibodies to Pertussis actually declined with each subsequent vaccine. So it's like how is that possible? Well, those mamas, their Pertussis antibodies were interfering with the baby's ability to make antibodies to protect against Pertussis. Versus the mamas that had not had the Pertussis vaccine, and their babies got the Pertussis vaccine, they didn't have antibodies to Pertussis in their breast milk for the baby, which is the whole point of getting it. But those babies, their antibodies did incline, they did increase with each vaccine, not decrease. So this was an unintended consequence that was happening because more now than like 10 years, five to 10 years ago, the boosters vaccine was not suggested as much as now because Pertussis is very much amongst us. And I go into why also Pertussis is amongst us more. But that's just why it's given. So Mama makes antibodies and then passes it to her baby. But I thought that was an interesting. So that's a conversation that I'll have with pregnant moms to be aware of. So I think you have a right to know of some of that research. And be it that's part of your decision making to do something or not to do something. But again, here, I am giving you that information that is to be unbiased. So that you can make an informed decision, whatever that is, should be informed. I don't - and I tell this to patients, everybody, I don't care what your decision is, I have no personal attachment to your decision at all, I can't have a personal attachment. What I care about is that you made an informed decision so that you would never come back in my office and say, you never told me that. Why did you not tell me that, you should have known that, you're the person that's supposed to know this information and give me that information so that I can make an informed decision. That's what I don't ever want to happen. So then I have no attachment to anyone's decision. I have patients that vaccinate, some that have chosen not to, some that have chosen to do some. And so that is their decision. Vaccination is a choice. It is your decision to do what it is that you want to do. And I'm not here to swing you in either direction. That's not what I do. I don't say to do or not to do, let's let's get granular so you understand the product. And the infection, I think is also the missing component. People don't understand the infection that they are vaccinating against. And it's important for you to know that. What is HIB? What is influenza type B? What is, you know, maybe polio? What is diphtheria? What is Pertussis? You know, people are like what is that? Okay. So it is important for you to understand the infection, I have patients do that first. Get to know the infection first, then let's talk about the vaccine afterwards. Get to know the infection first. And then, because I think that we need a lot more headway in understanding first because you're making a decision to get a vaccine to protect your child from that infection. So I think it should be the other way around. So get to know the infection, then let's talk about the vaccine because we know what the vaccine is, we know it's purpose. And why you're doing it is for having protection against that infection. Do you understand the infection? And again, that will help you make a decision as well. And people are like I had no idea, no idea about that. I didn't even know why I was doing that. I had no idea what that was. So it's like hey, well, now you do. Yeah, that's an important part of the risk benefit analysis, right, is what are you protecting against? If you choose not to what are the risks, right? So that's important to know. And that will lead into something else. But I also just wanted to circle back and make sure I had a full understanding and kind of recap for those listening in terms of the Pertussis in pregnancy and checking the levels within the baby after each of those stages. So just want to make sure I have the right understanding of it. So the ones where the woman did vaccinate in pregnancy, she got those antibodies and then the baby, as they had their following vaccines, their antibodies actually decreased. So it's almost like it was blocking the baby's ability to do it on their own. Because in the instances where the woman didn't, the baby was able to do it themselves? Okay. Very interesting. So I just wanted to make sure I fully understood that. Exactly. Yes. Which is totally - that's why it's so interesting because it has been now at every visit with either your midwife or obstetrician. That suggestion now to do the booster X vaccine in the third trimester, so versus five to 10 years ago. You know, I have mamas who had a kiddo three years ago, and they were like what? Yeah, they never said anything to me, and my kids are three and four-and-a-half. Right. So it's more even maybe in the last couple years, of being very diligent to ask if you want it, or you know, that you should get it. And so it's interesting because like, okay, well, they're doing it because Pertussis is one of the four things that sends infants into the hospital. So it's still with us significantly. So therefore, it's implemented in pregnancy, as a result to build those antibodies. And then it's in your breast milk, which it was for those mamas that got the vaccine, they were passing it through their breast milk, they were. I mean, hence, the baby couldn't make Pertussis antibodies well because she had antibodies. So that that objective worked, in terms of her making antibodies and passing, that objective was succeeded. But then the unintended consequence was was that the baby's antibodies were declining when they got their vaccines. So that was an unintended consequence. Yeah. And that has me thinking now with other kind of vaccine that can be recommended to pregnant women is the COVID vaccine too. And it's so new, I'm assuming there isn't as much research for that, right? No, not at all. And could it have similar - well, I'm not sure yet, because it's not scheduled at all, it's not offered for a two month old to have a COVID vaccine. It's coming down to six months, though. So let's just take it as a kiddo is having it at six months, and she did have it in pregnancy, could her COVID vaccine impede the baby responding? And that part? No idea? Maybe? Maybe, could natural immunity impede? Maybe. I mean, this is, you know, unknowingly unless a. it's done and b. closely monitored to answer those questions. Because this in terms of the Pertussis, the booster X vaccine, was a planned study, and they had like 263 mamas enroll. And then they compare the TD vaccine to the booster X vaccine, which is the TD Pertussis, and then they had an actual here we go from pregnancy, to then all the way up until I think they ended it around nine or twelve months they ended up looking at antibodies. It was a planned study. Now, I mean, is there that? I don't know if there's going to be unvaccinated mamas to COVID, then baby gets it at six months, let's look at that, and then mama to COVID, and then baby gets COVID vaccine, and then compare those two. So that would be what you want to be comparing those to. And then you could answer the question. Because at this point, no idea. Because vaccine efficacy is based on two things. First off, you made antibodies, you gotta make antibodies, number one. Number two, cases decline. That's how you know the vaccine is efficacious, you can make antibodies all day long. If the cases don't reduce, then it's not efficacious, because the whole point is to reduce cases of that infection. That's how you can, frankly, say it's effective. So let's take chickenpox vaccine, since the chickenpox vaccine came out in the 90s, we have less chickenpox, varicella, outbreaks. So we know it's efficacious, yes, they make antibodies to it but also we have a decline of the infection itself. Therefore you can you can conclude it is efficacious as a result. Those two things have to happen to, frankly, say yes it works. Okay. And that leads into, we can dig in a little bit more for the COVID vaccine. I know we are kind of coming up to time, but as you touched on, they are talking about it for six months to five years, because previously, I believe it was five and up. And now with the school year approaching, many parents are starting to think like, oh, should I vaccinate my child who's entering kindergarten or should I do a COVID vaccination for my younger child as well? Right. So going back to other infections, what I try to have patients do first off is understand the infection that you're dealing with. Which we've had some time to understand COVID in itself, and yes, there's different strains that are happening. We've got the alpha, the Delta, Omnicron. And it just continues because it's mutating. Now, there isn't any approved Canadian, or US approved treatment, per se, when you contract COVID. So it's all about prevention, prevention is the key in that public health model. It's about preventing worst cases so that you don't go to the hospital. That's what it's about. That's the objective. Knowing that you can still have symptoms, but you're not in a circumstance where you require emergency medicine and attention. That's what they want to prevent. That's the prevention piece. If you're vaccinated, and you have mild symptoms, they're like that was a success, because you're not in the hospital. That's the the same thing with the flu vaccine. That's the objective, is to reduce hospital visits. And they're gonna go by every year based on whom is in unvaccinated and whom is in vaccinated and compare year to year to year. And then they can use that data to say it was effective based on those numbers, or not effective based on those numbers. But that takes time to be able to say that. Now, of course, the flu vaccine changes every year as well. So the COVID vaccine, though, has not changed, it's the same vaccine, and we're using it for different forms of SARS Cov 2. So the efficacy is always on the table, it's a question mark, the efficacy. I mean, there's two things that come with vaccines: safety and efficacy, those two things. Is it safe, is it effective. So the efficacy portion gets more attention than the safety portion. And I say that because if there's going to be, say, adverse reactions unknown, to public health it's going to be well you made antibodies, reduced the possible spread, therefore reduce someone else getting infected as a result. So it's a numbers game, in terms of reducing spread is the whole objective, as well as reducing the spread so that others don't get infected, and therefore those people aren't going to be in the hospital. So the choice still comes down to the decision to choose to do so. As well as looking at Coronavirus and children. What are the stats of that? And how does it affect the child? The decision then is well, the efficacy in looking at has it reduced rates? When someone with a vaccine gets infected with COVID, is it mild, moderate or severe. And you're putting all that information together, which is still ongoing. So it's difficult to give frank information to you because it's ongoing. And now this is new in terms of to six month olds. And I have no idea, no one does, have no idea in terms of efficacy and safety in six months old at this point. This is the thing with science. It says in order to answer that question, we need to do the research to be able to give you the answer. And you can do it on animals, rats, monkeys, and then try to relate that to how that would work in a human but some of these infections affect humans differently than an animal. So it's not parallel. It's not the same because some infections don't even affect animals at all. So then you can't even use them as, you know, how bad will this be? Because in terms of efficacy, what you can do is you can give the vaccine to an animal. And then you can inoculate them, meaning put them in a room and have COVID in the room and see how does it how how do they respond, is it they have antibodies, and then therefore they come out with no symptoms, or they had antibodies and they did have symptoms. You can do that to an animal. You don't do that in human trials. What you do is you get a vaccine, which they've done with COVID. And then you go out into the wild, as we call it. You go to the grocery store and you you do things and what happens, did you get infected in that four month time period, those that got vaccinated, or did you not get infected, and that's going to be what they're going to be using for efficacy. There's so many variables there, so many variables, obviously, where you just need more people to make sure that that wasn't just by chance, that it actually did happen. Because that will be like, oh, that just happened by chance, that was just by chance. And so that's why you need more, this is why it's not good to do 100 People, this is why you're going to do like 100,000 people. So we know it wasn't by chance. It was an actuality, within that cohort. So it's hard - back to decision making. Again, get to know the infection itself. And in the demographics of people with mild, moderate, severe, the health status of your child, because in any infection, viral or bacterial, you can have the similar risk of contracting. But are you more susceptible for that infection to be worse for you or your child? That goes back to immune optimization, is what that goes back to. So this is where you take accountability for those lifestyle choices that you're making. If your kiddo is up till 10 o'clock at night, and they should be going to bed at seven, because they're in an age category that needs 12 hours of sleep, that less sleep makes them more susceptible. They're not getting exercise, more susceptible. They're having all the sugary things, especially in summertime, Gatorade, ice cream, all the things that are cooling you off, the sugar, sugar, sugar, that's harming their immune system. Now, you can get away with it more in the summertime because you're outside. And you're not in a tight congregation, you're also not at school type congregation. So you're outside doing things as well. But then continue with that style of what you're doing. You just roll right into September, you roll into October, which is Halloween, and you eat all the candy, then you roll into November, which is Thanksgiving, then you roll into December, which is Christmas. So you just continue to perpetuate the problem. And then you're like, I don't understand why we're sick, I don't understand. And to me, it's like, okay, it's time to start understanding, it's time to also stop blaming other people of why you were sick. This part is also part of why I like to be here as well in this conversation, because it's time to to take accountability. Because you're going to blame someone else for why you're sick, you need to look at yourself, first off, because if you are more susceptible to contract that infection, it's on you, not on them for being sick, it's on you. Because it's a blame game as well. If you don't get vaccinated, then I could get sick. And that is not how it works. I know that's what's been said, it's not how it works. Because if you are doing things to suppress your immune system, and you're vaccinated, you my friend can still be un-immunized. While you've got someone that's vaccinated or not, is sick and you're around them, you're sick because of your choices. So this is where again, if you start - I say preservation of your immune system now. Summer months is about growing a garden, and then you can it, preserve it. Do the same for immune system now, get in the habit of you're doing the smoothies that has all the good stuff in it, you're exercising because it's nice out. Continue that into September, into October, into November, into December. So you're preserved throughout all of it, and you come out of it much better than you did if you had not done those things. If your vitamin if your vitamin D status is low, and your zinc status, your Selenium, vitamin C, your gut health is awful because you have IBS or IBD, you are way more susceptible to having problems. And you're not going to make antibodies very well to that vaccine. Vaccination is a tool, it's not 100% effective. None of them are. So you can't hold on to the fact that I've been vaccinated, I'm going to be fine. I'm totally fine. And I tell my patients that, just because you've been vaccinated doesn't mean you cannot contract those other millions of viruses and bacteria out there, because you can. So just because you've vaccinated you still have to take care of yourself, because you can still catch any of them. And that's important. And so if you don't have a bubble around yourself, you've got the nose to bring things in and the mouth to bring things in constantly. And so you have an immune system of the gut that can help you out or it's not there to help you out. And so if it doesn't help you out, then those things are going to go through the digestive tract into your systemic bloodstream. And now your immune system is on board having to deal with it, if they can or cannot. So this a huge piece, that accountability, taking care of your health is how you're going to be able to get through each winter. Even if you're vaccinated, you still have to take care of yourself. And so when I see people - and it is your choice to do what you want to do - but when I see people wearing a mask, absolutely your choice and absolutely fine to do that. That's not really part of the point of this, is you're wearing a mask to protect yourself. Okay. But if I'm seeing - and I'm seeing from a distance, I'm not having that conversation, but I'm seeing from a distance well, I see that there's pop in your cart, all white bread, see all the things that which are suppressing your immune system means you are going to be more susceptible. Yes, you're wearing a mask to protect yourself is why you're doing it. Why are you not taking care of your immune system? That is what will protect you. And you are hurting it every single time you drink that pop. You know, sugary yogurts are in the cart. I see cake, I see ice cream, I don't see anything, I don't see any veggies or fruit or what have you. I see no whole foods going on there. And so that is what's going to hurt you. So it is time to realize that those decisions do affect your immune system. And you are hurting your immune system every single time you do that. So now is the time to preserve and change those habits, takes 30 days to really change a habit. And then now you're rolling into the time when you really want preserve everything. Take care of yourself now. And then you'll be good. You'll be better than you were had you not done that. Thank you. No one is talking about this conversation in that way. Which I find so frustrating. It's like here's your answer, but no, there's so much to our health. And that we can be doing and to be proactive and to stay healthy for all of the different things we may come across. And it's not just a quick fix. We need to be aware of this, looking at all of the things, for what we're putting into our bodies, how we're moving our bodies, all of that. And yeah, thank you, because it is so refreshing to hear. Yeah. I mean, we're so accustomed to the quick fix, right? We're so accustomed to that pill, shot, done, I'm good. Now I don't have to think. And it's just not that anymore. No more. Illness and sickness is up. And if the trend continues to go up, it's not going down. And so when you unfortunately have a side of medicine that says it doesn't matter what you eat, well, there you go. So then it's like, well, it does matter what you eat. And it's in the literature, if you want to find it, if you actually, you know, it's there. There's evidence for this. But you know, we're not having the conversations around why vitamin D from the podium, those people are not speaking about why vitamin D is important and what it does for you. Those people are not empowering you on how to take care of yourself. And that information should be free and readily available for you. And should be right there, right in front of you. Check your vitamin D today, check your vitamin D status. You can check your zinc status, you can check these things - really, really low, had no idea. To me, I think checking your vitamin D status should be a free thing. Because it's not in Canada, it's not free, it should be free, number one. And then number two is the vitamin D should just be free as well. And you should be counseled by your healthcare provider on how to take it and how much you should take to, like that's just health 101 to me. Because it's all about the immune system, is all about making sure that it's strong and healthy for when you contract something. And that's a part of being human. It is a part of our existence that we are going to come across all different sicknesses and it's not necessarily something we need to try and never have happen. It's just a part of our life and we need to try and be proactive so we can handle it and lean on different tools and resources depending on our situation to help us more with that. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Well, yeah, this was awesome. I love your perspective on this. Before we sign off, I just want to kind of recap for those considering kind of any kind of vaccine, the main kind of decision process points, immune system, what the virus or whatever it is that we are wanting to protect against, what is that, and then looking at what the vaccine is, it's efficacy, how we can potentially strengthen that if we need to. And, yes, did I hit all the points? It's pretty much all the points. Yeah, get to know the infection, support your immune system. Start from that perspective first and then can move into - because it's, you know, it's easy to explain the vaccines when they are, there's the schedule, and what they are. But you already know, if you understand the infections, and you understand why you're getting the vaccine, because the vaccine is the antigen, and you get the antigen so that you make an antibody. That's the point. Sounds great. Well, thank you so much for being here and for sharing all of that. Where can everyone go to find you and check you out and everything you have going on? Yeah, so Instagram is just [@DrTaylorBean](https://www.instagram.com/drtaylorbean/). My website is [www.DrTaylorBean.com](http://www.drtaylorbean.com). The Clinic website is [www.TaylorMadeWellness.com](http://www.taylormadewellness.com). And then for the vaccines, webinars are on their own website, they're on my personal website, but they're [www.VaccineOptimization.com](http://www.vaccineoptimization.com). That's its own website. And you can pick and choose what you want to watch. You can purchase the whole eight, or you can purchase one at a time, you can bundle them together. So usually, I say to people two and three, episode two and three because of the viruses and the bacteria specifically to get to know. But webinar one is about the infant's immune system, which I think is important to understand, because it develops. Webinar 2, pregnancy and breastfeeding. And then three, four, and then five and six are going to be aluminum, genetics, and safety, efficacy, how research is done. And then seventh is how to optimize your kiddos health from just optimization period. And then the eighth is how I optimize vaccination. What that means as an MD, what do I do and how do I go through that. But having a consult is basically webinar eight and seven. But to have more granular questions, those other webinars help answer those questions, I think, is why I did them. So that if we have a conversation, you and I, then, you know, you've already done that work. And you're like, okay, I really need to know, this, this, this versus like, so what do I do? Because my answer is going to be the recommended vaccine schedule. That's the answer. And so you need to come forward and be like well, look, I'm thinking of this and thinking of that, tell me more about x y z, and then we go through that information. Get informed, be prepared, ask the questions. Exactly. You were allowed to ask questions. And as practitioners we should be answering them in a respectful way. Which is obvious to me but anyways, yeah, I'm here to be an unbiased soundboard. That is the point. Well, we will have all that linked. Thank you. Thank you for those listening.
