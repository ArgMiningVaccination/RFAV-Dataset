The three core products of the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Program\u2014Alpha CRS+\u00ae, xEO Mega\u00ae, and Microplex VMz\u00ae\u2014are formulated to provide you with targeted levels of essential nutrients and powerful metabolic factors for optimal health, energy, and longevity. Our lifelong health and vitality depend on many factors including diet, physical activity, weight management, rest, stress management, exposure to toxins, and inherited genetic predisposition for disease or wellness. While some of these variables are beyond our complete control, breakthrough scientific research is revealing many ways we can influence\u2014and even control\u2014significant factors of aging and wellness. A long life full of vitality and healthy aging begins with providing your cells with essential nutrients and metabolic factors to help them perform optimally.

Free radicals are a toxic byproduct of breathing and the metabolism of food. They also come from other sources, such as pollution, smoking, sun exposure, and exposure to radiation. All these free-radical sources can push oxidative stress beyond what the body can safely handle. Cellular free-radical damage is believed to play a major role in aging. Antioxidants are stable molecules that can neutralize free radicals. Some antioxidants are found in the foods we eat, particularly in fruits and vegetables, and some antioxidants are manufactured by the body. Most medical experts recommend that we increase our consumption of foods containing antioxidants. Polyphenols are a particularly powerful group of antioxidants that provide protection against free- radical damage to cellular DNA and mitochondria. They have a very high capacity to neutralize free radicals and have been studied for a number of longevity health benefits. Reducing oxidative stress to cellular DNA and other important cell structures supports healthy cell proliferation, function, and lifespan. THE dTERRA LIFELONG VITALITY PACK\u00ae provides a concentrated source of powerful antioxidants.ALPHA CRS +\u00ae CELLULAR VITALITY COMPLEX POLYPHENOLS: A class of molecules that provide numerous longevity benefits including powerful activity against oxidative stress as well as protection from free-radical damage for critical cell structures, DNA, and mitochondria. FREE RADICALS: Unstable molecules that can start a damaging chain reaction of cellular oxidation contributing to unhealthy aging. DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid in cells that contains the genetic instructions for cell proliferation, specialized function, and lifespan. It is through the DNA that the instructions for life are stored and passed to new cells that make up tissues, organs, systems, and organisms. Disruption of normal DNA function can result in sub-optimal health. Alpha CRS+ Cellular Vitality Complex contains powerful polyphenols that protect cells from free radicals that can damage cellular DNA, mitochondria, and other critical cell structures.

When cells are under stress, especially oxidative stress, they respond defensively to reduce the stressor. This is an important and normal function of the body's immune system, which helps protect against threats to cellular health. Free-radical damage to critical cell structures can trigger a defensive response that, if left unchecked, can lead to a chronic state of defensive readiness and can have long-term health consequences. The dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae helps to supplement a diet with dietary antioxidants that support lowering oxidative stress, neutralize damaging free radicals, interfere with the generation of free radicals, and regenerate antioxidants in the body. The program also supplies essential fatty acids that the human body is not able to produce, while promoting optimum well-being of multiple organ systems. The program was formulated with a blend of CPTG\u00ae essential oils that demonstrate activity against oxidative stress in cells. OXIDATION CELLULAR STRESS CELLULAR AGINGAcute cellular damage can trigger a defensive response in cells. Cells, tissues, and organs become more prone to oxidative stressors.Damaged cells can lead to unhealthy aging.Free radicals can damage cellular DNA, mitochondria, and other critical cell structures. 4 3 1 2INCREASE YOUR ENERGY AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL All energy for life is produced in tiny cellular structures called mitochondria in which food molecules and oxygen are combined to produce chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). As we age, the number of mitochondria per cell and their output efficiency can decline, resulting in decreased vitality and energy. Compromised mitochondria can also release more toxic exhaust in the form of free-radical molecules, which can further damage mitochondria, DNA, and other critical cell structures. Less efficient production of energy in cells can result in a decrease of physical performance and mental energy. Increasing our dietary consumption of foods rich in antioxidants, particularly polyphenols, can help protect mitochondria and other cell structures from free-radical byproducts of energy production in cells. Additionally, supplementing our diets with nutritional co-factors of energy production in mitochondria can support healthy production of cellular energy. The dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae includes these antioxidant and energy cofactors . Acetyl-L-Carnitine: Helps shuttle fatty acids into mitochondria for energy production Alpha Lipoic Acid: Supports the production of ATP and acts as a powerful antioxidant in mitochondria Coenzyme Q10: Important coenzyme for Quercetin: Provides powerful polyphenol antioxidant protection in mitochondria and other cell structures Resveratrol: Polyphenol found in red wine; supports healthy mitochonodrial biogenesis Vitamins and Minerals: Essential cofactors of energy production in cells Essential Fatty Acids: Required for cell growth; supports healthy cellular function MITOCHONDRIA : Sometimes described as micro power plants in cells, mitochondria produce the energy chemical adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that powers all cellular activity for life. Cellular mitochondria also play critical roles in other cell functions, including intracellular signaling, cellular differentiation, growth, and apoptosis. Mitochondrial energy functions can decrease with age or increased exposure to oxidative stressors. These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Vitamins and minerals are essential cofactors of growth, energy production, and cellular immune function. They are classified as \"essential\" because they cannot be produced in the body in sufficient quantities to sustain life and healthy functioning of body systems. Essential vitamins and minerals must be obtained from food, yet our modern diets are often deficient in adequate amounts of the variety of vitamins and minerals necessary for optimal health and wellness. There are more and more health concerns with the lack of nutrients in the foods we eat because we are so reliant on processed and convenience foods. Microplex VMz has been carefully formulated to be taken with xEO Mega\u00ae in order to provide the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and omega fatty acids that we need to add to a well-balanced diet for optimum health. Vegan Microplex VMz provides the same benefits as Microplex sourced from vegan-friendly sources. COMPLEX Balanced blend of vitamins: Includes antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E; an energy complex of B vitamins; and natural vitamin D 3. Whole-Food and Enzyme Blends: Contains a blend of whole food ingredients to boost everyday nutrient intake: kale, dandelion, broccoli, cabbage, spinach, etc. Eight different enzymes were added to aid in digestion and help with the absorption have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

These essential oils complement the formulations of the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae products while also contributing their own healthful benefits. Essential oils are aromatic compounds found naturally in plants. In nature, these compounds help protect the plant. With modern trends moving more toward natural and holistic approaches to self care and wellness, essential oils are proving to be a viable and efficacious addition to any health-care program. Essential oils are easily implemented. They can be diffused aromatically, applied topically, and even\u2014as in the case of the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack \u00ae products \u2014taken internally to aid in digestion and to support vitality and well being. Not only is it important to ensure proper use of essential oils, it is also vital that oils not be adulterated or diluted. Many other oils on the market contain fillers or artificial ingredients to either lower the price or increase the volume yielded by the source. All dTERRA essential oils undergo the CPTG Certified Pure Tested Grade quality control protocol. This protocol consists of a series of tests for any contaminants, such as heavy metals or other chemical residues, resulting in an essential oil that is guaranteed to be just as nature intended.
