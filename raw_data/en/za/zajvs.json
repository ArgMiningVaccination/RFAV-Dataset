Sources of data: Selected textbooks and articles on the subject of AD. Areas of agreement: The principles of AD make no sense from a scientific perspective and there is no clinical evidence to support them. Areas of controversy: The promotion of AD treatments provides income for some entrepreneurs but has the potential to cause harm to patients and consumers. Growing points: In alternative medicine, simplistic but incorrect concepts such as AD abound. AREAS TIMELY FOR RESEARCH: All therapeutic claims should be scientifically tested before being advertised-and AD cannot be an exception.
