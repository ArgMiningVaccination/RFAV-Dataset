HBOT is a course of treatment used for various conditions and illnesses, including diabetic ulcers and other non-healing wounds. While patients recline comfortably inside a chamber, pure oxygen is administered at an atmospheric pressure two to three times higher than normal pressure. As the patient breathes normally, pressure forces pure oxygen into the bloodstream. This process increases the oxygen delivery to all tissues, improves the ability of the white blood cells to kill bacteria and helps boost the body's own natural healing process. Throughout the treatment session, patients can watch television or just relax. Physician supervision is provided during all treatments, to ensure the highest quality of care. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy is recognized as a successful adjunctive treatment by the American Medical Association, Medicare, and most commercial insurers. Individuals with the following conditions may benefit from wound care and hyperbaric oxygen therapy: - Diabetic Leg and Foot Wounds - Chronic Bone Infection - Acute arterial insufficiency - Radiation related problems for cancer patients - Necrotizing Infections - Gas Gangrene - Carbon Monoxide Poisoning - Crush Injuries - Other non-healing wounds [What role does hyperbaric oxygen therapy play in treating breast cancer patients?](/documents/community-medical-center-/Hyperbaric-Oxygen-Breast-Cancer-Awareness-CMC.pdf) (PDF) "}
