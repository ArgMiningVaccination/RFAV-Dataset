About Homeopathic Industry in India Before exploring how to become a pharmacist, let's examine the market in India. India is among the 66 WHO-identified countries where Homeopathy is practiced and its popularity is growing by the day. The market is growing at 25% annually in India and by conservative estimate is around 85 billion in 2014. What makes the Homeopathy market impressive is the fact that 100 million Indians solely depend on Homeopathy. This number is expected to go up to 160 million in a few years with greater awareness and choices made available. This market is currently serviced by 500,000 registered homeopaths and 20,000 more are being added every year. Supporting this ecosystem are 185 homeopathic colleges in the country, and 11,000 homeopathic hospital beds. By becoming a pharmacist you sit on a huge demand generated by this ecosystem. Industry body ASSOCHAM recently conducted a survey on 'Homeopathy adoption' in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, and other satellite towns like Chandigarh, Hyderabad, and Lucknow. It randomly surveyed 5000 patients and found that over 55 percent preferred Homeopathy as the treatment is safer and physiologically satisfactory with no side effects. World Health Organization (WHO) has also independently assessed and concluded that homeopathy is the second largest system of medicine in the world. As per WHO the annual turnover of homeopathic medicines accounts for Rs 8,400 crore globally and is expected to touch Rs 52,000 crore by 2017.

Other major brands with pan India presence and good market standing are Dr. Vashisht, Adel, Fourrts, BBP, Allen, Bhargava, Doliosis, Wheezal, Haslab, etc.. All the above companies follow General Manufacturing Practices (GMP standards) and a few among them also follow international standards like Pharm Betro and PIC. While most companies follow criteria outlined in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia (HAB) and Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia India (HPI), some also follow German Pharmacopeia (DAB), European Pharmacopeia (Ph. Eur), United States Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia (HPUS) in their manufacturing guidelines. Homeopathy Trade Policies and Practices: You need to have a good understanding of the major brands (as stated above) and the general trade practices and norms followed by the Homeopathic companies as a first step towards becoming a pharmacist. This would be relevant if you are dealing directly with companies. Some essential guidelines are as follows - The minimum order value (i.e., the order you place with the company at any given point in time) is between Rs.10000 - Rs.30,000. Order to supply turnaround time is anywhere between 15 - 30 days and you will have to make Inventory plans in advance. Freight may be paid by the company based on order value or general understanding. - Incentives (or discounts ) are provided based on sales performance linked to annual turnover, and quarterly and annual growth achieved for the financial year. Additionally, if you pay upfront money for your order you may be entitled to Cash Discount between 2%-3%. The incentive payment is linked to the timely submission of 'C' forms (tax filing statements with tax authorities). - Trade credit is extended by companies based on your track record. You can enjoy between 30 -45 days credit facility but do not expect this in your first transaction as companies expect you to pay in advance. On the flip side, if you do not pay outstanding bills within the stipulated period, you will be penalized with interest charges @ 12% - 15% on the outstanding amount. In the worst-case scenario, they may blacklist and stop any future dealings. - Claims regarding expiry, breakage, leakage or evaporation: In the course of business dealing with the companies you may come across products received in damaged or defective conditions. Generally, companies allow such claims provided you intimate them on a timely basis and return the goods to their warehouses promptly.
