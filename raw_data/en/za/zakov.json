One option is to stop using them altogether, which can work in [some cases](http://www.thankyourbody.com/oil-cleansing-method/). Most of the time, though, you're using these beauty and personal care products for a reason and don't want to give them up. Another option is to buy products from [trustworthy companies](https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/savvy-minerals-by-young-living) that use natural ingredients in place of [synthetic chemicals](/blog-xenoestrogens/). These products can sometimes be a little more expensive than their chemical-laden counterparts (but not always!) and you'll need to keep your long-term health goals in mind when adjusting your budget to accommodate your dedication to a natural lifestyle. However, there is one more option, one that we've been posting more about on our [Pinterest boards](http://pinterest.com/beachcomacu) because we've recently been more motivated to explore it. It's not as time-consuming as we originally thought and can actually save you money...and it's the best way to know exactly what you're putting on your body. Did you ever do simple experiments in school? Your teacher probably wrote a recipe on the board and then you would add the random ingredients listed and be amazed that they combined to make something you recognized. Back in school it was probably fun, but for whatever reason the idea of making products from scratch turns many people off nowadays. It might be that we're shorter on time now that we're older or have gotten used to the convenience of buying exactly what we need when we need it, but something special happens when we make a product ourselves. Our curiosity ignites, we challenge our creativity, and we feel a sense of accomplishment knowing that we finished a unique project. What we're leading up to is: For whatever reason, we never had any desire to make personal care products at home, but now that we've started, we're hooked! This blog post isn't meant to give you new recipes - we're not going to reinvent the wheel here because there are TONS readily available online - but rather inspire you to find and try your own. When you run out of [moisturizer](https://draxe.com/diy-face-moisturizer/), make a batch at home to replace it. If you happen upon on [article](https://www.self.com/story/how-to-get-rid-of-dark-undereye-circles) describing the benefits of topical caffeine for dark circles, search for a [DIY recipe](https://realfoodrn.com/diy-caffeine-eye-serum/). Did you realize your \"beachy waves\" hairspray costs more than its worth? Try a [salt spray](https://wellnessmama.com/5054/beach-waves-hair-spray/). The possibilities are endless! Does this sound like too much work or too \"hippyish\"? Trust us, we've been there. If you're not ready for it, just [research](http://ewg.org/skindeep) the brands you use and make healthy choices when it comes to where you get your personal care products. However, if you're looking for an easy way to save money or are the least bit curious about becoming a do-it-yourself-er, then start small. Pick an easy recipe that requires ingredients that you either already have or can easily get. (Toothpaste only requires hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and [essential oils](/blog-essential-oils/)!) Many natural products don't take that much time to make, and you can customize recipes to meet your specific needs once you get the hang of them. How many store-bought products offer you that?
