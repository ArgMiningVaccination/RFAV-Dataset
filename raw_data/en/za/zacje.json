The country started its investigationafter native Sylvia Millecam, an actress and comedienne, died from breast cancerin 2001 after receiving unfounded methods of treatment. For two years, Millecam, 45, was treated by 28 differentpractitioners and institutions using only alternative treatments, including salttherapy and cell-specific treatment. She was told on at least twooccasions that she did not have cancer but a bacterial infection, Sheldon wrote. So far, six alternative practitioners have been referred tothe countrys judicial system, and three doctors are being investigated forpossible disciplinary action. The Dutch inspectorate wants to change the law toensure greater supervision of alternative practitioners, and for all suchpractitioners to be registered and not be allowed to make medical diagnoses.
