Dr John Briffa offers a natural alternative.", "sitename": "The Guardian", "date": "2004-08-01", "cleaned_text": "Last week, my column focused on nutritionally oriented alternatives to headache-alleviating analgesics such as aspirin. However, even if more of us eschew aspirin for our thumping heads, I doubt whether this will put a dent in sales. Aspirin's ability to thin the blood has led to its use in preventing heart attacks and strokes. But dosing up on a daily aspirin is not for everyone. One study found that treatment with aspirin can worsen the condition of those suffering from weakened heart function (heart failure). The study's lead author suggested that doctors might have a change of heart regarding the use of aspirin in cardiac failure. This started me thinking about how the contents of the natural medicine chest could alleviate the symptoms of heart failure. The compromised cardiac function typical of this condition leads to an under-supply of blood to the tissues, which may cause fatigue and reduce one's capacity for exercise. Heart failure can also cause fluid to accumulate, particularly in the lungs and legs. Fortunately, those affected by heart failure may be helped by specific nutrients that feed the heart. One of the most important is magnesium, a mineral that helps maintain muscular function. Individuals with heart failure tend to have lower than normal levels of magnesium. Nuts are an excellent source, though supplementation provides a practical and relatively economical way to get therapeutic levels into the system. For those with heart failure, I recommend long-term supplementation with 400-500mg of magnesium a day. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) also improves heart function. It is essential for producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the basic unit of energy in the body. CoQ10 seems to be important for producing energy in muscular tissues including the heart, and supplementation helps relieve the symptoms of heart failure. CoQ10 is best absorbed into the body when dissolved in oil (as found in soft gelatine capsules). Heart function may be enhanced by herbal remedies, too. Hawthorn (Crataegus oxyacantha) is believed to increase blood flow to the heart and increase its ability to deliver blood to the tissues. Those taking prescription medications for heart failure should consult their doctor before taking this herb, though it is regarded as very safe, even when taken in the long term. Experience shows that natural remedies have considerable capacity to pump up the power of the heart. Dear John I developed a stye some weeks ago that will not go. My doctor has referred me to the eye clinic at the local hospital for surgical treatment. Do you know anything I might be able to do to treat this problem naturally? Lester Gillies A stye is caused by infection of a gland at the base of one or more eyelashes. It causes a lump at the margin of the eyelid that is usually inflamed and painful. Most styes are caused by bacteria of the Staphylococcus type. Warm compresses may help draw the infection to the surface. Soak some cotton wool in warm water and place over your closed eye for a few minutes, several times each day. It might also help you to apply neat tea tree oil (with a cotton bud) to the affected area two or three times a day. Be careful not to get the oil into your eye, as this may sting. Finally, if your stye does begin to discharge, try supplements of zinc and vitamin C, which are believed to help the immune system clear infection and assist skin healing. Take 30mg of zinc each day, along with 1g of vitamin C two or three times a day, for two weeks. Nutrition news Mounting evidence suggests that increased risk of heart disease may be associated with an elevated level of a variety of substances in the bloodstream including C reactive protein, or CRP (which promotes inflammation), fibrinogen (which enhances blood clotting) and homocysteine (believed to damage the inside of arteries and promote the laying down of fatty deposits here). In a recent study published in the Journal of the American Journal of Cardiology, scientists assessed the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and the levels of these substances in individuals living in Greece. Those individuals eating a Mediterranean diet (one that is rich in foods such as fruit, vegetables, beans, fish, olive oil and nuts) were found to have generally lower levels of CRP, fibrinogen and homocysteine compared to those whose diet was less typical for the region. This study suggests that eating a Mediterranean diet helps to lower risk of heart disease by modulating the level of several bodily substances implicated in this condition. "}
