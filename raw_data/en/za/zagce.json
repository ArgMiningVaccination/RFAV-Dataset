This includes supporting people with MS and their healthcare providers in considering options, ensuring that scientifically rigorous research explores unanswered questions, and advocating for affordable access and equity of healthcare. We are committed to our mission: We will cure MS while empowering people affected by MS to live their best lives .\" AHSCT is a type of bone marrow transplantation that attempts to reset the immune system, which is responsible for damaging the brain and spinal cord in MS. The stem cells used during the procedure are 'autologous' meaning they are derived from your own body. It is a one-time procedure that can significantly reduce and potentially eliminate disease activity in some people. There are risks including serious infections associated with the treatment that require follow up and supportive care to reduce them. Since MS is different for each person, the individual should discuss treatment options with their MS specialist or physician to determine what is best for their MS. Studies show aHSCT may be a safe and effective treatment in people who: - have relapsing-remitting MS - are less than 50 years of age - have had MS for less than 10 years - have breakthrough disease activity (new inflammatory lesions on MRI and/or relapses) despite treatment with a high-efficacy DMT or are unable to take a high-efficacy DMT Factors including older age, greater disability and certain health conditions (for example, heart or lung disease) are associated with increased risk of life-threatening side effects following aHSCT. It is crucial that aHSCT is performed at a treatment location that is accredited by the [Foundation for Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT). ](https://accredited.factwebsite.org/?_sft_country=usa&_sft_clinical=hematopoietic-progenitor-cell-transplantation&_sft_transplant-types=adult-autologous&_sft_collection=marrow-cellular-therapy-product) An MS specialist can assist with selecting a treatment center for care during and after aHSCT.

To learn more about Resources: In 2020, the [National Medical Advisory Committee](https://nms2cdn.azureedge.net/cmssite/nationalmssociety/media/msnationalfiles/professionals/national-medical-advisory-committee-2020-2021.pdf) of the National MS Society released an article reviewing evidence related to the optimal use of aHSCT for specific people with MS, which was published in JAMA Neurology ( [online October 26, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.4025) ). There is currently one clinical trial on aHSCT in MS in the United States. The [BEAT-MS clinical trial](/About-the-Society/News/MS-Trial-Alert-Investigators-Recruiting-Nationwide) is randomly assigning eligible participants to undergo aHSCT or receive certain DMTs to compare the costs, safety and effectiveness of the two treatments.
