Treatment gaps have been described, but a worldwide evaluation is lacking. We estimated, among individuals with a 12-month DSM-IV (where DSM is Diagnostic Statistical Manual) anxiety disorder in 21 coun- tries, the proportion who (i) perceived a need for treatment; (ii) received any treatment; and (iii) received possibly adequate treatment. Methods: Data from 23 community surveys in 21 countries of the World Mental Health (WMH) surveys. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed (WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview, CIDI 3.0). DSM-IV included posttraumatic stress disorder among anxiety disorders, while it is not considered so in the DSM-5. We asked if, in the previous 12 months, respondents felt they needed professional treatment and if they obtained professional treatment (special- ized/general medical, complementary alternative medical, or nonmedical professional) for \"prob- lems with emotions, nerves, mental health, or use of alcohol or drugs.\" Possibly adequate treat- ment was defined as receiving pharmacotherapy (1 +months of medication and 4 +visits to a med- ical doctor) or psychotherapy, complementary alternative medicine or nonmedical care (8 +visits). Results: Of 51,547 DSM-IV anxiety disor- der, 27.6% of whom received any treatment, and only 9.8% received possibly adequate treatment. Of those with 12-month anxiety only 41.3% perceived a need for care. Lower treatment levels were found for lower income countries. Conclusions: Low levels of service use and a high proportion of those receiving services not meeting adequacy standards for anxiety disorders exist worldwide. Results suggest the need for improving recognition of anxiety disorders and the quality of treatment. KEYWORDS adequate treatment, anxiety disorders, health services, perceived need for care, surveys 1 INTRODUCTION Anxiety disorders are frequent (lifetime prevalence ranging between 5 and 25% of the population, and a 12-month prevalence rangingbetween 3.3 and 20.4%, worldwide) (Kessler et al., 2009). When adjusted for methodological differences, current (3-month) prevalence is estimated at 7.3% worldwide (4.8-10.9%), ranging from 5.3% (3.5- 8.1%) in African settings to 10.4% (7.0-15.5%) in Euro/Anglo settings (Baxter, Scott, Vos, & Whiteford, 2013). Some anxiety disorders, in par- ticular the phobias, social anxiety, and separation anxiety, have very early age of onset (median ages in the range of 5-10 years of age; Kessler et al., 2009), whereas others (generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) tend to have a later age-of-onset distributions (median 24-50), with much wider cross-national variation.ALONSO ET AL . 197 Because of their relatively high prevalence, their tendency toward chronicity and substantial comorbidity, anxiety disorders are associ- ated disability (Harter, Conway, & Merikangas, 2003; Saha, Stedman, Scott, & McGrath, 2013). Anxiety disorders cause 10.4% of the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost due to neu- rological, mental, substance use disorders and account for 1.1% of the global burden of disease worldwide, that is, a total of 26,800,000 DALYs worldwide (Whiteford, Ferrari, Degenhardt, Feigin, & Vos, 2015). Anxiety disorders are also very costly. It has been estimated that the total costs of anxiety disorders were \u20ac74.4 billion for 30 European EU countries in 2010 (Gustavsson et al., 2011). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reup- take inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective treatments for anxiety disorders (Hoffman & Smits, 2008; Koen & Stein, 2011). Therefore anxiety disor- ders are among the conditions that have been identified by the WHO for scaling up interventions for mental disorders (Chisholm et al., 2016; World Health Organization (WHO), 2017). Yet a number of barriers limit the effective treatment of anxiety disorders. First, they are often unrecognized. Recognition rates in primary care may be lower than 50% (Culpepper, 2003). Using standardized case detection methods has been recommended to improve their recognition in primary set- tings (Culpepper, 2003; Olariu et al., 2015). Structural and health sys- tem weaknesses, including scarce mental health and human services (WHO, 2010) as well as lack of awareness and costs of treatment (Ho, Hunt, & Li, 2008) and stigma perceived by the people who experience anxiety disorders, further limit their treatment (Clement et al., 2015). All these factors result in a low use of health services for anxiety disorders. Even in high income countries, only about a third of individ- uals with anxiety disorders receive any treatment (Alonso et al., 2004; Hamalainen, Isometsa, Sihvo, & Pirkola, 2008), with the exception of the United States, where treatment rates are considerably higher (Olson, Marcus, Wan, & Geissler, 2004). Importantly, the proportion of patients with anxiety disorders who receive adequate treatment is still much lower (Kasteenpohja et al., 2016; Roberge et al., 2015), even in the United States, with less than 15% of people with diagnosed anxiety receiving treatment that conforms with evidence-based recommenda- tions (Kasteenpohja et al., 2016; Roberge et al., 2015). The treatment gap for anxiety seems to be even wider in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Gureje et al., 2008), which is consistent with reports for major depressive disorders (MDDs) (Thornicroft et al., 2017), and for overall mental disorders (Wang et al., 2007a). In addition, little is known about the access to treatment for anxiety disorders and its ade- quacy in LMICs. Also different studies have used different definitions of adequate treatment. For minimally adequate pharmacotherapy, any or all of the following criteria have been considered: type, dosage, dura- tion, plus the number of consultations. For minimally adequate psy- chotherapy, the number of sessions (either 8 or 12) and sometimes the type of therapy (i.e., cognitive behavioral treatment by the same mental health professional) have been proposed (Roberge et al., 2015). The World Mental Health (WMH) surveys, including information on anxiety disorders and related treatment across 21 diverse coun- tries worldwide, provide an unprecedented opportunity to examine receipt of treatment for anxiety disorders. On one hand, countries from the whole spectrum of income and geographical variation havebeen included. On the other, common assessment methods and defi- nitions have been used. The specific objectives of this study were to estimate, among individuals with a 12-month DSM-IV (where DSM is Diagnostic Statistical Manual) anxiety disorder: (i) the proportion who perceived a need for treatment; (ii) the proportion of those who received any treatment; and (iii) the proportion who received possibly adequate treatment. We also examined the influence of comorbidity on perceived need for treatment and whether the latter varied across countries. It is important to note that in the current DSM5 PTSD is no longer considered an anxiety disorder (as it was in the previous version, the DSM-IV). PTSD is currently considered a different type of disorder and it has been moved to a separate chapter (Trauma and Stress-Related Disorders, DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The reader should be aware that the WMH surveys used the DSM-IV clas- sification and therefore we included PTSD among anxiety disorders. 2 METHODS 2.1 Sample Data came from 23 community epidemiological surveys administered in 21 countries as part of the WMH surveys (Kessler & Ustun, 2004). These included 12 surveys carried out in high-income countries, six surveys in upper-middle-income countries, and six in low- or lower- middle-income countries (see Table 1). The majority of surveys were based on nationally representative household samples. Three were representative of urban areas in their countries (Colombia, Mexico, and Peru). Three were representative of selected regions in their coun- tries (Japan, Nigeria, and Murcia, Spain). Four were representative of selected Metropolitan Areas (Sao Paulo, Brazil; Medellin, Colom- bia; and Beijing-Shanghai and Shenzhen in the People 's Republic of China (PRC)). Trained lay interviewers conducted face-to-face inter- views with respondents, aged 18 years and over. The interviews took place within the households of the respondents. To reduce respon- dent burden, the interview was divided into two parts. Part I assessed core mental disorders and was administered to all respondents. Part II, which assessed additional disorders and correlates, was administered to all Part I respondents who met lifetime criteria for any disorder plus a probability subsample of other Part I respondents. Part II data, the focus of this report, were weighted by the inverse of their probabili- ties of selection into Part II and additionally weighted to adjust sam- ples to match population distributions on the cross-classification of key sociodemographic and geographic variables. Further details about WMH sampling and weighting are available elsewhere (Heeringa et al., 2008). Response rates ranged between 45.9 and 97.2% and had a weighted average of 70.1% across all surveys. 2.2 Measures 2.2.1 Mental disorders Mental disorders were assessed using the WHO Composite Inter- national Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Version 3.0, a fully structured interview generating lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates.198 ALONSO ET AL .

No substitution was allowed when the originally sampled household resident co uld not be interviewed. These household samples were selected from Census area data in all countries other than France (where telephone directories were used to select households) and the Netherlands (where postal registries were used to select households). dArgentina, Brazil, Colombia-Medellin, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Romania, and Spain-Murcia did not have an age restricted Part 2 sample. All other countr ies, with the exception of Nigeria and PRC (B-WMH; S-WMH), (which were age restricted to 39) were age restricted to 44. eThe response rate is calculated as the ratio of the number of households in which an interview was completed to the number of households originally sampled, excluding from the denominator households known not to be eligible either because of being vacant at the time of initial contact or because th e residents were unable to speak the designated languages of the survey. The weighted average response rate is 71.3%. fPeople 's Republic of China. gColombia moved from the \"lower and lower-middle income\" to the \"upper-middle income\" category between 2003 (when the Colombian National Study of Mental Health was conducted) and 2010 (when the Medellin Mental Health Household Study was conducted), hence Colombia 's appearance in both income categories.

Disorders considered in this paper are based on the DSM-IV and include 12-month anxiety (agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, PTSD, social phobia, specific phobia, adult separation anxiety disorder). The WMH CIDI interview translation, backtranslation, and har- monization protocol required culturally competent bilingual cliniciansto review, modify, and approve key phrases describing symptoms (Harkness et al., 2008). Blinded clinical reappraisal interviews with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (First, Spitzer, Gib- bon, & Williams, 2002) were carried out in four countries. Good concordance was found with diagnoses based on the CIDI (Haro et al., 2006).200 ALONSO ET AL . 2.2.2 12-month Mental Health Service use Within disorder-specific sections of the survey, respondents were asked whether or not they ever talked to a medical doctor or other professional (including psychologists, counselors, spiritual advisors, herbalists, acupuncturists, and other healing professionals), and if they ever have, they were asked if they received treatment in the last 12 months. Additionally, in the services section of the survey, respondents were asked if they ever in their lifetime went to see any professional on a provided list for problems with emotions, nerves, or use of alcohol or drugs. This list included psychiatrists, general practitioners or family doctors, any other medical doctors, psychologists, social workers, counselors, any other mental health professionals (such as psychotherapists or mental health nurses), nurses, occupational therapists, or other health professionals, religious or spiritual advisors, or any other healers (like herbalists, chiropractors, or spiritualists). If the respondent reported ever seeing a given professional from the list, he or she was further probed if the given professional was seen in the past 12 months, and how many visits occurred in the past 12 months. In addition, respondents were asked about the number of self-help groups they attended in the past 12 months. Those having responded \"yes\" to seeing a professional or attend- ing a self-help group in the past 12 months in either the disorder- specific survey section or the services section were considered having received any 12-month treatment. Any treatment in the past 12 months was further classified as (1) specialist mental health treat- ment (psychiatrist, psychologist, other mental health professional in any setting, social worker or counselor in a mental health specialist treatment setting, used a mental health hotline); (2) general medi- cal treatment (primary care doctor, or other medical doctor, or other healthcare professional seen in a general medical setting); (3) comple- mentary alternative medicine (CAM) (any other type of healer such as chiropractors or participation in self-help groups); or (4) nonmedi- cal treatment provider (religious or spiritual advisor, social worker, or counselor in any setting other than specialist mental health) for a men- tal health problem. It is important to note that social workers or counselors in the non- medical treatment group only refer to those working outside of the health services settings. Those working in a specialized or a primary care setting were included in their respective categories (specialized or primary care). We also asked participants to report whether they felt they needed professional treatment for their mental health problems. Those responding yes and those reporting using mental health ser- vices in the previous 12 months were considered to perceive a need for health care. 2.2.3 Socioeconomic characteristics To assess educational attainment, respondents were asked how many years of education they completed. As educational levels and systems varied across countries, responses were divided into four groups based on country-specific distributions. Annual family income was classified into quartiles as related to within-country median values of income per family member before taxes.2.3 Analysis The analyses reported here focus on respondents who met DSM-IV criteria for any anxiety disorder at some time in the 12 months before interview. The definition used for possibly adequate treatment was that of Wang et al. (2007a), and Thornicroft et al. (2017), and was based on evidence-based guidelines(Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), 1993; American Psychiatric Association, 2006; Lehman & Steinwachs, 1998) that consisted of receiving either pharmacotherapy (the respondent had to report having taken medi- cation for at least 1 month as well as having visited a medical doctor at least four times, both in the previous 12 months for their mental health problems, as we assume that for pharmacotherapy treatment supervision and control of medication is required) or psychotherapy or CAM (reporting 8 +visits with any professional including religious or spiritual advisor, social worker, or counselor). Our decision to use four or more physician visits alongside pharmacotherapy was based on the fact that for medication assessment, initiation, and monitoring, four or more visits are generally recommended during the acute and con- tinuation phases of treatment. We required at least eight sessions for psychotherapy based on the fact that clinical trials showing efficacy have generally included eight or more visits. Because adequacy defini- tions used in our study did not distinguish between CAM and nonmed- ical sector, our analyses combine these two categories. We considered visits to all sectors for the analysis of possibly adequate treatment, since small numbers preclude categorization by service sector. 2.4 Statistical analyses Survey sampling weights were applied in all analyses so that respon- dents reflected nationally representative samples in terms of sociode- mographic characteristics within each country. Standard errors were estimated using the Taylor series linearization method implemented in the SAS software survey procedures to adjust weighting and clus- tering. To test for differences between high-income, upper-middle- income, and lower-middle- and low-income country groups, in relation to the key variables of interest related to the aims of the paper, chi- square tests were applied. Statistical significance was evaluated using two-sided .05 level tests. 3 RESULTS The characteristics of the study sample and survey response rates are presented in Table 1. In total, 17 nationally representative surveys and six large regionally representative samples were analyzed, with a total of 51,547 Part II respondents (12,285 from low-, 12,598 from middle- upper-, and 26,664 from high-income countries). The overall weighted response rate was 71.3%. As shown in Table 2 (first column), a total of 9.8% of respondents met criteria for at least one anxiety disorder in the 12 months prior to the interview. Prevalence figures were similar for high-income (10.3%) and upper-middle-income (10.6%) countries, but lower for countries (7.9%).

A full account of the prevalence of anxiety disorders in the WMH surveys may be found in previous publications (Demytte- naere et al., 2004; Kessler & Ustun, 2008). Because our study was based on a community dwelling popula- tion, we could estimate the proportion of all the individuals meet- ing DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for any anxiety disorders in the over- all population who received any treatment (Table 2, column 2). This was just over a quarter (27.6%, ranging from 36.3% in high-income countries to 13.1% in low/middle-income countries). The proportion of respondents with an anxiety disorder who received possibly ade- quate treatment was 9.8% (ranging from 13.8% in high-income to 2.3% in low/middle-income countries) (Table 2, column 3). On average, less than half (41.3%) of the individuals with anxiety disorders reported a need for treatment (Table 2, column 4). Self- perception of need for treatment was higher in high-income coun- tries (48%) with a clear gradient across country types, with a mini- mum of 28.5% in lower-middle-income countries. Two thirds (66.8%) of individuals with an anxiety disorder who perceived a need for care received any treatment in the previous year (Table 2, column 5). This proportion showed a negative gradient by country income: 75.0% used services in high-income countries versus 46.1% in lower-middle- income countries. Perception of need for treatment was highest in Israel, the United States, and Peru, whereas participants in Nigeria, Iraq, and Lebanon had the lowest perception of need. In Nigeria, the region of Murcia in Spain and Italy more than 90% of those who per- ceived a need for care received some treatment, whereas less than 38% of those living in Lebanon, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico who perceived a need for care received any treatment. Table 3 presents similar data to those in Table 2, but stratified by two groups: (1) individuals with anxiety disorders without other comorbid mental disorders (Table 3, upper section) and (2) those with an anxi- ety disorder who also had a comorbid mental disorders (Table 3, lower section). Among those without comorbidity, perception of need for treatment was considerably lower than among those with comorbidity (overall, 26.3 vs. 55.2%, P<.001), Service use among those with a per- ception of need, however, was similar among those without and those with mental comorbidity (62.7 and 68.6%, respectively). Among indi- viduals who perceived a need for help, the proportion receiving possi- bly adequate treatment varied among those without comorbidity and those with comorbidity (20.5 and 34.5%, respectively, P<.001). These trends are present in all country income level groups. For ease of presentation, statistical testing of results for Tables 2 and 3 are presented in supplementary Tables S1 (test results for Table 2) and S2 (test results for Table 3). Table S1 shows that statistical tests of comparisons across all country surveys and comparisons across the income groups were all significant in both tables; differ- ences within high-income countries were all significant for all analyses; tests for within-group comparisons of other country income groups were also significant, with the exception of within-group comparisons of lower/lower-middle-income countries for any treatment (column 2, Table S1); and for the same comparison within upper-middle-incomecountries for possibly adequate treatment among those perceiving need of treatment (column 3, Table S1). Table S2 indicated that the vast majority of differences between comorbid and noncomorbid anxiety are statistically significant, with exceptions confined to four cells with low numbers of observations. 4 DISCUSSION A major finding of this study is that across 21 countries worldwide, only about a fourth (27.6%) of individuals meeting criteria of a 12- month DSM-IV anxiety disorder have received any treatment in the previous year. One important determinant of this treatment gap is that individuals do not perceive a need for treatment (less than half of individuals with a 12-month anxiety disorder reported a need for treatment). But other barriers may also exist, as only about two thirds of those who perceived a need for treatment actually received it. A second major finding is that the quality of treatment received by individuals with anxiety disorders seems suboptimal, since only about a third of treated cases met the criteria for our definition of possibly adequate treatment. Thus, fewer than one in 10 individu- als with anxiety disorders received possibly adequate treatment in a given year. The treatment gap was much wider for less wealthy coun- tries. Individuals with comorbid mental disorders had a higher per- ception of need for care, and a higher likelihood of receiving possibly adequate treatment. Our results are consistent with previous stud- ies in primary care settings, and with reports of undertreatment of depression disorders and common mental disorders in general (Thor- nicroft et al., 2017). The findings provide a global perspective on the treatment gap for anxiety disorders and indicate a need to improve access to care in all countries, in particular in low/middle-income countries. These results must be considered in the light of several study limitations. First, diagnoses of anxiety disorders were based on the CIDI 3.0. Although acceptable agreement between CIDI diagnoses and diagnoses made during blind clinical reinterviews (Haro et al., 2006) was achieved, these studies were conducted almost exclusively in high-income countries. It remains possible that the accuracy of CIDI anxiety diagnoses could vary in lower-income countries. Sec- ond we used the DSM-IV classification that considered PTSD an anx- iety disorder. There is a need to further evaluate the anxiety treat- ment gap using DSM-5 criteria. Third, we relied on self-reported data for use of services, and we were not able to corroborate responses with administrative records. Accuracy of self-reported use of ser- vices may differ across sociodemographic and cultural groups and this might affect the comparisons across countries (Luck, 1996; Mann et al., 1992). Nevertheless, a number of survey methods attempted to augment recall and accurate responses, including survey commit- ment probes and exclusion of individuals failing to endorse commit- ment. Fourth, we considered those reporting using services \"for prob- lems with emotions, nerves, mental health or use of alcohol of drugs\" as receiving treatment. It may well be that the treatment received was not addressing their anxiety disorder. This might have led us toALONSO ET AL . 203 TABLE 3 Twelve-Month Prevalence of Anxiety Disorder, Perceived Need for Treatment, Receipt of Any Treatment, and Receipt of Possibly Adequate Treatment by Mental Comorbidity Status Any TreatmentPossibly Adequate TreatmentPerceived Need for TreatmentAny 12-Month TreatmentPossibly Adequate Treatment 12-Month Diagnosis of Anxiety Disorder(Among Those With Anxiety Disorder)(Among Those With Anxiety Disorder)(Among Those With Anxiety Disorder)(Among Those With Anxiety Disorder and Perceived Need)(Among Those With Perceived Need and Any High income Belgium 4.6 (1.1) 21.0 (3.8) 2.9 (2.1) 21.9 (3.8) 96.1 (.) ** 14.0 (.) ** 39 France 7.6 (1.2) 10.9 (4.2) 4.9 (3.0) 23.4 (3.2) 46.6 (17.6) 44.7 (.5) 59 Germany 5.1 (.8) 16.5 (3.8) 5.4 (2.5) 19.1 (3.6) 86.5 (3.3) 32.8 (4.4) 70 Israel 2.2 (.2) 29.2 (4.6) 5.1 (2.2) 50.5 (4.9) 57.9 (5.8) 17.4 (5.5) 93 Italy 4.2 (.6) 16.3 (3.4) 4.5 (2.2) 16.3 (3.4) 100.0 (.0) 27.3 (2.1) 69 Japan 3.2 (.4) 15.8 (2.8) 5.8 (2.7) 26.7 (4.3) 59.4 (3.8) 36.7 (.8) 88 Murcia, Spain 7.1 (.6) 38.4 (5.9) 1.9 (1.2) 41.3 (6.0) 92.9 (3.1) 4.9 (2.6) 113 Netherland 5.2 (1.0) 14.8 (5.0) 4.3 (1.9) 20.5 (4.9) 72.1 (12.2) 28.8 (7.9) 51 Portugal 11.0 (1.0) 18.5 (3.3) 3.3 (1.2) 28.1 (4.3) 65.8 (5.3) 17.9 (5.2) 187 Spain 4.2 (.9) 9.3 (1.4) 3.8 (.5) 13.0 (2.0) 71.3 (2.0) 41.1 (5.0) 69 United States 9.4 (.6) 28.9 (2.1) 8.1 (1.1) 37.7 (2.8) 76.6 (3.0) 27.9 (3.0) 515 Argentina 5.2 (.6) 20.4 (3.2) 4.6 (1.2) 35.4 (4.0) 57.5 (3.8) 22.6 (6.0) 152 Total 5.7 (.2) 22.4 (1.1) 5.3 (.5) 31.3 (1.3) 71.7 (1.9) 23.6 (1.6) 1,505 II.

On the other hand, patients might not recognize or consider themselves as hav- ing \"problems with emotions, nerves, mental health, or use of alco- hol or drugs\" and yet they could still be treated with psychotropic medication for their somatic symptoms and/or sleep issues. This bias would lead us to overestimate the level of treatment gap for anxiety disorders.Additionally, we did not consider severity of anxiety disorder, which could have allowed to estimate whether international differences in use of services are influenced by variation in severity of anxiety dis- orders. We also used a broad definition of possibly adequate treat- ment. On one hand, this definition did not include specific effec- tive psychotherapeutic techniques, such as mindfulness meditation (Vollestad, Nielsen, & Nielsen, 2012), which could have led to anALONSO ET AL . 205 underestimation of adequacy. In fact, it is difficult to determine the adequacy of CAM simply by the number of sessions. And, in relation to pharmacotherapy, we did not consider the type of medication. On the other hand, adequacy of benzodiazepines for treatment for anx- iety disorders has been questioned (Baldwin et al., 2014). Not hav- ing excluded them might have led us to overestimate the adequacy of pharmacological treatment. However, even with this inclusion our estimated coverage rates are rather low. Another limitation is that we evaluated service use over a 1-year period. This might underes- timate utilization of services in the longer run, as there is some evi- dence that individuals with persistent symptoms of common mental disorders tend to use services if followed for a longer period than one year (Baldwin et al., 2014). Also, even though the WMH surveys included a large number of respondents, for some specific subanaly- ses, the number of respondents included for some countries was small, rendering results less stable and reliable. In addition, a more detailed analysis about use of psychopharmacology and psychotherapy treat- ments was not possible due to limitations in the way information was collected. Finally, while results show that a significant proportion of individ- uals with anxiety disorders do not perceive a need for treatment, our analyses do not allow us to draw conclusions about the specific bar- riers that may be contributing to the treatment gap for anxiety disor- ders. A number of different barriers (i.e., stigma, logistical, among oth- ers) have been described (Gulliver, Griffiths, & Christensen, 2012) in the literature. We have not have analyzed them and we consider it very important to gather additional information to understand the role that different types of barriers to mental health treatment play in the anxi- ety treatment gap. Notwithstanding these limitations, an important treatment gap for anxiety disorders has been identified. This finding is consistent with previous studies, and it suggests that the treatment gap for anxiety disorders is even higher than that described for MDD (Thornicroft et al., 2017). A lower proportion of individuals with anxiety disorders perceive a need for treatment (41.3% in our study) when compared to those with depression (56.7% in Thornicroft et al. study). Also, the proportion of those who receive treatment is lower among individu- als with anxiety disorders than among those with depression. And the average delay between onset of the disorder and seeking treatment is much longer for anxiety disorders than for MDD (Wang et al., 2007b). Finally, the proportion receiving possibly adequate treatment is also lower for those with anxiety disorders (9.8%) and considerably lower than for those with MDD (16.5%) (Thornicroft et al., 2017). Differences in the severity of symptoms may contribute to differences in utiliza- tion rates. In our study, mental disorder comorbidity shows an impor- tant association with perception of need for care. This is likely due to a higher severity of symptoms among persons with comorbid anxiety (Saris, Aghajani, van der Werff, van der Wee, & Penninx, 2017). There is also the possibility that some symptoms are not recognized as a men- tal disorder, but rather are attributed to somatic illnesses. This might be an issue for the cross-cultural validity of some diagnoses, as has been pointed out for PTSD (Hinton & Lewis-Fernandez, 2011). There is a need to research the factors and mechanisms shaping perception of need for services.In addition to lack of perceived need for treatment, other barri- ers may also play an important role. Low recognition rates for anxiety disorders have been described at the primary care level (Olariu et al., 2015). Also, the low level of perceived need for care among individu- als with anxiety disorders may be due to low levels of mental health literacy (Ho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007b). Efforts in both areas (i.e., increasing detection rates in primary care and in awareness of the potential benefits of existing therapies among the public) are needed. A worrying finding of our study is the low proportion of possibly adequate treatment for anxiety disorders. Our data indicate that this may result from a combination of the generally low levels of percep- tion of need for care, together with varying level of access to care as well as differences in the quality of care provided. In this respect, there are potentially important opportunities for improvement in sev- eral areas. Health literacy and awareness should be promoted in countries with low perception of need, mostly among the low/lower- middle-income countries. At the same time, the quality of treatment showed remarkable variation between and within country income lev- els. Although the assessment of possibly adequate treatment in our study was based on self-report and this may differ from information gathered from administrative records in health services settings, our results suggest that it is important to encourage health providers to follow the clinical guidelines to improve treatment quality for anxiety disorders.
