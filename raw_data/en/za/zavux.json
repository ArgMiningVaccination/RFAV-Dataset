These physical challenges are often rooted in spiritual energetic-emotional challenges that often need to be identified and healed so that complete healing and resolution of the physical body can occur. Oftentimes, the appearance of physical challenges in the body are a result of spiritual energetic-emotional challenges that were present prior to physical symptoms appearing. Thus, the physical challenge is often the symptom of the real issue, lesson, learning, or message that your energetic-emotional body and the universe have been trying to help you see and learn. These spiritual energetic-emotional healing sessions aim to address the root of the physical challenges in the body. Therefore, the initial 1 hour intuitive guidance session is an assessment and treatment planning session. Kaulana will share messages from his spirit guides identifying the spiritual energetic-emotional roots and areas for healing and discuss with you the healing protocols and process. Some healing may begin in the first session. After the initial session, additional healing sessions may be needed, with each additional session on average being 2 hrs in length, possibly occurring weekly, with some follow-up in between sessions. PERMISSION PROTOCOL: All requests go through a permission protocol, which involves Kaulana review your request with his guides. Please know that there may be times that he is unable to accommodate your request for a session. This does not mean you are unable to be helped or to heal, it often means that they are not the most appropriate team to help you at this moment in time. We encourage you to find the person(s) who are meant to be with you on your healing journey. This protocol applies to all clients (new and current).
