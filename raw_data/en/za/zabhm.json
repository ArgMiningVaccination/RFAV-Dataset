Immunostimulants (immunostimulators) are drugs that stimulate the [immune system](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_system/definition.htm) by increasing the activity of any of its components. The [immune](https://www.rxlist.com/immune/definition.htm) system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs. Together, they help the body fight infections and diseases. Sipuleucel-T (an [immunosuppressant](https://www.rxlist.com/immunosuppressant/definition.htm)) is used to treat certain types Another immunostimulant the United States Administration](https://www.rxlist.com/food_and_drug_administration/definition.htm) ( [FDA](https://www.rxlist.com/fda/definition.htm)) approval for [therapeutic](https://www.rxlist.com/therapeutic/definition.htm) [vaccination](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccination/definition.htm) to elicit immune responses against a wide variety of HIV antigens. These medications are also called personalized [autologous](https://www.rxlist.com/autologous/definition.htm) cellular [immunotherapy](https://www.rxlist.com/immunotherapy/definition.htm) (a type of [medication](https://www.rxlist.com/medication/definition.htm) prepared using cells from the [patient](https://www.rxlist.com/patient/definition.htm)'s own [blood](https://www.rxlist.com/blood/definition.htm)). The two main categories of immunostimulants are: - Specific immunostimulants: stimulate an [immune response](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_response/definition.htm)to a specific [antigen](https://www.rxlist.com/antigen/definition.htm)(a [toxin](https://www.rxlist.com/toxin/definition.htm)or other foreign [substance](https://www.rxlist.com/substance/definition.htm)which induces an immune response in the body) such as [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm). - Nonspecific immunostimulants: act irrespective of antigenic [specificity](https://www.rxlist.com/specificity/definition.htm)and are used in [immunodeficiency](https://www.rxlist.com/immunodeficiency/definition.htm)and [chronic](https://www.rxlist.com/chronic/definition.htm)infections. - Immunostimulants are [prescription](https://www.rxlist.com/prescription/definition.htm)-only medicines and are administered as a suspension (liquid) to be injected over about 60 minutes into a [vein](https://www.rxlist.com/vein/definition.htm)once every two weeks for a total of three doses. About three days before each dose of sipuleucel-T injection is to be given, a sample of white blood cells is collected at a [cell](https://www.rxlist.com/cell/definition.htm)collection center using a procedure called leukapheresis (a [process](https://www.rxlist.com/process/definition.htm)that removes the white blood cells from the body). This sample is then sent to the manufacturer and combined with a [protein](https://www.rxlist.com/protein/definition.htm)to prepare a dose of sipuleucel-T injection. Immunostimulants work in the following ways: - They cause the body's immune system to fight [cancer](https://www.rxlist.com/cancer/definition.htm)cells. - Sipuleucel-T selectively targets the [prostate](https://www.rxlist.com/prostate/definition.htm)-specific antigen known as [prostatic acid phosphatase](https://www.rxlist.com/prostatic_acid_phosphatase/definition.htm)( [PAP](https://www.rxlist.com/pap/definition.htm)), an antigen that is expressed in around 95% of prostate cancers. - Sipuleucel-T vaccine is based on the concept of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These cells present antigens in a form that T cells can recognize. - It works through APCs to stimulate T-cell immune response targeted against PAP. HOW ARE IMMUNOSTIMULANTS USED? - Immunostimulant drug sipuleucel-T was approved minimally [symptomatic](https://www.rxlist.com/symptomatic/definition.htm)metastatic [hormone](https://www.rxlist.com/hormone/definition.htm)- [refractory](https://www.rxlist.com/refractory/definition.htm)prostate cancer. [HIV vaccine](https://www.rxlist.com/consumer_hiv_vaccine/drugs-condition.htm)is awaiting FDA approval to treat HIV antigens. WHAT ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF IMMUNOSTIMULANTS? Common [Asthenia](https://www.rxlist.com/asthenia/definition.htm)(physical weakness or energy) Other rare side include: [Paresthesia](https://www.rxlist.com/paresthesia/definition.htm)(an [abnormal](https://www.rxlist.com/abnormal/definition.htm) [sensation](https://www.rxlist.com/sensation/definition.htm), typically tingling or pricking [pins and by pressure on or damage to [peripheral](https://www.rxlist.com/peripheral/definition.htm)nerves) [Anemia](https://www.rxlist.com/anemia/definition.htm)(low [red blood cells](https://www.rxlist.com/red_blood_cells/definition.htm)) Peripheral [edema](https://www.rxlist.com/edema/definition.htm)(swelling of lower legs or hands) [Insomnia](https://www.rxlist.com/insomnia/definition.htm)(trouble falling and/or staying [involuntary](https://www.rxlist.com/involuntary/definition.htm), rhythmic [muscle](https://www.rxlist.com/muscle/definition.htm) [contraction](https://www.rxlist.com/contraction/definition.htm)leading to shaking movement in one or more parts of the body) Information contained herein is not intended to cover all possible side effects, precautions, warnings, drug interactions, allergic reactions, or adverse effects.
