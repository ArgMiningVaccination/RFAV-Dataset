Hypertension is a global health concern. Although the pharmacological treatment has obvious antihypertensive effects, there arestill some limitations on management of hypertension by drug therapy alone. In recent years, the nonpharmacological therapyof traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gradually become an important mean to help the prevention and treatment of hypertension in some Eastern countries. In this review, the nonpharmacological TCM therapies, including acupuncture, tuina, Tai Chi, and auricular-plaster, are covered along with the mechanism. 1. Introduction Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for heart disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease and so on [1].G l o b a l l y ,h y p e r t e n s i o ni sr e s p o n s i b l ef o ra tl e a s t4 5 %o fd e a t h sdue to heart disease and 51% of deaths due to stroke [2].In 2017, American Heart Association (AHA) released thenew version of the American Guidelines for Hypertension,in which hypertension is defined as blood pressure (BP)130/80 mmHg [3]. Under these circumstances, more adultpopulation will be affected, and hypertension is becoming amore and more serious medical and public health issue. Incurrent treatments for hypertension, there are several classesof antihypertensive drugs and strategies to modify the effecto fa d v e r s el i f e s t y l e so nB P .A l t h o u g ht h e s eh a v em a d eg r e a tprogress in targeting hypertension, for which a number ofapproaches have been developed, only about a quarter of patients are receiving adequate treatment. Pharmacotherapy can effectively control the blood pres- s u r e .H o w e v e r ,i tm a yb ea s s o c i a t e dw i t hp o t e n t i a la d v e r s e events, including hepatic and renal dysfunction. There are still some other deficiencies in drug treatment. For example, prehypertension and stage I hypertension alongside mildhypertension drugs are recommended for intensive lifestyle management rather than antihypertensive drugs for theirinitial BP lowering. The effect of drugs in the treatment of refractory hypertension is still not satisfactory, and theeconomic burden of long-term medication may cause lackof compliance to the poor economic conditions patients [4].Therefore, more and more people have turned to focus oncomplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for treatingessential hypertension (EH). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) includes many kinds of nonpharmacological interventions, such as acupunc-ture, tuina, and qigong. They can improve related symptomsof diseases through external stimuli. The American Collegeof Physicians recommended noninvasive pharmacologic andnonpharmacologic treatments such as acupuncture and tuinaas first-line treatment for low back pain [5]. In fact, TCMnonpharmacological interventions have a positive effect onthe adjuvant treatment of disease. Firstly, they avoid thedirect toxic effect of the drugs on the organs because ofvitro stimuli. Secondly, some studies [6-10] showed that theycan better control the blood pressure in patients with earlyhypertension. It puts forward good directions for the riskof taking medicine for early hypertension. Thirdly, they canmarkedly improve the symptoms of hypertension, such assevere headache, dizziness, and fatigue. For some patients with refractory hypertension or serious related symptoms, the quality of life can be improved and the pain can be Hindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2019, Article ID 1317842, 7 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/13178422 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine reduced by TCM nonpharmacological interventions [11-14]. Last but not least, they belong to a low cost treatment. Somea c u p o i n tm a s s a g eo re x e r c i s ec a nb ec a r r i e do u tb yp a t i e n t sthemselves paying no money. This review summarizes themethods of TCM nonpharmacological interventions on EH,along with the mechanism. 2. Acupuncture As a famous form of traditional Chinese medicine, acupunc-ture is one of the oldest and most commonly used forms ofalternative medicine. It is a method for restoring balance ofqi, the life force that circulates throughout the body in energypathways that are called meridians, by stimulating specificpoints over the surface of body known as acupuncture pointsor acupoints [15]. In recent years, as complementary medicineinterventions, acupuncture is increasingly valued by peopleand widely used in the clinic, as well as being applied in theUnited States and Europe. It is said that acupuncture cantreat a number of diseases, including those related to thecardiovascular system [16], such as hypertension [17]. So itc o u l db eu s e do np a t i e n t sw h ow a n tt oa v o i dd r u gt h e r a p yo ras an alternative option to reduce dosages of antihypertensiveagents. Some systematic reviews and studies [6, 17-19] found that acupuncture might lower blood pressure in prehyper- tension and stage I hypertension. Acupuncture could reduce blood pressure by regulating the nervous system. Someacupoints could reduce blood pressure by modulating sym-pathetic nerves [20-23]. Tan Ying-ying et al. [24] establishedhypertension model with 45 male SD rats and found that electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation of \"Quchi\" (LI 11) candownregulate arterial blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity and increase the baroreflex sensitivity in hyperten- sion rats, which may be related to its effects in downregulatingp47 phagocyte oxidase mRNA and protein expression in the RVML. the antihypertensive mechanisms of acupunc- ture at Taichong (LR3) is also via the regulation renalsympathetic activity and ss-ARs [25]. In addition, stimulate the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) to regulate blood pressure. The study of Wang Xue-R u ie ta l .[ 2 6 ]f o u n dt h a ta c u p u n c t u r ed e c r e a s e sh i g hb l o o d pressure and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate o x i d a s ei nt h eR V L Mo fs p o n t a n e o u s l yh y p e r t e n s i v er a t s .O x i d a t i v es t r e s si nt h eR V L M ,w h e r et h es y m p a t h e t i cn e r v o u scontrol center is located, contributes to neural mechanisms of hypertension. So the mitogen-activated protein kinases and the sciatic nerve are involved in the mechanism ofacupuncture's amelioration of hypertension. Besides regulating nervous system, acupuncture can also improve hypertension through various ways. For example,EA could significantly reduce markers of cardiac hypertrophyand apoptosis, as well as elevated expression of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) in SHRs [27]. Sin Bond Leung et al. [28] found that the effects ofa c u p u n c t u r ei nt r e a t i n gh y p e r t e n s i o nw e r ea s s o c i a t e dw i t h reduced oxidative stress, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, and endothelial function in SHRs.3. Tuina Tuina is based on the theory of internal organs and meridians o fT C M .I ti sp r e s s e do ns p e c i fi cp a r t so ft h eb o d ys u r f a c eto regulate the body's physiological and pathological con-ditions, to achieve the purpose of physiotherapy. Modernstudies indicate that tuina manipulations modulate BP by thefollowing four aspects [29]. Firstly, it regulates the nervoussystem, activating vagus, inhibiting sympathetic nerves, andadjusting autonomic nerves in both ways, and further dilatingcapillaries and reducing the resistance of peripheral bloodvessels [30]. Secondly, the manipulations can relax majormuscle groups, release vascular spasm, increase vascular bed,a n di m p r o v eb l o o dfl o wi np e r i p h e r a lv e s s e l s[ 3 1 ] .Th i r d l y ,i tstimulates the carotid baroreceptor to excite the vagus, reduceheart rate and pumping blood volume, inhibit vasomotorneurons, dilate blood vessels, and decrease the resistance ofperipheral blood vessels [32]. Fourthly, the manipulations canalso reduce symptoms such as pressure and anxiety [33, 34]. Shen Zhi-fang [35] et al. treated 40 patients with grade 1-2 hypertension and observed that the tuina manipula-tions of kidney-tonifying blood-circulating and collaterals-unblocking could produce a significant effect on antihy-pertension and improving blood pressure variability, and i ta l s oc o u l de ff e c t i v e l yr e d u c et h et a r g e to r g a nd a m a g ei n hypertension and benefit the prognosis. In addition, tuina canalso improve sleep quality [36, 37] in middle-aged Womenand old people with hypertension. 4. Qigong Qigong is an ancient Chinese healing art, involving med-itation, controlled breathing, and movement exercises thatdate back thousands of years, and is believed to be based onTCM. Qigong includes two concepts: qi, the vital energy ofthe body and gong, the training or cultivation of qi. Medicalqigong is divided into internal and external components [38].Internal qigong consists of exercises, including breathing,meditation, focus of intention, and rhythmical movements,while external qigong is performed by a trained practitionerin order to deliver qi energy to the patient. One possibleexplanation for the beneficial effects of qigong exercise isincreased healthy flow of qi, blood, and fluid throughoutthe body by repetitive movements to relieve pathologicalstagnation and regulate the function of meridians and visceralorgans. Many potential beneficial effects have been found on various disorders [39], including cardiovascular disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and cancers. And qigong hasalso been studied as an alternative therapy for controllingblood pressure. For example, Ba duan jin qigong exercise [40-43] may have the potential to improve systolic blood NO, and plasma endothelin-1 and then improvecardiovascular function and decrease BP in older adults withhypertension. Randomized clinical trials [44] also showedthat the possible mechanisms by which qigong could reduceEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 BP in hypertensive patients may include modulation of the sympathoadrenal medulla function, while the lowering ofplasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels can reducesympathetic nervous system activity. Therefore, a decrease incatecholamine levels through modulation of the sympatheticadreno medullary function could be the mechanism under- lying the observed reduction in blood pressure. 5. Tai Chi Tai Chi also originates from China. It is a therapy which evolved from martial arts. Tai Chi [45] mainly comprises three basic components, movement, deep breathing, and meditation. The movement of this exercise is slow, fluid, andcontinuous. They need body, breathing, and heart to achievea balanced state. In this way, the essence, qi and spirit of thebody can form a benign cycle. Doing this exercise [46] canr e l a xt h eb o d ya n dm i n d ,s t r e n g t h e nt h ej o i n t s ,i m p r o v ej o i n tmobility, and boost the immune system. The slow movements[47] between different postures that are normally held forshort periods of time represent physical stimuli, which affectthe cardiovascular and muscular systems. Tai Chi exercise [48, 49] had shown positive effects on patients with many chronic diseases. Many systematicreviews [50-53] of Tai Chi also showed that this sport hasbeneficial effects on BP of patients with hypertension. Anda community-based study [54], which include 266 patientswith hypertension, found that a Tai Chi program to improvehypertension in older adults is effective in reducing bloodpressure and body mass index, maintaining normal renalfunction and improving physical health of health-relatedquality of life. The study of PAN Xiaogui [55] et al. found thatS B P, D B P, a n d m e a n a r t e r i a l p r e s s u r e l e v e l s c a n s i g n i fi c a nt l yreduce in 24 EH patients who practice Tai Chi exercise,compared with 16 patients without exercise. And the reducedblood pressure may be correlated with increased plasma levels of gaseous signal molecules, such as endogenous NO, CO, and H 2S, which are involved in blood pressure regulation. 6. Auricular-Plaster Auricular-plaster has been utilized in the treatment of dis-eases for thousands of years. Dr. Paul Nogier firstly originatedthe concept of an inverted fetus map on the external ear.A present study [56] indicates that the auricular-plaster plays a role in vagal activity of autonomic functions of cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems. Soa u r i c u l a r - p l a s t e ri sa l s op r o p o s e dt op r e v e n th y p e r t e n s i o nv i avagal regulation. Some meta-analysis trials [57-59] show that auricular pressure therapy is safe and effective for EH. Yang Xiaolin [12]et al. divided ninety patients with primary hypertension intomedication group and combination group. After 4 weeks oftreatment, they found that auricular point sticking combinedwith acupuncture for primary hypertension is better thancaptopril for the improvement of 24 h ambulatory bloodpressure, Ang II level and creatinine level, and can improved i z z y n e s s ,p a l p i t a t i o n ,a n do t h e rc l i n i c a ls y m p t o m s .I t[ 6 0 ,6 1 ]can also be applied at the acupoints of Shenmen, sympathesis,kidney, liver, heart, and subcortex to improve physical painand reduce target organ damage for hypertensive patients. 7. Acupoint Catgut Embedding Acupoint catgut embedding [62] refers to setting absorbablecatgut into the acupoint, by stimulating meridians, balancingyin and yang, and harmonizing qi and blood, to achievethe purpose of adjusting viscera and treating diseases. Mod-ern medical theory holds that the inflammatory reactionoccurred in the local package by catgut to produce continu-ous stimulation on acupoints. By stimulating the acupuncturepoint, it can restore the regulation function of central nervous system and endocrine body fluid, relive blood vessel spasm, a n ds t e a d yt h eb l o o dp r e s s u r e . Clinical trials [11, 63-65] showed that acupoint catgut embedding therapy can better improve the symptoms andblood pressure of patients with hypertension. Li Ling [66] etal. treated 70 prehypertensive patients with acupoint catgutembedding and found that this treatment also can effectivelydownregulate the total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, upregulate the high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol, and reduce weight. The mechanism[67-69] of acupoint catgut embedding may be sustainedstimulation of acupoints, which regulate the excitability ofthe central nervous system, decrease the content of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, improve the microvascular circula-tion and relaxation, and finally regulate the arterial bloodpressure reaching a new balance. 8. Chinese Medicine Foot Bath TCM believes that the feet have many meridians and acu-points connected with viscera. For example, high bloodpressure is also located at the toes, and long-term com-pression can make the body in the dynamic balance of qiand blood [70]. Chinese medicine foot bath therapy [71,7 2 ]h a st h ef o l l o w i n gt h r e em a i ne ff e c t so nh y p e r t e n s i o n .(1) Improving the blood circulation of the whole body andregulating the autonomic nerve. (2) Reducing blood viscosity.(3) Promoting metabolism. It has the dual effect of the watertemperature and medicine liquid fumigation: this therapy,combined with the effect of drug heat and drug penetration[73], can increase the inhibition process of cerebral cortex through the mechanism of nerve reflex and body fluid, so as to regulate the action of the subcortical vascular motor center,reduce the tension of peripheral arteriole, and assist in thetreatment of hypertension [74]. Some clinical observations [75, 76] showed that, compared with common therapy, treatment with Chinesemedicine foot bath can perfect better in reducing systolicand diastolic pressure, and improving symptoms like vertigo,headache, palpitation, and shortness of breath. Huang Yao[77] et al. intervened in 152 patients with prehypertensiona n dp r i m a r yg r a d e1h y p e r t e n s i o nb yZ h uL i a n g c h u n ' sf o o tbath recipe and found that the clinical curative effect ispromising. Particularly, it has obvious effect on decreasing4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine D B P .C u iY i[ 7 8 ]e ta l .o b s e r v e d1 4 0p a t i e n t sw i t hd i ff e r e n t stages of hypertension and found that Chinese medicinefoot bath has significant effect on mild, moderate, and severehypertension. 9. Other Therapies In fact, there are still other therapies for EH in folk, such as Chinese medicine pillow, which worked though volatility of herbs [79-81], and Chinese umbilical, which absorbeddrugs into the blood through navel [82, 83] and special diet.Some studies showed that these therapies also can relievehypertension and its related symptoms of patients in varyingdegrees. But these researches are only in the stage of clinicalobservation and not going on deeper mechanism study. In summary, the abundant nonpharmacological therapies c o u l dn o to n l ye n h a n c ed r u ge ff e c tb u ta l s oh a v em a n yo t h e radvantages, such as patient's willingness to accept, cheapness,n ot o x i cs i d ee ff e c t sa n ds oo n .H o w e v e r ,t h eb a s i cr e s e a r c hon TCM nonpharmacological therapies for hypertension isstill inadequate based on the existing literature. Firstly, theregulations of indications or contraindications of differenttreatments are still unclear. For example, exercise therapymay be suitable for critical hypertension and stages I and IIhypertension, but not for the stage III hypertension, or otherserious complications. Therefore, different types of hyper-tension patients should be in accordance with the doctor'sexercise prescription, to choose the appropriate sports andsports intensity, and pay attention to the safety of sports.Secondly, the effectiveness of various nonpharmacologicalinterventions has yet to be further studied. There are manyreports on the treatment, but the mechanism of nonphar- macological interventions is still not clear. What is more, we can see the improvement of the risk factors and target organdamage are mentioned in many articles; however, they needto be further studied and discussed in the future. As we know, the ultimate goal of hypertension treatment should be to reduce the incidence and mortality of heart,brain, and kidney complications. Although more and morepeople tend to use TCM nonpharmacological interventions,well-designed preclinical and clinical trials on the potentialsynergistic and adverse side effects of the therapies, as well astheir mechanisms, are warranted. And TCM nonpharmaco-logical interventions should be selected under the guidanceof doctors. Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
