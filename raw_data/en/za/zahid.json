We are interested in understanding the impact COVID-19 during pregnancy might have on birthing people and their babies. We called the study 'Generation C' because it is looking at the generation of children born during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are now following up the children born into this cohort to better understand how SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination against COVID-19 during pregnancy impacts these children longer term. To test for COVID-19 infection and vaccination during pregnancy, we use blood samples drawn as part of routine care in all pregnant participants. Samples are tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, early and late in pregnancy and at delivery. The study also examines the patients' electronic medical records, obtaining information on pregnancy and child outcomes. Jill Schechter with Gen C baby Jonah What makes Generation C unique? We make use of scientific expertise from many different medical disciplines. We are a team of obstetricians, pediatricians, psychiatrists, immunologists, epidemiologists, pathologists, and population health scientists, all studying the different ways COVID-19 can affect pregnancy and child outcomes. What did participants have to do as part of Generation C? Will participants be able to know their antibody status through participating in Generation C? Did participants have to have been exposed to COVID-19 to participate? Why are these findings significant? Where will the results of the study be published? What has the study found to date? Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry [anna.rommel@mssm.edu](mailto:anna.rommel@mssm.edu) Anna's work focuses on common exposures during pregnancy, including infections, medications and pollutants, and their link to the development of negative pregnancy and birth outcomes and suboptimal neurodevelopment in the child. She is particularly interested in exploring the extent to which COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic disproportionately impact pregnant women from underserved communities and their children.
