The research shows how the molecular structure and sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\u2014part of the virus that causes COVID-19\u2014could be behind the inflammatory syndrome cropping up in infected patients. [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/09/25/2010722117), uses computational modeling to zero in on a part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that may act as a \"superantigen,\" kicking the immune system into overdrive as in [toxic shock syndrome](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/t/toxic-shock-syndrome-tss.html)\u2014a rare, life-threatening complication of bacterial infections. [Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children](http://www.cdc.gov/mis-c)(MIS-C), include persistent fever and severe inflammation that can affect a host of bodily systems. While rare, the syndrome can be serious or even fatal.

[Bahar and her team created a computer model of the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein and the receptors on human T cells, the foot soldiers of the immune system. Under normal circumstances, T cells help the body fight off infection, but when these cells are activated in abnormally large quantities, as is the case with superantigens, they produce massive amounts of inflammatory cytokines\u2014small proteins involved in immune system signaling\u2014in what's known as a \"cytokine storm.\"](https://dam.upmc.com/-/media/upmc/media/publishingimages/2020/september/bahar-spike-sag-hr.jpg?la=en&rev=9e82320c9c5d40098ea75ada47e84444&hash=166A65CFC760285FEB66B947CEB9D8F2) [\"Everything came one after another, each time a huge surprise.
