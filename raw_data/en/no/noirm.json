Pathway Identifiers Each pathway map is identified by the combination of 2-4 letter prefix code and 5 digit number (see KEGG PATHWAY is integrated with [KEGG Identifier](/kegg/kegg3.html)). The prefix has the following meaning: - map - manually drawn reference pathway - ko - reference pathway highlighting KOs - ec - reference metabolic pathway highlighting EC numbers - rn - reference metabolic pathway highlighting reactions - <org> - organism-specific pathway generated by converting KOs to gene identifiers - 011 - global map (lines linked to KOs) - 012 - overview map (lines linked to KOs) - 010 - chemical structure map (no KO expansion) - 07 - drug structure map (no KO expansion) - other - regular map (boxes linked to KOs) KEGG PATHWAY is integrated with [MODULE](/kegg/module.html)and [NETWORK](/kegg/network.html)databases as indicated below.
