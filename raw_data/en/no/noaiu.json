Purdue's obligations under this Section will remain in effect for ten (10) years following the Effective Date of this Judgment. 16. Purdue shall continue to review news media stories addressing the abuse or diversion of OxyContin and undertake appropriate measures as reasonable under the circumstances to address abuse and diversion so identified, including but not limited to, (i) correcting misinformation, (ii) offering non-branded educational materials to local substance abuse prevention and treatment initiatives, or (iii) directing Health Care Professionals to Purdue's Medical Services group for fair and balanced information on appropriate use of opioid analgesics, prevention and detection of abuse and diversion. Purdue's obligations under this Section shall expire ten (10) years following the Effective Date of this Judgment or three months from the date on which the last of Purdue's patents 10 covering OxyContin expires, whichever is earlier, but in no event shall be earlier than seven (7) years following the Effective Date of this Judgment. 17.

For a period of ten (I 0) years following the Effective Date of this Judgment, Purdue's performance evaluation of persons involved in marketing or promoting OxyContin shall meaningfully take into account that sales persons inform Health Care Professionals to whom the sales persons promote OxyContin about its potential for abuse and diversion, and how to minimize those risks; failure to do so shall be considered as a basis for disciplinary action, including, but not limited to censure, probation and termination. 19. In its promotion and marketing of OxyContin, Purdue shall not misrepresent, in any written or oral claim relating to OxyContin, that its sales, medical or research personnel have experience or credentials or are engaging in research activities if they do not in fact possess such credentials or experience, or are not engaging in such activities. 20.

See full prescribing information for OXYCONTIN. OXYCONTIN\u00ae (oxycodone hydrochloride ) extended -release tablets, for oral use, CII Initial U.S. Approval: 1950 WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE AND MISUSE; RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS) ; LIFE - THREATENING RESPIRATORY OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS See full prescribing informat ion for complete boxed warning . OXYCONTIN exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient's risk before prescribing and monitor regularly for these behaviors and conditions. (5.1) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. (5. 2) Serious, life -threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow OXYCONTIN tablets whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. (5. 3) Accidental ingestion of OXY CONTIN, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone. (5.3 ) Prolonged use of OXYCONTIN during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life -threatening if not recognized and treated. If prolonged opioid use is required in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. (5. 4) Conco mitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone. (5. 5, 7, 12.3) Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing OXYCONTIN and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS): To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic produc ts must make REMS -compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to complete a REMS -compliant education program, counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life -threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of OXYCONTIN. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of OXYCONTIN or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow OXYCONTIN tablets whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving OXYCONTIN tablets can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Accidental I ngestion Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OXYCONTIN, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of OXYCONTIN during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life -threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of Reference ID: 4326201neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction use of OXYCONTIN with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discont inuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving OXYCONTIN and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer [see Warnings and Interactions (7), C linical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7)]. Reserve concomitant prescribing of OXYCONTIN and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symp toms of respiratory depression and sedation. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE OXYCONTIN is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around- the-clock, long -term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate in: Adults; and Opioid- tolerant pediatric patients 11 years of age and older who are already receiving and tolerate a minimum daily opioid dose of at least 20 mg oxycodone orally or its equivalent. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended- release opioid formulations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] , reserve OXYCONTIN for use in patients for whom alternative tre atment options (e.g., non- opioid analgesics or immediate -release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. OXYCONTIN is not indicated as an as -needed (prn) analgesic. Reference ID: 43262012 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions OXYCONTIN should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. OXYCONTIN 60 mg and 80 mg tablets , a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Adult patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day , 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually ; taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24- 72 hours of initiating th erapy and following dosage increases with OXYCONTIN and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 )]. Instruct patients to swallow OXYCONTIN tablets whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . Instruct patients not to pre-soak, lick, or otherwise wet the tablet prior to placing in the mouth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11 )]. Cutting, breaking, crushing, chewing , or dissolving OXYCONTIN tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . OXYCONTIN is administered orally every 12 hours. 2.2 Initial Dosage in Adults who are not Opioid -Tolerant The starting dos age for patients who are not opioid tolerant is OXYCONTIN 10 mg orally every 12 hours. Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 )]. 2.3 Conversion from Opioids to OXYCONTIN in Adults Conversion from O ther Oral Oxycodone Formulations to OXYCONTIN If switching from other oral oxycodone formulations to OXYCONTIN, administer one half of the patient's total daily oral oxycodone dose as OXYCONTIN every 12 hours . Reference ID: 4326201 Conversion from other around- the-clock opioid drugs when OXYCONTIN therapy is initiated. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to OXYCONTIN defined by clinical trials. Initiate dosing using OXYCONTIN 10 mg orally every 12 hours. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24 -hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate -release opioid) than to overestimate the 24 -hour oral oxycodone dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to an overdose . While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is substantial inter -patient variability in the relative potency of different opioids . Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and for signs of oversedation/toxicity after converting patients to OXYCONTIN. Conversi on from Methadone to OXYCONTIN Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone ha s a long half -life and can accumulate in the plasma. Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to OXYCONTIN Treatment with OXYCONTIN can be initiated after the transdermal fentanyl patch has been removed for at least 18 hours. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, start with a conservative conversion: substitute 10 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours for each 25 mcg per hour fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCONTIN, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.4 Initial Dos age in Pediatric Patients 11 Years and Older The following dosing information is for use only in pediatric patients 11 years and older already receiving and tolerating opioids for at least five consecutive days. For the two days immediately preceding dosing with OXYCONTIN, patients must be taking a minimum of 20 mg per day of oxycodone or its equivalent . OXYCONTIN is not appropriate for use i n pediatric patients requiring less than a 20 mg total daily dose. Table 1 , based on clinical trial experience, displays the conversion factor when switching pediatric patients 11 years and older (under the conditions described above) from opioids to OXYCONTIN. Discontinue all other around- the-clock opioid drugs when OXYCONTIN is initiated. There subst antial inter -patient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of OXYCONTIN. It is safer to underestimate a pa tient's 24 -hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate -release opioid) than to Reference ID: 4326201overestimate the 24- hour oral oxycodone requirements and manage an adverse reaction due to an overdose . Consider the following when using the information in Table 1. This is not a table of equianalgesic doses. The conversion factors in this table are only for the conversion from one of the listed oral opioid analgesics to OXYCONTIN. The table cannot be used to convert from OXYCONTIN to another opioid. Doing so will result in an over -estimation of the dose of the new opioid and may result in fatal overdose . The formula for conversion from prior opioids , including oral oxycodone, to the daily dose of OXYCONTIN is mg per day of prior opioid x factor = mg per day of OXYCONTIN. Divide the calculated total daily dose by 2 to get the every -12-hour OXYCONTIN dose . If rounding is necessary, a lways round the dose down to the nearest OXYCONTIN tablet strength available . Table 1: Conversion Factors When Switching Pediatric Patients 1 1 Years and O lder to OXYCONTIN Prior Opioid Conversion Factor Oral Parenteral * Oxycodone 1 -- Hydrocodone 0.9 -- Hydrom orphone 4 20 Morph ine 0.5 3 Tramadol 0.17 0.2 *For patients receiving high -dose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for high -dose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. Step #1: To calculate the estimated total OXYCONTIN daily dos age using Table 1: For pediatric patients taking a single opioid, sum the current total daily dos age of the opioid and then multiply the total daily dos age by the approximate conversion factor to calculate the approximate OXYCONTIN daily dos age. For pediatric patients on a regimen of more than one opioid, calculate the approximate oxycodone dose for each opioid and sum the totals to obtain the approximate OXYCONTIN daily dos age. Reference ID: 4326201 For pediatric patients on a regimen of fixed -ratio opioid/non- opioid analgesic products, use only the opioid component of these products in the conversion. Step #2: If rounding is necessary, a lways round the dos age down to the nearest OXYCONTIN tablet strength available and initiate OXYCONTIN therapy with that dose. If the calculated OXYCONTIN total daily dos age is less than 20 mg, there is no safe stren gth for conversion and do not initiate OXYCONTIN . Example conversion from a single opioid (e.g., hydrocodone) to OXYCONTIN: Using the conversion factor of 0.9 for oral hydrocodone in Table 1, a total daily hydr ocodone dos age of 50 mg is converted to 45 mg of oxycodone per day or 22.5 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours. After rounding down to the nearest strength available, the recommended OXYCONTIN starting dosage is 20 mg every 12 hours . Step #3: Close observati on and titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal or for signs of over - sedation/toxicity after co nverting patients to OXYCONTIN. [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] for important instructions on titration and maintenance of therapy. There is limited experience with conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCONTIN in pediatric patients 11 years and older . If switching from transdermal fentanyl patch to OXYCONT IN, ensure that the patch has been removed for at least 18 hours prior to starting OXYCONTIN. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, start with a conservative conversion: substitute 10 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours for each 25 mcg per hour fentanyl transdermal patch. F ollow the patient closely during conversion fentanyl to OXYCONTIN . If using asymmetric dosing, instruct patients to take the higher dose in the morning and the lower dose in the evening . 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy in Adults and Pediatric Patients 11 Years and Older Individually titrate OXYCONTIN to a dos age that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving OXYCONTIN to as sess the maintenance of pain control , signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration . During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dos age adjustment of OXYCONTIN or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate- release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attemp t to identify the source of increased pain Reference ID: 4326201before increasing the OXYCONTIN dos age. Because steady -state plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, OXYCONTIN dosage may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days. If unacceptable opioid- related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage . Adjust the dos age to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid- related adverse reactions. There are no well -controlled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing mor e frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline for pediatric patients 11 years and older , the total aily oxycodone dos age usually can be increased by 25% of the current total daily dos age. As a guideline for adults , the total daily oxycodone dos age usu ally can be increased by 25% to 50% of the current total daily dos age, each time an increase is clinically indicated. 2.6 Dosage Modifications with Concomitant Use of C entral Nervous System Depressants If the patient is currently taking a central nervous system ( CNS ) depressant and the decision is made to begin OXYCONTIN, start with one -third to one -half the recommended starting dosage of OXYCONTIN, consider using a lower dosage of the concomitant CNS depressant, and monitor patients for signs of respirato ry depression , sedation, and hypotension (5.6 ), Drug Interactions (7)] . 2.7 Dosage Modifications in Geriatric Patients who are Debilitated and not Opioid - Tolerant For geriatric patients who are debilitated and not opioid toler ant, s tart dosing patients at one -third to one -half the recommended starting dosage and titrate the dos age cautiously [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5]. 2.8 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at one -third to one -half the recommended starting dos age and titrate the dosage carefully . Monitor for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see Use in Specific Populations, (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.9 Discontinuation of OXYCONTIN When the patient no longer requires therapy with OXYCONTIN, taper the dosage gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring for signs and symptoms of withdrawal . If a patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interv al between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCONTIN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)] .

As an opioid, OXYCONTIN exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse . Because extended - release products such as OXYCONTIN deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxycodone present [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] . Although the risk of a ddiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OXYCONTIN. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Reference ID: 4326201Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse , or misuse prior to pr escribing OXYCONTIN, and monitor all patients receiving OXYCONTIN for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioid s such as OXYCONTIN, but use in such patients necess itates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OXYCONTIN along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of OXYCONTIN by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10) ]. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider t hese risks when prescribing or dispensing OXYCONTIN. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS -compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS -compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the sa fe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG . Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Conside r using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient -prescriber agreements that reinforce patient -prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1 -800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com . The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMS Blueprint . Reference ID: 43262015.3 Life -Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life -threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated , may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage . Carbon dioxide (CO 2) reten tion from opioid- induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life -threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of OXYCONTIN, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dos age increase. M onitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 -72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of OXYCONTIN. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OXYCONTIN are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Overestimating the OXYCONTIN dos age when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OXYCONTIN, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of OXYCONTIN during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for s igns of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.5 Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Concomitant use of OXYCONTIN (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 )], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of OXYCONTIN is achieved . Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in OXYCONTIN- treated patients may increase oxycodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using OXYCONTIN with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in OXYCONTIN- treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of OXYCONTIN until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Reference ID: 4326201Concomitant use of CYP3A4 discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease oxycodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone . When using OXYCONTIN with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.6 Risks f rom Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressa nts Profound sedation, respiratory depression , coma, and death may result if OXYCONTIN is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., non - benzodiazepines alcohol ). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug -related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharma cological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant conc omitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indic ated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when OXYCONTIN is used with benzodiazepines or other CN S depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance us e disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) , Patient Counseling Information (17)] . 5.7 Life -Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of OXYCONTIN in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Reference ID: 4326201Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : OXYCONTIN- treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxi a, hypercapnia, or pre -existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of OXYCONTIN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 )]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OXYCONTIN and when OXYCONTIN is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.6 )]. Alternatively, consider the use of non- opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non- specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with ph ysiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a differ ent opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Severe Hypotension OXYCONTIN may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurre nt administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of OXYCONTIN. In patients with circulatory shock, OXYCONTIN may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OXYCONTIN in patients with circulatory shock. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracra nial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury , or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) , OXYCONTIN may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Reference ID: 4326201Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OXYCONTIN. Opioids may also obscure the clini cal course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of OXYCONTIN in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.11 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been post -marketing reports of difficulty in swallowing OXYCONTIN tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to pre -soak, lick, or otherwise wet OXYCONTIN tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare post -marketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternativ e analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions OXYCONTIN is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including a cute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The oxycodone in OXYCONTIN may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures . Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during OXYCONTIN therapy. 5.14 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist e.g.., e.g., buprenorphine) in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including OXYCONTIN. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the anal gesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Reference ID: 4326201When discontinuing OXYCONTIN, gradually taper the dos age [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)]. Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCONTIN [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)] . 5.15 Risks of Driving a nd Operating Machinery OXYCONTIN may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are toleran t to the effects of OXYCONTIN and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . 5.16 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for \"opioids\" or \"opiates\" detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for in -office use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified \"cut -off\" value as \"negative\". Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that t he sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and consider the limitations of the testing used when interpreting results. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Life-Threatening Respiratory D epression and Precautions (5.3)] Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions Interactions With Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )] Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 )] Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9 )] Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11, 5.12)] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13 )] Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14 )] 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Adult Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of OXYCONTIN was evaluated in double- blind clinical trials involving 713 patients with mo derate to severe pain of various etiologies. In open- label studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received OXYCONTIN in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. Reference ID: 4326201OXYCONTIN may inc rease the risk of serious adverse reactions such as those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock [see Overdosage (10)] . The most common adverse react ions (>5%) reported by patients in clinical trials comparing OXYCONTIN with placebo are shown in Table 2 below: TABLE 2: Common Adverse Reactions (>5%) Adverse Reaction OXYCONTIN (n=227) Placebo (n=45) (%) (%) Constipation (23) (7) Nausea (23) (11) Somnolence (23) (4) Dizziness (13) (9) Pruritus (13) (2) Vomiting (12) (7) Headache (7) (7) Dry Mouth (6) (2) Asthenia (6) - Sweating (5) (2) In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported in patients treated with OXYCONTIN with an incidence between 1% and 5%: Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, gastritis General disorders and administration si te conditions: chills, fever Metabolism and nutrition disorders: anorexia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: twitching Psychiatric disorders: abnormal dreams, anxiety, confusion, dysphoria, euphoria, insomnia, nervousness, thought abnormalities Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal postural hypotension The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of patients involved in clinical trials: Reference ID: 4326201Blood lymphatic disorder, appetite, s tomatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: withdrawal syndrome (with and without seizures), edema, peripheral edema, thirst, malaise, chest pain, facial edema Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: accidental injury Investig ations: ST depression Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration impotence Respiratory, thoracic and m ediastinal disorders: cough increased, voice alteration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: dry skin, exfoliative dermatitis Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients 11 Years and Older The safety of OXYCONTIN has been evaluated in one clinical trial with 140 patients 11 to 16 years of age . The median duration of treatment was approximately three weeks. The most frequently reported adverse events were vomiting, nausea, headache, pyrexia, and constipation. Table 3 includes a summary of the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events reported in 5% of patients . Table 3: Incidence of Adverse Reactions Reported in 5.0% Patients 11 to 16 Years System Organ Class Preferred Term 11 to 16 Years (N=140) n (%) Any Adverse Event >= 5% 71 (51) Reference ID: 4326201 GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS 56 (40) Vomiting 30 (21) Nausea 21 (15) Constipation 13 (9) Diarrhea 8 (6) GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS 32 (23) Pyrexia 15 (11) METABOLISM AND NUTRITION DISORDERS 9 (6) Decreased appetite 7 (5) NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS 37 (26) Headache 20 (14) Dizziness 12 (9) SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE DISORDERS 23 (16) Pruritus 8 (6) The following adverse reactions occurred in a clinical trial of OXYCONTIN in patients 11 to 16 years of age with an incidence between 1.0% and < 5.0%. Events are listed within each System/Organ . gastroesophageal reflux disease General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, pain, chills, asthenia Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications: pain, seroma Investigations: saturation decreased increased, hemoglobin decreased, platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, red blood cell count decreased, weight decreased Metabolic and nutrition disorders: hypochlor subcutaneous tissue disorders: hyperhidrosis, rash 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post -approval use of extended - release oxycodone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relatio nship to drug exposure. Abuse, addiction, aggression, amenorrhea, cholestasis, completed suicide, death, dental hypertonia, overdose, palpitations (in the context of withdrawal), seizures, suicidal attempt, suicidal ideation, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and urticaria. In addition to the events listed above, the following have also been reported, potentially due to the swelling and hydrogelling property of the tablet: choking, gagging, regurgitation, tablets stuck in the throat and difficulty swallowing the tablet. Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life -threatening condi tion, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in OXYCONTIN. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 includes clinically sign ificant drug interactions with OXYCONTIN . Table 4 : Clinically Significant D rug Interactions w ith OXYCONTIN Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of OXYCONTIN and CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of oxycodone , resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects . These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of OXYCONTIN and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of OXYCONTIN is achieved [see Warning s Reference ID: 4326201and Precautions (5. 5)]. After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the oxycodone plasma concentration will decrease [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. Intervention: If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of OXYCONTIN until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals. If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the OXYCONTIN dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. Examples Macrolide use of OXYCONTIN and CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of oxycodone [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to oxycodone [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 )]. After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the oxycodone plasma concent ration will increase [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions , and may cause serious respiratory depression. Intervention: If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the OXYCONTIN dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider OXYCONTIN dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression. Examples: Rifampin, c arbamazepine, phenytoin Benzodiazepines and Other Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, t concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants , including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions Benzodiazepines and other Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system ha s resulted in serotonin syndrome . Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue OXYCONTIN if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Intervention: The use of OXYCONTIN is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 da ys of stopping such treatment. May reduce the analgesic effect of OXYCONTIN and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dos age of OXYCONTIN and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when OXYCONTIN is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk S umm ary Prolong ed use of opioid a nalgesics dur ing pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid wal syndrome [see Warnings and Pr ecautions 5.4)]. There are no a vailable data with OXYCONTIN in pr egnant women to inf orm a drug-associated risk for major birth de fects and miscarriage. In animal reproduc tion studi es, ther e was no e mbryo-fetal toxicity when Reference ID: 4326201oxycodone hydrochloride was orally administered to ra ts and rabbits, dur ing the p eriod of organogenesis, at dos es 1.3 to 40 time s the adult hum an dose of 60 m g/day, respectiv ely. In a pre- and postna tal toxicity study, when oxycodone was orally administered to r ats, th ere was transiently decreased pup bod y weight du ring lactation a nd the early post-weaning period a t the dose equiva lent to a n adult dose of 60 mg/day. In several publishe d studi es, treatme nt of pregnant rats with o xycodone h ydrochloride at clinically relevant dos es and be low resulted in neurobehavioral effects in o ffspring [se e Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant wom en of the potential risk to a fetus. The estima ted background risk of major birth de fects and mis carriage for the indicated popul ation is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general popul ation, the estima ted back ground risk of major birth defects and mis carriage in clinical ly recognized pregnancies is 2 -4% and 15- 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/N eonatal A dverse Reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritabil ity, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea , and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )]. Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho- physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid- induced respiratory depression in the neonate. OXYCONTIN is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorter -acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics , including OXYCONTIN, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the streng th, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Reference ID: 4326201Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with 0.5, 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg oxycodone hydrochloride (0.08, 0.3, 0.7, and 1.3 times the human daily dose of 60 mg/day, respectively based on a mg/m2 basis) during the period of organogenesis. Oxycodone did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at exposures up to 1.3 times the human dose of 60 mg/day. The high dose produced maternal toxicity characterized by excessive gnawing on forelimbs and decreased body weight gai n. Pregnant rabbits were treated with 1, 5, 25, and 125 mg/kg oxycodone hydrochloride (0.3, 2, 8, and 40 times the human daily dose of 60 mg/day, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 basis) during the period of organogenesis. Oxycodone did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at exposures up to 40 times the human dose of 60 mg/day. The 25 mg/kg and 125 mg/kg doses high doses produced maternal toxicity characterized by decreased fo od consumption and body weight gain. Pregnant rats were treated with 0.5, 2, and 6 mg/kg oxycodone hydrochloride (0.08, 0.32, and 1 times the human daily dose of 60 mg/kg, respective, based on a mg/m 2 basis, during the period of organogenesis through lacta tion. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early post -weaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mg/kg/day, equivalent to an adult human dose of 60 mg/day, on a mg/m2 basis). However, body weight of these p ups recovered. In published studies, offspring of pregnant rats administered oxycodone hydrochloride during gestation have been reported to exhibit neurobehavioral effects including altered stress responses and increased anxiety -like behavior (2 mg/kg/da y IV from Gestation Day 8 to 21 and Postnatal Day 1, 3, and 5; 0.3 times an adult human oral dose of 60 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis), and altered learning and memory (15 mg/kg/day orally from breeding through parturition; 2.4 times an adult human oral dose of 60 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Oxycodone is present in breast milk. Published lactation studies report variable concentrations of oxycodone in breast milk with administration of immediate -release oxycodone to nursing mothers in the early postpartum period. The lactation studies did not assess breastfed infants for potentia l adverse reactions. Lactation studies have not been conducted with extended-release oxycodone, including OXYCONTIN, and no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with OXYCONTIN. Reference ID: 4326201Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to OXYCONTIN through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breast -fed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast -feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of OXYCONTIN have been established in pediatric patients ages 11 to 16 years. Use of OXYCONTIN is supported by evidence from adequate and well -controlled trials with OXYCONTIN in adu lts as well as an open -label study in pediatric patients ages 6 to 16 years . However, there were insufficient numbers of patients less than 11 years of age enrolled in this study to establish the safety of the product in this age group. The s afety of OXYCONTIN in pediatric patients was evaluated in 155 patients previously receiving and tolerating opioids for at least 5 consecutive days with a minimum of 20 mg per day of oxycodone or its equivalent on the two days immediately preceding dosing with OXYCONTI N. Patients were started on a tot al da ily dose ranging between 20 mg and 100 mg depending on prior opioid dose . The most frequent adverse events observed in pediatric patients were vomiting, nausea, headache, pyrexia, and constipation [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4 ), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Trials (14) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlled- release tablets, 148 (33.3% ) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0%) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients w ho received oxycodone hydrochloride controlled- release tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, a dosage reduction in debilitated, non- opioid- tolerant patients is recommended inistration (2.7)] . Reference ID: 4326201Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids , and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who are not opioid- tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dos age of OXYCONTIN slowly in these patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Oxycodone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of OXYCONTIN in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic f unction [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Therefore, a dosage reduction is recommended for these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)] . Monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (<60 mL/min), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50% higher than in subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation. 8.8 Sex Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with OXYCONTIN, opioid- na\u00efve females demonstrate up to 25% higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequenc y of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no male/female difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials. 9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance OXYCONTIN contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance . 9.2 Abuse OXYCONTIN contains oxycodone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. Reference ID: 4326201 The high drug content in extended- release formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse. All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic product s carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non- therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and include s: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. \"Drug -seeking\" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders . Drug -seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated \" loss\" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions , and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider (s). \"Doctor shopping\" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions ) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with a chieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. OXYCONTIN, like other opioids, can be diverted for non- medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record -keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests , as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of the rapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of OXYCONTIN OXYCONTIN is for oral use only. Abuse of OXYCONTIN poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of OXYCONTIN with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved OXYCONTIN enhances drug release and increases the risk of overdose and death. With parenteral abuse, the inactive ingredients in OXYCONTIN can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, increased risk of endocarditis , valvular Reference of thrombotic (a condition characterized clinically by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia) associated with parenteral abuse have been reported. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious dis eases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Abuse Deterrence Studies OXYCONTIN is formulated with inactive ingredients intended to make the tablet more difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. For the purposes of describing the results of studies of the abuse -deterrent characteristics of OXYCONTIN resulting from a change in formulation, in this section, the original formulation of OXYCONTIN, which is no longer marketed, will be referred to as \"original O xyContin\" and the reformulated, currently marketed product will be referred to as \"OXYCONTIN\". In Vitro Testing In vitro physical and chemical tablet manipulation studies were performed to evaluate the success of different extraction methods in defeating the extended -release formulation. Results support that, r elative to original O xyContin, there is an increase in the ability of OXYCONTIN to resist crushing, breaking, and dissolution using a variety of tools and solvents. The results of these studies also support this finding for OXYCONTIN relative to an immedi ate-release oxycodone. When subjected to an aqueous environment, OXYCONTIN gradually forms a viscous hydrogel (i.e., a gelatinous mass) that resists passage through a needle. Clinical Studies In a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled 5- period cr ossover pharmacodynamic study, 30 recreational opioid users with a history of intranasal drug abuse received intranasally administered active and placebo drug treatments. The five treatment arms were finely crushed OXYCONTIN 30 mg tablets, coarsely crushe d OXYCONTIN 30 mg tablets, finely crushed original O xyContin 30 mg tablets, powdered oxycodone HCl 30 mg, and placebo. Data for finely crushed OXYCONTIN, finely crushed original O xyContin, and powdered oxycodone HCl are described below. Drug liking was measured on a bipolar drug liking scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response of neither liking nor disliking, 0 represents maximum disliking and 100 represents maximum liking. Response to whether the subject would take the st udy drug again was also measured on a bipolar scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response, 0 represents the strongest negative response (\"definitely would not take drug again\") and 100 represents the strongest positive response (\"definitely wo uld take drug again\"). Twenty -seven of the subjects completed the study. Incomplete dosing due to granules falling from the subjects' nostrils occurred in 34% (n = 10) of subjects with finely crushed OXYCONTIN, compared with 7% (n = 2) of subjects with finely crushed original O xyContin and no subjects with powdered oxycodone HCl. Reference ID: 4326201The intranasal administration of finely crushed OXYCONTIN was associated with a numerically lower mean and median drug liking score and a lower mean and median score for take drug again, compared to finely crushed original O xyContin or powdered oxycodone HCl as summarized in Table 5. Table 5: Summary of Maximum Drug Liking (E max) Data Following Intranasal Administration VAS Scale (100 mm)* OXYCONTIN (finely crushed) Original OxyContin (finely crushed) Oxycodone HCl Drug Liking Mean ( SE) 80.4 (3.9) 94.0 ( 2.7) 89.3 (3.1) Median (Range) 88 (36-100) 100 (51-100) 100 (50- 100) Take Drug Again Mean ( SE) 64.0 (7.1) 89.6 (3.9) 86.6 (4.4) Median (Range) 78 (0-100) 100 (20-100) 100 (0-100) * Bipolar scales (0 = maximum negative response, 50 = neutral response, 100 = maximum positive response) Figure 1 demonstrates a comparison of drug liking for finely crushed OXYCONTIN compared to powdered oxycodone HCl in subjects who received both treatments. The Y -axis represents the percent of subjects attaining a percent reduction in drug liking for OXYC ONTIN vs. oxycodone HCl powder greater than or equal to the value on the X -axis. Approximately 44% (n = 12) had no reduction in liking with OXYCONTIN relative to oxycodone HCl. Approximately 56% (n = 15) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking w ith OXYCONTIN relative to oxycodone HCl. Thirty -three percent (n = 9) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30% in drug liking with OXYCONTIN compared to oxycodone HCl, and approximately 22% (n = 6) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50% in drug liking with OXYCONTIN compared to oxycodone HCl. Reference ID: 4326201Figure 1: Percent Reduction Profiles for E max of Drug Liking VAS for OXYCONTIN vs. oxycodone HCl, N=27 Following Intranasal Administration The results of a similar analysis of drug liking for finely cr ushed OXYCONTIN relative to finely crushed original O xyContin were comparable to the results of finely crushed OXYCONTIN relative to powdered oxycodone HCl. Approximately 43% (n = 12) of subjects had no reduction in liking with OXYCONTIN relative to original OxyContin. Approximately 57% (n = 16) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking, 36% (n = 10) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30% in drug liking, and approximately 29% (n = 8) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50% in drug liking with OXYCONTIN compared to original O xyContin. Summary The in vitro data demonstrate that OXYCONTIN has physicochemical properties expected to make abuse via injection difficult. The data from the clinical study, along with support from the in vitro data, also indicate that OXYCONTIN has physicochemical properties that are expected to reduce abuse via the intranasal route. However, abuse of OXYCONTIN by these routes, as well as by the oral route, is still possible. Additional data, including epidemi ological data, when available, may provide further information on the impact of the current formulation of OXYCONTIN on the abuse liability of the drug. Accordingly, this section may be updated in the future as appropriate. OXYCONTIN contains oxycodone, an opioid agonist and Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit, including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, OXYCONTIN can be abused and is Reference ID: 4326201subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1)]. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. OXYCONTIN should not be abruptly discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.9 )]. If OXYCONTIN is abruptly discontinued in a physically -dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome: rest lessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, di arrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . 10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with OXYCONTIN can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulm onary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, snoring , and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation , if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. C ardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulator y depression 4326201secondary to oxycodone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. Because the durati on of reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in OXYCONTIN, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. OXYCONTIN will continue to release oxycodone and add to the oxycodone load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion, necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature , administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependen ce and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist. 11 DESCRIPTION OXYCONTIN \u00ae (oxycodone hydrochloride ) extended -release tablets is an opioid agonist supplied in 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablets for oral administration. The tablet strengths describe the amount of oxycodone per tablet as the hydrochloride salt. The structural formula for oxycodone hydrochloride is as follows: C18 H21 NO 4 HCl is a crystalline powder derived from the opium alkaloid, thebaine. Oxycodone hydrochloride dissolves in water (1 g in 6 to 7 mL). It is slightly soluble in alcohol (octanol water partition coefficient 0.7). The 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg tablets contain the following inactive ingredients: butylated magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide. The 10 mg tablets also contain hydroxy propyl cellulose. The 15 mg tablets also contain black iron oxide, yellow iron oxide, and red iron oxide. The 20 mg tablets also contain polysorbate 80 and red iron oxide. The 30 mg tablets also contain polysorbate 80, red iron oxide, yellow iron oxide, and black iron oxide. The 40 mg tablets also contain polysorbate 80 and yellow iron oxide. The 60 mg tablets also contain polysorbate 80, red iron oxide and black iron oxide. The 80 mg tablets also contain hydroxypropyl cellulose, yellow iron oxide and FD&C Blue #2/Indigo Carmine Aluminum Lake. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxycodone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal thera peutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia for oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and C NS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid- like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Reference ID: 432620112.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsi veness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in CO 2 tension and electrical stimulation. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of he morrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in situations [see Overdosage (10)] . Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reducti on in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decre ased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm , resulting in constipation. Other opioid- induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects o n the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Reactions (6.2)] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic -pituitary -gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal r ole of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical , lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Reference ID: 4326201Concen tration -Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective \"drug effect\", analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome , and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Adminis tration (2.1, 2.5)] . Concentration -Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose -related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respir atory depression. In opioid- tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid- related adverse reaction s [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of OXYCONTIN is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. OXYCONTIN is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving OXYCONTIN impairs the controlled- release delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorp tion of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from OXYCONTIN is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60% to 87%. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from OXYCONTIN to that from immediate -release oral dosa ge forms is 100%. Upon repeated dosing with OXYCONTIN in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steady -state levels were achieved within 24- 36 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and u nconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination half -life ( t \u00bd) of oxycodone following the administration of OXYCONTIN was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediate -release oxycodone. Absorption About 60% to 87% of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low pre -systemic and/or first- pass metabolism. Reference ID: 4326201Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for OXYCONTIN 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (C max) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 6) . Given the short elimination t \u00bd of oxycodone, stead y-state plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 24- 36 hours of initiation of dosing with OXYCONTIN. In a study comparing 10 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediate -release oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found t o be equivalent for AUC and C max, and similar for C min (trough) concentrations. TABLE 6 Mean [% coefficient of variation] Regimen Dosage Form AUC (nghr/mL) * (ng/mL) Tmax (hr) Single Dose 10 [27] [21] 15 mg 0-inf data obtained while subjects received naltrexone, which can enhance absorption Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from OXYCONTIN. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steady -state volume of distribution (V ss) for oxycodone was 2.6 L/kg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37\u00b0C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45%. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 )]. Reference ID: 4326201Elimination Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce oxymorphone major circulating mediated N-demethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated O -demethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Noroxycodone exhibits very weak anti -nociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the blood- brain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administrat ion is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( - and \u00df -oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsibl e for keto -reduction and glucuronidation in oxycodone have established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows: free and c onjugated oxycodone conjugated metabolites up to 18%. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 L/min i n adults. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15% greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 21 -45). Age: Pediatric Population In the pediatric age gro up of 11 years of age and older, systemic exposure of oxycodone is expected to be similar to adults at any given dose of OXYCONTIN. Reference ID: 4326201Sex Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25% higher than for male subjects on a body weight -adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.9)]. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50% and 20% higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95% and 65% hi gher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30% and 40%. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t \u00bd for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. Renal I mpairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50% and 20% higher, respectively, values oxyc odone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60%, 50%, and 40% higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t \u00bd for oxycodone of 1 hour. Drug Interaction Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major iso enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Co- administration of OXYCONTIN (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and C max by 170% and 100%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7)]. CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed the a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased max 63%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7)]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine) , such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with OXYCONTIN [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Reference ID: Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fe rtility Carcinogenesis Long -term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have not been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay. Oxycodone was negative when tested at appropriate concentrations in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay, the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice. Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were admini stered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mg/kg /day). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (2 -3 weeks post - cohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to G estation D ay 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( up to 8 mg/kg/day) , up to 1.3 times a human dose of 60 mg/day . 14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adult C linical S tudy A double -blind, placebo -controlled, fixed- dose, parallel group, two- week study was conducted in 133 patients with persistent, moderate to severe pain, who were judged as having inadequate pain control with their current therapy. In this study, OXYCONTIN 20 mg, but not 10 mg, was statistically significant in pain reduction compared with placebo. Pediatric C linical S tudy OXYCONTIN has been evaluated in an open -label clinical trial of 155 opioid- tolerant pediatric patients with moderate to sever e chronic pain . The m ean duration of therapy was 20.7 days (range 1 to 43 days). The s tarting total daily doses ranged from 2 0 mg to 100 mg based on the patient's prior opioid dose . The mean daily dose was 33.30 mg (range 20 to 140 mg/day). In an extension study, 23 of the 155 patients were treated beyond four weeks, including 13 for 28 weeks . Too f ew patients less than 11 years were enrolled in the clinical trial to provide meaningful safety data in this age gr oup.

Revised: 12 /2016 Reference ID: 4326201 Exhibit C DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES SEP 1 0 20'13 Andrew Kolodny, MD President, Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing 920 481h Street, Suite 1510 Brooklyn, NY 11219 Re: Docket No. FDA-2012-P-0818 Dear Dr. Kolodny: Food and Drug Administration 10903 New Hampshire Avenue Building #51 Silver Spring, MD 20993 This letter responds to the citizen petition submitted by Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing (PROP), which was received by FDA on July 26, 2012 (Petition). The Petition describes PROP's concerns about the safety and efficacy of opioid analgesic drugs for long-term use in chronic non-cancer pain, and requests that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency): (1) \"[s]trike the term 'moderate' from analgesics] for non-cancer pain\"; (2) \"[a]dd a maximum equivalent to 100 milligrams of morphine for non-cancer pain\"; and (3) \"[a]dd a duration of 90-days for continuous [daily] use\" for non-cancer pain (Petition at 2). 1 FDA has carefully reviewed PROP's Petition and the numerous comments submitted to the public dockets2 by government entities, medical societies, healthcare providers, patients, and other members of the public. For the reasons described in detail in this response, the Petition is granted in part and denied in part. Today, on the basis of the information discussed below, FDA has notified application holders for extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics that, pursuant to section 505(0)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C 355(0)(4)), important safety labeling changes are needed to the labeling of ER/LA opioid analgesics.3 It is the agency's intent that these changes, which are described more fully below, will help more effectively communicate the serious risks of misuse, abuse, neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), addiction, overdose, and death associated with the use of ER/LA opioids overall, and during pregnancy. FDA has also determined that more data are needed about the safety of long-term use of opioids. Pursuant to section 505( o )(3) of the FD&C Act, FDA is therefore requiring all new drug application (NDA) sponsors of ER/LA opioids to conduct postapproval studies and clinical trials 1 The Petition requests pertain to analgesia products; therefore , this response is limited to opioids with indications for analgesia. 2 FDA received comments on the PROP citizen petition in the above-captioned docket and comments relevant to the PROP citizen petition in the docket for a part 15 hearing the agency held in February 2013, titled Impact of Approved Drug Labeling on Chronic Opioid Therapy (Part 15 Hearing) (see Docket No. FDA-2012-N-J 172). 3 Pursuant to section 505( o )( 4) of the FD&C Act, FDA is notifying holders of approved ND As and holders of approved AND As that reference a NDA that is not currently marketed . (post-marketing requirements, or PMRs) to assess certain known serious risks of ER/LA opioid use: misuse, abuse, hyperalgesia, addiction, overdose, and death. I. BACKGROUND A. Opioids Opioids are a class of powerful pain-relieving agents that includes oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine, among others. When prescribed and used properly, opioids can effectively manage pain and alleviate suffering-clearly a public health priority.4 Chronic pain is a serious and growing public health problem: it \"affects millions of Americans; contributes greatly to national rates of morbidity, mortality, and disability; and is rising in prevalence.\"5 There is also evidence that pain is inadequately treated in many patients.6 However, pain is a self-reported symptom that is difficult to quantify, and its treatment is complex. Opioids also have grave risks, the most well-known of which include addiction, overdose, and even death. The labeling for these products contains prominent warnings about these risks. Moreover, the boxed warning states that all patients should be \"routinely monitor[ ed] ... for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction.\" Even proper use of opioids under medical supervision can result in life-threatening respiratory depression, coma, and death (see Boxed Warning and Section 5.3 of Warnings in current labeling). Indeed, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysis published in February 2013 documents an 11th straight year of increases in drug overdose deaths, with opioids being involved in 75% of pharmaceutical overdose deaths, either alone or in combination with other drugs. 7 Most opioid-only drugs are controlled under Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.8 By law, prescriptions for Schedule II drugs cannot be refilled; patients need a new prescription to obtain the drug beyond the initial number of doses prescribed.9 There are also strict recordkeeping, reporting, and physical security requirements. This level of 4 See \"Relieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research.\" Committee on Advancing Pain Research, Care, and Education; Institute of Medicine. 2011:1- 364 (available at http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record id= 13172). 5Jd. atp. 5. 6 Id. at p. 1. 7 Jones CM, Mack, KA, Paulozzi LJ. Pharmaceutical overdose deaths, United States, CFR 1308.12. There are some in Schedule III (e.g., buprenorphine, see 21 CFR 1308.13(e)(2)(i)) and Schedule IV (e.g., butorphanol pentazocine, see 21 CFR 1308.14(\u00b1)). Tramadol, a synthetic opioid, is not currently scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act, see www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug chem info/tramadol.pdf. 9 Although opioid drug labeling does not recommend a limit on the number of doses a patient should receive, the Schedule II status of most opioid drugs imposes certain restrictions on their availability. 21 CFR 1306.12(a). However, prescribers \"may issue multiple prescriptions authorizing the patient to receive a total of up to a 90-day supply of a Schedule II controlled substance\" as long as certain conditions are met. 21 CFR 1306.12(b)(l). 2 control reflects a finding that most opioid drugs have \"high potential for abuse\" and that \"[a]buse of the drug ... may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.\"10 Opioid drugs have been approved for different conditions of use based on the data and information submitted by the sponsor of each drug product. Accordingly, product labeling may vary among approved opioid drugs, and such drugs may be prescribed to different patient populations.11 The approved indications for ER/LA opioid analgesics are uniform, however. These drugs are currently indicated \"for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time.\"12 The current labeling for these drugs also contains a prominent statement that they are not for use: As an as-needed (pm) analgesic, For pain that is mild or not expected to persist for an extended period of time, For acute pain, In the immediate postoperative period, or For postoperative pain, unless the patient is already receiving chronic opioid therapy prior to surgery, or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. 13 The labeling for some ER/LA opioid analgesics also states that they are for use ( or for use at higher doses) only in opioid-tolerant patients.14 10 21 U.S.C. 812(b )(2). 11 For example, indications for which particular IR opioid products have been approved include \"the management of acute and chronic moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate\" (Oxecta \"the reliefof mild to moderately severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate\" (Codeine sulfate (NDA 022402) labeling, available at www.accessdata.fda. gov/drugsatfda docs/label/2013/022402s006lbl.filli) ; and \"the management of pain in patients where an opioid analgesic is appropriate\" (Dilaudid (hydromorphone hydrochloride) OxyContin docs/label/20 available at www.accessdata.fda. gov/drugsatfda docs/label/2013/0222720ri gls014lbl.pdf(intemal references omitted). 14 See, e.g., (hydromorphone hydrochloride) (NDA 021217) and Duragesic (fentanyl) (NDA 019813). Further, certain opioid drugs also have limitations of use on the higher doses, with labeling stating that higher doses are for opioid-tolerant patients only. See, e.g., labeling for Avinza (morphine sulfate) extended-release capsules (NDA gls014lbl.pdf. 3 B. ER/LA Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy FDA approved a shared-system Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for ER/LA opioid analgesics on July 9, 2012 The goal of the ER/LA Opioid Analgesic REMS is to \"reduce serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing , misuse, and abuse of [ER/LA opioids] while maintaining patient access to pain medications.\"16 Under the REMS, \"[a]dverse outcomes of concern include addiction, unintentional overdose, and death.\"17 The REMS is currently limited to ER/LA opioid products because FDA has concluded that there are disproportionate safety concerns associated with these products compared to immediate-release (IR) \u00b7 .d 18 op101 s. Currently, more than 30 products are subject to the ER/LA Opioid Analgesic REMS.19 The ER/LA Opioid Analgesic REMS contains requirements for distribution of a Medication Guide with each prescription filled, as well as a requirement that training be made available to all those who prescribe ER/LA opioids. Prescriber education training is considered ER/LA Opioid Analgesic REMS-compliant if, among other things, it includes the elements described in the \"FDA Blueprint for Prescriber Education for Extended-Release and Long-Acting Opioid Analgesics\" (FDA Blueprint).20 The FDA Blueprint guidance to prescribers to enable appropriate ER/LA opioid prescribing practices, as well as information prescribers can use in counseling patients about the risks and benefits of ER/LA opioid use. C. Public Input FDA has received a considerable amount of input from stakeholders and other commenters on issues pertaining to the benefits and risks of opioid use. For example, FDA participated in a two-day workshop in May 2012 hosted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), called, \"Assessment of Analgesic Treatment of Chronic Pain: A Scientific Workshop.\"21 Several stakeholders and other members of the public gave presentations 15 See www.fda.gov/downloads(I).ru g~/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetylnformationforPatientsandProviders/UC M311290.pdf (most recently modified in April, 2013). 16 Id. at p. 2. 11 Id. 18 See http://www.fda.gov/Dru gs/DrugSafety/lnformationb yDrugClass/ucm309742.htm# 05; see-also, e.g., Dormitzer, C.

FDA also received over 600 comments to the Part 15 Hearing docket. The majority were from patients voicing concerns that labeling changes could make legitimate patient access to opioid analgesics more difficult.25 The remainder reflected the same diversity of viewpoints and concerns presented during the hearing itself. FDA also received more than 1900 comments on the PROP Petition. Many public health agencies and organizations supported the requests in the Petition, citing concerns about increased opioid use and abuse.26 However, the majority of comments opposed PROP's requests. Many professional societies (e.g., the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Medical Association, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the American Pain Society) did not support the Petition and stated that the data cited by PROP did not support PROP's requests (particularly those requests for limits on dose and duration of use of opioids). Professional societies also expressed concern that the labeling changes requested by PROP were not supported by scientific evidence, and that a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to a maximum dose or duration of treatment would be problematic and inconsistent with the need for individualized treatment and the variability among patient responses to opioids.27 22 See Docket No. FDA-2012-N-0067. 23 See Docket No. FDA-2012-N-1172. 24 See www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-20l2-l2-19/pdf/2012-30516.pd\u00a3 25 However, for privacy reasons, many comments from individual patients are not publicly available on www.regulations.gov. They nevertheless are considered to be included in the public docket. 26 See, e.g., comments from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Docket No. FDA-2012-P-0818-0785); County of Los Angeles Public Health (Docket No. FDA-2012-P-0818-0336); Denver Public Health (Docket No. FDA-2012-P-0818-0677); and the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University (Docket No. FDA-2012-P-0818-0691 ). 27 See, e.g., comments from the American Academy of Pain Medicine (Docket No. FDA-2012-P-0818- 0165); the American Medical AssociatioJJ (o\"ocket No. FDA-2012-P-0818-0783)~ the American Society of Anesthesiologists (Docket No. FDA-2012-P-0818-0246); the American Pain Society (Docket No. FDA- 2012-P-0818-0187); the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (Docket No. FDA- 2012-P-0818-0658); the American Society of Regional Analgesia and Pain Medicine (Docket No. FDA- 2012-P-0818-0276); the Texas Pain Society (Docket No. FDA-2012-P-0818-0331); and the Florida Academy of Pain Medicine (Docket No. FDA-2012-P-0818-0333). Some commenters submitted critiques of PROP's cited studies that identified the studies' limitations. See, e.g., comments from the American Academy of Pain Medicine (Docket No. FDA-2012-P-0818-0165). For example, the Florida Academy of Pain Medicine states, \"it appears that the petitioners are asking for changes to the indications for long-term 5 II. SAFETY LABELING CHANGES After evaluating stakeholder and commenter input regarding opioid labeling, and based on FDA's review ofrelevant literature, FDA has determined that safety labeling changes to the labeling of ER/LA opioid analgesics are needed to more effectively communicate to prescribers the serious risks associated with these drugs, and to more clearly describe the population in whom these drugs should be used in light of these serious risks-thus encouraging better prescribing, monitoring, and patient counseling practices involving these drugs. FDA is therefore exercising its authority under section 505(0)(4) of the FD&C Act to notify application holders that modifications to ER/LA opioid analgesic labeling are needed. 28 It is the agency's intent that these changes will help reduce inappropriate prescribing29 and help curb the increase in misuse, abuse, NOWS, addiction, overdose, and death associated with ER/LA opioid analgesic use. These safety labeling changes apply only to ER/LA opioid analgesics, and, at present, FDA is not requesting or requiring that any labeling changes be made to IR opioids or opioid/non-opioid combination products (which include both an IR opioid and a non\u00ad opioid analgesic).30 Much of the literature FDA reviewed assessed opioid use from all opioid sources, or did not necessarily separate data according to opioid formulation (i.e., ER/LA versus IR or opioid/non-opioid combinations). However, FDA recognizes that ER/LA opioids, as a class of drugs, have disproportionate safety concerns compared to IR opioids or opioid/non-opioid combination products; indeed, the recognition of high-dose opioid therapy (LTHDOT) for non-cancer pain, based on a small number of studies with significant methodological shortcomings and findings that are not conclusive. In short, they are basing their request for label changes on the same kind of evidence they themselves, criticize as being insufficient to support the safety and efficacy ofLTHDOT for non-cancer pain\" (Docket No. FDA-2012-P-0818-0333). 28 Section 901 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of2007 (FDAAA) amended the FD&C Act, as codified in section 505(0)(4) of the FD&CAct, to authorize FDA to require holders of approved drug applications to make safety labeling changes (SLCs) if the agency becomes aware of\"new safety information'\u00b7' that FDA determines should be included in the labeling of the drug. New safety information is information derived from a clinical trial, an adverse event report, a post-approval study (including a study under section 505(0)(3) of the FD&C Act), or peer-reviewed biomedical literature; data derived from the post-market risk identification and analysis system under section 505(k) of the FD&C Act; or other scientific data deemed appropriate by the Agency about, among other things, a serious or an unexpected serious risk associated with use of the drug of which the Agency has become_aware (that may be based on a new analysis of existing information) since the drug was approved, the REMS was approved, or since the last assessment of the approved REMS; or the effectiveness of the approved REMS for the drug obtained since the last assessment of such strategy. See section 505-l(b)(3) of the FD&C Act. 29 Pain patients in the United States receive care from prescribers with different backgrounds and levels of experience and expertise in treating pain. IMS Health, Vector One\u00ae: National (VONA). Data Extracted September 2012. Weblink: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/DrugSafetyand RiskManagementAdvisoryCommittee/UCM337148.pdf. For example, some prescribers may not understand how to identify patients at risk for addiction, how to identify behaviors associated with misuse and abuse, and how to manage patients who are receiving opioids for chronic pain so as to reduce the risks of misuse, abuse, NOWS, addiction, overdose and death. 30 Therefore, the agency denies PROP's Petition insofar as it requests labeling changes for IR opioids, or opioid/non-opioid combination products. 6 disproportionate safety concerns for ER/LA opioids informed FDA's decision to require the ER/LA Opioid Analgesic REMS. For example, data show that the risk for misuse and abuse is greater for ER/LA opioids.31 Because they are intended to release the drug over a longer period of time, many ER/LA opioids contain higher doses of opioids compared to IR opioids or opioid/non,..opioid combinations. This increases the risk of a fatal outcome in the event of an overdose, and may make ER/LA opioids more desirable in the eyes of opioid abusers and addicts. Furthermore, ER/LA opioids are often used in a chronic pain setting. Thus, in light of the risks posed by ER/LA opioids, and the totality of available data on both ER/LA opioids specifically and opioid drugs in general, the Agency has decided to make ER/LA opioid analgesics its current focus. First, FDA is requiring changes to the boxed warning for ER/LA opioid analgesics to give greater emphasis and prominence to the risks of misuse, abuse, NOWS, addiction, overdose, and death. For example, the first sentence of the new boxed warning provides that ER/LA opioids \"expose patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse which can lead to overdose and death.\" The new boxed warning also urges prescribers to \"assess each patient's risk\" before prescribing, and to \"monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions.\" Second, FDA is requiring changes to the Indications and Usage section of the labeling. As noted above, ER/LA opioid analgesics currently are \"indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time.\"32 The Agency has concluded that use of terminology predicated only on a categorical \"severity scale\" (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) to characterize the intensity of pain for which ER/LA opioids are indicated does not sufficiently focus prescribers' attention on their responsibility to make an individualized assessment of patient needs in light of the serious risks of ER/LA opioids. Given these serious risks, especially those of overdose and death, the Agency believes that clarity as to the appropriate use of such drugs is of the utmost importance. The new language clearly communicates to prescribers that ER/LA opioid analgesics should be used only when alternative treatments are inadequate because of the serious risks of these drugs. The new language also identifies specific examples of alternative treatment options, namely, \"non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids,\" and provides additional guidance on when such treatments may be deemed inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.\u00b7 Furthermore, the new labeling language underscores that patients in pain should be assessed not only by their rating on a categorical pain intensity scale, but also based on a 31 Dormitzer, C. Opioid Abuse and Misuse: Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and the Drug Abuse Warning Network. Joint Meeting of the Anesthetic and Life Support Drugs Advisory Committee (ALSDAC) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (DSaRM).

This framework better enables prescribers to make decisions based on a patient's individual needs, given the serious risks associated with ER/LA opioids, against a backdrop of alternatives such as IR opioids and non-opioid analgesics. It allows prescribers to make an assessment of pain relative to a patient's ability to perform daily activities or enjoy a reasonable quality oflife, not only on where a patient's pain falls on an intensity scale, and assess if ER/LA opioids are needed after determining whether (a) the pain is severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment, and (b) if alternatives to ER/LA opioids are inadequate to manage such pain, in light of the serious risks associated with ER/LA opioid analgesics. The revised indication language reads as follows: \"[Tradename] is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release opioid formulations, reserve [Tradename] for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. [Tradename] is not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic.\" This new language is intended to prompt prescribers to more closely assess each individual patient's condition, and carefully evaluate whether alternative treatment options such as non-opioid analgesics or IR opioids are appropriate. The new language is intended to reflect that ER/LA opioid analgesics should be prescribed only when the prescriber determines that such alternatives are ineffective, not tolerated, or would otherwise be inadequate. Third, FDA is notifying application holders of the need for changes to the Dosage and Administration, Warnings and Precautions, Drug Interactions, and Use in Specific Populations sections of ER/LA opioid analgesic labeling. These changes are specifically intended to urge prescribers to weigh carefully whether the benefits of an ER/LA opioid outweigh its serious risks on a patient-by-patient basis. If an ER/LA opioid analgesic is prescribed, the labeling changes emphasize that prescribers should monitor patients carefully for signs of abuse and addiction. FDA is also notifying application holders of the need for changes to the Patient Counseling Information and the product-specific Medication Guides to improve the communication of risks to patients.33 The Agency 33 Following the approval of the safety labeling changes, a REMS modification will be required to incorporate the approved safety labeling changes into the REMS materials, as applicable. 8 believes that the changes will improve communication of serious risks associated with the use of these products and help improve the safe use of ER/LA opioid analgesics overall. FDA intends these changes to enable not only a more careful and thorough approach to determining whether ER/LA opioid analgesics should be prescribed for a particular patient, but also allows prescribers to better assess whether the serious risks associated with ER/LA opioids, including the risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and death associated with ER/LA formulations, are offset by the benefits ER/LA opioids may provide in managing pain for an individual patient. Accordingly, PROP'srequest that FDA remove the term \"moderate\" from the indication for ER/LA opioid analgesic drugs is granted for the reasons explained above. As explained above, the changes to the labeling also reflect a departure from an indication based solely on a severity scale, and transitions to an indication that facilitates careful prescribing decisions based on an individualized assessment of a patient's situation (i.e., whether an individual's pain is severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long\u00ad term opioid treatment) and a heightened recognition that, because of the serious risks associated with the use of these drugs, ER/LA opioids should be used only when alternative treatment options are inadequate. 34 All of PROP' s labeling change requests are limited to .\"non-cancer\" pain, a distinction that is not made in current ER/LA opioid analgesic labeling. It is FDA's view that a patient without cancer, like a patient with cancer, may suffer from chronic pain, and PROP has not provided scientific support for why labeling should recommend different treatment for such patients. In addition, FDA knows of no physiological or pharmacological basis upon which to differentiate the treatment of chronic pain in a cancer setting or patient from the treatment of chronic pain in the absence of cancer, and comments to the Petition docket reflect similar concems.35 FDA therefore declines to make a distinction between cancer and non-cancer chronic pain in opioid labeling. 36 In accordance with section 505(0)(4) of the FD&C Act, the ER/LA opioid analgesic application holders are required to submit by October 10, 2013, a supplement proposing changes to the approved labeling to reflect the new safety information, or else notify the Agency that they do not believe labeling changes are warranted and submit a statement detailing the reasons why changes are not warranted.37 34 When other analgesics are contraindicated or ineffective, restricting the indication of opioid drugs to treatment of severe pain only could leave some patients with chronic pain with an impaired ability to carry out daily activities, resulting in a diminished quality oflife. See National Pharmaceutical Council (2001): Pain: Current Understanding of Assessment, Management, and Treatments, http://www.npcnow.org/App Themes/Public/pdtnssues/pub related research/pub quality care/Pain\u00ad Current-Understanding-of-Assessment-Management-and-Treatments.pdf 35 See, e.g., comments from National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (Docket No. FDA-2012-P- 0678); Purdue Pharma (Docket No. FDA-2012-P-0818-0707). 36 FDA notes that some epidemiology studies make distinctions between cancer and non cancer pain. However, while such classifications may be standard in epidemiological research, FDA believes that they are not relevant to ER/LA opioid labeling. 37 See section 505(o)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act. 9 If the ER/LA opioid application holders do not submit the requested safety labeling changes, or if FDA disagrees with alternative language that the companies propose, the FD&C Act provides timelines under section 505( o )( 4) for discussions regarding the labeling changes. 38 At the conclusion of these discussions, section 505( o )( 4)(E) authorizes FDA to issue an order directing labeling changes as appropriate. III. POSTAPPROV AL SAFETY STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS ER/LA opioid drugs generally have been approved in part based on randomized, controlled clinical trials that lasted for a 12-week period. This is due, in part, to the fact that for chronic pain, it can be difficult to ensure subject participation in controlled trials beyond 12 weeks. Many commenters, including PROP, have voiced increasing concern about the lack of controlled clinical trial\u00b7data evaluating opioid use longer than 12-weeks. FDA is not aware of adequate and well-controlled39 studies of opioid use longer than 12 weeks.40 FDA has evaluated concerns pertaining to the serious risks of misuse, abuse, hyperalgesia,41 addiction, overdose, and death associated with opioid use. The Agency acknowledges that the available data demonstrate an association-though not necessarily a causal relationship-between opioid dose and certain serious risks of opioid use. However, FDA also agrees that more data are needed regarding the relationship between opioid dose and adverse effects, and the relationship between opioid duration of use and adverse effects, before the Agency can determine whether additional action needs to be taken. More data are also needed on the point at which the risks of opioid use at escalating doses and longer durations of treatment may outweigh the benefits of opioid analgesic therapy. Thus, FDA is exercising its authority under section 505(o)(3)(A) through (B) of the FD&C Act to require ER/LA opioid drug sponsors to conduct PMRs to assess the known serious risks of misuse, abuse, hyperalgesia, addiction, overdose, and death associated with the long-term use of opioid analgesics. FDA has established milestone dates for 38 See section 505(o)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act. 39 In this setting, \"well-controlled studies\" exclude active-controlled trials because they lack assay sensitivity, and failure to detect a statistically significant difference is difficult to interpret-either both drugs had the desired effect or both drugs did not have the desired effect. 40 There are numerous uncontrolled studies that have evaluated patients on opioids for as long as a year; although some patients drop out of the studies over this period of time, many remain on opioid therapy, which may suggest that they continue to experience benefits that would warrant the risks of opioid use. 41 Hyperalgesia is a known serious risk associated with chronic opioid analgesic therapy in which the patient becomes more sensitive to certain painful stimuli over time. See, e.g., Varney SM, Bebarta VS. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia--worsening pain in opioid-dependent patients. Am J Emerg Med. Feb;3 l (2):458.e5-6; Angst MS, Clark Hyperalgesia A Qualitative Systematic Review. Anesthesiology 2006; 104:570-87. It also may lead to increased use of opioid analgesics. See, e.g., Chapman CR, Davis J, Donaldson GW, Naylor J, Winchester D. Postoperative pain trajectories in chronic pain patients undergoing surgery: the effects of chronic opioid pharmacotherapy on acute pain. J Pain 2011; 12: 1240-6. 10 completion of these studies and clinical trials, and is encouraging ER/LA opioid application holders to work together on these studies and clinical trials to provide the best information possible. First, the sponsors will have the opportunity to discuss with the Agency the particulars of the design and conduct of these PMRs.42 We expect that this process will be completed in time for sponsors to submit final protocols to FDA within one year (i.e., no later than August 2014). Sponsors must periodically report on the status of the studies and clinical trials.43 The milestones for completion vary by study, with some expected to be completed as early as August 2015 and others expected to be completed in 2018. As with the safety labeling changes, FDA is requiring PMRs only of ER/LA opioid analgesic application holders. While a majority of the literature that FDA reviewed did not distinguish between opioid formulation and/or composition, such as ER/LA versus IR opioids, or single ingredient opioids versus opioid/non-opioid combination products, FDA has made the determination that PMRs should be required of ER/LA opioid analgesic application holders to assess the known serious risks of misuse, abuse, hyperalgesia, addiction, overdose and death. FDA is taking this approach for the same reasons the Agency has decided to require safety labeling changes for ER/LA opioid analgesics: as discussed in greater detail in section II, above, FDA recognizes that ER/LA opioids, as a class of drugs, have disproportionate safety concerns compared to IR opioids or opioid/non-opioid combination products44 and because ER/LA opioids are often used in a chronic pain setting. Thus, in light of the serious risks of ER/LA opioids, and the totality of available data, the Agency has decided to make ER/LA opioid analgesics its current focus for requiring PMRs. IV. REQUESTS FOR MAXIMUM DOSE AND DURATION OF USE The Agency declines to specify or recommend a maximum daily dose or duration of use for any opioid at this time, for the reason described below. However, FDA has determined that PMRs are necessary to assess the known, serious risks of misuse, abuse, hyperalgesia, addiction, overdose, and death. These studies will address, among other things, the effect of dose and duration of opioid use on these serious risks. A. Maximum Daily Dose PROP requests that FDA \"add a maximum daily dose\" of the equivalent of 100 milligrams (mg) of morphine (100 mg morphine equivalent dose (MED)) to opioids 42 See Guidance for Industry, Postmarketing Studies and Clinical Trials-Implementation of Section 505(0)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (April 2011) at 12. 43 Section 505(o)(3)(iii) of the FD&C Act. 44 See, e.g., Dormitzer, C. Opioid Abuse and Misuse: Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and the Drug Abuse Warning Network. Joint Meeting of the Anesthetic and Life Support Drugs Advisory Committee (ALSDAC) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (DSaRM). UMUC Inn and Conference Center by Marriott, Adelphi, MD, July 22-23, 2010 (available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisotyCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/AnestheticAnd AnalgesicDrugProductsAdvisotyCommittee/UCM220950.pdf). 11 (Petition at 2). In support of PROP's request, the Petition asserts that high-dose chronic opioid therapy is associated with increased risk of overdose death,45 increased risk of emergency room visits,46 and increased risk of fractures in the elderly,47 (Petition at 2). PROP also maintains that \"three large observational studies published in 2010 and 2011 found dose-related overdose risk\" in patients on chronic opioid therapy (Petition at 2). FDA agrees that adverse events and substance abuse of opioids occur at high doses-but adverse events can also occur at doses less than 100 mg MED. FDA also acknowledges that the available data do suggest a relationship between increasing opioid dose and risk of certain adverse events. However, the available information does not demonstrate that the relationship is necessarily a causal one. FDA has reviewed the studies cited in support of PROP's request, as well as studies cited in comments to the Petition docket and other studies described in the literature. For the reasons discussed in further detail below, the scientific literature does not support establishing a maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg MED. Further, creating a maximum dose of 100 mg MED, or another dose ceiling, could imply a superior opioid safety profile under that set threshold, \u00b7 when there are no data to support such a conclusion. The Agency therefore denies PROP's request that opioid labeling specify a maximum daily dose. 1. Cited Data Do Not Define a Relationship between Opioid Dose and Risk of Fractures in the Elderly FDA agrees that the Saunders study48 PROP cites suggests a positive trend between opioid dose and fractures in the elderly. However, the elderly population is at risk for falls and fractures in general, and has more co-morbidities and more rapid fluctuations in health status than the overall adult population. The Saunders study did not take into account any co-morbidities in the elderly patients that arose after the initial patient visit when pain was diagnosed and an opioid was prescribed and the absence of that information may have confounded the results. Without additional data and a replication of the study's apparent finding, it would be premature to conclude that the risks ofhigh\u00ad dose opioids outweigh their benefits in this population. Additionally, the highest dose\u00ad level in the Saunders study40 was >50 mg MED, therefore, it did not directly address the 100 mg MED cutoff. 2. Cited Data Do Not Define a Relationship between Opioid Dose and Emergency Room Visits 45 See Gomes T, Mamdani MM, Dhalla IA, et al., Opioid dose and drug-related mortality in patients with nonmalignant pain. Arch Intern Med, 2011; 171: 686-91. 46 See Braden JB, Russo J, Fan MY, et al. Emergency department visits among recipients of chronic opioid therapy. Arch Intern Med 201 O; 170:1425-32. 47 See Saunders KW, Dunn KM, Merrill JO, et al., Relationship of opioid use and dosage levels to fractures in older chronic pain patients. J Gen Intern Med, 2010;25:310-5. 48 Saunders KW, Dunn KM, Merrill JO, et al., Relationship of opioid use and dosage levels to fractures in older chronic pain patients. J Gen Intern Med, 2010;25:310~5. 12 FDA does not agree with PROP's contention that the Braden study49 demonstrated a clear dose-response relationship between high dose opioid therapy and emergency room visits for recipients of chronic opioid therapy for non-cancer pain. Braden et al. examined the association between opioid dose and emergency room visits in two populations: a national, commercially insured population and a state-based publicly insured population. The study categorized opioid dose according to 3 levels: (1) 0 MED to the median MED of the population at issue50 (Category 1); (2) the median MED of the given population to 120 mg MED/day (Category 2); and (3) >120 mg MED/day (Category 3). When compared to Category 1 patients, Category 2 and Category 3 patients appeared to have an increased risk of emergency room visits-but only in one study population. Furthermore, Category 3 patients did not appear to have a greater risk of emergency room visits than Category 2 patients in that study population. Taken together, the findings of this study were inconclusive with respect to the relationship between opioid dose and emergency room visits. Furthermore, FDA is concerned that this study did not fully adjust for important factors that may confound the association between opioid dose and health services use, such as race and income.51 FDA therefore concludes that the Braden study does not support PROP's request to limit the maximum daily dose of opioids. 3. Cited Data Do Not Define a Relationship between Opioid Dose and Death PROP cites three observational studies (by Dunn, et al.,52 Bohnert, et al.,53 and Gomes, et al54) to support that higher doses of opioids are associated with higher risks of overdose\u00ad related death. Although these studies have several important limitations,55 FDA agrees 49 Braden JB, Russo J, Fan MY, et al., Emergency department visits among recipients of chronic opioid therapy. Arch Intern Med, 2010; 170: 1425-32. 50 Note that the mean MED was different in the two study populations. 51 Examples of other potential confounders include past health service use, alcohol use, or numbers of total medications used concurrently with opioids. See Braden JB, Russo J, Fan MY, et al., Emergency department visits among recipients of chronic opioid therapy. Arch Intern Med, 201 O; 170: 1425-32. 52 Dunn KM, Saunders KW, Rutter CM, et al., Opioid prescriptions for chronic pain and overdose: a cohort study. Annals oflnternal Medicine, 2010; 152:85-92. 53 Bohnert AS, IA, et al., Opioid dose and drug-related mortality in patients with nonmalignant pain. Arch Intern Med, 2011; 171: 686-91. 55 For example, the Dunn and Gomes studies did not discuss the reason the patients had been prescribed opioid therapy. It is possible that the patients' underlying illnesses (or the severity thereof) may have increased the risk of death or other adverse events-and without additional information, FDA cannot evaluate PROP's assumption that these adverse events can be attributed to opioid use alone. None of the three studies-Dunn, Bohnert, or Gomes-examined the role of the opioid's formulation (e.g., IR vs. ER/LA opioids) in their analyses, and it is possible that different formulations may have differing impacts on overdose-related outcomes. In addition, none of the three studies included data about what doses the patients actually took (as opposed to the doses they were prescribed), or data about whether the patients complied with the instructions they received about proper opioid use. Indeed, in the Bohnert study, almost half of the decedent population experienced an unintentional opioid-related death when the maximum prescribed dose was equal to O mg per day-which raises questions not only about the amount of opioids 13 that these studies appear to credibly suggest a positive association between high-dose opioid use and the risk of overdose and/or overdose mortality. Indeed, these studies appear to demonstrate a statistically significantly higher risk of overdose death among those taking opioid doses of> 100 mg MED compared to those taking opioid doses of 1- 19 mg MED. Unfortunately, the point at which the risk of overdose-related death increases enough to change the benefit-risk assessment of the studied opioids cannot be determined from these studies. Determining such a threshold would require a better \u00b7understanding of how risk of overdose and/or overdose mortality changes along the continuum of opioid dose (from O mg through the highest doses taken by patients). This dose-response (i.e. overdose and/or overdose mortality) relationship should be analyzed treating opioid use as a continuous variable or using categories defined by small increments ( e.g., 1 mg MED, or per 5 mg MED). Thus, even though the aforementioned studies demonstrated a statistically significantly higher risk of overdose death for patients taking the highest studied doses compared with patients taking the lowest studied doses, the threshold for an increased risk associated with these drugs could actually be considerably lower or higher than a maximum daily dose of 100 mg MED. B. Maximum Duration of Treatment The PROP Petition requests that FDA \"[a]dd a maximum duration of 90 days for continuous ( daily) use\" (Petition at 2). In support of this request, the Petition alleges that \"[l]ong-term safety and effectiveness of managing [pain] with opioids has not been established.\" After a review of the literature cited in the Petition, and an assessment of other relevant information discussed below, FDA has determined that limiting the duration of use for opioid therapy to 90 days is not supportable. Thus, the Agency denies this request. 1. Treatment Guidelines In support of its request, PROP cites to the American Pain Society-American Academy of Pain Medicine Opioids Guidelines. However, these guidelines state that chronic opioid therapy can be an effective therapy for carefully selected and monitored patients. 56 The guidelines recommend individualized care, management plans, and monitoring-not a maximum duration oftreatment.57 For example, they note that \"proper patient selection is critical,\" requiring \"a comprehensive benefit-to-harm evaluation that weighs the the patients actually took, but also the possibility that other causes of death may have mistakenly been assessed as opioid-related. Furthermore, the Dunn study described only 6 deaths in its discussion of 51 overdose-related outcomes, and it did not differentiate between deaths and other overdose outcomes in its analysis. Thus, it is less informative on the question of an association between opioid dose and death. 56 See Chou R, Fanciullo GJ, Fine PG, et al., American Pain Society-American Academy of Pain Medicine Opioids Guidelines Panel. Clinical guidelines for the use of chronic opioid therapy in chronic non-cancer pain. J Pain, 2009; 10: 113-130. 57 See generally id. 14 potential positive effects of opioids on pain and function against potential risks'.\"58 The guidelines also strongly recommend that\"[ o ]pioid selection, initial dosing, and titration ... be individualized according to the patient's health status, previous exposure to opioids, attainment of therapeutic goals, and predicted or observed harms.\"59 The decision whether to proceed with opioid therapy, according to the guidelines, \"should be intentional and based on careful consideration of outcomes\" of the initial course of opioid treatment, which should be treated as a \"short-term, therapeutic trial lasting from several weeks to several months. \"60 These guidelines are consistent with the new indication for ER/LA opioids: a focus on treatment decisions that include a thorough patient-specific assessment of the appropriateness of ER/LA opioids for that patient, and that reflect careful thought by prescribers and patients alike. 2. Cited Data on Persistence of Chronic Pain and Long-Term Opioid Use Are Inconclusive PROP cites surveys by Sullivan, et al. 61 and Eriksen, et al. 62 to support its assertion that \"[ r ]ecent surveys of [ chronic non-cancer pain] patients receiving [ chronic opioid therapy] have shown that many continue to experience significant chronic pain and dysfunction\" (Petition at 2). The Eriksen survey supports this assertion but is insufficient to conclude that chronic opioid therapy causes or contributes to chronic pain and dysfunction, or that it is ineffective in treating chronic pain and dysfunction. Although the survey found that the pain severity reported at the time of the survey was higher among respondents who were using opioids than those who were not using opioids, there was no assessment of pain severity prior to the time of the survey. Thus, patients who were using opioids could have suffered from higher levels of pain pre-survey than those who were not using opioids. Pain improvement was not measured. The Sullivan survey found that patients with chronic non-cancer pain treated with chronic opioid therapy reported being in pain 162 of the past 180 days (90% of days), and 92% of that sample reported pain on at least 90 days. These data suggest that patients on chronic opioid therapy experienced significant chronic pain, and that they continued to experience pain throughout their therapy. However, the study did not survey similar patients who did not receive opioid treatment. Without such a comparison group, it is unclear what the patients' pain trajectory would have been had they not been on chronic opioid therapy. Thus, this survey does not address the question of whether chronic non\u00ad cancer pain patients fare better or worse on chronic opioid therapy. 58 Id. at 115. 59 Id. at 117. 60 Id. 61 Sullivan MD, Von KM, Banta-Green C, Merrill JO, Saunders K.

Critical issues on opioids in chronic non\u00ad cancer pain: an epidemiological'study. Pain 2006;125(1-2):172-179. 15 3. Cited Data on Long-term Opioid Use and Addiction Do Not Establish a Threshold for Maximum Duration of Use PROP's Petition contends that opioids should be given a maximum duration of use based in part on a study of \"[a] large sample of medical and pharmacy claims records[, which] found that two-thirds of patients who took opioids on a daily basis for 90 days were still taking opioids five years later\" (Petition at 2). FDA disagrees with this statement.63 Although the study follow-up lasted roughly 5 years, not all patients who were started on chronic opioid therapy were followed for that duration. Approximately half of the study population was followed two years or less (the median follow-up time was around 2 years). Throughout the course of the study period, some patients were censored due to death, disenrollment from health coverage, or other reasons. Patients who were censored may have had a different duration of therapy than those who continued to be followed. In FDA's view, the study showed that, among patients who were followed for 4.8 years, two-thirds were still taking opioids at the end of this period. FDA also does not agree that these data necessarily reflect a safety concern specific to longer term use. Although some portion of these results certainly could be explained by adverse outcomes (e.g., addiction in opioid therapy patients), other factors may also be associated with low discontinuation rates ( e.g., certain intractable or recalcitrant pain conditions that may require longer treatment periods). The referenced study did not collect data on why patients continued or discontinued opioid therapy, and without this information, it would be premature to restrict opioid use to a 90-day maximum duration treatment period. The Petition also asserts that \"[r]ecent surveys using [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders] DSM criteria found high rates of addiction in [ chronic non-cancer pain] patients receiving [chronic opioid therapy]\" (Petition at 2). FDA agrees with this assertion.64 However, the cited surveys did not suggest that chronic opioid therapy causes addiction, or vice versa. Both addiction and chronic opioid therapy were measured at one,point in time, so it is unknown which happened first: addiction or chronic opioid therapy. The cited literature does not identify a duration threshold beyond which the risk of addiction outweighs the benefits of opioid treatment. PROP has selected a 90-day limit, but provides no evidence that addiction (however it is defined) increases significantly after 90 days of use such that it would support a labeling change. Nevertheless, the high 63 See Martin BC, Fan MY, Edlund MJ, De Vries A, Braden JB, Sullivan MD. Long-term chronic opioid therapy discontinuation rates from the TROUP study. J Gen Intern Med 2011;26(12):1450-1457. 64 However, the recently published Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - V (DSM V) combines the substance abuse and substance dependence categories into a single disorder measured on a continuum, to try to avoid an inappropriate linking of \"addiction\" with \"physical dependence,\" which are distinct issues. See American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Fifth Edition. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2013: 16 rates of addiction shown in the cited literature are concerning enough to require further exploration in postapproval studies. 4. Cited Data Are Insufficient to Explain Association between Opioid Use and Mental Health Co-Morbidities The Petition asserts that \"[p ]atients with mental health and substance abuse co\u00ad morbidities are mote likely to receive [ chronic opioid therapy] than patients who lack these risk factors, a phenomenon referred to as adverse selection.\" In support of this assertion, PROP cites to a study by Edlund et al., 65 which examined trends in opioid prescribing among individuals with non-cancer pain, with and without mental health and substances disorders. Although the Edlund study supports the association between current mental health and substance abuse co-morbidities and current use of chronic opioid therapy, FDA is unable to determine the reasons for this association in a cross-sectional analysis. This study only depicts the frequencies and prevalence of chronic opioid therapy in different sub\u00ad populations at one point in time, and the temporal relationship between mental health and substance abuse comorbidities and opioid therapy cannot be established. Thus, it is difficult to form any conclusions based on this study regarding the relationship between mental health/substance abuse disorders and the initiation, dose and duration of chronic opioid therapy. In sum, FDA agrees with the study's authors that the cited study does not conclude that the association between opioid use and mental/substance use disorder is due to any one specific factor.66 FDA acknowledges that patients with these co-morbid conditions may be at higher risk of adverse outcomes-possibly because they may be more likely to be treated with other psychoactive drugs. The results of the Edlund study thus underscore the need for prescribers to evaluate carefully whether and under what circumstances to prescribe opioids (particularly in high doses) to patients with these co-morbidities.67 However, the findings of the Edlund study do not support PROP's argument that opioid labeling should include a maximum daily dose or a maximum duration of use. 65 Edlund MJ, Fan MY, De Vries A, Braden JB, Martin BC, Sullivan MD. Trends in use of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain among individuals with mental health and substance use disorders: the TROUP Study. Clin J Pain 2010;26:l-8. 66 The authors state that they \"cannot definitively state why NCPC enrollees with MH [mental health]/SUDs [substances use disorders] were likely to than NCPC [non-cancer pain conditions] enrollees without MH/SUDs, and to receive them chrmiically[ ... ].\" Id. at 6. 67 For example, section 5.1 of ER/LA opioid analgesic labeling, as provided for in the safety labeling change notification letters referred to above, contains the following language: \"Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of [Tradename] for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as [Tradename ], but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of [Tradename] along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.\" 17 V. CONCLUSION For the reasons stated above, the Petition is granted in part and denied in part. Sincerely, Jane oodcock,l\\.1.D.

Welch Senate Clerk State House Room 335 Boston, MA 02133 Dear Mr. Clerk, The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) is pleased to submit the attached initial report on the opioid overdose study authorized by Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2015. The current opioid epidemic affecting our Co mmonwealth's communities has taken a record number of lives in each of the la st four years. Opioid Use Disorder is a complex chronic disease, and this opioid epidemic is a complex and persistent problem that will not be solved through a single solution. Analytic work is ongoing, and mu ch is yet to be learned from this effort, however, the findings of this init ial report can immediately inform our collective work with new insight into overdose-related de aths and the relative risks fa ced by different populations. I would like to acknowledge that this work has required a sign ificant collaborative effort from many government agencies. To this end, we are tr uly grateful to the many partners which have assisted DPH in this work so far. This effort highlights government's ability to work collaboratively towards efficiently solving comp lex and urgent problems. With the effort of legal, technical, and analytical teams across seve n state agencies (Departm ent of Public Health, EOHHS IT, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, the Department of Correction, MassHealth, the Center for Health Information and Analysis, and MassIT), Massachusetts has The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Executive Office of Heal th and Human Services Department of Public Health 250 Washington Street, Boston, MA 02108-4619 CHARLES D. BAKER Governor KARYN E. POLITO Lieutenant Governor MARYLOU SUDDERS Secretary MONICA BHAREL, MD, MPH Commissioner Tel: 617-624-6000 www.mass.gov/dph been able to develop a novel data model that allo ws for simultaneous analysis of 10 datasets with information relevant to opioid deaths. The goodw ill of all parties has been a hallmark of this ongoing work. I would also like to express my appreciation for the continued opportunity the Legislature has provided the Department of Public Health. The analytic approach authorized by Chapter 55 has enabled Massachusetts to serve as a national ex ample for the possibilities of public health's ability to leverage data warehousing to respond to pressing policy and health concerns by allowing existing data to be leveraged in new and innovative ways to support policy development and decision making, and to allocate resources more efficiently and effectively. To this end, other states have already engaged the Department in discussi ons about the technical aspects of this project, and I hope that this will serve as a model for how complex problems can be tackled in the future. Let me once again express how grateful I am for the Legislature's commitment to better understanding the root causes of this opioid epidemic by allowing us to continue this important work. I look forward to continuing to share the results of our analyses, and to our continued partnership in addressing this opioid epidemic.

Any report or supplemental reports resulting from this examination shall provide any data in an aggregate and deidentified format. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, to facilitate the examination, the department shall request, and the relevant offices and agencies shall provide, information necessary to complete the examination from the division of medical assistance, the executive office of public safety and security, the center for health information and analysis, the office of patient protection and the chief justice of the trial court, which may include, but shall not be limited to: data from the prescription drug monitoring program; the allpayer claims database; the criminal offender record information database; and the court activity record information. To the extent feasible, the department shall request data from the Massachusetts Sheriffs Association, Inc. relating to treatment within houses of correction. Not later than 1 year from the effective date of this act, the secretary of health and human services shall publish a report on the findings of the examination including, but not limited to: (i) instances of multiple provider episodes, meaning a single patient having access to opiate prescriptions from more than 1 provider; (ii) instances of polysubstance access, meaning a patient having simultaneous prescriptions for an opiate and a benzodiazepine or for an opiate and another drug which may enhance the effects or the risks of drug abuse or overdose; (iii) the overall opiate prescription history of the individuals, including whether the individuals had access to legal prescriptions for opiate drugs at the time of their deaths; (iv) whether the individuals had previously undergone voluntary or involuntary treatment for substance addiction or behavioral health; (v) whether the individuals had attempted to enter but were denied access to treatment for substance addiction or behavioral health; (vi) whether the individuals had received past treatment for a substance overdose; (vii) whether any individuals had been previously detained or incarcerated and, if so, whether the individuals had received treatment during the detention or incarceration. The report shall be filed with the clerks of the senate and house of representatives, the house and senate chairs of the joint committee on mental health and substance abuse, the joint committee on public health, the joint committee on health care financing and the house and senate committees on ways and means. The secretary of health and human services may publish supplemental reports on the trends identified through its examination; provided, however, that any supplemental report shall be filed not later than July 1, 2017 and shall be filed with the clerks of the senate and house of representatives, the house and senate chairs of the joint committee on mental health and substance abuse, the joint 7committee on public health, the joint committee on health care financing and the house and senate committees on ways and means. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the executive office of health and human services may contract with a nonprofit or educational entity to conduct data analytics on the data set generated in the examination, provided that the executive office shall implement appropriate privacy safeguards. 8Executive Summary Background Since 2000, opioidrelated deaths have increased in Massachusetts by 350%. The recent rate of increase is several times faster than anything seen before1 with every community in Massachusetts impacted by the current opioid epidemic. However, beneath this statewide impact, data indicates that some areas of the Commonwealth have been disproportionately impacted by this opioid epidemic. In particular, southeastern Massachusetts and Essex County have been inordinately affected. Just as communities are differentially impacted by the current opioid epidemic, population groups are also differently burdened. Opioidrelated death rates are highest among younger males - a fact that is similar in all states.2 Opioidrelated death rates are also higher among those who have recently been released from Massachusetts prisons, those who have obtained opioid prescriptions from multiple pharmacies, and those who have obtained prescription opioids in combination with other scheduled medications. As part of a multifaceted effort to address this unprecedented public health crisis, Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2015 (Chapter 55) was passed by the Massachusetts Legislature and signed into law by Governor Charles D. Baker in August 2015. This new law permits the linkage and analysis of existing data across state government in order to better guide policy development and programmatic decision making to successfully tackle the current opioid epidemic. Chapter 55 articulates seven questions to be addressed in this initial report. Detailed responses to each question can be found in Appendix A. In addition, Chapter 55 permits examinations beyond these seven questions, providing the Department of Public Health (DPH) an opportunity to build an even more comprehensive picture of the current opioid crisis. To this end, DPH has connected ten datasets managed by five state agencies to build a data warehouse structure - a concept viewed by national experts as the future of successful public health. While this initial report includes the first findings from the crossagency analyses of these ten datasets, analytic work is ongoing, and much is yet to be learned from this nationally leading effort. Contained within this report are descriptions of four specific analyses that directly respond to questions posed by Chapter 55, providing the state with important new insights into the profile of overdose related deaths and the relative risks faced by the Commonwealth's diverse populations. The importance of these findings has prompted the Department to issue initial recommendations to inform policy and response efforts across the state and region. Key Findings 1 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/quality/drugcontrol/county levelpmp/data briefoverdose deathsmay 2016.pdf 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics. Multiple Cause of Death 19992014 on CDC WONDER Online Database, released 2015. Data are from the Multiple Cause of Death Files, 19992014, as compiled from data provided by the 57 vital statistics jurisdictions through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. Accessed at http://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd icd10.html . 9Prescription Drugs Fuel This Epidemic, but IllegallyObtained Substances More Closely Linked to Overdose Deaths: Using these data, it was determined that illegallyobtained substances are much more frequently present in postmortem toxicology than prescription drugs (i.e., a Schedule IIIII opioids, or benzodiazepines). While prescription drug use can result in addiction and may increase the longterm risk of death, illegal drugs appear more likely to be the direct cause of death. As a result, increasing the availability of harm reduction strategies and interventions that target Heroin, Fentanyl, and polysubstance use (especially opioid use concurrent with benzodiazepine and/or Cocaine use) could significantly reduce the opioidrelated death rate. Medication Assisted Treatment Reduces the Risk of Fatal Opioid Overdose: Another key finding from these data is that receiving evidencebased opioid agonist treatment following a nonfatal overdose was associated with a reduced risk of a subsequent fatal opioid overdose. This suggests that overdose survivors have a short window of opportunity after a nonfatal overdose to reduce their risk of death by undergoing an evidencebased medication assisted treatment (MAT). A comprehensive plan for delivering evidencebased MAT, such as buprenorphine or methadone treatment, to treat opioid use disorder for those with high overdose risk could significantly lower the death rate. This report only includes data for statefunded opioid agonist treatment (i.e. Buprenorphine or Methadone). Work is ongoing to examine risk reductions associated with additional MATs including naltrexone.3 Women are More Likely than Men to Experience a Fatal Overdose Due to Prescription Opioid Use: While men were found to be significantly more likely to die from any opioidrelated overdose, the results of this study indicate that women are more likely than men to die of a prescription opioidrelated overdose. Women were more likely than men to both obtain Schedule IIIII opioids and to have Schedule IIIII opioids present in postmortem toxicology following an opioidrelated overdose death. While legally and illegallyobtained opioids pose a risk for men and women alike, prescribers and pharmacists should be educated to utilize the Prescription Drug Monitoring Database (PDMP) through the Massachusetts Prescription Awareness Tool (MassPAT) in order to identify any active or past prescriptions for their patients and to provide coordinated care and overdose risk reduction. Individuals Who Have Recently Been Released from Massachusetts Prisons are 56 Times as Likely to Die from an Opioid Related Overdose: Those who have recently been released from Massachusetts prisons have a shortterm risk of death from opioid overdose that is greater than 50 times the risk for the general public. 25% of Massachusetts prison inmates received treatment during their incarceration, and there was not a notable reduction in risk of fatal overdose in those that received treatment. To further reduce the opioidrelated death rate, additional focus should be paid to those being released from Massachusetts prisons, and treatment opportunities should be standardized regardless of setting. 3 Naltrexone, also known as Vivitrol, is a Schedule VI drug. As such, it is not captured in the PDMP. In future work, All Payer Claims Database (APCD) data will be used to assess the potential risk reduction associated with Vivitrol use. 10 Key Findings Recommendations FINDING 1 - Individuals who died from opioid related overdoses are much more likely to have an illegallyobtained substance (i.e., not Schedule IIIII opioid) present in postmortem toxicology Harm reduction strategies and other interventions that address Heroin, Fentanyl, and polysubstance use should be increased, expanded, and enhanced. FINDING 2 - Following nonfatal overdoses, people on opioid agonist treatment (i.e., medications that block the effect of opioids like Methadone and buprenorphine) are significantly less likely to die Strategies for making medications for opioid use disorders more accessible to individuals who experience a nonfatal opioid overdose should be prioritized. FINDING 3 - Women are significantly more likely than men to receive opioids from 3 or more prescribers and obtain them from 3 or more pharmacies. MassPAT should be leveraged by prescribers and pharmacists as a decision support tool to inform clinical decisionmaking. Also, prescribers and pharmacists should be educated about their own personal biases. FINDING 4 - The risk of opioid overdose death following incarceration is 56 times higher than for the general public. MAT and overdose prevention services should be expanded in correctional facilities, and access to postincarceration medical care and substance use prevention and treatment should be put in place prior to release. Importantly, in addition to providing insight into the current opioid epidemic, this effort also marks the beginning of how government, academia, the health care system, and private industry can and should collaborate to ask and answer complex questions. DPH is no longer asked to simply track the incidence of disease. Instead, public health policymakers, analysts, and researchers are faced with more complex questions than ever before. Increasingly, state leadership, stakeholders, and the public are calling upon DPH to assess the effectiveness of its policies and programming and to adjust accordingly. The Department's ability to engage academic partners and private industry to support surveillance and evaluation activities will be crucial, and collaborative, datadriven efforts such as this should become standard practice in Massachusetts and beyond. To this end, a virtual Data Warehouse - a virtual platform that links, stores, and allows for the analysis of datasets from multiple sources - should continue to be developed and expanded. Similarly to how successful businesses leverage big data to identify market opportunities, evaluate initiatives, and inform their operational and strategic decisions, a virtual Data Warehouse can serve as a business intelligence tool that would enable DPH to more efficiently and effectively target its resources, and to more precisely evaluate its programming. Furthermore, DPH will be able to support researchers and industry by being able to quickly provide these partners with information and analyses from multiple public and private data systems. Information from vital records (e.g. birth and death records), insurance 11claims data, public health programs, research and educational institutions, hospitals, and other clinical partners can be aligned and examined to provide DPH, academics, and industry with answers to critical questions about health outcomes, program effectiveness, and health care costs. These and other examples - all fueled by data warehousing technology - represent public health of tomorrow. 12Introduction Addiction is a complex chronic disease characterized by compulsive alcohol/drug use and/or behaviors, cravings, and continued use despite harmful consequences. Nearly one in ten Americans over the age of 12 are classified as having a substance use disorder.3 Among brain disorders, addiction incurs greater economic costs than Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease, or head and neck injury. Addiction is also the most costly neuropsychiatric disorder.4 According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse,5,6 the overall cost of substance abuse in the United States exceeds half a trillion dollars, including health and crimerelated expenses, as well as losses in productivity. While the term addiction includes alcohol and drug abuse, this report focuses on opioid addiction and its impact on premature death in Massachusetts. The consequences of addiction extend far beyond just cost. Specifically, addiction harms individuals, as well as their families, friends, and communities. Addiction to substances, like opioids, also put people at risk for the development of health problems, including lifethreatening infections such as HIV and hepatitis, cirrhosis, cognitive decline, overdose, unplanned pregnancy, family disintegration, domestic violence, criminal behavior, child abuse, and death.7 Massachusetts is particularly affected by opioids and opioid addiction. As in other states, the 1990s and 2000s were marked with substantial increases in prescribing of opioids for acute and chronic pain. This increased access to prescription opioids has been followed by increased availability of Heroin. According to a 2013 Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) report, the reported availability of Heroin has increased significantly from 2007 to 2013 in New England.8 A decade ago, the most prevalent substance reported to the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS) at the time of admission for addiction treatment in Massachusetts was alcohol. In 2015, the most prevalent reported drugs were opioids. The percentage of BSAS admissions that were opioidrelated increased from 31% in 2000 to 55% in 2014.9 The Health Policy Commission has reported similar substantial increases over the same time period for Massachusetts emergency department visits and hospitalizations. 10,11 Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality.

In 20132014, opioidrelated deaths occurred in twothirds of the communities in Massachusetts. While the opioid crisis has impacted every community in Massachusetts in some fashion (e.g., deaths, nonfatal overdoses, or disruptions to marriages, families, and neighborhoods), there are clearly areas that have been hit harder than others. The contrast between the community level map from 2000 and from 20132014 (Figure INTR.1) clearly shows the increase in the number of communities with opioidrelated deaths over a span of 15 years. Annual figures for confirmed and estimated cases can be found in Figure INTR.2. The number of confirmed unintentional opioid overdose deaths for 2015 (n=1531) represents an 18% increase over 2014 (n=1294), and the 2014 number (n=1294) represents a 41% increase over cases for 2013 (n=918). In order to obtain timelier estimates of the total number of opioid overdose deaths in Massachusetts confirmed and probable DPH used predictive modeling techniques for all cases not yet finalized by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). 12 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/stop addiction/current statistics.html 13 This report includes confirmed fatal Opioidoverdoses from 2014 - 2015 (n=2,192) 14Figure INTR.1: Opioid deaths in Massachusetts 2000 and 2013 - 2014 15Figure INTR.2: Confirmed and estimated opioid deaths in Massachusetts between 2000 and 2015 Note: Counts for 2000 - 2013 are complete as of the date that the state's statistical file was closed. Each year, a small number of cases receive a cause of death after the file is closed. Unintentional poisoning/overdose deaths combine unintentional and undetermined intents to account for a change in death coding that occurred in 2005. Suicides are excluded from this analysis. Opioids include Heroin, opioidbased prescription painkillers, and other unspecified opioids. Cases were defined using the International Classification of Disease (ICD10) codes for mortality. The following codes were selected from the underlying cause of death field to identify poisonings/overdoses: X40 X49, Y10Y19. All multiple cause of death fields were then used to identify an opioidrelated death: T40.0, T40.1, overdoses due to difficulties in reporting Heroinassociated overdoses separately. Many deaths related to Heroin are not specifically coded as such due to the fast metabolism of Heroin into morphine. To maintain consistency with NCHS reporting, the ICD10 code F11.1 is not included, death. 338468429549 456525615 6145615995266036689111,1221,379 1,1961,526 02004006008001,0001,2001,4001,6001,800 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015Number of deathsOpioidRelated Deaths, Unintentional/Undetermined Massachusetts: 20002015 Confirmed Estimated 16Just as communities are differentially affected by the opioid crisis, population groups are also affected differentially. While death rates have increased for virtually every population group, the rates are highest among younger males - a fact that is similar in all states.14 In 20132014, 76% of opioid overdose deaths occurred in people under the age of 50. Furthermore, men of age 18 to 34 had opioid related death rates nearly three times higher than women of the same age. For additional detail, see Table INTR.1.

Those trends are reported in subsequent sections of this report. As stated above, opioidrelated deaths began increasing very sharply in 2012.15 While this report will not make causal statements about this increase, it will compare and contrast related trends within the same period. Two such trends are cited here. First, the number of opioids prescribed to residents of Massachusetts increased roughly 7% per year since 2000.16 There was, however, no sharp increase in prescribed opioids beginning in 2012. In contrast, recent toxicology data suggest that the increased 14 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics.

Detailed examinations of these questions are included. This exercise in data linking across relevant and available datasets in Massachusetts allows us to identify systems that served individuals who died of a fatal opioid overdose prior to their death (e.g. health care settings, or criminal justice system). By identifying these points of contact, this information may shed light on future interventions to prevent opioid overdoses. The toxicology reports from the decedents may shed some light on some details of the death; however, looking back at the systems that served these individuals prior to overdose is also critical. By linking across systems, it is possible to know whether an individual had an ambulance related event reported to the Massachusetts Ambulance Trip Record Information System (MATRIS), any prescriptions for opioid medications recorded in the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), contact with the healthcare system via BSAS or in the hospitalization database (Case Mix) or All Payer Claims Database (APCD), or criminal justice involvement through the Department of Correction (DoC). The body of this report describes four analyses performed with data from the ten datasets. Those analyses can be found in the section that immediately follows. The reader is encouraged to examine the appendices as well. Please refer to Appendix A for detailed answers to the seven questions specified in Chapter 55. Among the questions were requests for information about the use of multiple prescribers, polyprescription use, voluntary and involuntary treatment, and postincarceration risk of overdose death. To gain a better understanding of the datasets used for analysis in this report, refer to Appendix B. Additional findings beyond the seven questions from individual datasets can be found in Appendix C. The data linkage process and a summary of how well the linkage plan worked can be found in Appendix D. In Appendix E, the reader can find the approach used to assess data quality and the strategies used to handle missing data. To understand the approach to data privacy followed by this work as well as the system architecture that allows for simultaneous examination of these 10 datasets, the reader is referred to Appendix F. Appendix G briefly summarizes the legal agreements that allowed data partners and other agencies to share data and utilize necessary resources. A full set of cross tabulations of each of the 10 Chapter 55 datasets compared to opioid deaths in 2013 and 2014 is presented in Appendix H. See Appendix I for additional information about Addiction and the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services. Finally, the partners who generously offered their time to make this report possible are listed in Appendix J. 19Key Findings from the Across Chapter 55 Datasets Linking large and complex opioidrelated datasets has made it possible to take an unprecedented look at the opioid crisis in Massachusetts. In the section that follows, four analyses are presented that demonstrate the importance of looking across datasets to understand what drives the crisis and what may be done to reduce the rate of death from legal and illegal opioids. In order to support the findings and recommendations, significant technical detail has been added to each of the sections below. This may be more detail than is helpful to some readers, so a summary of the findings and the recommendations has been inserted at the beginning of each section. Technical Notes: The linked dataset includes males and females in Massachusetts aged 11 and older. All four analyses used this starting population and filter the data according to the hypothesis of specific interest. This report uses standard conventions for naming drugs, drug classes, and chemical compounds. Specific drugs like Heroin and Fentanyl are capitalized. Drug classes and chemical compounds like benzodiazepines and 6mono acetyl morphine are not capitalized.

For this report, individual benzodiazepines were not distinguished on toxicology testing, but reported them as a class. Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone, Oxymorphone (as a prescription Oxymorphone), Codeine, and Tramadol are all specific toxicology results for substances where the main source is either prescribed or diverted Schedule II and III prescription opioids intended to treat pain. Therefore, these toxicology results were grouped together as \"prescription opioids.\" Categorizing Heroin and Morphine presence on toxicology is more complicated. One toxicology result specific for Heroin is 6monoacetylMorphine (6mam). However, 6mam is rapidly metabolized to Morphine and therefore, commonly, is not present on toxicology. When Morphine and Codeine are both present, especially where the quantitative level of Morphine is greater than Codeine, this indicates Heroin use due to impurities retained during Heroin refining from Opium.23,24 For this analysis, quantitative levels of Morphine and Codeine were not available. The presence of Morphine without Codeine in toxicology occurs due to either 1) prescription Morphine or 2) as a metabolite of Heroin. In order to determine whether to attribute deaths with Morphine present to prescription Morphine or to Heroin, the presence of Morphine prescriptions within the PDMP was reviewed. 23 Ceder G and Jones AW.

Figures KEY1.1 and KEY1.2 present the proportion of decedents with a specific drug (or Schedule II and III prescription opioid) in their toxicology results and the contribution of opioid prescriptions reported to the PDMP to these proportions. Breaking down the prescription opioid group into its components, substantial fractions of the decedents with Oxycodone, Hydromorphone, Hydrocodone, and Tramadol, present in toxicology had matching prescriptions for those drugs in the PDMP. Almost none had matching prescriptions for Oxymorphone, though this is a metabolite of Oxycodone. Notes: Presence in PDMP includes any prescription for the particular drug between 2011 and 2014. Codeine is not included in the chart because <5 prescriptions were filled by this study population. Based on these results, Morphine toxicology was further categorized as \"likely Heroin.\" When crossed with the PDMP, people who had Morphine present at death had very low rates of Morphine prescription histories. A similar pattern for Fentanyl was observed. For Fentanyl, there is a rapidly expanding distribution of illicitly produced Fentanyl sold as Heroin,25,26,27 which explains the low rate of Fentanyl prescriptions. In contrast, people with other prescription opioids such as Oxycodone in their 25 Rudd, Rose A., et al. \"Increases in drug and opioid overdose deathsUnited States, with Specific Prescription Opioids Present in Toxicology Results & the Relative Contribution of Prescriptions for the Drugs (20112014) Specific Drug Present in PDMP Specific Drug NOT Present in PDMP toxicolog y benzodia z who die o positive t not alwa y present > where Mo O decreasin bupre n present in and Meth Notes: Fent Pres P and their toxicolog y prescribe d 28 While \"de death.

Opioidinvolved decedents who died with only prescription opioids on board (representing under ten percent of opioid overdose deaths) were the most likely group to have had a prescription filled in the same month (36%) or in months proximal to their death. (See Table KEY1.1) While the majority of people filled an opioid prescription during the study period, relatively few filled a prescription for an opioid within one month of their death.

Polysubstance use: Polysubstance use can involve using 2 drugs for nonmedical purposes. For example, benzodiazepines30 are commonly taken with opioids for nonmedical purposes. The combination of the medications depresses the central nervous system at a higher rate than just using one of the medications. Benzodiazepines are commonly taken with opioids for nonmedical purposes. Benzodiazepines are present consistently in toxicology screens, regardless of the opioid present, in over half of overdoses. This pattern has been demonstrated in other populations.31 The proportion of people with a prescription for a benzodiazepine within one month of death ranged from 1425% in the toxicology subgroups while over half had a prescription during the study period. (See Table KEY1.2) Of particular note, benzodiazepines were present in 62% of overdoses when only a prescription opioid was 29 This value (1,657) differs from the total number of cases with toxicology reports (1,692) because there were 35 cases in which no positive results for the substances listed in the table were detected. 30 This medication is in the sedative/hypnotic drug class, and acts on the central nervous system. When used in combination with an Opioid, it poses a very high risk for overdose. 31 Park, T. W., Saitz, R., Ganoczy, D., Ilgen, M. A., & Bohnert, A. S. (2015). Benzodiazepine prescribing patterns and deaths from drug overdose among US receiving opioid analgesics: casecohort study. Bmj, 350, h2698. 25present, and 25% of these had a prescription within a month of their death. They were present 69% of the time when Methadone was present, and 24% of these people had a prescription for a benzodiazepine within a month of death. (See Table KEY1.3) Unlike the specific opioid products, benzodiazepines had a presence in death toxicology samples that exceeded the prevalence prescribed. While benzodiazepines were present in 982 toxicology screens, only 495 people ever had a prescription for one and less than 200 had a prescription within one month of their death. This suggests a substantial amount of diversion, and that benzodiazepines involved in opioid overdose deaths are a combination of prescribed and diverted pills. (See Table KEY1.3) Another drug commonly seen in opioid deaths was Cocaine. Overall, 30% of opioid decedents with a toxicology screen also had Cocaine present in their system. When Fentanyl, Heroin, or buprenorphine is present, Cocaine is present about 1/3 of the time. Cocaine is less commonly present when Methadone (21%) or prescription opioids (13%) are present.

Number not displayed because of complimentary suppression rules. 26 Limitations : The Chapter 55 project has facilitated the linkage of death, toxicology, and PDMP data at the individual level, which has allowed us to obtain a clearer picture of what opioids and other substances are present and how often opioids and benzodiazepines are prescribed. However, there are several limitations to our analyses at this point. First, the overdose death data are limited to 2013 and 2014 and therefore little can be said about time trends with two years of data. Expanding this analysis to more years would allow for analysis and surveillance of changes over time. The rapidly rising rates of Fentanyl present at overdose deaths from 2013 to 2015 is one example of why realtime surveillance of overdose death toxicology is an important public health tool. For the toxicology dataset, as discussed above, it is not clear how to attribute deaths where Morphine is present on toxicology. Based on a review of the PDMP data, it was decided to define these as \"likely Heroin\" present. A more indepth review of the subset of deaths with this toxicology result is warranted to confirm or further inform our assumptions. The toxicology also does not include routine testing for substances like Gabapentin, Promethazine or Clonidine, which may be diverted and used in combination with opioids.32,33,34,35,36 Further, the toxicology testing is not sensitive for alcohol, which is an established contributor to polysubstance overdose death. Therefore the role that these substances may be playing in opioid related overdose deaths cannot be determined. The PDMP dataset includes methadone prescribed for pain management, but does not include Methadone dispensed through opioid treatment programs. In this analysis, the data was not available to link toxicology to Methadone treatment data from the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services, which would help address this limitation. 32 Smith, RV, et al. \"Gabapentin misuse, abuse and diversion: a systematic review.\" Addiction. 2016 Jul;111(7):1160 1174. doi: 10.1111/add.13324.

Table KEY1.3: Proportion of Decedents with Benzodiazepine or Cocaine Present in Toxicology Screen by Category of Opioid Present in Toxicology Screen (20132014) Frequency% of Total % with Benzodiazepine % with Cocaine Fentanyl and Definite Heroin Present 166 10.0% 57.2% 31.3% Likely on Key Finding #1: Heroin and/or Fentanyl, and benzodiazepines are present at the majority of opioid overdose deaths and thus are likely to be driving the increases in overdose. Increased realtime surveillance capacity that integrates linkable data from multiple sources is crucial to understanding the rapidly increasing overdose death rates. Harm reduction strategies and interventions that address Heroin, Fentanyl, and polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines and Cocaine) should be increased, expanded, and enhanced. More outreach and education regarding use of the online PDMP to detect patients receiving multiple drugs is essential to improve coordination of care and thus reduce overdose risk. People who die from opioidrelated overdose are commonly prescribed opioids, though less commonly at the time close to their death. Therefore, the role of prescription opioids in overdose death is more likely part of the development of upstream risk, than a downstream proximal cause. Interventions focused on reducing access to prescription opioids should be paired with interventions that address Heroin, Fentanyl, and polysubstance use as the proximal causes of overdose.

As part of this, geospatial variability will be explored to compare the intersection of where individuals experience nonfatal opioid overdose and where they access treatment that may inform hotspots that should be targeted with additional resources. Finally, a range of treatment options beyond OAT will be examined including opioid antagonist treatment (e.g. injectable extended release Naltrexone) and detoxification admissions. Implications and recommendations based on Key Finding #2 A substantial portion of opioidrelated overdose deaths in Massachusetts are preceded by a nonfatal opioid overdose. Engagement in OAT following nonfatal opioidrelated overdose was found to be associated with a substantial decrease in the risk of a subsequent fatal opioidrelated overdose. Despite this risk reduction (50% less risk of an overdose by those engaged in OAT versus those who did not engage in OAT), the proportion of people who engage in OAT following a nonfatal opioid overdose remains low. Presentation to the health care system with nonfatal opioidrelated overdose represents an opportunity to engage highrisk individuals in treatment. There is substantial opportunity to develop novel public health approaches to identify individuals who experience nonfatal opioidrelated overdose and engage them in treatment.

While fatal opioid overdoses occur most frequently in males, this data suggests that women are disproportionately impacted by prescription opioids. As described in other sections of this report, the presence of Morphine in a toxicology screen is due to prescription Morphine or Heroin metabolites. Decedents were categorized as deaths that were likely attributable to Heroin when there was no matching Morphine prescription documented in the PDMP database.

Finally, a multivariate analysis to examine risk factors associated with overall mortality and opioidrelated mortality was conducted. Summary of Findings: 13,918 former inmates released between 2013 and 2014 were identified. These individuals spent 5,707 personyears in the community after release, 287 died from all causes, and 121 consequently died from an opioidrelated overdose during the study period. Rate of opioid related overdose was approximately 50 times higher in formerly incarcerated people than in non incarcerated Massachusetts residents. Former inmates also had a significantly lower overall survival than noninmates (p<0.0001). Our findings also suggest that there is a significantly elevated mortality risk in the earliest time periods after being released from a state correctional facility, when compared with other noncritical time periods. The largest proportions of former inmates died within the first month (Figure KEY4.1). 40 This figure represents sum of the population of the state in 2013 and 2014.

Likewise, when examining opioidrelated overdoses, former inmates had death rates in the 1st month after release that were up to 6times higher than rates at later times.

Although, not a high R2 (20%), it is worth highlighting that age was a significant predictor. The youngest at the time of release were most at risk: former inmates 1824 years of age were almost 10 times more likely to die from an opioidrelated overdose than any those that were 45 years and older.

Even though there is a large overlap between those that are criminally involved and those that have a SUD, there is a large assumption in this analysis not everyone who is incarcerated is in need of substance abuse treatment. The treatment indicator within the DoC data does not specify the type of treatment an individual received, and it may in fact include selfhelp groups. The indicator also does not specify the date when the treatment was received; therefore, it is hard to determine for those that had a lengthy sentence, whether the treatment was received closer to the beginning or end of a sentence, which may impact the overdose outcome. DoC data includes incarcerations for those in prison and does not include data for people in jails or houses of correction (HoC). The data from DoC used in this analyses (e.g. those incarcerated during the study period and released) is only a subset of the individuals incarcerated within Massachusetts during this study period. This analysis does not included individuals that were not released during the study period, and it does not include individuals incarcerated within Hoc. HoC servers a higher volume of inmates per year in comparison to DoC, primarily due to shorter sentences and those waiting trial within Hoc. Due to this limitation, using DOC data to understand the intersection between fatal opioid 40overdoses and the criminal justice system in Massachusetts does not provide a full picture to determine associated risks. An additional limitation arises if residents of Massachusetts are incarcerated outside of Massachusetts as that data is not captured by the DoC. Implications and recommendations based on Analysis #4: Of the 25,209 inmates released 13,918 were released during 2013 and 2014. Of these, 287 died during the same time period. In this group, 42.2% (n=121) died from an opioidrelated overdose. In comparison, for the total population in the state, opioidrelated deaths accounted for only 2.1% (n=2,192) of deaths. Opioidrelated overdose deaths in former inmates accounted for 5.5% of all opioidrelated deaths in the time period. Former inmates who died from opioidrelated overdoses were on average younger, more likely to have a High School education or less, and less likely to be married at or around the time of death, compared with those who died from all other reportable causes. These findings corroborate previous studies indicating that recently released prisoners are at increased risk for death following their release, particularly in the early period and particularly younger released prisoners. Ensuring treatment behind the walls and aftercare planning for released prisoners could potentially have a large public health impact. Increase education for overdose prevention (e.g. abstinence while incarcerated and relapsing upon release poses a risk for overdose. Further research is also warranted to identify other specific risk factors associated with this increased risk. 41Conclusions The rate of opioidrelated deaths in Massachusetts has increased sharply in recent years. Some communities have been very hard hit by this public health crisis, but all communities have felt the burden of deaths, nonfatal overdoses, job loss, poor health, disintegrated family structures, or disrupted neighborhoods. Important findings described in this report include the fact that illicit drugs, not prescription drugs, are much more commonly present in postmortem toxicology. As a result, increasing the availability of interventions that address Heroin, Fentanyl, and polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines and Cocaine) could significantly reduce the opioidrelated death rate. Also, opioid agonist treatment (OAT) like methadone or buprenorphine was found to be associated with a significantly lower risk of fatal opioid overdose following a previous nonfatal opioid overdose. A comprehensive plan for delivering OAT could significantly lower the death rate. This study also determined that women are more likely than men to obtain prescription opioids and to have prescription opioids present in postmortem toxicology. While legal and illegal opioids pose a risk for men and women alike, prescribers should be educated to utilize the PDMP database to identify any active or past prescriptions for their patients, particularly females, and to provide coordinated care. To further reduce the opioidrelated death rate, particular focus could be paid to the population of individuals being released from Massachusetts prisons. Their shortterm risk of death from opioid related overdose is 56 times higher than for the general public. Given the high risk of death in this population, better care coordination should also reduce the number of deaths. The Chapter 55 legislation permitted the development and examination of a first ever cross sector, linked dataset related to opioid deaths. The insights highlighted in this report would not have been possible without the capacity to create a confidential and secure dataset which was developed under the authority of Chapter 55. This approach also holds promise for other critical public health concerns. The unique partnership forged between government, academia, and industry to address a critical public health problem could form the roadmap for conducting complex analytic work in the future. 42Appendix A: The Seven Chapter 55 Statutory Questions This section presents the original statutory language of each question, restates it as a specific question, discusses its significance, presents results, and discusses findings. The analytic restatement is seen as an opportunity for the researchers to confirm they understand the underlying intent motivating the questions as presented in the legislation. Note: For privacy purposes, the data sets used for Chapter 55 analyses record information in the month of occurrence. No exact dates are used. In most cases, the presence or absence of any event was recorded in the month not the count of those events. Therefore, statements made about these data cannot directly be interpreted as averages but instead as the average number of months that any type of event occurred. Statutory Question 1: \"Instances of multiple provider episodes, meaning a single patient having access to opiate prescriptions from more than 1 provider\" Analytic Question 1: \"Does having multiple prescribers increase a patient's risk of fatal opioidrelated overdose?\" Individuals who obtain prescriptions for opioids from more than one prescriber may be at greater risk of death. Receiving prescription opioids from multiple prescribers with the intent of deceiving the prescriber about the volume of opioids received is often referred to as \"doctor shopping.\" While there is general acceptance that this is a risk factor for death, it is actually unknown how many persons in Massachusetts have died of an opioidrelated overdose who also obtained prescriptions from more than one health care provider. This analysis provides an opportunity to examine the assumption that persons going to multiple providers for opioid prescriptions are at increased risk of death from opioidrelated overdose. To answer this question, the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) dataset was linked to death certificates where the causes of death were noted. The linked dataset was analyzed for opioid prescriptions by patient, their demographics (age, gender, race, marital status, employment, and geography), the number of prescribers, and the outcome (opioidrelated death, any death, or still living no death). The analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between the number of prescribers and likelihood of dying of an opioidrelated overdose. Table A1: Relative Risk of OpioidRelated Overdose (20132014) of in a Three Month Period (20112014) Number of Prescribers vs. Risk of Fatal OpioidRelated Overdose 1 - 2 Prescribers 3+ Prescribers Relative Risk Ratio Total Fatal Overdoses 648 808 Total Individuals with at least 1 opioid prescription ~2.1M ~400,000 Incidence ~1.5 per 10,000 per year ~10.1 per 10,000 per year ~7 Summary Based on observed data, the use of 3 or more prescribers associated 43with a 7fold increase in risk of fatal opioidrelated overdose Discussion: Having three or more prescribers does not necessarily or automatically imply the patient is exhibiting the behavior colloquially known as \"doctor shopping.\" There are notable exceptions, such as multiprovider practices in which prescriptions could be written for a single patient by multiple providers as part of normal operations. Having said that, there is still a clear pattern supported by the data that once three or more prescribers write prescriptions for opioids in a threemonth window there is a marked increase in the likelihood of an opioidrelated overdose. It should be noted that the three month period that defined a multiprescriber event did not have to occur within any specific amount of time prior to death. The relationship examined was whether any multiprescriber event (i.e., 3 or more prescribers) was associated with an increased risk of death of an opioidrelated overdose. Limitations: The identifiers in the PDMP data set are imperfect. As such, it is highly likely that the multi prescribers events are underestimated. That said, there is no reason seen in these data to suggest that these undetected cases would substantially alter the conclusions drawn here. If anything, individuals using multiple forms of identification might logically be assumed to be at higher risk than those not attempting to avoid detection. 44Statutory Question 2: \"Instances of polysubstance access, meaning a patient having simultaneous prescriptions for an opiate and a benzodiazepine or for an opiate and another drug which may enhance the effects or the risks of drug abuse or overdose\" Analytic Question 2: \"Does the addition of a prescription benzodiazepine to opioids increase the risk of fatal opioidrelated overdose relative to taking opioids alone?\" It is generally thought that there are more deaths from overdose in people who use more than one type of central nervous system depressant. To confirm this hypothesis, the PDMP dataset was linked to death certificates to analyze the death rates for those concurrently using opioid and benzodiazepines versus opioids only. The analysis was further refined with demographic break outs to allow for the relationships between drug combinations and demographic data. The linked dataset was analyzed for concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions by individual and their demographics (age, gender, race, marital status, employment, and geography) to identify any relationship between the number and type of depressants taken and the likelihood of dying. Table A2: Relative Risk of OpioidRelated Overdose (20132014) by Presence of Benzodiazepine in PDMP Records of Benzodiazepine vs. Fatal OpioidRelated Overdose Opioids Only Opioids + Benzodiazepines Relative 812 692 Total Individuals ~2.1M ~0.4M Incidence ~2.0 per 10,000 per year ~8.4 per 10,000 ~4.2 Summary Based on observed data, the history of benzodiazepine concurrent with opioid prescriptions is associated with a 4fold increase in risk of fatal opioidrelated overdose Discussion: Preliminary findings support the hypothesis of increased risk of fatal opioidrelated overdose associated with concurrent prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines. This risk factor should be clearly communicated to all prescribers and dispensers. Further analysis should be undertaken to see if mediating factors like demographics, previous treatment history, and comorbid conditions like mental health histories increase or decrease this risk. Limitations: The identifiers in the PDMP data set are imperfect. As such, it is highly likely that the instances of concurrent prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines are underestimated. There is no reason seen in the data that these undetected cases would substantially alter the conclusions drawn here. If anything, individuals using multiple forms of identification might logically be assumed to be at higher risk than those not attempting to avoid detection. 45Statutory Question 3: \"The overall opiate prescription history of the individuals, including whether the individuals had access to legal prescriptions for opiate drugs at the time of their deaths\" Analytic Question 3: \"Did opioidrelated overdose decedents have access to legal opioids, defined as a prescription filled around time of death?\" It is not known if there are more overdose deaths from misuse of prescribed medications or illegal drug use drugs consumed by people for whom they were not prescribed. To ascertain the difference, the PDMP dataset was linked to death certificates to analyze the death rates for individuals with no scheduled medications41. The analysis was further refined with demographic break outs so relationships with demographic data could be examined. As in Question 2, the linked dataset was analyzed for opioid prescriptions by individual and their demographics (age, gender, race, marital status, employment, and geography) to identify any relationship between the number, type of opioid, and use of nonprescribed medication and the likelihood of dying of an opioidrelated overdose. Table A3a: Proportion Prescription for Opioids (20112014) Prescription in Same Month of Death vs. No Known Prescription Rx in Month of DeathNo Known Rx in Month of DeathProportion Fatal Overdoses 183 2009 8.3% Summary Based on observed data, 8.3% of opioidrelated overdose decedents had an opioid prescription in the same month as their death Table A3b: Proportion of OpioidRelated Overdose Deaths by Toxicology Report Findings (20132014) (Mutually Exclusive Groups) Proportion of OpioidRelated Overdoses by Toxicology Report Findings Fatal Overdoses Percent of Fatal Overdoses Fentanyl + Definite Heroin 166 9.8% Fentanyl + Likely 83 4.9% Fentanyl 288 547 154 9.1% Buprenorphine 15 0.9% 41 The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 established an initial list of five classifications or schedules of drugs.

Other RX 2. These are not mutually exclusive categories so this column adds to more than 100% Discussion: These three tables are used to estimate the proportion of opioidrelated fatal overdoses that are attributable to prescriptions. Table A3a examines prescription history in the same month of death as a way to infer if the decedent had \"legal access to opioids\" at time of death. Table A3b notes chemicals found in toxicology screen and is presented in decreasing order of deadliness of the specific drugs42 (Fentanyl and/or Heroin > methadone > other Rx > buprenorphine) present in the results. A person was put into a category based on the most deadly drug present in the results, regardless of the presence of other drugs. For example, if someone had Fentanyl and methadone present, they would be in the \"Fentanyl\" group. These groups are mutually exclusive. For clarification, \"likely Heroin\" is determined based on evaluation of the toxicology data in combination with information on prescribing of Morphine from the PDMP. Toxicology screens were considered where Morphine was present in the 42 While \"deadliness\" is an imprecise term, drugs are considered deadlier when equivalent amounts are more likely to lead to death. In this case, equivalent amounts of Heroin or Fentanyl are more likely to result in death than buprenorphine. 47absence of Codeine to indicate that the Morphine present was likely a metabolite of Heroin (and not prescription Morphine). A final important note regarding Table A3b is that in 14 of the 15 deaths where Buprenorphine was the only opioid present, the toxicology result was also positive for a benzodiazepine. Table A3c uses a similar identification methodology but relaxes the mutual exclusivity constraint. Both 3b and 3c, in tandem with 3a, lend support to an emerging hypothesis that illicit substances are the driving force behind opioidrelated deaths. Limitations: The identifiers in the PDMP data set are imperfect. As such, it is highly likely that the opioid prescription histories for some individuals are incomplete. Toxicology data also does not precisely identify all drugs. In some cases, metabolites of opioids may suggest that either a legal or illegal drug was ingested. However, there is no reason seen in the data that these limitations would substantially alter the conclusions drawn here. 48Statutory Question 4: \"Whether the individuals had previously undergone voluntary or involuntary treatment for substance addiction or behavioral health.\" Analytic Question 4: \"Substance abuse treatment history (voluntary and involuntary) of Massachusetts residents who died of opioidrelated overdose\" Addiction treatment is intended to help individuals stop compulsive drug seeking and use by providing them with medication and behavioral coping skills as tools. Treatment can occur in a variety of settings, take many different forms, and last for different lengths of time. Because addiction is typically a chronic disorder characterized by occasional relapses, a shortterm, onetime treatment is usually not sufficient. For many, treatment is a longterm process that involves multiple interventions and regular monitoring. There are a variety of evidencebased approaches to treating addiction. Treatment can include behavioral therapy (e.g. cognitivebehavioral therapy or contingency management), medications, or their combination. The setting for service delivery may be inpatient or outpatient. A clinical recommendation for treatment depends on the individualistic needs of a client.43 While most clients enter treatment voluntarily, some are committed to treatment through the court system. Section 35 of Chapter 123 of the Massachusetts General Laws provides a mechanism for a family member, police officer, physician, or court official to petition for a person whose alcohol or drug use puts themselves or others at risk to be involuntarily committed for substance abuse treatment. If the court approves the petition, the person is sent to the Women's Addiction Treatment Center (WATC) in New Bedford or the Men's Addiction Treatment Center (MATC) in Brockton to receive up to 90 days of inpatient substance abuse treatment similar to a combination of Acute Treatment Services (detoxification) and Clinical Stabilization Services. There has been a significant increase in the number of commitments through Section 35 in recent years. In 2007 there were 1,086 individuals committed through Section 35. In 2015 that number was 3,651.Given the increasing number of commitments it is important to assess the effectiveness of the involuntary commitments in reducing adverse consequences, specifically fatal opioidrelated overdoses. The current analysis measures the risk of fatal opioidrelated overdose for those with a history of involuntary commitment. Death certificate data from 20132014 were linked to treatment data from the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS) from 20112014. The analysis was further refined with demographic break outs to identify any age differences. Results: Of the 149,351 clients served between 2011 and 2014 in the BSAS treatment system, 9,464 people were committed to involuntary treatment. Clients who had ever been admitted through Section 35 were 88% White nonHispanic, 58% male and had a median age of 32 years old. In contrast, clients 43 There are evidencebased guidelines from SAMHSA and associations like American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) and American Psychological Association (APA) for particular treatment services and for particular populations. For instance, there are guidelines for clinically evaluating patients to determine what is medically necessary and determine individualistic needs. The guidelines outline standards of care for stabilizing patients with withdrawal symptoms during detoxification and there are recommendations for maintenance care. The guidelines also specify MAT dosing for detoxification purposes as well as maintenance. Often, people with severe addiction are polysubstance users and require treatment for all substances abused. 49with only a voluntary treatment history were 75% White nonHispanic, 68% male and had a median age of 37 years old. Based on admissions during the study period, 67% of clients with a history of involuntary treatment had at least one opioidrelated admission, 83% reported prior mental health treatment, and 44% reported a prior overdose. For clients with only a voluntary treatment history, 46% had at least one opioidrelated admission, 58% reported prior mental health treatment, and 18% reported a prior overdose. Clients who received involuntary treatment were 2.2 times as likely to die of opioidrelated overdoses and 1.9 times as likely to die of any cause compared to those with a history of voluntary treatment only. Table A4: Risk of OpioidRelated Overdose Death (20132014) by Treatment Status (20112014) Treatment Type and Risk of Fatal Opioid Overdose Voluntary Treatment Involuntary Treatment Fatal Overdoses 892 134 Individuals 139,887 9,464 Percent Fatal Overdoses 0.63% 1.4% Discussion: Individuals afflicted with substance use disorders often don't acknowledge having a substance use problem nor seek treatment until they have significant health and social issues as a consequence of their compulsive behavior associated with their addiction. This means that most of the individuals presenting to treatment - voluntary or involuntary - have a multitude of social, behavioral, and health issues. For example, of the BSAS treatment population included in this study 58% reported prior mental health history. That number was even higher for those committed through Section 35 (83%). Section 35 permits the courts to involuntarily commit someone whose alcohol or drug use puts themselves or others at risk. Therefore, most individuals admitted through Section 35 are not necessarily ready for treatment. Table A4 provides evidence of significant differences in outcomes between those that received voluntary treatment and those that were committed to treatment involuntarily. A higher percentage of those that had a history of involuntary treatment died of an opioidrelated overdose compared to those without a history of involuntary treatment. The differences in history of prior mental health treatment and nonfatal overdoses may indicate that these clients have complex comorbid conditions and are at a higher risk of fatal overdose. There are significant limitations in both the mental health and substance abuse treatment systems in addressing the dually diagnosed. Mental health clinicians' knowledge of substance use disorders and overdose prevention is necessary given the significant overlap between these two populations. The same is true about substance abuse providers. Further analysis must be conducted to assess other underlying risk factors, i.e.; prescription history, drugs of choice, comorbid disorders (e.g., mental health conditions), and demographics that may put this subpopulation at a higher risk for overdose. However, the preliminary findings are not surprising given the involuntary nature of Section 35 and thus potential lack of client treatment readiness. Future analysis should also investigate the impact on risk of overdose death of the length of 50engagement as well as the transition to step down services following voluntary and involuntary acute services. Limitations: This analysis does not include all Section 35 commitments in the Commonwealth, only those admitted through WATC and MATC, which are facilities licensed and operated under contracts from MDPH. A significant portion of people committed were sent to the Massachusetts Committing Institution (MCI) in Framingham and the Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center (MASAC) in Bridgewater during this time period. As a result, the findings may not fully reflect the risk of overdose for this population. Furthermore, BSAS data does not represent all substance abuse treatment provided in the Commonwealth. BSAS only collects data from its contracted providers. Of the data that is submitted to BSAS, outpatient treatment data is incomplete and does not include all nonBSASpaid services. BSAS does not collect data from providers that prescribe Vivitrol or from noncontracted buprenorphine providers. Including substance abuse treatment data captured in other systems such as APCD may help refine these findings. 51Statutory Question 5: \"whether the individuals had attempted to enter but were denied access to treatment for substance addiction or behavioral health.\" Analytic Question 5: \"Does denial of service lead to an increased risk of fatal opioidrelated overdose?\" This analysis could not be conducted with the data currently available. Addiction is a complex problem partially because there is no single path to recovery. People with addiction can recover on their own without any treatment; some use selfhelp strategies to recover while others enter formal treatment.44 Evidence suggests that few people with addiction actually seek treatment, and for those that do, they often wait for many years before entering treatment.45 Only about 10% of individuals with a substance use disorder have had any treatment.46 This lack of treatment for those in need is unlike any other area of health care. By comparison, approximately 50% of those with a mental health disorder receive treatment.47,48 In 2014, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA) estimated that nationally 19.9 million persons aged 12 or older needed substance use treatment but did not receive specialty treatment in the past year. Of these 19.9 million persons, only 798,000 reported that they perceived a need for treatment for their use of illicit drugs or alcohol; this corresponds to about 4.0 percent of those that needed treatment. Thus, the large majority of the roughly 20 million people aged 12 or older who needed substance use treatment but did not receive specialty treatment did not perceive a need for treatment. Of the 798,000 persons who perceived a need for treatment, only a small percentage made an effort to get treatment (Figure A5).49 44 Klingemann and Sobell, 1989; Slutske, 2006; Sobell et al., 1996 45 Kessler, R.

As such, a history of past treatment would be a marker for individuals at higher risk for death from an overdose. There are two datasets that must be used to identify nonfatal opioidrelated overdoses: the Massachusetts Ambulance Trip Record Information System (MATRIS) and Acute Case Mix. An algorithm that utilizes several pieces of information in MATRIS creates a flag to indicate opioidrelated incidents. Both Case Mix and MATRIS data have been linked with death data where possible. A gap in this data is that MATRIS does not include information on opioidrelated overdoses where an ambulance was not called. Case Mix data, which includes information on Emergency Department visits, Hospitalizations, and Observation stays, can be used to both corroborate the incidence of an opioidrelated overdose in MATRIS and also to identify opioidrelated overdoses that occurred when a person did not take an ambulance to the hospital. This data can also be linked with deaths in order to determine if the opioid related overdose was fatal or not. None of our data systems can account for an opioidrelated overdose where a person did not take an ambulance and did not end up in a Massachusetts hospital (i.e. a person who was revived with Naloxone by a friend or family member and did not seek additional treatment.) Results: Using ICD9 codes51, 6,335 individuals were recorded as having opioid overdoses in the Case Mix data file. Overdoses were recorded for these 6,355 people in 9,621 different months thus indicating that there were at least 1.5 overdoses per person using Case Mix data alone. Since the Chapter 55 Case Mix data records only that one or more events occurred within a month and not the total number of events, it is not possible to compute a more accurate estimate of the average. In Case Mix data, 71% had only one overdose. Of these, 3.7% died of an opioidrelated overdose at some point in 2013 or 2014. Similarly, 29% had more than one overdose in Case Mix. Of these, 6.3% died of an opioidrelated overdose at some point in 2013 or 2014. See Table A6a. Table A6a: Overdoses by Person in Case Mix Data, Massachusetts (20112014) Total ODs Number Percent Cumulative Frequency Cumulative Percent 1 4,490 70.9 4,490 70.9 2 1,127 17.8 5,617 88.7 6.1 6,006 94.8 4 171 2.7 6,177 97.5 5 or more 158 2.5 6,335 100.0 Using an algorithm developed in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 8,859 individuals were identified as having had a likely overdose from the MATRIS data. There were 10,995 overdoses recorded for these 8,859 individuals, thus indicating that there were 1.2 overdoses per person using the MATRIS data alone. In MATRIS, 83% had only one likely overdose. Of these, 4.5% died of an opioidrelated overdose at some point in 2013 or 2014. Similarly, 17% had more than one likely overdose in MATRIS. Of these, 5.4% died of an opioidrelated overdose at some point in 2013 or 2014. See Table 6b. Table A6b: Overdoses by Person in MATRIS, Massachusetts (20132014) Total ODs Number Percent Cumulative Frequency Cumulative 1 7,344 82.9 7,344 82.9 2 1,134 12.8 8,478 8,720 98.4 4 82 0.9 8,802 99.4 5 or more 57 0.6 8,859 100.0 Finally, when Case Mix and MATRIS data were examined together, there were 13,154 people recorded as having or likely having an overdose event in 2013 or 2014. Although it is likely an underestimate for the reasons stated above, these overdose events occurred 20,619 eventmonths thus indicating that on average each individual had 1.5 overdose events per person. In Case Mix and MATRIS, 15% of the individuals had one or more overdose events recorded. Of these, 5.4% died of an opioid related overdose at some point in 2013 or 2014. Onethird (33%) of individuals with recorded overdose events could be found only in the Case Mix data. Of these, 4.0% died of an opioidrelated overdose during 2013 or 2014. Slightly over half (52%) of individuals with recorded overdose events could be found only in the MATRIS data. Of these, 4.4% died of an opioidrelated overdose during the study period. Altogether, 9.3% of people with a fatal opioidrelated overdose had at least 1 prior nonfatal overdose event recorded in either Case Mix or MATRIS. No differences were found by gender. In other words, the likelihood of subsequent opioid related death when preceded by a nonfatal overdose was the same for men and women. There were, however, differences by age. Compared to people aged 45+, those aged 27 and under and those 28 to 34 were nearly twice as likely to have a previous overdose event before death. Discussion: There are at least 5 times as many nonfatal overdose events compared to fatal opioid related overdose deaths. Each should be considered an opportunity to reduce the risk of subsequent opioidrelated death. While the available data shows that a relatively small number of nonfatal overdoses precede a fatal overdose (9.3%), it is believed that this number is a significant underestimate. See the Limitations discussion below. Regardless, all opportunities should be explored to reduce the 55opioid overdose death rate. For example, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) could receive alerts about highrisk communities or highrisk patient profiles. Heightened awareness could positively impact the death rate. Hospitals and EMS alike could be advised about the importance of reporting accurate data about fatal and nonfatal overdose deaths, so trends can be identified and addressed as soon as possible. Finally, since the majority of overdose events are only found in Case Mix data or MATRIS data but not in both, this suggests that a substantial number of people seek no treatment whatsoever following a nonfatal overdose. Educating users, friends, family members, and bystanders about the importance of seeking medical treatment following a nonfatal overdose is critical if the number of deaths is to be reduced. Limitations: While only 9.3% of the individuals who had a fatal opioidrelated overdose also had at least 1 prior nonfatal overdose event, it is very likely that this value is a significant underestimate of the actual number of opioid overdoses prior to opioid death that occurred in Massachusetts during 2013 and 2014. First of all, the Chapter 55 data was organized by months to protect the privacy of the individuals whose data was analyzed. Any nonfatal overdose occurring in the same calendar month as a fatal overdose would be masked and thus undercounted. Second, MATRIS data has known gaps. Some emergency medical services do not report data and others do not routinely record data that is sufficient for the algorithm to flag an ambulance trip as a likely overdose case. As least 30% of MATRIS data is missing in whole or in part. On this measure alone, it is almost certain that the actual number of individuals with overdose events preceding death far exceeds what is reported here. Third, Case Mix data is also likely to underestimate the total number of overdose cases. There could be coding errors, different coding approaches used by different hospitals, or possible physician concerns for patient privacy that could result in incomplete counts of overdose reporting in hospital settings. Finally, there are numerous testimonials of persons who survived an overdose after a being revived with Naloxone by a friend or family member. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many of these individuals did not seek additional treatment and thus were not included in the two data sets examined here. These individuals may have refused care by an EMT, refused to enter a hospital Emergency Department, or never sought any treatment whatsoever. Mathematical modeling of the full array of data available through Chapter 55 could shed some additional light on the percentage of cases. That work is ongoing. 56Statutory Question 7: \"Whether any individuals had been previously detained or incarcerated and, if so, whether the individuals had received treatment during the detention or incarceration.\" Analytic Question 7: \"Does treatment during incarceration reduce likelihood of a fatal opioidrelated overdose?\" It is considered best practice to provide individuals that have a substance use disorder (SUD) with treatment as swiftly as possible. Furthermore, for individuals who are incarcerated and have a SUD, providing treatment behind the walls would be the optimal time to do so rather than waiting until release. It is hypothesized that those that receive SUD treatment behind the walls are less likely to die of an opioidrelated overdose postrelease in comparison to those that do not receive treatment prior to release. To confirm this hypothesis, an analysis was conducted by linking Massachusetts Department of Correction (DoC) data (jails are not included), which includes drug treatment received during incarceration in prison to death certificate data and the individual's demographic information. There is a large overlap between people involved in the criminal justice system and people who use substances. In a survey of State and Federal prisoners, the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) estimates that about half of the prisoners in the US meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria for substance use disorders, and yet fewer than 20 percent who need treatment receive it.52,53 Of those surveyed, 14.8 percent of State and 17.4 percent of Federal prisoners reported having received drug treatment since admission.54 Inmates released from correctional facilities are at an increased risk of overdose;55 this increased risk is due to a multitude of factors. First, evidence-based, individualized treatment may not be available within the correctional facilities. Second, due to prolonged abstinence and the resulting reduction in tolerance, a similar dose as the one used prior to incarceration may pose a significantly high risk of overdose. A large study conducted in Washington State found that within the first two weeks after release, the rate of death from overdose was 1,840 per 100,000 personyears (95% confidence interval, 1213 to 2677). In the Washington State study, inmates were 129 times as likely to die of an overdose compared to other state residents in the first two weeks after release. 56 The cases in this study were in the state system and did not include jails or houses of correction; which is very similar to Massachusetts. During incarceration there is an opportunity to engage inmates with a substance use disorder in treatment. Of those surveyed by BJS, 14.8% of State and 17.4% of Federal prisoners reported having 52 Chandler RK, et.

Further analysis of linking DoC data with BSAS data will indicate whether inmates with a substance use disorder are: a) receiving treatment while incarcerated; and b) referred and subsequently admitted to the appropriate community based treatment. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)58, \"only a small percentage of offenders have access to adequate services, especially in jails and community correctional facilities. Not only is there a gap in the availability of these services for offenders, but often there are few choices in the types of services provided. Treatment that is of insufficient quality and intensity or that is not well suited to the needs of offenders may not yield meaningful reductions in drug use and recidivism. Untreated substance abusing offenders are more likely than treated offenders to relapse to drug abuse and return to criminal behavior. This can lead to rearrest and reincarceration, jeopardizing public health and public safety and taxing criminal justice system resources. Treatment is the most effective course for interrupting the drug abuse/criminal justice cycle for offenders with drug abuse problems.\"59 Results: The DoC data includes people that were incarcerated and released during the study period (n = 25,209). 25% of the sample received treatment for substance abuse behind the walls. 12% of the fatal opioid overdose records linked with DoC data.

Drug Use and Dependence State and Federal Prisoners. Accessed at: http://proxychi.baremetal.com/ csdp.org/research/dudsfp04.pdf Ibid. 58Discussion: There does not appear to be a difference in incidence of opioidrelated overdose between those treated for SUD and those not known to have been treated for an SUD while incarcerated. Further analysis is needed to determine the risks associated with being incarcerated and risk of overdose. A significant opportunity is missed in engaging these clients in substance abuse treatment while they are incarcerated. Recommendations for improving services and increasing understanding of these associations include: Increase the quantity and quality of substance abuse treatment within DoC facilities. Increase education for overdose prevention (e.g. abstinence while incarcerated and relapsing upon release poses a risk for overdose). Improve integrated mental health and substance use disorder treatment plan prior to release date, and ensure individuals are linked with these community supports at time of release. DoC data only includes a subpopulation of the individuals incarcerated in Massachusetts. This may impact the rates presented in Table A7. Future analyses using more comprehensive criminal justice data would shed better light on the associations between incarceration and risk for overdose. Limitations: There are some limitations associated with using DoC data to better understand the intersection of opioid overdoses and criminal justice involvement in the Commonwealth. Even though there is a large overlap between those that are criminally involved and have a SUD, there is a large assumption in this analysis not everyone who is incarcerated is in need of substance abuse treatment. The treatment indicator within the DoC data does not specify the type of treatment an individual received, and it may in fact include selfhelp groups. The indicator also does not specify the date when the treatment was received; therefore, it is hard to determine for those that had a lengthy sentence whether the treatment was received closer to the beginning or end of a sentence, which may impact the overdose outcome. DoC data includes incarcerations for those in prison and does not include data for people in jails or houses of correction (HoC). The data from DoC used in this analyses (e.g. those incarcerated during the study period and released) is only a subset of the individuals incarcerated within Massachusetts during this study period. This analysis does not included individuals that were not released during the study period, and it does not include individuals incarcerated within HoC. HoC servers a higher volume of inmates per year in comparison to DoC, primarily due to shorter sentences and those waiting trial within HoC. Due to this limitation, using DoC data to understand the intersection between fatal opioid overdoses and the criminal justice system in Massachusetts does not provide a full picture to determine associated risks. An additional limitation arises if residents of Massachusetts are incarcerated outside of Massachusetts, as that data is not captured by the DoC. 59Appendix B: Dataset Descriptions The following is a description of each of the ten datasets used for this report. Each description outlines the information collected, the frequency, the limitations, the lag time between data collection and data availability, the relevance to opioids, and the authorization for collecting the data. It is of note that all of the datasets are authorized through Massachusetts legislation, however, this is the first time these datasets have been used together to depict a more accurate and holistic picture of a public health problem. Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (RVRS)60 - Death Records61 What data are collected: Opioidrelated deaths are the primary focus of this work and the most basic source of this information comes from death certificates filed with the Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (RVRS). The official cause of death and the manner of death (i.e., intentional, unintentional, or undetermined) are assigned by physicians and medical examiners. Each death certificate also includes demographic information such as age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, gender, educational attainment, marital status, and occupation. These basic demographics are recorded by the funeral director and are typically provided by a family member. Availability of data: Mortality information is reported electronically using the Vitals Information Partnership62 (VIP). The VIP system is webbased and receives information 24 hours a day seven days a week. For analytic purposes, data can be exported from VIP with all the data elements listed above. Opioidrelated deaths and other complex cases are almost always referred to the Office for the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) for determination of cause and manner of death. This results in a reporting lag for these deaths. That said, basic data on demographics is available on a nearreal time basis. Limitations of the data: As legal records, the information recorded on death certificates is considered highly accurate. However, some information like race, Hispanic ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, and occupation are not always fully populated. Causes of death from the OCME often lag the date of death making some elements of death data less timely than others. 60 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departmen ts/dph/programs/admin/dmoa/vitals/ 61 The collection of death certificate data is authorized by MGL Chapter 46. 62 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments /dph/programs/admin/dmoa/vitals/vitals information partnership vip.html 60Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS)63 - Substance Abuse Treatment Data64 What data are collected: Massachusetts Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS), of the Department of Public Health, is the single state authority responsible for regulating and licensing substance abuse treatment providers. The services provided range from acute detoxification to residential and outpatient based services. All treatment providers who receive funding from BSAS are required to submit data to BSAS to carry out the responsibilities listed under the law. The required data fields include but are not limited to: client characteristics, enrollment information, disenrollment information, services and outcomes. Currently, only treatment providers that receive funding from the Department submit this data to BSAS. Availability of data: Processing of linked clients also allows us to construct treatment episodes and entire client histories. There is a 12 month lag between the time the data are reported and the time it is available for analysis/reporting from BSAS. Limitations of the data: The BSAS data set poses several limitations. First, BSAS data does not represent all substance abuse treatment provided in the commonwealth. BSAS only collects data from its contracted providers. Of the data that is submitted to BSAS, outpatient treatment data is incomplete and does not include all nonBSAS paid services BSAS does not collect data from providers that prescribe Vivitrol or from noncontracted Buprenorphine providers. At the time of this analysis, Methadone data was incomplete. Due to challenges associated with recent system changes related to data submission, some Methadone providers have been unable to submit data. Data collected in regards to section 35 commitments are incomplete in the BSAS data set. For example, in 2015 there were 2,068 of Section 35 commitments were served in settings that are outside the scope of data submitted to BSAS (e.g. MASAC and MCI Framingham). As a result of these data limitations, it is possible that some of the analyses using BSAS treatment data may provide an incomplete picture. Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)65 - Schedule II through V medications66 63 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/dep artments/dph/programs/substance abuse/ 64 The collection of detailed substance abuse treatment by BSAS is authorized under MGL Ch.111 B and E. All treatment providers are required to submit data to BSAS to carry out the responsibilities listed under the law. The regulations promulgated to carry out these responsibilities require the providers to submit data in a timely manner. The required data fields include but are not limited to: client characteristics, enrollment, disenrollment information, services and outcomes. Currently, only treatment providers that receive funding from the Department submit the required data to BSAS. BSAS uses this data for billing/payment and service planning purposes. Almost all BSAS licensed/contracted providers enter the required data through the Virtual Gateway. Assessment data collected at admission and disenrollment are entered into Enterprise Invoice Management/Enterprise Service Management (EIM/ESM) system daily or in batches. Data entry occurs at provider sites and is transmitted to BSAS on a monthly basis. The current database includes data from Fiscal Year 20002016. BSAS can readily report data at the provider level, the enrollment level, and the client level. 65 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/dep artments/dph/prog rams/hcq/drug control/PDMP/ 66 The Department of Public Health's Office of Prescription Monitoring and Drug Control (OPMDC) established the Massachusetts Prescription Monitoring Program (MA PDMP) in 1992 pursuant to joint regulations (105 CMR 700.012) with the Board of Registration in Pharmacy (247 CMR 5.04). 61What data are collected: Information about filled prescriptions for schedule II through V medications is reported electronically each business day to the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) in the Department of Public Health's Office of Prescription Monitoring and Drug Control (OPMDC) by all Massachusetts community, hospital outpatient and clinic pharmacies as well as from outofstate mail order pharmacies that deliver to patients in Massachusetts. Schedules II through V medications consist of those prescription drug products with recognized potential for abuse or dependence (e.g., narcotics, stimulants, sedatives). Consequently, they are among those most sought for illicit and nonmedical use. The specific medication as well as the dosage and the number of pills or amount are also captured. In order to facilitate the monitoring of individuals who receive scheduled medications, basic identifying information like full name, gender, date of birth, and full address are also recorded as well as information about the prescriber and dispensing pharmacy. Availability of data: PDMP reporting is comprehensive for pharmacies within the Commonwealth with very few instances of noncompliance among pharmacies. PDMP data arrives daily and is considered complete and accurate for export and analysis within approximately two weeks. Limitations of the data: The PDMP dataset has a few noteworthy limitations. First, methadone clinics do not report to the Massachusetts PDMP as they are exempt by statutory language. Specifically, the PDMP only collects data on prescriptions dispensed, and methadone in clinics is administered pursuant to medical order, not prescription. Methadone is only include when prescribed for pain. Second, controlled substance prescriptions dispensed by Veterans Administration (VA) facilities are not included. This represents a high risk population and a significant data gap. Third, prescription drugs that are obtained illegally (e.g., stolen, purchased on the street, etc.) are a potentially significant contributor to the opioid overdose epidemic and are not captured within an individual's PDMP history, but may be captured by the OCME toxicology screens. Finally, a filled prescription should not be interpreted to mean that an individual took all or even any of that medication. Linking these records with toxicology data can provide some insight into the proportion of scheduled medications that are illegally diverted for other purposes than originally intended. Massachusetts Ambulance Trip Record Information System (MATRIS)67 - Office of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS)68 What data are collected: The Department of Public Health's Office of Emergency Medicine (OEMS) established the Massachusetts Ambulance Trip Record Information System (MATRIS) in December 2010 as a statewide system collecting emergency medical service (EMS) incident data from licensed ambulance services. Under EMS System regulations, ambulance services are required to document each EMS call and include the data elements pertaining to the call that are specifically referenced in an administrative requirement issued by OEMS governing the statewide EMS minimum data set. MATRIS data elements are based on the National Emergency Medical Service Information System 67 For more information see: www.mass.gov/dph/oems/matris 68 The collection of detailed ambulance trip data by OEMS is authorized under 105 CMR 170.345(B) . 62(NEMSIS) Version 2.2.1 dataset standard developed in 2005. This includes demographic, clinical, operational, and billing data. Demographics required are patient age, birth date, gender, and patient home address. Also required are incident type, incident address, dates, times, destination facility type, destination facility name, and destination facility address. Patient name is not currently required but is submitted approximately 70% of the time. MATRIS can identify nonfatalopioid related events, even when the patient refuses transport to the hospital. MATRIS tracks when naloxone was administered either by the EMT or as \"prior aid\" by other first responders, (fire, police) or bystanders (friends, family). Evaluation on interventions provided by EMTs can be performed to correlate survival and other outcome rates when linked with outcomes from ED and death data. Availability of data: Ambulance incident information is to be submitted into the MATRIS secure website electronically from all licensed ambulance services in Massachusetts within 14 days of the call; however frequency of submission varies by service. Many of the larger ambulance services have automated daily submission, while others can take longer to submit. There are currently over 6.4 million ambulance trip records in MATRIS. There were 1.3 million records in MATRIS for incidents occurring in both 2013 and 2014. There are 1.4 million for 2015 available for future analysis. Limitations of the data: MATRIS has several limitations. The first is that the NEMSIS standard does not specifically identify incidents as being opioidrelated, but rather \"poisoning/ingestion\". The second, the data are not uniformly reported by EMS providers. The third limitation is that the overall usability of the data submitted by ambulance services varies by provider, with roughly 30% of the provided data being partially or completely unusable. These issues are partially mitigated through the integration with other datasets listed above. Finally, whether a specific ambulance trip involves an opioid overdose is not a simple judgment. The classification of opioid trips was based on an algorithm developed in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Their assistance was invaluable. Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (RVRS)69 - Birth Records70 What data are collected: The collection and dissemination of this data are to facilitate the surveillance of births and birth trends in the state of Massachusetts, including those based on demographic information and data on birth outcomes. Data are reported to the Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (RVRS) by all licensed birthing hospitals and birthing centers and by city and town clerks if they are establishing a home birth that occurred in their city/town in Massachusetts. The birth data contains identifying information about the parents of record and the child. These data are critical to understand the health risk to a mother who delivers a Substance Exposed Newborn (SEN) or an infant with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). 69 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departmen ts/dph/programs/admin/dmoa/vitals/ 70 The collection of Confidential Birth Information is authorized under 105 CMR 350.000. 63Availability of data: Natality information is reported electronically using the Vitals Information Partnership (VIP).71 The VIP system is webbased and receives information 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Substantial quality control efforts are required to assess the accuracy and completeness of birth records. As a result, the final dataset of birth records is usually available by May of the following year. Limitations of the data: As legal records, the information recorded on birth certificates is considered highly accurate. However, some information like race and Hispanic ethnicity are not always fully populated. Massachusetts Cancer Registry (MCR) 72 - Cancer Staging73 What data are collected: The Massachusetts Cancer Registry (MCR), a database managed by the Department of Public Health, is a population based registry that tracks the incidence of cancer within the Commonwealth. Since 1982, the MCR has captured key data elements such as date of diagnosis and cancer stage at diagnosis, in addition to various demographic data elements. For this purposes of this work, MCR data was included because palliative treatment for late stage cancers often includes the use of opioid medications to control pain. Being able to distinguish those cases of high opioid use for cancer treatment from cases where an individual may be abusing prescription medications was critical to this study. Availability of data: Reporting facilities are required to report case level data to the MCR within 180 days of diagnosis or first date of patient interaction. Analysis of supporting documentation related to determining the stage of a cancer also takes considerable time. Typically, MCR data availability lags the calendar by approximately two years. Limitations of the data: Defining the stage of a cancer is not an exact science. It is based on a number of written reports and laboratory tests. Furthermore, not all cancers cause significant pain even in late stages. These data can provide an indication that medications may have been prescribed for pain but they cannot definitively rule out the possibility that there was underlying abuse. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME)74 - Circumstances of Death and Toxicology Reports75 What data are collected: The OCME, a part of the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, gathers a great deal of information about unattended and other deaths where the underlying causes may not be apparent. Not of all of the information collected is relevant to opioid overdose deaths, 71 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments /dph/programs/admin/dmoa/vitals/vitals information partnership vip.html 72 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departm ents/dph/programs/admin/dmoa/cancer registry/ 73 The collection of detailed cancer incidence and staging by the MCR is authorized under Chapter 111, Section 111B. 74 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eopss/agencies/ocme/ 75 The collection of death certificate data is authorized by MGL Chapter 38. 64so the work reported here has focused on the circumstances of death recorded on the OCME intake forms and the toxicology reports used to determine the cause of death. The data field labeled \"circumstances of death\" is a brief narrative that describes the setting and environment of an unattended death. It is often written by the State Police in the case of acute opioid overdoses. These narratives are analyzed by searching for the presence of key words. The toxicology reports describe the presence of hundreds of specific chemical compounds that might be found in the body of the decedent. This study has focused primarily on the presence of natural and synthetic opioids. Availability of data: The intake forms that contain the circumstances of death narratives are usually available within about 72 hours of a case being accepted by the OCME. Toxicology screening and confirmatory tests are conducted by the Crime Laboratory run by the Massachusetts State Police as well as the NMS Labs (Willow Grove, PA). Toxicology tests lag the date of death by about 60 days. Limitations of the data: Written narratives will provide initial impressions of the circumstances of death. As first impression, these can be misleading in some cases. Final causes of death must be provided by physicians and medical examiners. Toxicology results can be extremely complex to interpret. Levels of drugs found a decedent's tissue are affected by the timing of the test, the type of tissue, and other factors. Many drugs also metabolize into a variety of different chemical compounds. For all these reasons, toxicology results are generally examined in broad categories to simplify interpretation. OCME data are connected directly to the death records using the unique OCME ID number. OCME and RVRS death records link nearly 100% of the time. Finally, the vast majority of the toxicology records for early 2013 were only available on paper and thus not practical to include in this report. Case Mix Database 76 - Inpatient hospitalization, emergency department visits, and outpatient observations managed by the Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA)77 What data are collected: The Case Mix data contains all inpatient hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and outpatient observation in the state. Massachusetts acute care hospitals are required to submit Case Mix data to the Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) in order to track disease burden and associated costs statewide. Detailed information is available for each encounter, including geography (e.g., zip code, town, county, state, country), demographics (e.g., age, race, ethnicity), and costs by service (e.g., medical/ surgical, behavioral health), admission and discharge dates, diagnosis, and the facility providing patient care. Case Mix data can identify individuals who received past treatment for a substance overdose including healthcare encounters 76 Accessed at http://www.chiamass.gov/case mixdata/ 77 Massachusetts acute care hospitals are required to submit Case Mix data in accordance with Regulation 114.1 CMR 17.00. 65associated with detoxification, psychiatric care, and overdose based on procedures rendered or diagnoses made when these services are offered by acutecare hospitals. Availability of data: The Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) receives data quarterly. Significant work is required to clean and harmonize the data across hospitals. As a result, there is approximately a one year lag between final data submission to CHIA by acute care hospitals and receipt of the data by DPH and other approved organizations. Limitations of the data: The Case Mix data does not include hospital services rendered to Massachusetts residents by nonMassachusetts hospitals or hospitals operated by the Veterans Administration (VA), thus reducing the observable analytic universe. Similarly, CHIA does not currently collect information from behavioral health hospitals. Demographic data included in Case Mix is not considered as accurate as those recoded on birth of death records. Consequently, the linkage of these records to other datasets may be incomplete. Furthermore, the coding of encounters for overdose or for behavioral health services is not considered fully complete. Finally and possibly most important for the Chapter 55 project is that Case Mix data are available on a Federal fiscal year. The most recent data available is through 9/30/2014 which means that any data on nonfatal overdoses, substance abuse treatment, or mental health diagnosis codes won't be captured in the final three months of the study period. NonScheduled Pharmacy Claims78 - Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database (APCD)79 What data are collected: The Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database (APCD) is managed by the Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA). The APCD contains health and pharmacy insurance claims data from the approximately 80 private health care payers, public health care payers (including Medicare and MassHealth) and publiclysupported managed care organizations and senior care organizations across the entire state of Massachusetts. The APCD insurance eligibility files include basic identifying information like full name, address, gender, date of birth, race, ethnicity, and Social Security number. Most APCD data requested from CHIA focused on pharmacy claims for nonscheduled medications. Availability of data: The APCD is overseen by CHIA, the independent state agency responsible for collecting, cleaning, maintaining, and managing access to the data. Data are reported out once a year and each report contains all data from the previous calendar year. The newest version is available approximately 6 months after the close of the preceding calendar year. Limitations of the data: The APCD forms the backbone or spine of the linked datasets. Its completeness and accuracy are critical to the entire effort. In recent years, CHIA has expended 78 Accessed at http://www.chiamass.gov/ma apcd/ 79 CHIA has statutory authority to collect data from both public and private health care payers under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 12C, section 10. By July 2010, Regulations 114.5 CMR 21.00 and 114.5 CMR 22.00 formally established the APCD in Massachusetts. 66significant resources to link records across payers. The current APCD contains roughly 15 million unique records which is substantially above the 6.3 million residents in Massachusetts. Most of these records are single records unconnected to a full set of identifiable records. Other analyses undertaken for this project suggest that the unique records prepared for the APCD serve the purpose intended. Other known limitations of the APCD include exclusions such as Workers' Compensation, TRICARE/Veteran's Health Administration, and the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan claims. Additionally, uninsured individuals (approximately 3% of the state's population) are not captured. Finally, healthcare services provided but paid for out of the patient's own finances, e.g., cash payment for a convenience care clinic service like a strep throat culture, are excluded because these services do not generate claims. Department of Correction (DoC)80 - Incarceration and Treatment81 What data are collected: The Department of Correction (DoC), a part of the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, is required by statute to maintain adequate records of persons committed to the custody of the department. In addition, DoC must establish and maintain programs of research, statistics, and planning, and conduct studies relating to correctional programs and responsibilities of the Department. To achieve those goals, DoC maintains a database of individuals incarcerated in Massachusetts prisons. This database includes the substance abuse treatment received by prisoners. Identifiers like full name, gender, date of birth and Social Security numbers are also included. Availability of data: As releases from prison are routine, these data are kept current. Limitations of the data: DoC data includes incarcerations for those in prison and does not include data for people in jails or houses of correction (HoC). The data from DoC used in this analyses (e.g. those incarcerated during the study period and released) is only a subset of the individuals incarcerated within Massachusetts during this study period. This analysis does not included individuals that were not released during the study period, and it does not include individuals incarcerated within HoC. HoC servers a higher volume of inmates per year in comparison to DoC, primarily due to shorter sentences and those waiting trial within Hoc. Due to this limitation, using DOC data to understand the intersection between fatal opioid overdoses and the criminal justice system in Massachusetts does not provide a full picture to determine associated risks. An additional limitation arises if residents of Massachusetts are incarcerated outside of Massachusetts as that data is not captured by the DoC. 80 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eopss/agencies/doc/ 81 The collection of detailed incarceration data by DoC authorized under MGL c. 124, s. 1(j) and MGL c. 124, s. 1(k). 67Appendix C: Additional Single Table Discussion Additional Single Table Discussion: Prescription Monitoring Program (PDMP) Key Findings: The Chapter 55 work has allowed for a robust analysis of key PDMP measures with the other linked datasets. Looking at PDMP data alone, it is notable that although there has been a sevenpercent annual increase in Schedule II filled prescriptions since CY 2000; a slowing in that trend in the most recent years has been observed. This is primarily attributed to a reduction in opioid prescribing in the recent time period. It is too early to determine whether this reduction in opioid prescribing will result in fewer opioidrelated overdose deaths over time. The Chapter 55 work has highlighted the alarming increase in opioidrelated overdose deaths attributed to Heroin and most notably Fentanyl. How prescription opioid use/abuse impacts transitioning to these illicit drugs will be a key area of focus moving forward and the Chapter 55 linked databases will play a critical role in addressing these questions. Other key findings identified from analyzing the PDMP dataset are that while 2 in 5 Massachusetts adults had a prescription for an opioid during the study period, only 8 percent of people who died from an opioidrelated overdose had legal access to prescription opioids within a month of their death. This is critical information because without linking the datasets and reviewing medical examiner data, there is no way to estimate the extent to which diversion of prescription opioids plays a role in the opioid overdose epidemic. Additionally, the linkage with PDMP and death files highlights the significance of polysubstance use in risk of overdose death. The data show that having a concurrent prescription for opioids and benzodiazepines results in a fourfold increased risk of opioidrelated death. One additional key finding from analyzing the PDMP dataset concerns the issue of individuals obtaining controlled substance prescriptions from multiple providers (i.e., visiting different prescribers for similar or same controlled substances and having these prescriptions dispensed at different pharmacies). The occurrence of multiple provider episodes (MPEs) can be identified from analyses of the PDMP data. Linkage with the death records provides a more complete understanding of the risk that this type of activity poses in opioidrelated overdose deaths. Table C.1 presents the opioidrelated overdose death incident rate analysis of having different numbers of prescribers and pharmacies (0 = individuals who died were not linked to any prescription records in the PDMP). The findings clearly show the increased incidence (more than 3fold) of having 3 or more different prescribers compared to only 1 prescriber who writes prescriptions for controlled substances. Even more striking is the apparent increase in overdose incidence when obtaining these controlled substance medications filled from three or more pharmacies compared to using only one pharmacy (18.34 versus 1.09, respectively). This apparent risk that having dispensed controlled substance prescriptions from multiple pharmacies can help inform policy moving forward. 68Table C.1: Incidence of opioid overdose deaths associated with multiple provider episodes (20112014) Prescribers Incidence (per 10,000 per year) 0 1 2 3+ Opioid Deaths 0.97 0.99 2.72 9.73 Pharmacies Incidence (per 10,000 per year) 0 1 2 3+ Opioid Deaths 0.97 1.09 4.28 18.34 Additional Single Table Discussion: Massachusetts Ambulance Trip Record Information System (MATRIS) Key Findings: By utilizing the linkage authorized by Chapter 55 with MATRIS and death data, EMS response was shown to be highly successful in preventing fatal overdoses. The finding that 95.8% of the patients with an opioidrelated ambulance trip did not die during the study period and only 18.6% of opioidrelated decedents had one or more opioidrelated ambulance trips confirms that 911 response leads to a high reversal rate. Overdose campaign strategies encouraging EMS activation should continue. Of people who had an ambulance trip for a nonfatal overdose prior to their fatal overdose, 29.3% did not have an ambulance trip for their fatal overdose. This indicates that there are possible missed opportunities for interventions after the nonfatal overdose. Some examples of these interventions are: recovery coaching, treatment, and education on withdrawal and tolerance. This finding also supports the need for further promotion of the Good Samaritan Laws to encourage calling 911 for an overdose without fear of legal repercussions. Additional Single Table Discussion: Massachusetts Cancer Registry (MCR) Key Findings: The MCR data are included in this project so that cancer diagnosis can be controlled for in multivariate analyses. It is not intended to be analyzed separately. There is a well known association between late stage cancer diagnosis and opioid prescribing. It was important to be able to take this into account when looking at risk of opioid death as it relates to opioid prescribing patterns. Additional Single Table Discussion: Department of Correction (DoC) Key Findings: Data from the Department of Correction (DoC) included information on all inmates who have been released from DoC incarceration between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2014. The cohort included 25,209 inmates who had a total of 38,961 releases from prison. Prior studies have demonstrated that inmates face an increased risk of death, compared with the general population, 69following release from prison in the United States and abroad82,83. Since only 20132014 deaths were available, inmates released only during this same time period were used to calculate the risk of death faced by those inmates after release from prison and investigate whether they had a higher risk of death after release. Of the 14,533 inmates released in 20132014, 287 died from all causes and 121 consequently died from an opioidrelated overdose during the study period. In this group, 42.2% (n=121) died from an opioidrelated overdose. In comparison, for the total population in the state, opioidrelated deaths accounted for only 2.1% (n=2,192). The leading cause of death was injuries of all intents: 124 unintentional injuries, 16 suicides, 9 homicides and 5 injuries of undetermined intent. The second leading cause of death were illdefined conditions signs and symptoms (30 deaths), cancer (20 deaths), heart disease (20 deaths), and chronic liver disease (9 deaths). Looking at the leading cause of death, we see that these were mostly unintentional poisonings involving opioids. Deaths from opioidrelated overdoses were more common among persons younger than 45 years, whereas deaths from cardiovascular disease and cancer were more common among those 45 years of age or older. Inmates who died from opioidrelated overdoses were significantly younger than those inmates that died from other causes (35.0 vs. 47.0 years). See Table C.3. Table C.3: Mean Age at Death with 95% Confidence Intervals (20132014) Age At Death (years) Mean Lower 95% Upper 95% All deaths 41.9 40.3 43.6 NonOpioid Deaths Nearly onequarter of released inmates in 20132014 who died of an opioidrelated overdose died within 30 days of release. The mean time from release to death was 13 months, ranging from dying within the same month as release (or in prison) to 42 months later. See Figure C.4. 82 Merrall EL, Kariminia A, Binswanger IA, et al: Metaanalysis of drugrelated deaths soon after release from prison.

NEngl J Med 356:157- 65, 2007 70 Additional Single Table Discussion : Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS) Key Findings: Between 2011 and 2014, 149,351 people received addiction treatment or other recovery related services from providers that report to the BSAS. These clients were 76% white non Hispanic, 68% male, had a median age of 37 years. Of the 149,351 people utilizing services, 87% (130,452) had at least one admission in 20112014; the remaining 13% utilized services in programs in which they were admitted to prior to 2011. Based on clients with admissions in the study period, 60% reported prior mental health treatment and 20% reported a prior overdose. Additionally, 47% had at least one opioidrelated admission. Similarly, people admitted to treatment reporting opioid use has increased since FY 2012. Of the clients reporting an opioid problem, the percentage that report a Heroin problem has increased over the last several years, as those that report a problem with other Opioids has simultaneously decreased. In fact, treatment admissions for nonHeroin opioids increased from 3.7% of all opioid admissions in 2000 to 21.8% in 2011 and then dropped to 9.9% in 2014. This suggests that Heroin is a major contributor in regards to the increase in treatment admissions for Opioid addiction. Although it is important to note that prescription opioids still play a role in opioid addiction and overdose. Over half of the individuals who received treatment through BSAS had a prescription for an Opioid in the PDMP during the study period. 2,832 of the 149,351 clients (1.9%) died in 2013 and 2014. Of these deaths, 1,026 were due to opioidrelated overdoses (36.2%). The remaining 1,806 deaths were due to chronic disease or other causes (Figure C.6). 25.6%14.9%27.3%32.2%33.1% 14.5%15.7%36.7% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80% less than a month 31 91 days 91 181 days more than 6 monthFigure C.4: Time to Death for Released Inmates (20132014) Opioid Deaths Other Deaths 71 Of all confirmed opioidrelated overdose deaths in 20132014 (n = 2,192), 47% (n=1,026) utilized addiction treatment and recovery services in BSAS system (Figure C.7). Demographics of Fatal Opioid Overdoses among BSAS clients Among the 1,026 people who died of an opioidrelated overdose and utilized addiction treatment and recovery services in the BSAS system, 85% were White nonHispanic, 71% were male, and they had a median age of 36 at the time of death.

Of the 1,026 people utilizing services, 91% (933) had at least one recent admission in 20112014; the remaining 9% utilized services in programs in which they were admitted to prior to 2011. Based on these 933 clients with recent admissions, 87% had at least one opioidrelated admission, 79% reported prior mental health treatment, and 51% reported a prior overdose. Key Take Aways Treatment admissions for opioid problems now account for more than half of all BSAS treatment admissions. Treatment admissions for nonHeroin opioids increased from 3.7% of all opioid admissions in 2000 to 21.8% in 2011 and dropped to 9.9% in 2014. Over half of persons who received treatment through BSAS had a prescription for an opioid during the study period. Nearly half of individuals who died of opioidrelated overdoses had a confirmed addiction treatment history in the BSAS system. Of the BSAS clients who died of an opioidrelated overdose, 60% utilized acute treatment services and 91% had a recent admission to any BSAS treatment or service. 73Appendix D: Data Linkage Data linkage for the Chapter 55 work was conducted by the Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) in consultation with the Department of Public Health (DPH). Six levels of matches were tested between individual Chapter 55 datasets and identifiers found in the All Payer Claims Database (APCD). All matches were deterministic. A conservative approach to matching was used, so no \"near\" or \"close\" matches were considered. In other words, all successful matches had to be exact at one of six levels. The complete matching scheme is described below. The most reliable match is a \"1\", and so on down the chart to the least reliable, a \"6\". Match Level Identifiers To Be Matched 1 Exact match on first name, last name, Social Security number, gender, birth date, street address #1, street address #2, town of residence, and zip code. 2 Exact match on last name, Social Security number, gender, birth date, town of residence, and zip code. 3 Exact match on Social Security number, gender, and birth date. 4 Exact match on first name, last name, gender, birth date, street address #1, street address #2, town of residence, and zip code. 5 Exact match on first name, last name, gender, birth date, town of residence, and zip code. 6 Exact match on first name, last name, gender, and birth date. CHIA processed each Chapter 55 file independent of all other files. To speed the process of the linkage work, there was no requirement for CHIA to perform data standardization or to deduplicate the data within or across files. Since data fields, collection methods, oversight, and quality vary from source to source - and even record to record - it is possible that \"John Smith\" got a Level 1 match in File1 but then the same \"John Smith\" appeared twice in File2 , getting a Level 2 and a Level 3 match due to algorithm rules and/or missing data. Alternatively, the various John Smiths may not be related. Without a focused deduplication effort, or a secondary weighted probabilistic match, it is impossible to know how often this might have occurred. Other tests of reliability of the matching scheme indicated that this was not a frequent occurrence. If duplicates were found within a file, each of these records was assigned the same projectspecific ID (see Appendix F, deidentification). A summary of the matches across all datasets can be found in Table D.1 below. 74Table D.1: 2.3 1.9 9.1 13.7 98.9 4.2 0.7 2.2 Row % 77.8 2.7 45.6 19.5 66.9 24.0 66.7 Row % BSAS 37811 1679 1340 55956 149252 13131 Column % X 7.3 1.1 27.7 4.2 1.0 52.2 Row % 25.3 1.1 0.9 37.5 >99.9 8.8 MATRIS 25138 2864 221811 514866 8664 Column % X 17.1 59.3 16.6 3.6 34.4 Row % 4.9 0.6 43.1 99.9 1.7 MCR 99 67898 146673 234 Column % X 2.1 5.1 1.0 0.9 Row % 0.1 46.2 99.7 0.2 TOX 2332 4815 302 Column % X 0.2 0.03 1.2 Row % 48.3 99.6 6.3 Case Mix 1333862 10298 Column % X 9.2 40.8 Row % 100 0.7 APCD 25205 Column % X 100 Row % 0.2 DoC Column % X Row % 75Appendix E: Data Quality and Strategies for Handling Missing Data Data Quality Analysis: Each data owner cleaned their data according to their usual standards. To provide some uniformity to the process of data cleaning, DPH conducted a fourstep cleaning process for all analytic datasets that it held prior to delivery to the server on which all Chapter 55 datasets were stored. The first step was to screen for duplicate records; the second step was to measure the distributions of categorical and numeric variables; the third step was to assess overall data environment quality by examining various aspects of the linkages across tables; and the fourth step was to compare the linked and unlinked records for differences in demographic categories. Step 1. Evaluation of duplicate identification values A count of identification values was performed and compared to a count of distinct identification values for each analytic dataset. The ratio of those values indicated the level of duplication if any. The level of record duplication detected was minimal. Step 2. Distribution of Categorical and Numeric Variables The larger the dataset the more likely it is to contain some invalid or unknown values. For example, no age should be a negative number and it is unlikely that any age is above 110. In order to assess the quality of each variable across the datasets, it was important to quantify the frequency, percent, and cumulative percent of all valid and invalid information. High percentages of invalid data were corrected wherever possible. Assessing the quality of each numeric variable was extended to include binary variables represented by 0/1. The summary of numeric variables included quantifying the mean, maximum, and minimum values and a flag to indicate if the variable was binary. These values were calculated across all analytic datasets and applicable variables. As above, the rate of invalid data detected was minimal. Step 3. Overall Environmental Quality The data were evaluated for overall quality, which included determining how much overlap exists across datasets. Each unique ID was assessed for presence in each dataset and ultimately in how many and in which specific datasets the unique ID appears. The total number of ID's with a single hit as well as the total number of ID's with more than one hit were reported. Inconsistencies were evaluated based on prior knowledge of what constitutes irregular patterns among tables in which ID's appear. Step 4. Linked Versus Unlinked Data A sixlevel deterministic matching algorithm was used for matching each dataset with the APCD Spine. For more information about this process and the percentage of matches for each dataset, please see Appendix D. Before proceeding with any analysis, it was important to understand whether there were any pronounced biases between those records that were linked to the APCD Spine and those that were not. Individual records from original sources, such as MATRIS ambulance trip data, were excluded from the analytic environment when a match could not be 76made to the CHIA spine. By comparing the demographic patterns between the linked and unlinked records, it is possible to gain a basic sense of whether the linking produced a biased dataset and thus required greater care when interpreting the results. Upon review of the datasets provided by the participating organizations, in general, there were no systemic or nonrandom patterns with two exceptions: 30% of all records, 25% of opioidrelated records, provided by MATRIS for ambulance trips were unlinked due to missing identifiers, such as first name. This was observed to be ambulance servicespecific and therefore geographically biased, causing artificially low representation of Boston. To address this issue missing geographic information was imputed for individual rides, not patients. By imputing the geographic information, ambulance trip data could be analyzed on an aggregate basis and the 25% of opioidrelated events that would have been excluded were able to be used. See the section below titled \"Data Strategies\" for further information about this work. The Department of Corrections dataset also exhibited statistically significant deviations when comparing the linked and unlinked comparison. This dataset is being examined to understand the root cause of the deviations and to determine what, if any, adjustments need to be made. The current hypothesis is that longer duration prison terms lead to shorter windows of opportunity to acquire health insurance or file a health claim and therefore appear in the Mass APCD. Given the large data files in use, many demographic categories showed statistically significant difference but these were not considered to be of practical importance. Missing Data Strategy: In any complex analytics project, data quality is a key consideration. High quality data leads to high quality results and trustworthy interpretations. Knowing the importance of the opioid threat and the criticality of providing trustworthy interpretations, the project team developed a data quality strategy to overcome known limitations in the data. These limitations are caused by imperfections in the data capturing mechanisms. For example, some fields or data elements may be optional from an operational perspective, but turned out to be critical from an analytics perspective. For this Chapter 55 Report, the team adhered to two guiding principles, identified three types of archetypal data limitations, and devised five approaches to deal with them. Guiding Principles: The guiding principles informed the strategy by helping to frame the problem and align the solution to the aims of the Ch. 55 Report. The first guiding principle was to be analytically rigorous and valid. This principle should allow readers to focus on results, conclusions, and interpretations rather than flaws in methodology. The second guiding principle was that a false positive was less harmful than a false negative. What this means is that the approach slightly biases toward overreporting of critical incidents rather than underreporting since the data capture is inherently biased towards under capturing. To illustrate this, consider a nonfatal opioidrelated overdose. The data may show 1,000 for a given time period in a given geographic area. In reality, however, if perfect data was available the real 77number may be as high as 1,100. It is well known that some nonfatal overdoses are not recorded if the person is not transported by EMS or is seen in a hospital emergency department. The strategy taken here seeks to modify the data to get closer to the true value of 1,100 by using the observed values as a minimum instead of a midpoint for confidence intervals. Common Data Limitations: As the word implies, common data limitations are not unusual. They are seen in many datasets including the Chapter 55 datasets. They are partiallymissing or conflicting data, missing columns, and missing rows. Partiallymissing or conflicting data occurs when the linkage across datasets results in either one dataset having a field that another lacks (e.g., a death record for a particular individual may contain their gender while their PDMP record may not), or when two datasets have different values for the same field (e.g., a death record for a particular individual may indicate they are male while their PDMP record indicates they are female). A missing column arises when a one or more types of information are not included in a dataset. For example, education level is only recorded within the death records but not the other nine Chapter 55 datasets. A missing row arises when either a record for an individual is never recorded but service was provided or when an event occurs that is normally recorded but no record is ever made. Data Strategies: To address these limitations, five strategies were deployed. The first strategy addressed the partial and conflicting data challenge by establishing a \"trust hierarchy\" that created a single source of truth for each resident's demographic data based on reliability of the respective sources of that data. The second strategy addresses missing columns caused by \"border leakage\", a problem that arises when services are rendered outside of the State of Massachusetts and therefore not captured by any governmental agencies. To address this challenge, a border flag was created and appended to each record with a residence zip code that was near any Massachusetts state border. This variable could then be used as a covariate to help manage the risk of services missing due to geographic constraints. The third strategy dealt with missing columns due to cash payments. Since healthcare is so heavily claims and payeroriented, when a resident chooses to pay cash instead of use their insurance for select services, those records would not be found in the data, with one notable exception which is the PDMP. By using the PDMP's cash payment indicator, researchers developed a Propensity to Use Cash Model, which helps account for utilization that may be hidden due to cash payments. To address missing rows, a SAS Macro was developed to create confidence intervals around summary statistics using a technique known as bootstrapping. This methodology incorporates uncertainty about the data to resample known data over and over again. This resampling leads to multiple simulated alternatives from which a distribution of outcomes can be derived and used to infer what the actual true value would be with perfect data. For example, data may show 50 opioidrelated deaths in a given month, by using this methodology, one could observe that 90% of simulated alternative samples are below 57 opioidrelated deaths and therefore establish a confidence interval that the true number of opioidrelated deaths is between 50 and 57 for that specific month. The difference between observed and calculated is based on the trustworthiness of the underlying datasets.

See 79Appendix F: Data Privacy and System Architecture A determination was made at the outset of the Chapter 55 project to be able to examine all datasets in relation to each other. This required the development of a linkage or crosswalk so that individuals in one set could be located in the others, yet without revealing the identity of the matched person. The privacy concerns about holding, managing, and processing direct identifiers for so many sensitive datasets are considerable, and the processes developed to address these concerns were both thoughtful and innovative. In order to protect the privacy of the individual datasets, four approaches were used: Encryption: All data was encrypted in transport and at rest. Deidentification: Direct identifiers were removed from each dataset prior to analyst access. The unique identifiers randomly generated for individuals were projectspecific , meaning that no record IDs could be used to trace information back to any dataset held by any data owner now or in the future. Securing the Server: The server on which the Chapter 55 datasets were stored was secured so the likelihood of unauthorized access was minimized to the extent possible. Preventing Misuse by Analysts: Additional restrictions were placed on authorized access to the server on which the Chapter 55 datasets were stored in order to minimize the likelihood of intentional or unintentional misuse of the data. Each of these approaches is described briefly below. Encryption Given the sensitivity of the data involved in the Chapter 55 analysis, multiple levels of encryption were used with the intent to limit data access to only authorized parties. Whenever data was stored at rest, whether on the server or other hard media, it was protected by at least 256bit encryption and industrystandard strong passwords. Further, whenever data needed to be transported - for example between DPH and CHIA - it was placed in an encrypted file container on physical media that used hardware based encryption. This doublyencrypted drive was then manually transported by a trusted and authorized team member to its destination and handdelivered to the proper recipient, or similarly retrieved for a return trip. Deidentification Chapter 55 datasets are not truly linked in the most commonly used sense of that word. In most cases, linkage implies a merger of datasets. For Chapter 55, a crosswalk is developed between datasets but the datasets themselves were never actually merged. This is an important distinction. By not merging data, it is argued that risk of reidentification of individuals who have information in two or more datasets is minimized. Furthermore, the unique identifiers contained in each dataset are not 80found in any other project. Thus, if any breach of data or transmission protocol occurred, then the data could not be linked back to any source data file. The specific steps taken to minimize of the risk to data privacy through deidentification are below. See Figure F.1 for a visual depiction of this process. 1) A pool of roughly 54 million random, nonsequential, 20digit IDs (Random IDs or RIDs) was created at DPH. This number of values was sufficient to assign to every record of each of the constituent Chapter 55 raw datasets an ID that was unique across the entire project. 2) With RIDs affixed, each dataset was divided into two parts: direct identifiers (Identifier set) and analytic data (Analytic set). The only common information across both was the RID. The Identifier sets were hand delivered to CHIA. As noted under the Encryption section, all data was encrypted using 256bit AES encryption with strong protection consistent with EOHHS and MassIT policy regarding password contents and length. 3) Distinct from DPH's RIDcreation effort, CHIA created an extract of the All Payer Claims Database (APCD) that included only the fields to be used for the linkage scheme matching (Appendix D), plus an additional projectspecific ID (PID). This PID was a random unique 20digit number. It was in no way related to, nor derivative of, CHIA's Master Person Index (MPID) or any other persistent identifying code. This master extractplusPID is known as the APCDSpine. 4) For each Identifier set, CHIA compared each record to the APCDSpine. (For additional details on the data linkage, please see Appendix D.) Where a match was found, the PID and match level were associated with the RID from the Identifier set. 5) Upon confirmation from CHIA that an Identifier set was successfully matched to the APCDSpine, DPH then deleted that Identifier set from its server. 6) The result set of matched PID/RID and match level were returned to DPH through the same secure mechanism as the delivery of the Identifier sets. 7) The RIDs within the returned result set were used to appropriately assign PIDs (and match confidence) to matching records in the Analytic sets. This allows the Analytic sets to be de identified, but also connectable across datasets. 8) Because DPH had deleted the Identifier set, it was never in possession of the PID, RID and direct identifiers at the same time. 9) After assigning the PIDs to the Analytic sets, DPH securely delivered each Analytic file to the Massachusetts Information Technology Center (MITC) to be securely loaded onto the designated server. 10) In order to prevent merging of data, the projectspecific identifiers and the analytic files for each Chapter 55 dataset were permanently stored in separate folders. 11) After all Chapter 55 Identifier sets have been matched and the Chapter 55 project no longer needs the APCDSpine, CHIA will then delete it, destroying any connection between direct identifiers and PIDs at CHIA. 81Figure F.1: Step by step process for transferring data securely from DPH tp CHIA to MITC 82Securing the Server There were three main goals in securing the SAS server: 1) Develop a clear audit process 2) Ensure proper encryption for the different needs of the users 3) Make it so that it was possible to handle more than a small number of group types in the system These three goals were achieved in the following manner: The disk partition on which the Chapter 55 data was stored was encrypted using LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup). Linux is the opensource version of the UNIX operating system and LUKS is the standard hard disk encryption method for Linux servers. To provide further flexibility in the design of the secure data ecosystem to the needs of the Chapter 55 project, Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.0 was used. Accounts were authenticated by LDAP, which is the MITC standard, and account creation was handled through specific (not automated) requests to the MITC Linux team. A unique mount point for the Chapter 55 project was created so that only group participants could gain access. The interface for Chapter 55 work was through the web server interface with data encrypted at rest including all individual work files. An audit process was implemented to record when and who was doing maintenance on/for SAS. All inbound requests to the server were blocked unless the requestor was on a preapproved whitelist. The firewall restricted access to specific ports on the server. Ports were continuously monitored. Preventing Misuse by Analysts: To minimize the risk of misuse of Chapter 55 data by authorized users, the following processes were implemented as what has been collectively termed a Privacy Shield . Access to Chapter 55 data was only permitted using Enterprise SAS Studio software Only authorized users were given User IDs and passwords to access the Chapter 55 data. Authorized users were required to demonstrate that DPHrequired privacy and confidentiality trainings were up to date. Only deidentified Analytic sets were accessible by analysts. Analysts had \"read only\" access to Chapter 55 datasets. Writes were not permitted. Analysts were not permitted to see the raw Chapter 55 Analytic data. This was accomplished by turning off the ability of authorized users to open and view raw Analytic data files. 83 Analysts were not permitted to see small cell sizes. The common SAS procedure for producing counts and crosstabulations (PROC FREQ) was altered so that it masked (by displaying asterisks) any cell count that was between 1 and 10. All temporary SAS work files were deleted in one of three ways. If shutdown of a process was typical, files were deleted upon shutdown. If shutdown was atypical (e.g., power outage), the system searched for orphaned work files every 15 minutes and these files were deleted. If any data query was open for more than 72 hours, then the system administrator could manually shut down a process which would delete any associated SAS work files. An audit process of all commands issued to SAS was implemented. Logs were checked to ensure that no analyst made any attempt to export, print, or otherwise view any Chapter 55 data. See Figure F.2 for a visual depiction of the Chapter 55 Data Warehouse. 84Figure F.2: Data analyst access to Chapter 55 datasets through a secure hardware and software Privacy Shield. 85Appendix G: Legal Agreements In order to meet the legal requirements of working with all of these protected datasets, a number of legal documents were produced. Four different types of agreements were signed. 1) Linking - This agreement between DPH and CHIA allowed for the exchange of data for the purposes of securely connecting data at the individual level across secure datasets without exposing the identity of the individual so connected. 2) Sharing - This agreement outlined the methodology and restrictions allowing for the sharing of data between different departments or agencies that were not previously sharing - or even allowed to share, outside of the Chapter 55 project. Each of the datasupplying entities was a signatory to this ISA. Specifically, signatories include: the Department of Public Health (DPH), the Department of Correction (DoC), the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), and the Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA). While CHIA has previously signed the Linking agreement, they are also intended to be a provider of Analytic data from the All Payer Claims Database (APCD) and Case Mix. 3) Hosting - An agreement between DPH and MassIT specifying the hosting responsibilities and restrictions for the data infrastructure. 4) Access - An additional agreement created for ad hoc access to data outside of the purview of the prior three agreements. For example: If the Data Office within MassIT were to assist in a way that required analytical data access that is not covered by the 3rd agreement (which is hosting specific). This 4th agreement essentially outlines the responsibilities of being a good data steward and requires a signature for access. There would conceivably be n number of these agreements signed over time. 86 Appendix H: Crosstabulations of Chapter 55 Datasets with Death File Demographics Table H.1: All Deaths in Massachusetts compared to DoC population Characteristic All Deaths in MA DoC Age\u2014 no.

(%) High School or I: Background on Addiction & the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services Addiction Background: The etiology of addiction is dependent upon biological, psychological, and social factors. Antecedents of addiction include individual vulnerability levels, drug or object exposure, and drug or object interaction. More specifically, throughout the course of development, people encounter and accumulate specific combinations of neurobiological and psychosocial elements that can influence their behavior. Some elements increase the likelihood of addiction, whereas other factors are protective and reduce the chance of addiction (e.g., social support networks). Individuals with psychopathology (e.g., major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder) often exhibit increased prevalence of drug use disorders. Furthermore, the prevalence of psychopathology is increased among individuals who are dependent on multiple psychoactive substances (e.g., Heroin, alcohol, or cocaine)8485. Various sociodemographic risk factors (e.g., relating to poverty, geography, family, and peer groups) can influence the onset and course of drug use that can similarly affect the likelihood of developing addiction.868788 Starting in fiscal year 2012, clients receiving BSAS treatment reporting an opioid problem at the time of admission exceeded the number of clients reporting a problem with any other substance (31% in 2000 compared to 55% in 2014).89 A significant portion of the increase was due to prescribed and illicit prescription drugs up to 2011, after which there was a drop in this category and a sharp increase in Heroin admissions. Each expression of addiction, poses similar as well as unique consequences. Opioid Addiction, for example, poses very particular risks and adverse consequences, i.e. hypoxia (decreased oxygen to the brain), sepsis, and nonfatal/ fatal overdose. There is an elevated risk of exposure to Opioids in Massachusetts given the trends in the last decade. Opioids are a class of drugs that are naturally occurring but are also produced in a synthetic and semisynthetic fashion. When Opioids bind to receptors in the body they can reduce the perception of pain. Opioids can produce many different side effects including: respiratory depression, drowsiness, mental confusion, and nausea. However, Opioids can produce a feeling of euphoria since they affect the brain's reward circuitry. Opioids can be prescribed for pain management, but they can also be illicitly obtained. Some examples of can be prescribed for pain management, but it can also illicitly be obtained either on its own, or combined with Heroin. The potency of an Opioid as well as the combination of more than one Opioid, or the combination of an Opioid with a sedative can pose elevated risks for adverse consequences.

New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1984. 89 This includes both Heroin and other opioids. 94for these adverse consequences has to do with fundamental components of the disease. People with addiction often experience episodes of abstinence, and relapse. When there is a period of abstinence which is followed by a relapse, a person is at enormous risk for overdose. This risk is due to tolerance and withdrawal. Tolerance and withdrawal can be explained as (1) an increased dose of a drug or object is needed to experience the same subjective effects as with a lower dose before,(2) the experience of withdrawal upon stopping use with the presence of three or more symptoms: dysphoric mood, nausea or vomiting, muscle aches, pupillary dilation, sweating, fever, diarrhea, convulsions, or tremors, and (3) the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.90 Tolerance among Heroin users, for example, refers to the observation that regular users require more Heroin to get the same level of intoxication experienced previously at a lower dose; withdrawal means that these users get sick when they stop using the drug and that using the drug again can make this stereotypical pattern of illness stop. The potency of a drug can also play a critical role in the relationship between abstinence, relapse, tolerance and withdrawal; if a similar dose is used, but the potency is stronger than the previous dose there is a risk for overdose and death. Addiction treatment is intended to help individuals stop compulsive behaviors and drug and/or alcohol seeking and use by providing them with medication and behavioral coping skills as tools. Treatment can occur in a variety of settings, take many different forms, and last for different lengths of time. Because addiction is typically a chronic disorder characterized by occasional relapses, a short term, onetime treatment is usually not sufficient. For many, treatment is a longterm process that involves multiple interventions and regular monitoring. There are a variety of evidencebased approaches to treating addiction. Treatment can include behavioral therapy (e.g. cognitivebehavioral therapy or contingency management), medications, or their combination. The setting for service delivery may be inpatient, or outpatient. A clinical recommendation for treatment depends on the individualistic needs of a client.91 People with Addiction often suffer from other health (e.g., depression, HIV, Hepatitis), occupational, legal, familial, financial, and social problems that should be addressed concurrently. The best programs provide a combination of therapies and other services to meet an individual's needs. Psychoactive medications, (e.g. antidepressants, antianxiety agents, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic medications) may be critical for addiction treatment success for patients that have cooccurring mental disorders. Currently, the BSAS data set does not account for all these critical elements of people served in our treatment system; however there is potential to collect and analyze this information in the future. 90 American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM5. Washington, D.C: American Psychiatric Association. 91 There are evidencebased guidelines from SAMHSA and associations like American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) and American Psychological Association (APA) for particular treatment services and for particular populations. For instance, there are guidelines for clinically evaluating patients to determine what is medically necessary and determine individualistic needs. The guidelines outline standards of care for stabilizing patients with withdrawal symptoms during detoxification and there are recommendations for maintenance care. The guidelines also specify MAT dosing for detoxification purposes as well as maintenance. Often, people with severe addiction are polysubstance users and require treatment for all substances abused. 95BSAS Data Collection: Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS) is the single state authority responsible for regulating and licensing substance abuse treatment providers throughout the Commonwealth. The Department's authority is defined under MGL Ch.111 B and E. Under this authority, the Department must ensure that treatment services are available along the continuum of care from detoxification to recovery. The Department can also engage into contracts with private providers and fund services. The Department currently licenses American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) levels I - IV but only funds levels I - III. The services that fall under the funded categories range from acute detoxification to residential and outpatient based services. In addition to licensing, regulating, and funding treatment services, BSAS funds prevention and recovery support services throughout the Commonwealth. 96Appendix J: Partnerships The Chapter 55 project brought together analysts and researchers from across government, six academic institutions, and two private consulting firms. First and foremost, the Department of Public Health would like to thank all those who participated in this effort. Without everyone's assistance, this report could not have been completed in time. The work done here has been groundbreaking and the collaboration has been extraordinary both inside and outside government institutions. The concept of a shared, integrated, data environment, accessible by government, academic institutions and private enterprise predates both this opioid epidemic and the Chapter 55 legislation. The March 2015 report to the Legislature titled \"Feasibility Proposal and Implementation Plan for a Public Health Data Warehouse\" describes much of the infrastructure, data security plans, and the partnership goals that were central to the Chapter 55 work. One specific goal stated in the March 2015 report captures the approach taken by all parties. It was, \"To design a technical architecture for a data warehouse that utilizes state resources efficiently while enabling secure access to public health data for internal and external users.\" This goal was an acknowledgement that each type of organization (i.e., government, academic and private industry) had essential but incomplete resources and expertise relevant to completing the work undertaken in the Chapter 55 project. The Chapter 55 report, therefore, became the catalyst that motivated a collective and concerted effort towards bringing the vision of a shared, integrated, data environment to fruition. The collaborative, multisector, work done to date is a single instance of the vision. The Chapter 55 project represents a process that should be continued, adapted, and refined as new public health challenges and new collaborators emerge. The Department would specifically like to thank the following institutions.

The total number of deaths has increased five -fold in the last 20 years, but the rate of increase of opioid -related overdose deaths was particularly sharp between 2013 and 2014.1 The maps below show a graphic depiction of the increasing and spreading opi oid crisis in Massachusetts between 2011 and 2015 (the darkening area on the maps below) . Not since the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s has Massachusetts seen such a sharp increase in a single category of deaths. Increasing and Spreading Opioid -Relat ed Overdose Death Rates in Massachusetts from 2011 to 20152 2011 2015 The characteristics of the epidemic in Massachusetts are similar to other states. What is especially notable is that this epidemic does not conform to the stereotypical boundaries of race, class, gender , and geography. Almost every community is affected overdose deaths and nonfatal opioid -related overdoses are highest among younger males, but all population subgroups have seen increases in recent years. Individuals released from incarceration are also at high risk of death upon re - entering the community, but so too are individuals experiencing hom elessness , veterans, mothers with opioid use disorder , and individuals with serious mental illnesses.

By 2015, that number had increased to 46%. The full -sized maps can be examined in Appendix D. 8 Fighting the current opioid epidemic has been a priority of the Baker -Polito Administration since day one. In February 2015, Governor Baker appointed a working group to develop a plan to reduce the rate of opioid -related deaths in the Commonwealth. In June 2015, the Governor 's Opioid Working Group released 65 recommendations and a comprehensive Action Plan aimed at curbing the current opioid epidemic. The se short - and long -term recommendations focus on prevention, intervention, treatment, and recovery support . Today , nearly all of these recommendations are underway, making Massachusetts a national leader in terms of both investments and policy.3 Understan ding the complexity of this epidemic with precision is imperative to respond effectively. One part of this response includes the passage of Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2015 (Chapter 55) by the Massachusetts Legislature and Governor Charles D. Baker , and its reauthorization in Chapter 133 of the Acts of 2016. These laws enabled an unprecedented linkage and analysis of existing data across state government in order to better guide policy development and programmatic decision -making. The findings included in this report are a result of the linkages and analyses of more than 20 administrative data sets.4 Contained within this report are descriptions of analyses providing the state with important new insights into the profile of overdose -related deaths and nonfa tal opioid -related overdoses and the relative risks faced by the Commonwealth 's diverse populations. The report is divided into three main sections: Re-Estimating Baseline Statistics: This section provides more accurate estimates for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), Nonfatal Overdose (NFO), Deaths (OROD) . Timeline and Influences: This section offers an initial glimpse into the length of time between the stages of opioid use from an individual 's perspective from initial use of prescr iption medications to fatal overdose . Identifying At -Risk Populations: This section includes estimates of the risk of fatal and nonfatal overdose for each of seven at-risk populations including the homeless , veterans , and individuals diagnosed with severe mental illness . In each section, the left column contains succinct take -home messages including current status, data sources, and key findings and is organized for quick reference . The larger right hand area of each page contains more information includin g the background, basic methods used for conducting the analysis, teams involved in the analysis, and key findings for further analysis and for policy consideration. Finally, the appendices provide in -depth explanations and background information. 3 Accessed http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/stop -addiction/recommendations -of-the-governors -opioid -working - group.pdf on 5/19/2017. 4 Administrative data refers to information collected primarily for administrative (not research) purposes. 9 Key Findings : Massachusetts 2011 -2015 In 2015, it is estimated that over 4% of persons age 11 and older in Massachusetts had opioid use disorder. Nonfatal overdoses recorded by emergency medical services (EMS) , hospitals, and bystander interventions increased ~ 200% between 2011 and 2015. The total number of nonfatal overdoses between 2011 and 2015 exceeded 65,000. Almost half of the individuals who died of an opioid -related overdose during the study period were at one time classified as opioid na \u00efve5 during the study period. Risk for fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose grows as use continues. Compared to the general population, those who received three months of prescribed opioids in 2011 were 4 times as likely to die from an opioid -related overdose w ithin one year, and 30 times as likely to die of an opioid -related overdose within five years. It is estimated that roughly one in every 25 adults has been homeless at some point between 2011 and 2015. The risk of opioid -related overdose death for person s who have experienced homelessness is up to 30 times higher than it is for the rest of the population. The risk of fatal opioid -related overdose is six times higher for persons diagnosed with a serious mental illness (SMI) and three times higher for thos e diagnosed with depression. Compared to the rest of the adult population, the opioid -related overdose death rate is 120 times higher for persons released from prisons and jails. The five -year opioid -related overdose death rate of mothers with evidence of opioid use d isorder was 321 times higher than the rate among mothers without evidence of opioid use disorder . This effort also marks a continuation of the significant collaboration between state and federal government, academia, the health care system, and private industry. The Chapter 55 initiative has clearly demonstrated that partnerships can cross governmental and non -governmental boundaries to quickly address a pub lic health problem of acknowledged urgency. However, for these types of partnerships to become institutional and routine, it is critical to formalize relationships. Access to a unique dataset in a time of crisis may temporarily attract multidisciplinary pa rtners, but sustainability is best assured through formalizing data governance, mutually beneficial partnerships , and a plan for ongoing resourcing and data maintenance. These issues must be address ed to ensure continued success. The Department 's ability to engage academic partners and private industry to support monitoring and evaluation activities will be crucial, and collaborative, data -driven efforts such as this should become standard practice in Massachusetts and beyond. 5 To be categorized as opioid na\u00efve, the individual's records had to show a period of six months or more without an opioid prescription before their first opioid prescription. Patients excluded from the group were persons who had any advanced cancer (other than non -melanoma skin cancer), had a substance use disorder diagnosis in the six months preceding their first opioid prescription, or whose first prescription was for any buprenorphine formulation indicated for treatment of substance use disorder. 10 Section I. Re-Estimating Baseline Statistics There were indications in the information gathered during the first year of Chapter 55 work that data collected by government agencies about the opioid crisis portrayed an incomplete picture of the scope of the problem. The figure below depicts this hypothesis. In the center of the diagram is the Universe of Known Events , consisting of data recorded in administrative data sets like medical claims, ambulance trip records, and death certificates about Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), Nonfatal Overdose (NFO), and Opioid -related overdose deaths . The fact that we are in a crisis is made clear when we look at th ese data. The scope of the crisis , however, is not. Specifically, w hat is unknown are the actual number of unrecorded nonfatal overdoses and the total number of people with OUD. If we are to improve allocat ion of resources for individuals with OUD, we need to know how many people fit this definition and where they live. If we are to improve emergency services for people who have nonfatal opioid overdoses, we need to know how many people have overdosed, how many have overdosed repeatedly, and what proportion of reversals are overseen by bystanders. While opioid -related deaths are recorded on death certificates, there are strong indications that additional deaths may also be opioid -related. Internal data patterns suggest that publically reported counts of opioid -related de aths may still underestimate the size of the problem and also mask the impact of fentanyl on the death rates. This section of the report examine s the interrelationships among all the data sets to establish estimates for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), Nonfatal Overdose (NFO), and Opioid -related Overdose De aths (OROD) that are more internally consistent and consistent with all the relevant data. Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Nonfatal Overdoses Fatal Overdoses Universe of Known Events (Recorded) 11 Section I.a E stimating the Size of the Population with OUD Background: The rise in opioid -related overdose death rates nationally between 1999 and 2010 parallel s the increase in consumption of opioid analgesic s.6 While this general trend applies to Massachusetts, reliable state -level numbers for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) are difficult to obtain. Without citing a specific rate, o ne recent study using 2012 data suggest ed that the ra te of opioid use disorder in Massachusetts was nearly one -third higher than the national rate.7 However , opioid -related overdose deaths in Massachusetts have more than doubled since 2012 . Given this increase, it is more important than ever to obtain a reliable estimate of the size of the population with OUD. Basic Methods: In the normal course of business, government agencies collect vast amounts of administrative data to track events and transactions. While the data is often comprehensive, there are limitations to its use. One commonly cited limitation of administrative data is the likelihood that some information recorded is incomplete.8 Events may not be captured or diagnosis codes may not be listed. Analysts used records that were linked at the individual level across more than 10 administrative data sets. OUD is specifically coded in the All Payer Claims Database, Case Mix (hospital, ED and outpatient), death records, and the post mortem toxicology reports recorded by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. These values were used to form what was referred to as the \"Gold Standard\" measure for OUD. A \"capture -recapture\" analysis9 was used to estimate the true prevalence of opioid use. Individuals were identified using markers consistent with OUD in each Chapter 55 data source (i.e., the Gold Standard) . It was assumed that this data was an incomplete accounting of OUD in Massachusetts . Data was organized in tables by age group, sex, and county. Log linear models were used to fit the data to markers . The final model produced aggregate 6 Jones CM. Frequency of prescription pain reliever nonmedical use: 2002 -2003 and 2009 -2010. Arch Intern Med. 2012;172(16):1265 -1267. 7 Jones CM, Campopiano M, Baldwin G, McCance -Katz E.

Current Status : The best available estimate is that the rate of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) in MA is nearly one -third higher than the national rate. Data sources: Medical claims Hospital, ED, and outpatient data Death records Ambulance trips Post -mortem Toxicology Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Substance Abuse Treatment Birth records Dept of Mental Health Dept of Correction Houses of Correction Cancer Registry Dept of Housing and Comm unity Development Dept of Veterans' Services 12 estimates by year, county, gender, and age group. A combination of Poisson and zero inflated Poisson mode ls were used to estimate the population prevalence. Estimates were validated by comparing projected OUD rates with rates of fatal opioid -related overdose deaths. Key Findings: Using only data specifically coded for OUD, it is estimated that approximately 4.4% of Massachusetts residents age 11 and older have opioid use disorder . No single Chapter 55 data set include d all individuals identified by the Gold Standard of OUD. Linkage was critical to increase accuracy . The capture -recapture methodology produced annual estimates of OUD. There is an indication that the size of the OUD population may be increasing. Further study will refine these estimates. The proportion of the OUD population dying each year from opioid - related overdoses has nearly doubled between 2011 (0. 40%) and 2015 (0.68%). 0.0%1.0%2.0%3.0%4.0%5.0% 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015% OUD in MA Population Estimated OUD Population Rises Signficantly Between 2011 -2015 Key Finding: In 2015, over 4% of Massachusetts residents age 11 and older had opioid use disorder. 13 Epidemics occur in stages from growth to equilibrium to decay. The fact that the OUD population may still be increasing despite the fact that the proportion of population dying is also increasing may sugge st that we have not yet reached the equilibrium phase . Recommendations for Further Analysis: Develop analytic models for making estimates of OUD for individuals. Compare current OUD services for demographic and geographic populations to determine if service s should be adjusted . Examine changing demographic trends to d etermine whether the need for specific services is likely to change over time . The population in Massachusetts is getting older and more ethnically diverse. Evaluate the impact of transi tions of care for the OUD population 2014 2015% of OUD Population Dying Annually Proportion of Estimated OUD Population Dying Each Year Has Nearly Doubled Since 2011 Key Finding: The proportion of the OUD population dying each year from opioid -related overdoses has nearly doubled between 2011 (0.40%) and 2015 (0.68 %). 14 Section I.b Estimating the Number of Nonfatal Overdoses (NFO) Background: Some research has estimated that there are 20 nonfatal opioid - related overdoses (NFO) for every fatal overdose . 10 For Massachu setts, that would suggest that there could be 30,000 -40,000 nonfatal overdoses in 2015 alone. However, hospital , ED, and ambulance data record fewer than 20 ,000 event s combined . Furthermore , the 20 to 1 ratio comes from a study that is 15 years old and predates the influx of fentanyl into drug supply system . The actual estimates could be either higher or lower. More recent data from Vancouver found that nearly half of people who die of fatal opioid -related overdose had a previous nonfatal overdose in the preceding five years. 11 Since death rates in Massachusetts have increased so markedly since 2012, 12 it is important to know whether nonfatal overdoses have increased at the same rate. Records of nonfatal overdoses capture events when illegal activity may have been involved . As a result, those records are most likely incomplete accountings of the total number of events. To complete the picture, it is important to review data sources to ensure that estimates for different aspect s of the opioid crisis are lo gically consistent with each other. That is why the linked Chapter 55 data set is such a valuable resource. All known sources were brought together to provide this composite estimate. Basic Methods: Linkage is required to identify any nonfatal overdose event in the administrative data sets available for Chapter 55. Overdoses are captured in hospital and ambulance data, but those events must be linked with death records to determine whether the overdose was fatal or nonfatal. Overdose e vents for individuals are recorded in the Case Mix (hospital, ED and outpatient data), and MATRIS (ambulance trips) . While the Case Mix data is thought to be a fairly complete accounting of NFO see n in Massachusetts hospitals, it is less clear that the APCD captures all NFO events for which medical claims are paid. MATRIS data has known gaps . Some emergency medi cal services have failed to report required data . Also, NFOs from MATRIS are based on a composite of information recorded by the EMTs to produce a likely NFO 10 Darke S., Mattick R. P., Degenhardt L. The rati o of nonfatal to fatal heroin o verdose. Addiction 2003; 98: 1169 -71 11 Caudarella A, Dong Kerr T, Wood E, Hayashi K. Nonfatal overdose as a risk factor for subsequent fatal overdose among people who inject drugs. Drug Alcohol estimated that there are 20 nonfatal opioid -related overdoses (NFO) for every fatal overdose. This estimate predates the influx of fentanyl into the drug supply system. Data sources: Hospital, ED, and outpatient data Death records Ambulance trips Post -mortem Toxicology Census data (zip level) Community bystander reversals 15 event.13 Lastly , DPH's Bureau of Substance Abuse Services tracks some overdose reversals by community. However, this is also an incomplete picture of bystander reversals across the state. Given the variety of data sources used in this analysis , data linked at the individual as well as community level data was used to estimat e the total number of NFO . Extensive de -duplication of NFO events was required across the different data sets. All sources of data were used to develop a model of NFO that yielded a statistically reliable annual estimate of events in the state. Final e stimates of missing NFO data from MATRIS were computed b y comparing the ratio of projected NFO population rates at a community level to the rate of fatal overdoses by community. Values for community level \"undercounts\" were recorded. Finally, bystander revers als reported by communities were added to the community level \"undercounts\" from MATRIS . Key Findings: Reliable MATRIS data is only available starting in 2013. Ambulance trips due to opioid -related overdose increased by 110% in the two following years .14 Overdoses are counted by an algorithm that incorporate s many different pieces of information from the trip record for each ambulance run. Naloxone was administered by an EMT in roughly two of every five overdose events between 2013 and 2015 . While the actual number of naloxone administrations has increased over time , the percentage of 13 Data ent ered into MATRIS by EMTs was never intended to be diagnostic. 14 This number could be an overestimate since data recorded in 2013 may ha ve more missing information than subsequent years. 5525 9047 12050 050001000015000 2013 2014 2015EMS Transports for Opioid Overdoses Double in Two Years Recorded EMS Transports For \"Probable\" Opioid OverdosesKey Finding: Ambulance trips due to a probable opioid -related overdose increased as much as by 110% in two years. Naloxone was administered by EMS in roughly 2 of e very 5 of these overdoses. 16 opioid -related events where naloxone was administered has remained relatively unchanged . Multiple naloxone administrations by EMTs were up 27% from 2013 to 2015 , which aligns with the time period during which the presence of illicit fentanyl sharply increased in the drug supply system. No single Chapter 55 data set included all individuals identified with NFO. Linkage between data sets was critical for this analysis . Nonfatal opioid overdoses increased by ~200 % between 201 and 2015. The total number of nonfatal ov erdoses between 2011 a nd 2015 exceeded 6 5,000 .15 Annual estimates for nonfatal overdoses were compared to the number of fatal overdoses between 2011 and 2015. The figure below shows the year to year changes . 15 Linking data across multiple data systems along with the use of logi cal estimates of missing data has allowed DPH to determine likely counts for nonfatal opioid overdoses between 2011 and 2015. Nonfatal opioid overdoses in Massachusetts have increased by ~300% in four years . - 10,000 20,000 30,000 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015Estimated # NFOs Total Nonfatal Opioid Overdoses Rise Sharply Between 2011 and 2015* * MATRIS data only available from 2013 - 2015.

Key Finding: Nonfatal overdoses recorded by EMS, hospitals, and bystander interventions increased ~200% between 2011 and 2015. The total number of nonfatal overdoses between 2011 and 2015 exceeded 65,000. 17 Recommendations for Further Analysis: Since many nonfatal overdoses go unrecorded, the total number, and geographic and demographic distribution s may still be underestimated. To better understand these aspect s of the opioid crisis, more complex analytic tools (e.g., machine learning) should be used to estimate the number and distribution of nonfatal opioi d overdoses in Massachusetts. A careful examination of Naloxone distribution to communities should be studied using the Chapter 55 data set s to determine the effectiveness of this program. It will also tell us whether this program is increasing the proport ion of \"live s saved \" to total overdoses , and where to target program resources in the future. 18 Section I.c Estimating the Total Number of Opioid -related Overdose opioid -related overdoses have dramatically increased since 2000.16 In May 2017, DPH reported that there were at least 1,933 confirmed opioidrelated deaths in Massachusetts during 2016.17 In comparison, there were just onefifth as many confirmed opioid related dea ths (338) in 2000 .18 While t he number of opioid -related overdose deaths (OROD) is at the highe st level ever , initial analyses of Chapter 55 data indicated that the reported total may be an undercount .19 For example, opioid overdose was the listed cause of death for only 49.8% of those who died the same day as the naloxone administration by EMS . Similarly, there was a dip in the number of opioid - related overdose deaths for persons in their late 30's and early 40's. To better understand these unexpected results, the data was exa mined to determine if the reported numbers of OROD should be revised upward. Unlike the examination of undercounts of opioid use disorder (OUD) and nonfatal overdoses (NFO), undercounts of OROD are not caused by incomplete data . The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) certifies virtually all opioid -related deaths in the state. However, t he linked Chapter 55 data provides analysts with an opportunity to examine data patterns across many data sets that the OCME could not have seen at the time the cause of death was being certified . For example, w hen making a determinati on of the cause of death, the OCME cannot systematically examine treatment and prescription histories or other administrative records indicating long -term opioid use. These additio nal pieces of information can be used to shed light on whether there may be an undercount of opioid -related deaths. Basic Methods: Analysts used 25 3,378 linked records of deceased individuals . These records were linked at the individual level across eight additional administrative data sets. All causes of death were included. OROD for 16 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/stopaddiction/current statistics.html on 5/19/2017. at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/depar tments/dph/stop -addiction/current - statistics.html on 5/19/2017. 18 While some of the increase in opioid -related deaths could be due to more careful reporting, it is unlikely that increases of this magnitude are due to reporting differences over time. 19 Unreported data from the first Chapter 55 study showed an unusual number of deaths in different age groups with long histories of opioid use and treatment. This study examines the likelihood that som e additional deaths may be opioid -related. Current Status : The rate of recorded opioid -related deaths and number of deaths are higher than ever in Massachusetts. In 2016, there were five times as many confirmed opioid related deaths compared to 2000. This number may still be an underestimate. Data sources: Medical claims Hospital, ED, and outpatient data Death records Ambulance trips Post -mortem Toxicology Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Substance Abuse Trea tment 19 individuals was coded using the Medical Examiner's determination of cause of death . A predictive model w as developed using 15 dependent variables . Causes of deaths assigned to cases that had been referred to the Medical Examiner were assumed to be correct. The model produced results that could be interpreted conservatively or more broadly. The conservative approach focused only on a narrow range of cases with the specific ICD 10 codes for the cause of death that were drug related, related to respi ratory or cardiovascular conditions, or were undefined or unknown.20 The sum of the probabilities from the logistic model was counted as the additional opioid -related overdose deaths. The broader model u tilized all cases not referred to the Medical Examiner and summed the probabilities to obtain an estimate of the additional opioid -related overdose deaths . Key Findings: The percent of total opioid -related deaths by age group shows a drop between age 30 and 50 suggesting the possibility that deaths may have been undercounted. Before estimating total deaths, opioid -related deaths were examined for several temporal pattern s: seasonality, weekend/weekday differentials, and concentrations of deaths near the beginnings of months when benefit checks are often distributed. Approximately 20% more deaths occurred per day on weekends and also 20% more during the first 3 days of a m onth. There was no seasonality effect. 20 The Opioid Deaths by Age (smoothed) Notable Drop in Rate of Opioid Overdose Deaths Between Ages 30 and 50 Age 30 Age 50 Key Finding: Plots of opioid - related deaths suggest that fewer cases were recorded among persons age 30 to 50. 20 The number of opioid -related overdose deaths coded by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner more than doubled between 2011 and 2015. Two predictive models were developed to determine if the \"official\" count was lower than what might be expected when looking across the breadth of Chapter 55 data . These models suggest that there might be an additional 6% to 33% opioid -related overdose deaths between 2011 and 2015. Model 2 estimates were highest for 2011 (43% increase) and 2012 (42% increase) compared to 2015 (25% increase). Since the broader model included many categories of death that we re less related to long -term substance misuse or causes of death that were undefined or vague, it was felt that the re -estimate from the conservative m odel is most likely closer to the true value for OROD. - 1 2 3 4 Weekdays Weekend DaysFirst 3 Days of the MonthRest of the MonthAvg # of Opioid -Related Deaths Per Day Opioid Deaths Significantly Higher on Weekends and on the First 3 Days of the Month - 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015# of Opioid Relaed Overdose Deaths Opioid -Related Overdose Deaths More Than Double in 5 Years Deaths - Coded Deaths - Model 1 Deaths - Model 2Key Finding: Predictive models suggest that there might be an additional 6% to 33% opioid -related overdose deaths between 2011 and 2015 . The more conservative estimate (6%) is thought to be closer to the \"true\" value. Key Finding: Approximately 20% more opioid -related deaths occurred per day on weekends and also 20% more during the first 3 days of a month. 21 Recommendations for Further Analysis: A much d eeper examination of undercounted opioid -related deaths should be undertaken. Knowledge of which demographic groups are misclassified more frequently than others , and whether pattern s exist that indicate more frequent misclassification of official causes o f death , can guide further work in this area. 22 Section II. Timeline and Influences Opioid Na\u00efve Continued Use Nonfatal Overdose Impact of Fentanyl Introduction In addition to being able to look across many different data sets as was the case in the previous section, the Chapter 55 data set also allows analysts to look at individuals for up to a five year time period. There has been much discussion about the role of prescription medications in fueling the opioid crisis in Massachusetts and elsewhere. There is also growing evidence of the impact of fentanyl on the sharp increase in fatal and nonfatal overdoses in the state.21 While the Chapter 55 data can be used to establish the risk of fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose at each stage of the timeline, it can also be used to estimate the average length of time between the different stages. What is the growing risk following first use of medications? How rapidly does that risk increase? When does more continuous use become risky and how long does that take? After a nonfatal overdose (NFO), what are the risks for a second NFO and how long does that take? Finally, how has the availability of illicit fentanyl in the drug supply system changed these timelines? To fully understand how the transitions operate from one stage of opioid use to the next and how individual risk can be reduced , individual demographics, social determinants, medication use and other factors should be examine d in concert to develop an individualized risk model. That work is beyond the scope of this report. The following section will provide an initial glimpse of timeline from opioid naive to fatal opioid overdose . 21 Somerville NJ, O'Donnell J, Gladden RM, et al. Characteristics of Fentanyl Overdose \u2014 among the Opioid Na\u00efve Background: In the 1990s, support was building for greater use of opioids to manage pain.22 Throughout th e early 2000s, there was a steady increase in opioid prescribing for acute and chronic pain.23 24 For many years, this increase closely paralleled an increasing opioid -related death rate in Massachusetts and elsewhere, but rates for opioid prescribing and op ioid related overdose deaths have gone in different directions in recent years.25 That fact could be used to argue against the importance of examining opioid na\u00efve individuals. However, given the long -term statistical relationship between prescribing and ov erdose deaths from the early 2000s, it is important to better understand the rate at which this risk increases. Studies also show that the transition from opioid na\u00efve to opioid tolerant can be very brief - as little as one week.26 Despite the short time i t takes for the body to develop tolerance to opioids, relatively little is known about the short, mid, and long -term risks of opioid prescribing to the opioid na\u00efve. The Chapter 55 data set provides an opportunity to examine the risk for persons with littl e or no exposure to prescription opioids and to track those risks over time. Basic Methods: A binary operational definition for persons who were opioid na\u00efve was developed using Chapter 55 data . All individuals were classified as either opioid na\u00efve or not opioid na\u00efve. To be categorized as opioid na\u00efve , the individual's records had to show a peri od of six months or more without an opioid prescription before their first opioid prescription. Patients excluded from the group include those who: had any advanced cancer (other than non -melanoma skin cancer) had a substance use disorder diagnosis in the six months preceding their first opioid prescription, or whose first prescription was for any buprenorphine formulation indicated for treatment of substance use disorder 22 McQuay H.

Data sources: Medical claims Hospital, ED, and outpatient data Death records Ambulance trips Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Substance Abuse Treatment Current Status: While there is consensus that long -term and high dose prescribing of opioids puts patients at increasing risk of fatal and non-fatal opioid - related overdose, additional evidence is needed about the short -, mid-, and long -term risks of opioid prescribing to the opioid na\u00efve. 24 Opioid na\u00efve populations were examined annua lly between 2011 and 2015. They were compared to the general population for rate of fatal opioid overdose. Key Findings: The number of new opioid prescriptions dropped by roughly 50% between 2012 and 2015. Over three million individuals received new opioid prescriptions during the study period with a death rate of 6.2%. It is possible that the high death rate may reflect use of opioids for palliative care. The number of first prescriptions for patients classified as opioid na\u00efve using the definition abo ve dropped by nearly half between 2012 and 2015. Opioid na\u00efve patients were tracked for up to 66 months following the initial prescription. For those who died of an opioid -related cause , the mean length of time from initial prescription to the opioid -related overdose death was 36 months. 0200,000400,000600,000800,0001,000,000 2012 2013 2014 2015The Number of Opioid Naive Individuals with First Prescriptions Has Dropped 47% Since 2012 # of individuals with first Opioid RxKey Finding: The number of initial prescriptions for patients classified as opioid na\u00efve using the definition above dropped by nearly half between 2012 and 2015. 25 Almost half of all individuals who died of an opioid -related overdose during the study period were at one time classified as opioid na\u00efve during the study period. Recommendations for Further Analysis: Examine the risk of this population to determine other factors which increase, decrease, or mitigate the risk of fatal opioid overdose. Compare the data for this population to the post -mortem toxicology reports to determine if people are dying from prescr ibed opioid medications or if they have made the transition to illegal drugs such as heroin. Measure the average length of time between opioid naivety and coding of opioid use disorder in administrative data sets. 020406080100% Suviving of Those Who Died 0 ------ Months from Initial Prescription ------ 60 Average Survival Time For Those Who Died of Opioid Overdose was 36 Months Key Finding: Almost half of all individuals who died of an opioid -related overdose during the study period were at one time classified as opioid na\u00efve during the study period. Key Finding : For those who died, the mean length of time from initial prescription to opioid - related overdose death was 36 months 26 Section II.b Continued Use of Prescription Opioids and Risk of Fatal Overdose Background: Concern about changes in opioid prescribing practices has been evident for over a decade.27 Most people who receive an initial prescription for opioids after surgery or for pain do not continue to receive opioids after completing the initial prescription. 28 However, since most Massachusetts adults have filled an opioid prescription between 2011 and 2015,29 any increasing risk associated with th e continued use of prescription opioids puts hundreds of thousands of individuals at some ongoing risk for fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose. The analyses presented in this section will be a continuation of the work presented in the previous section on th e opioid na\u00efve population . The same cohorts will be tracked and estimates of fatal overdose risk will be calculated for different lengths of time of continued use. Basic Methods: A cohort who filled an opioid prescription for three months in 2011 or six months in 2011 or all 12 months in 2011 was tracked from 2011 through 2015 to see how many of them died from opioid -related overdoses each year. Data from the Prescription Drug Mon itoring Program was linked to death records for this analysis. The goal was to see how risk of death increased through time and as a function of the number of months an individual had a prescription for opioids in 2011. Key Findings: There has been a 47% decrease in the number of opioid na\u00efve individuals between 2011 and 2015 , and the total number of opioid prescriptions dropped 10% from its peak in 2012 to 2015 . 27 Compton WM, Volkow ND.

Data Sources : Death records Prescription Drug Monitoring Program 27 1.1 million people who filled opioid prescriptions in 2011 were tracked over time. Of these, over 40,000 persons were prescribed opi oids for the entire year, over 120,000 had more than six months of prescribed opioids, and over 220,000 persons had over three months of prescribed opioids. Compared to the general population, those who received three months of prescribed opioids in 2011 w ere four times as likely to die from an opioid -related overdose within one year, and 30 times as likely to die of an opioid -related overdose within five years. Recommendations for Further Analysis: A deeper analysis is req uired to understand the impact of fentanyl on the risk timeline for this 2011 cohort. It is possible that the trends seen for the persons prescribed opioids in 2011 may be different than in years where fentanyl was prevalent and opioid prescribing had drop ped to some extent. 012345 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015Millions of Opioid Prescriptions Total Opioid Prescriptions Fall Slightly Between 2011 and 2015 N/A 0200400600800 1 Year 2 Years 3 Years 4 Years 5 YearsOpioid -Related Death Rate per 100,000 Within 1 Year After Receiving 3 -Months of Prescribed Opioids, the Death Rate Quadruples. 3 to 5 months 6 to 11 months All 12 months# of months with Opioid Prescriptions in 2011 Key Finding: While there has been a 47% decrease in the number of opioid na\u00efve individuals since between 2011 and 2015 , the total number of opioid prescriptions only dropped 10% from its peak in 2012 to 2015 . Key Finding: Compared to the general population, those who received three months of prescribed opioids in 2011 were four times as likely to die from an opioid -related overdose within one year, and 30 times as likely to die of an opioid -related overdose within five years. 28 The analysis should be combined with post -mortem toxicology to determine if it is possible to pinpoint with some accuracy the point at which individuals transition from legal to illegal opioids. 29 Section II.c Risk of Overdose and Death after a Nonfatal Opioid Overdose Background: Identifying individuals with a non -fatal overdose (NFO) related to opioids and determining treatment patterns and use of substance use treatment services may provide an opportunity to intervene and improve future outcomes. Previous research has shown that mortality among individu als with substance use disorders is high, even among those receiving treatment.30 Additionally, individuals having an NFO from opioids, heroin, or related drugs may suffer from substantial morbidity from injuries and illnesses caused by the NFO.31 Increased access to opioid agonist treatment has been shown to be associated with a decrease in heroin associated deaths .32 Understanding the post -NFO risk can guide government agencies and the health care system to deliver more integ rated care that reduces the lik elihood of subsequent fatal opioid overdose . Additionally, treating conditions related to opioid use and NFOs may be very expensive for private and government insurers,33 so better understanding treatment access and provision may improve the evidence availa ble for policy on appropriate treatment access and utilization. Basic Methods: A cohort was constructed of Massachusetts residents ages 11 years or older who had either an opioid -related fatal overdose or NFO within the 2011 -2015 period .34 Individuals were identified for this cohort using hospital discharge data, data on ambulance responses, and death records. The cohort was tracked to determine whether individuals had 1) an overdose (fatal or non - fatal) at any point , and 2) a repeat overdose after the original NFO. Insurance status was determined using the All Payer Claims Database. 30 Gossop M, Stewart D, Treacy S, Marsden J.

For tho se whose initial overdose was fatal, we observe them as censored in our follow -up data. However, the construction of the original overdose cohort in this manner allows us to determine overall trends in the insurance status and type of individuals experienc ing an opioid overdose at any point in the time period. Current Status : Previous research has shown that mortality among individuals with substance use disorders is high, even among those receiving treatment. Data Sources : Medical claims Hospital, ED, and outpatient data Death records Ambulance trips Post -mortem Toxicology 30 For the overdose cohort, we constructed two dataset s - one with follow -up information for 12 months including the month of the first fatal overdose or NFO, and one with follow -up information for 24 months including the month of the first overdose. Estimates of the rate of fatal and repeat nonfatal overdose s were calculated. Key Findings: Of the Massachusetts residents who had a nonfatal overdose (NFO ) between 2011 and 2015, 94.8% of them were insured for the majority of the two -year follow -up period. Of those who were insured, 76.8% were enrolled in Medicaid . Of the Massachusetts residents who had a nonfatal overdose (NFO) between 2011 and 2015 , 6.2% h ad a fatal opioid -related overdose within one year following the initial overdose ; 9.3% of the sample ha d a fatal opioid -related overdose within two year s following the initial nonfatal overdose .35 Repeat overdoses were common in the coh ort, with 14.9% having one or more repeat overdose s during the one -year follow -up period and 19.1% during the two year follow -up period . For the two year period, being insured (versus uninsured) is associated with a 5% increase in the probability of a repeat overdose, controlling for demographics and health services utilization. However, being insured (versus uninsured) is associated with a 7% reduc tion in the 35 This includes individuals who had a fatal overdose as their initial entry into the overdose Overdoses . Repeat OverdosesNearly 1 in 10 Die with in 2 Years After an Initial Nonfatal Overdose Key Finding : 6.2% of the sample had a fatal opioid -related overdose within one year following the initial overdose. 9.3% of the sample ha d a fatal opioid -related overdose during the following two year s. Key Finding : Repeat overdoses were common in the coh ort, with 14.9% having one or more repeat overdose s during the one -year follow -up period and 19.1% during the two year follow -up period. 31 probability of having a fatal opioid -related overdose at any point during the period (including the initial overdose). Recommendations for Further Analysis: More advanced statistical modeling should be conducted to control for length of follow -up, comorbidities that impact medical care utilization, and differences in socioeconomic status . Examining associations between insurance status and type with opioid prescriptions and prescription use following an NFO is an important area for further study. There should be further examination of treatment provided to high - risk individuals by insure rs in order to ensure that they have appropriate access to evidence -based treatment . 32 Section II.d Estimating the Impact of Fentanyl on Background: Fentanyl is a opioid . It is a schedule II prescription drug,36 and it is typically used to treat patients with severe pain or to manage pain after surgery.37 While similar to morphine , fentanyl is estimated to be 50 to 100 times more potent.38 39 However, fentanyl is also increasingly manufactured illicitly and distributed for non -medical purposes often mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin without the users' knowledge. Nationally, two in five heroin -related deaths have involved fentanyl and the rate appears to be higher in Massachusetts.40 41 Adding to the public health concern is the fact that n ew synthetic opioids are now being found in New England . A recent warning about carfentanil is evidence of the evolving risk.42 In some cases, these new Illicit synthetics are many times as potent as fentanyl which is almost always illicit as well . When illicit fentanyl became common in the drug supply in Massach usetts, the death rates went up sharply. While evidence is emerging that fentanyl is a strong contributor to the sharp increase in opioid -related deaths in Massachusetts .43 this analysis will attempt to shed some additional light on that question. 36 Controlled Substances Act.

Characteristics of Fentanyl Overdose \u2014 Status : Nationally, two in five heroin -related deaths have involved fentanyl and the rate appears to be higher in Massachusetts . 33 Basic Methods: Two models were developed to estimate the impact of fentanyl on opioid related deaths in Massachusett s. Model 1 used the annual counts of opioid -related deaths between 2000 and 2011 to project annual opioid -related deaths for the period from 2011 through 2015. Fentanyl was first noticed in Massachusetts deaths beginning around 2011 . Actual deaths were com pared to the expected deaths from the projection model to yield additional deaths that may be attributable to fentanyl. Model 2 also used the individual death records but supplemented this information with data from post -mortem toxicology reports a s well as basic demographics and the individual's history of opioid use disorder (OUD) including medication assisted and other OUD treatments. The model was designed to determine the unique contribution that fentanyl has played in the increased death rate in Mas sachusetts. Key Findings: According to the New England High Intensity Drug Traffick ing Area (NE - HIDTA) group, seizures of pure fentanyl increased sharply between 2011 and 2015 . While seizures of heroin and other opioids doubled in this time, fentanyl seizures barely registered in 2011 and increased 70 -fold between 2014 and 2015. Oxycodone is the most commonly prescribed opioid. One in five persons dying of an opioid overdose had an active oxycodone prescription at the time of death. Less than 2% had an active prescription for fentanyl, a number that barely changed over the course of a year. This indicates that almost all fentanyl involved i n deaths is illicitly obtained. The f entanyl predictive m odel used trended death data from 2000 through 2010 to estimate likely deaths in 2011 through 2015. This is the dashed line in the figure below. Based on this model, t he number of additional deaths since 2010 due to fentanyl exceeds 2,000. 0%10%20%30%40% Active 1 Week 1 Month 6 Months 1 Year% of opioid deaths with valid prescription by time Fentanyl is Rarely Prescribed to Persons Who Die of Opioid Overdoses Fentanyl Oxycodone Key Finding: A simple model was used to estimate that 2,066 deaths were attributable to increased levels of illicit fentanyl in the drug supply. Data Sources: Medical claims Hospital, ED, and outpatient data Death records Ambulance trips Post -mortem Toxicology Substance Abuse Treatment Key Finding: While seizures of heroin and other opioids doubled in this time, fentanyl seizures barely registered in 2011 and increased 70 -fold between 2014 and 2015. 34 Recommendations for Further Analysis: While the i ncreasing levels of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply roughly parallel the temporal increase in deaths , a deeper analysis looking at each individual's history o f opioid use disorder, previous nonfatal overdoses, and mental and physical health co -morbidities is required to better understand the impact of fentanyl A geographic time series analysis should be conducted to show the spread of fentanyl and its relation to fatal and nonfatal overdose locally. If possible, algorithms should be developed to project where hot spots may occur in the future. 0500100015002000 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015Opioid Deaths Per Year More Than 2,000 Additional Deaths Attributable to Fentanyl Between 2011 -2015 Death Trend 2000 - 2010 Actual Deaths 2011 - 20152,066 m ore deaths occurred than predicted 35 Section I II. Identifying At -Risk Populations The Chapter 55 data enables the state to simultaneously examine many different groups who may be at risk for fatal and non -fatal opioid overdose. This work marks the first population -specific examination of opioid related overdose risk for several of the populations characterized in this report . The strength of the Chapter 55 data comes from the breadth of information gathered together in a single place. For example, data on homelessness is limited or not well validated in virtually all data sets. Howev er, evidence of homelessness can be found in 12 different Chapter 55 data tables. Pulling together these data enables analysts to fill in the gaps in individual histories or even to model missing data. This approach has been used to provide a more complete picture of the homeless population in the state. The same is true for veterans, those with mental health co -morbidities, young adults, those leaving Massachusetts jails and prisons after serving a sentence, mothers with opioid use disorder , and individual s served by a number of other government agencies. The core information presented in each subsection will provide estimates of the risk of fatal and nonfatal overdose for each of the populations studied. In addition, the overlap in these populations will be presented. This is of particular interest for persons receiving service or aid from a specific government agency. Knowing the likelihood that an individual is also connected to another agency may offer opportunities to collaborate across government to a ddress the opioid problem. The subpopulations examined were: Massachusetts Veterans served by VA Pharmacies and the Department of Veterans' Services Individuals experiencing an episode of homelessness or housing instability Individuals with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) Young Adults (ages 18 -25) Individuals Recently Released from Incarceration in Prisons and Jails Mothers with Opioid Use Disorder Residents of Massachusetts Communities and Regions 36 Section III .a Massachusetts Veterans Using the VA Pharmacies and DVS Services Background: Veterans comprise 5% of the Massachusetts population - more than 355,000 persons. A recent survey of Massachusetts veterans indicates that they reported problems with binge drinking, s ymptoms of depression and post - traumatic stress disorder along with financial, housing, and educational needs,44 making this group an at -risk population for opioid use disorder. While a Chapter 55 analysis of the broader relationship between Veterans' status and fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose will be examined at a later date, the population of interest here are Veterans who receive services and entitlements from the Department of Veterans' Services (DVS) along with those who dually utilize the Feder al VA pharmacy for prescriptions, including opiate prescriptions. Basic Methods: DVS provided a complete list of persons receiving financial support with DVS funds. Fewer than 10% of the total Veteran population in the state received benefits from DVS between 2011 and 2015. In order to expand the population to other Veterans, an operation al definition of \"Vet eran\" status was developed. To be counted as a \"Veteran\" in the Chapter 55 data set, an individual had to meet ANY of the following criteria: At least one record for housing, medical or other benefits in the DVS data between 1/1/2011 and 12/31/2015 AND wa s at 18 years old or more. At least one prescription filled at a VA pharmacy between 1/1/2013 - 12/31/2015 (the period for which data w ere available). At least one prescription in the PMP data between 1/1/2011 and 12/31/2015 where the type of payment was i dentified as 'Military Installations and VA .' A record of death in which the occupation was classified as 'military .' This definition identified 98,433 individuals. The Veterans identified using the definition above were cross -tabulated with the other at -risk groups reported on 44 Supporting Those Who Served in Massachusetts Needs, Well -Being, and Available Resources for Veterans by Carrie M. Farmer, Terri Tanielian, Shira H. Fischer, Erin L. Duffy, Stephanie Dellva, Emily Kristine Brown, RB -9945 -KLAFF Current Status : Massachusetts veterans report problems with binge drinking, symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder along with financial, housing, and educational needs. Little is known about the specific risk of fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose among Veterans. Data Sources : Medical claims Hospital, ED, and outpatient data Death records Ambulance trips Post -mortem Toxicology Dept of Veterans' Services 37 in this section. Finally, estimates of the rates for fatal overdoses were calculated for this group of Veterans. Key Findings: The average veteran identified was 54 years old, but the age distribution indicated that there were tw o distinct groups of veterans - one with an average age of 32 and the other with an average age of 67. More than half of the Massachusetts veterans identified were men. Unlike most at -risk populations, the Massachusetts veterans examined here had relativel y little overlap with other at -risk groups. One quarter were insured through MassHealth. The percentage of identified veterans who had a fatal opioid overdose was three times the state average. This was an unadjusted estimate, which did not control for Veteran specific characteristics such as age, physical and mental health co -morbidities, etc . Generation of an adjusted estimate is planned as part of further analyses. 0% Mental IllnessMA Veterans Had Little Connection to Other Service Agencies and At Risk Populations % as a total of the Veteran population examined in this report * Individuals receiving benefits through DTA. 0255075100 Coded as a Veteran Not Coded as a VeteranDeath Rate per 100,000 Opioid Death Rate ~3 Times Higher among MA Veterans Key Finding: Unlike other at-risk populations, the Massachusetts veterans examined here had relatively little overlap with other at -risk groups. Key Finding: The percentage of identified veterans who had a fatal opioid -related overdose was three times the state average. 38 Recommendations for Further Analysis: Examine \"dual use\" in this Veteran sample for opioid prescriptions (i.e., how many Veterans are getting their opioid prescriptions from both VA and non -VA pharmacies as compared to only VA pharmacies ). Further, examine whether these dual users are at an in creased risk of opioid use disorder, non -fatal opioid overdose and fatal opioid non overdose, and fatal opioid overdoes in sub -groups of at -risk Veterans (i.e., homeless, depressed, and th ose with PTSD ). Examine effect of the VA's Opioid Safety Initiative launched in 2013 on the rates of opioid use disorder and opioid related deaths in Veterans in Massachusetts. 39 Section I II.b Individuals Experiencing Homeless ness Background: Homelessness has been a persistent societal problem in Massachusetts and nationwide for decades .45 Despite the length of time policymakers have recogn ized the problem, accurate and complete data is difficult to obtain primarily because d ata systems are not well organized to track individuals experiencing homelessness . Some estimates, however , do exist. A 2016 point -in-time count in Massachusetts found that roughly 19,600 persons were experiencing homelessness on a given night \u2014of whom about two thirds were persons in families and the remaining one third were single homeless adults.46 Point -in-time counts, however, do not adequately capture the issue of housing instability or episodic homelessness since an individual's or family's risk of homelessness may be transient . With respect to risk of fatal and nonfatal opioid -relate d overdose, a 2003 -2008 study of homeless adults in Boston found that drug overdose was the leading cause of death for this population, occurring at rates 16 -24 times higher than in the general population. Opioids were a factor in over 80% of these deaths.47 In light of dramatic recent increases in opioid -related fatalities nationally, a more comprehensive and updated assessment of opioid overdose deaths among individuals experiencing homelessness in Massachusetts is warranted. Basic Methods: Government ag encies routinely collect vast amounts of administrative data to track events and transactions. These data include information about homelessness and housing instability in various forms, and while extensive , these data are limited in important ways. One co mmonly cited limitation of administrative data is the likelihood that some information recorded is incomplete.48 For example, data on emergency shelter utilization represent one of the most commonly used sources of administrative data to identify homelessne ss but do not identify homeless persons who do not use the emergency shelter system. Other administrative data sources such as medical records, data collected about ambulance trips , and death records include indicators of homelessness and housing instability, but not all episodes of homelessness are likely to be captured and diagnosis codes indicating 45 Lee, B. A., Tyler, K. A., & Wright, J. D. (2010). The new homelessness revisited.

Current Status: Homelessness has been a persistent societal problem in Massachusetts and nationwide for decades. Despite the length of time policymakers have recognized the problem, accurate and complete data on individual homelessness is difficult to obtain primarily bec ause data systems are not well organized to track a population that is periodically transient. Data Sources : Medical claims Hospital, ED, and outpatient data Death records Ambulance trips Post -mortem Toxicology Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Substance Abuse Treatment Birth records Dept of Mental Health Dept of Correction Houses of Correction Cancer Registry Dept of Housing and Comm Development Dept Veterans' Services 40 homelessness may not be listed during a medical encounter even for those who are experiencing an episode of homeless. For this study, mathematical modeling was therefore used to project the incomplete parts of data sets in order to yield a reliable prevalence estimate for individuals experiencing homelessness in Massachusetts.49 Analysts used 5,050,639 records that were linked at the individual level across 14 administrative data sets. To be included, individuals had to have data in at least one data set in addition to the All Payer Claims Database. 50 The records were randomly s plit into two portions - a training data set with 75% of the records and a test data set with the remaining 25%. Homelessness was specifically coded in the All Payer Claims Database, CaseMix (hospital, ED and outpatient data), ambulance trip, Prescription Drug Monitoring Program , and Department of Mental Health data, and an indicator in any of these datasets was categorized as a coded instance of homelessness.51 Predictive models using logistic regression were developed on the training data set to estimate t he likelihood of coded homelessness using more than 100 predictors. The resulting model was validated on the test data set on the coded homelessness measure described above and also other related variables. Since the validation demonstrated that the estim ated homelessness values were predictive of expected outcomes, a final homelessness measure was created using actual coded values where available and predicted probabilities where no code existed. These values were examined with respect to fatal and nonfat al opioid overdose to determine the risk for this vulnerable population. Key Findings: By linking data sets together and modeling patterns that could be related to homelessness, it is estimated that 1 in 25 adults ( 3.7%) was likely to have been homeless at some point between 2011 and 2015. 49 Our focus in this wo rk is primarily on the single adult homeless population with a future analysis to focus more specifically on the discrete population of persons in families experiencing homelessness. This distinction is warranted in light of evidence of differences in the characteristics of the single adult and family homeless along several dimensions. 50 Since the APCD forms the spine of the Chapter 55 data system, all individuals have at least some data in the APCD. 51 Records on the use of the Emergency Assistance (EA) family shelter system were available from the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), but were not included as an indicator of homelessness in the current analysis, as the intent was to i dentify the single adult homeless population as far as was possible with the available data. Key Finding: When relying exclusively on homeless - specific administrative codes, only 1% of the population was homeless between 2011 and 2015. However, by linking data sets togeth er and modeling patterns that could be related to homelessness, it was estimated that 1 in 25 adults (3.7%) was likely to have been homeless at some point between 2011 and 2015 . 41 At least three in eight adults who experienced homelessness between 2011 and 2015 have a coded diagnosis of a serio us mental illness .52 The opioid overdose death rate is between 16 and 30 times higher for the homeless individuals compared to the rest of the adult population .53 Recommendations for Further Analysis: Build on this initial analysis of the relationship between homelessness and opioid overdose to assess other questions of interest related to homelessness housing status. Potential areas for inquiry include: examining whether homeless status modifies (either positively or negatively) the effectiveness of naloxone; assessing whether persons experiencing homelessness are more likely to experience fatal 52 Coded in one or more of the administrative data sets. 53 The rate is 16 times higher for coded administrative data and 30 times higher for the modeled results. 0% 20% above)Mothers with OUDSerious Mental Illness2 in 5 Homeless Adults have been Diagnosed with a Serious Mental Illness % as a total of the homeless population * Individuals receiving benefits through DTA. 0100200300400 Homeless (Coded) Homeless (Modeled) Not HomelessDeath Rate Per 100,000 Opioid Death Rate 16 to 30 Times Higher for Individuals Experiencing Homelessness Key Finding: The opioid - related overdose death rate is 16 to 30 times higher for homeless individuals compared to the rest of the adult population . Key Finding: 39% of Homeless adults have had contact with the Dept of Transitional Assistance while 20% have been recently incarcerated in Massachusetts jails or prisons. 42 overdoses in which fentanyl is present; examine health care utilization patterns among persons experiencing homelessness to identify potential intervention points. Since the risk of opioid related death is significant for individuals experiencing homelessness, we should also examine fatal and non -fatal opioid overdose specifically among fam ilies who use the DHCD Emergency Assistance family shelter system . 43 Section III .c Individuals with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) Background: Persons with substance use disorder (SUD) have been found to be twice as likely to have mood or anxiety dis orders.54 However, among the criminal justice involved population, almost half have both a diagnosis of a serious mental health condition and substance use disorder.55 In January 2017, the Substance Abuse and Mental health Services Administration (SAMHSA) estimated that 1.5 million adults with serious mental illnesses (SMI) had misused opioid s in the previous year.56 SAMHSA defined SMI as \" a diagnosable mental, behavioral or emotional disorder (excluding developmental and substance use disorders) of sufficient duration to cause serious functional impairment in an individual's major life activities (going to work, school, interacting with family, etc.).\" The specific diagnostic categories included were mood disorders, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders. While the rate of opioid misuse is higher in the SMI population, the impact on fatal and nonfatal overdoses is not known. The Chapter 55 data system can shed much light on these relationships. Basic Methods: MassHealth prepared data that flagged persons with SMI using ICD 9 and ICD 10 diagnosis codes found in any medical claims administered by MassHealth . This flag was only available for MassHealth Clients and was based on the MassHealth definition of SMI . Other diagnosis groups were examined using the Case Mix hospital, ED, and outpatient data sets . These included Stress/Anxiety, Depression, Early Onset /ADHD, and Neuro -Cognitive diagnoses . Comparisons between the SMI group using MassHealth data and the hospital - based diagnoses using Case Mix should be done with caution. The risk of fatal and nonfatal overdose may be overestimated if based on the opioid -related risk for th e populations identified from hospital events , since hospital -related events may capture persons with more serious conditions tha n those identified through medical claims. All five groups examined with respect to fatal opioid overdose and c omparisons were m ade to the rest of the adult population in Massachusetts.

Current Status : SAMHSA estimated that 1.5 million adults with serious mental illnesses (SMI) had misused opioids in the previ ous year . While the rate of opioid misuse is higher in the SMI population, the impact on fatal and nonfatal overdoses is not known. Data Sources : Medical claims MassHealth Hospi tal, ED, and outpatient data Death records Dept of Mental Health 44 Key Findings: Roughly one in four persons ages 11 and older in the MassHealth population was identified as having a serious mental illness. Of these individuals, n early two in five have been homeless for some period of time between 2011 and 2015 while one in four has been served by the Department of Transitional Assistance. 57 57 Since only MassHealth data was used to identify SMI, all person s with SMI in this study above)Mothers with OUDHomelessPersons with SMI are More Likely to be Homeless and Receive Benefits Through Dept of Transitional Assistance % as a total of the SMI population * Individuals receiving benefits through DTA. Key Finding: Nearly two in five MassHealth members with a serious mental illness have been homeless for some period of time between 2011 and 2015. 45 Of individuals diagnosed with SMI in the MassHealth population, the opioid -related overdose death rate is more than six times the state average. In the Chapter 55 data set, through hospital records, o ne in six persons was identified having a stress or anxiety diagnosis , one in 10 persons in was identified as having a depression diagnosis , and one in 40 persons was identified as having a neuro -cognitive diagnosis . The opioid -related overdose death rate was roughly two times higher than the state average for those identified as having a stress or anxiety diagnosis. The opioid -related overdose death rate was roughly three times the state average for those identified as having a depression diagnosis. The opioid -related overdose death rate was roughly seven time s higher than the state average for those identified as having a neuro -cognitive diagnosis . Recommendations for Further Analysis: Examine all deaths that might be considered premature in order to better understand whether a larger number of cases involving persons with a serious mental illness might actually be intentional deaths (i.e., suicides). Examine nonfatal overdoses to see if the pro portion is related to greater degrees of isolation . 30.3 34.1 37.0 86.1* 95.6 12.8 - 20 40 60 80 100 120 Anxiety Depression ADHD SMI Neuro Cog MADeaths Per 100,000 Very High Rates of Fatal Opioid Overdoses for Persons with Some Mental Health Diagnoses *Among MassHealth members only Key Finding: The risk of fatal opioid -related overdose is six times higher for persons diagnosed with a serious mental illness (SMI) and three times higher for those diagnosed with depression. 46 Section III.d Young Adults (18 - 25 years old) Background: Eight percent of the state's population (538,000 persons) are 18 - 25 years old (i.e., \" young adults\").58 Nationally, young adults have a higher prevalence of prescription drug misuse than any other group with 5.9 percent reporting nonmedical use in the past month.59 Between 2002 -2004 and 2011 - 2013, heroin use in young adults increased 108% and fatal overdoses increased 86%.60 In 2014, young adults had the highest prevalence of past -year heroin use (0.8%) and prescription drug misuse (12.0%) compared to other age groups. When examining recent illicit drug use, young adults are almost three times as likely to report past year illi cit drug dependence and misuse as the general population.61 Young adults who use substances are also three times more likely to be HIV positive and twice as likely to have past year history of civil commitment (Section 35) to treatment . Since y oung adults may respond to engagement and treatment differently than older adults , further examination into developmental differences in this age group and the need to take a tailored approach to understanding their specific risk factors and treatment needs are critic al. Basic Methods: Age is a core demographic variable in the All Payer Claims Database (APCD) and thus young adults are represented in the Chapter 55 data as fully as they are represented in the APCD. The Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) estimates that annual representation of Massachusetts residents in the APCD exceeds 97%. Since the vast majority population was represented, no mathematical modeling or weighting was required. Key Findings: In general, young adults did not overlap with other at -risk groups. Approximately one -third were insured by MassHealth. One in 20 had been homeless and one in 20 had a diagnosis for a serious mental illness. 58 Accessed at http://censusviewer.com/state/MA/2010 on 5/19/2017. 59 J, Gladden M.

Of those incarcerated, nearly two -thirds (1.5 million) have substance use disorders, including up to one-quarter with opioid use disorder63,64,65. It has been estimated that one -third of heroin users pass through correctional facilities annually66. Few inmates with opioid use disorder receive addiction treatment during incarceration, and rates of relapse and opioid overdose -related deaths (109 deaths per 100,000 person years, or 15 percent of all deaths among former inmates) are tragically high following release67 68 69 70. Data from Massachusetts prisons and jails were used in this report. The Massachusetts Department of Corrections (DOC) manages all seventeen71 state correctional facilities or prisons. The 15 county jails72 or Houses of Correct ion (HOC) are managed by the county sheriffs. According to the DOC, the MA prison population continued to decline for the fourth year, dropping 15% after a peak of 11,723 inmates on January 1, 2012 to 10,014 inmates on January 1, 2016. The number of crimin al releases increased averaging 277 per month (3 ,329 total) during 2015.73 The DOC has acknowledged the drug problem within the prison 62 Glaze LE, Parks E.

Individuals incarcerated in Massachusetts jails were not examined previously. Data sources : Medical claims Hospital, ED, and outpatient data Death records Ambulance trips Post -mortem Toxicology Dept of Correction Houses of Correction 50 population .74 Indeed, the 2016 Chapter 55 opioid report found an approximately 50 times higher opioid overdose death rate in formerly incarcerated people compared with non-incarcerated Massachusetts residents .75 Basic Methods: The D OC and the county -based HOC data provided a complete listing of persons \"released to the street\" for the Chapter 55 study. DOC records covered the period 1/1/2011 through 12/31/2015. HOC records covered a slightly shorter period - 7/1/2011 through 12/31/2015. Since nearly the entire population was represented, it was decided that no mathematical modeling would be required to estimate the likelihood t hat a person had been released from a prison or jail. The linkage rate of DOC and HOC records to the APCD spine were 89.7% and 81.8% respectively.76 Key Findings: During the time period, there were 30,056 recently released inmates from the Department of Correction (DO C) and 29 ,068 from the House of Correction (HO C) for a total of 53,956 former inmates. Twenty -five percent of Mass achusetts prison inmates from DO C received treatment during their incarceratio n. The opioid overdose death rate is 120 times higher for those recently released from incarceration compared to the rest of the adult population. 74 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eopss/agencies/doc/ on 5/19/2017. 75 Accessed 5/19/2017. 76 For HOC data, incarceration dates are not reported for all county releases, so the full period of incarceration is not available for the data set. Hampshire and Berkshire counties did not submit data for FY2012 quarter 2, and Worcester County did not prov ide offender date of birth for CY2012 through CY2013 Q4, so their information is excluded for this analysis. 0.0500.01000.01500.02000.0 Incarceration History No Incarceration HistoryDeath Rate Per 100,000 Opioid Death Rate 120 Times Higher for Individuals with Histories of Incarceration Key Finding: The majority of individuals with history of incarceration have insurance through MassHealth; 42% of former inmates were considered homeless and 54% were considered a s having an opioid use disorder. Key Finding: Compared to the rest of the adult population, the opioid - related overdose death rate is 120 t imes higher for persons released from prisons and jails. 51 About three in five former inmates were considered homeless (coded plus estimated), over half were considered as having an opioid use disorder. Less than 2% were also among the veterans examined in this study. Opioid -related deaths among persons recently released from incarceration have increased over 1 2-fold between 2011 and 2015. Two in five deaths were opioid -related corresponding to one of every six opioid -related overdoses deaths in the state. In 2015, nea rly 50% of all deaths among those released from incarceration were opioid -related.

Nearly one of every 11 opioid -related overdose deaths were to persons with histories of incarceration in Massachusetts jails and prisons. 52 For individuals who died, the mean time from release to death was 19 months, ranging from dying within the same month as release (or in prison) to 58 months later. The first month after release proved to be a critical time period for former inmates . Opioid -related overdose de ath rates were significantly higher than for subsequent months .77 Former inmates who died from opioid -related overdoses were on average younger, more likely to be male, more likely to be White non - Hispanic, more likely to have a high school education or less, less likely to be married at or around the time of death, less likely to be in a management or professional occupation, more likely to be in a service and in farming/fishing/construction profession, and more likely to be recorded a s a veteran on death certificates compared with those who died from all other reportable causes. Recommendations for Further Analysis : Examining the impact of treatment on fatal and nonfatal overdose to determine if specific models are more effective wi th individuals who have been released from incarceration. More advanced statistical modeling should be conducted to control for length of prison time, comorbidities that impact medical care utilization, and other differences in socioeconomic status. 77 Since the data from Houses Correction only included release data and not dates of incarceration, the analysis focused on data from the Department of Correction. 050100150200250 Under 1 month1-3 months 3-6 months per 100 poerson years Opioid -Related Death Rates for Former Inmates are Higher in the Month of Release than Later Key Finding: Our findings also confirm that there is a significantly elevated mortality risk in the earliest time -periods after being released from a state correctional facility, when comp ared with other non - critical time periods. 53 Section I II.f Mothers with Opioid Use Disorder Background: Mothers with opioid use disorder (OUD) are a population of particular concern, since perinatal opioid use is not only associated with adverse health outcomes for the mother, but also with adver se health outcomes for her offspring across the life course. While 2013 estimates of current illicit drug use among persons aged 12 and older are higher for men than for women (11.5% vs.7.3%), research indicates women progress more rapidly to problem use.78 79 80 The proportion of pregnancy -associated deaths (deaths during or within one year of the end of pregnancy) in Massachusetts related to substance use increased from 14% in 2011 to 41% in 2014.81 Opioids were the most common substance indicated in these deaths. However, little is known about nonfatal opioid -related overdoses during pregnancy and following delivery. Because screening s of women in primary or prenatal care is not universal, opportunit ies are likely missed to identify women in need of OUD evaluation and treatment referral. The breadth of the Chapter 55 data set provides an opportunity to better understand whether pregnant women and new mothers with OUD are at greater or lesser risk of f atal and nonfatal overdose compared with new mothers who do not have an OUD and understand the timing of overdose events during the prenatal and postpartum periods. By linking the data of the mother and child, the Chapter 55 data set allows close tracking of the impacts on the substance -exposed dyad and estimation of future risks. Basic Methods: A cohort of women who delivered a live birth in Massachusetts between 2011 \u20142015 was identified by linking birth certificate records to maternal records in the All Payer Claims Database (APCD). Infant diagnosis codes for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) documented in APCD and CaseMix were also linked to mothers via birth certificate records. Fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose events were identified using CaseMix hospital records, MATRIS ambulance records, and death cert ificates. Women were classified as having evidence of OUD if any of the following were documented during the 5 year time period: 78 Derrington TM, Bernstein J, Belanoff C, Cabral HJ, Babakhanlou -Chase H, Diop H, Evans SR, Kotelchuck M.

More than a third (38.3%) of deaths among w omen delivering a live birth between 2011 and 2015 were fatal opioid -related overdoses, compared to a fifth (19.9%) among women who did not deliver a live birth. The five -year opioid -related overdose death rate of mothers with evidence of OUD was 321 times higher than the rate among mothers without evidence of OUD and the opioid -related overdose death rate among mothers delivering an infant with NAS was 27 times higher than the rate for all other mothers.

Standard statistics, based on very limited data, do not lend themselves to making clear statements about the burden of specific health conditions when community populations are small. However, by linking the Chapter 55 data at the community level, it is possible to gain insight into the opioid burden for all Massachusetts communities. Basic Methods: A four -step process was used to estimate overall opioid burden for all towns in Massachusetts. An assumption was made that the overall burden of the opioid crisis at a community level could best be measured using multiple data points that captured different aspects of the crisis. While some measures mig ht be higher in one town and lower in another , considering multiple measures across time would make the results more reliable. The graphic below depicts the basic approach of combining years, using reliable data, adjusting the population for very small to wns, and using multiple data sources to make all estimates more accurate. Step 1 (Combine Years): Averaging across years or computing rates for multiple years tends to produce more reliable estimates.82 Because some data elements were available for all ye ars, only data from 2013 and 2014 were used for this analysis . Step 2 (Use Only What's Reliable): Estimating rates for very small communities is difficult, because isolated events can alter rates dramatically. It was necessary to determine the point at which data w ere reliable enough to use.83 This was called the threshold of stability . The threshold was established to be 3,000 residents. 82 Since the opioid crisis in Massachusetts accelerated in 2012, no data prior to 2012 was used in the analysis. 83 To establish our \"threshold of stability ,\" we looked at the standard deviations of community level rates for each of the 4 measures using different population cut points for the communities. Community population size was determined using the 2010 US Census. Multiple population cut points were tested to determine the appropriate threshold : all communities, 1,000 2,000, 3,000 and 20,000 residents. For all four measures, the standard deviation of the rates stabilized once when communities with 3,000 residents or more were considered. Current Status : Other than counts of opioid -related deaths (which are unstable for smaller communities ), little is known about the burden of the opioid crisis in all 351 Massachusetts communities. 58 Step 3 (Make Small Towns Seem Bigger): After determining the threshold of stability , data for the 75 smallest towns i n Massachusetts were adjusted so that changes in rates would be similar to a town of 3,000 people.84 Step 4 (Find Data with Similar Patterns ): The level of community burden was estimated using information about fatal opioid overdoses for residents of a community, nonfatal opioid overdoses for residents of a community, Naloxone kits distributed to communities, and the number of infants born with n eonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) to mothers who lived in these communities. These four data points were chosen because they were expected to show similar changes over time and across communities. If a community was high or low on one measure, it would be similarly high or low on others.85 Key Findings: A measure of the overall burden of the opioid crisis on the community level was developed using four data points (described above) that captured different aspects of the crisis. The map below shows the burde n for all 351 Massachusetts communities divided by quintiles (i.e., five equally -sized groups ordered from lowest to highest burden) - the darker the shade, the higher the burden of opioid use in that community. 84 A Poisson probability of the number of actual events occurring in each community was computed for each of the 4 measures. That probability was compared to the probabilities computed for rates for a hypothetical town of 3,000 people. The rate for the hypothetical town replaced the rate for the smaller community to mak e it more reliable over years. 85 The actual rates for larger towns and estimated rates for smaller towns were analyzed using a principal components analysis. A one component solution was clearly indicated as it accounted for nearly three -quarters of all differences. Therefo re, adding together standardized values for the four measures was a reliable way to estimate the opioid burden on a community level. 59 Recommendations for Further Analysis: A comprehensive geospatial analysis of opioid burden should be conducted at the micro -geographic -level (e.g., census tract, block group, block) to identify neighborhood level burden. Hotspot cluster analysis should be conducted at the census tract or block group level to identify statistically significant clusters of opioid burden on the neighborhood level across Massachusetts. A thorough geospatial analysis should look at the relationship between local opioid burden and available services such as p harmacies , SEPs, OEND, MAT, detox programs, hospitals, etc. A composite variable for available services should be developed and mapped geospatially. Several variables should be considered for this composite variable: o Numerator: naloxone distribution, number of peo (MAT: methadone maintenance, buprenorphine, suboxone), number of people in programs; o Denominator: number of people with opioid use disorder (OUD) Development of novel variables and analyses to assess access to services should be considered: o MAT services received per 1,000 fatal overdoses; MAT services per 1,000 people with OUD; 60 o Naloxone kits distributed per 1,000 people with OUD o Ratio: number of providers to number of people with OUD Statistica l models should be considered to identify community -level factors associated with opioid burden and access to services. Trends in opioid burden should be examined in order to make estimates of future risk on a community by community basis. Appendix A: Dataset Descriptions The diagram below shows the 22 datasets linked to produc e this report . Sixteen of the data sets were linked at the individual level while six data sets provided additional community level data either at the town or zip code l evel. The MassHealth data also included service flags for individuals receiving services from the Department of Children & Families, the Department of Youth Services, the Department of Developmental Services, the Department of Transitional Assistance, and the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind.86 The remainder of Appendix A provides a description of each of the 22 datasets used for this report. Each description outlines the information collected, the frequency, the limitations, the lag time between data collection and data availability, the relevance to opioids, and the authorization for collecting the data. 86 With the exception of data from the Department of Transitional Assistance, the data in the service flag fields was poorly populated and therefore was not used in this report. 62 Regi stry of Vital Records and Statistics (RVRS)87 - Death Records88 What data are collected: Opioid -related deaths are the primary focus of this work and the most basic source of this information comes from death certificates filed with the Registry of Vital Re cords and Statistics (RVRS). The official cause of death and the manner of death (i.e., intentional, unintentional, or undetermined) are assigned by physicians and medical examiners. Each death certificate also includes demographic information such as age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, gender, educational attainment, marital status, and occupation. These basic demographics are recorded by the funeral director and are typically provided by a family member. Availability of data: Mortality information is reported electronically using the Vitals Information Partnership89 (VIP). The VIP system is web -based and receives information 24 hours a day seven days a week. For analytic purposes, data can be exported from VIP with all the data elements listed above. Opioid -related deaths and other complex cases are almost always referred to the Office for the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) for determination of cause and manner of death. This results in a reporting lag for these deaths. That said, basic data on demograp hics is available on a near -real time basis. Limitations of the data: As legal records, the information recorded on death certificates is considered highly accurate. However, some information like race, Hispanic ethnicity, educational attainment, marital s tatus, and occupation are not always fully populated. Causes of death from the OCME often lag the date of death making some elements of death data less timely than others. Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS)90 - Substance Abuse Treatment Data91 What d ata are collected: Massachusetts Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS), of the Department of Public Health, is the single state authority responsible for regulating and licensing substance abuse treatment providers. The services provided range from acu te detoxification to residential and outpatient based services. All treatment providers who receive funding from BSAS are required to submit data to BSAS to carry out the responsibilities listed under the law. The required data fields include but are not l imited to client characteristics, enrollment information, disenrollment information, services and outcomes. Currently, only treatment providers that receive funding from the Department submit this data to BSAS. Availability of data: Processing of linked c lients also allows us to construct treatment episodes and entire client histories. There is a one to two month lag between the time the data are reported and the time it is available for analysis/reporting from BSAS. 87 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/admin/dmoa/vitals/ on 5/19/2017. 88 The coll ection of death certificate data is authorized by MGL Chapter 46. 89 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/admin/dmoa/vitals/vitals -information - partnership -vip.html on 5/19/2017. 90 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/g ov/departments/dph/programs/substance -abuse/ on 5/19/2017. 91 The collection of detailed substance abuse treatment by BSAS is authorized under MGL Ch.111 B and E. All treatment providers are required to submit data to BSAS to carry out the responsibilities listed under the law. The regulations promulgated to carry out these responsibilities require the providers to submit data in a timely manner. The required data fields include but are not limited to: client characteristics, enrollment, disenrollment inform ation, services and outcomes. Currently, only treatment providers that receive funding from the Department submit the required data to BSAS. 63 Limitations of the data: The BSAS data set poses several limitations. First, BSAS data does not represent all substance abuse treatment provided in the commonwealth. BSAS only collects data from its contracted providers. Of the data that is submitted to BSAS, outpatient treatment data is incomp lete and does not include all non -BSAS paid services . BSAS does not collect data from providers that prescribe Vivitrol or from non -contracted Buprenorphine providers. At the time of this analysis, Methadone data was incomplete. Due to challenges associate d with recent system changes related to data submission, some Methadone providers have been unable to submit data. Data collected in regards to section 35 commitments are incomplete in the BSAS data set. For example, in 2015 there were 2,068 Section 35 com mitments served in settings outside the scope of data submitted to BSAS (e.g. MASAC and MCI Framingham). As a result of these data limitations, it is possible that some of the analyses using BSAS treatment data may provide an incomplete picture. Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)92 - Schedule II through V medications93 What data are collected: Information about filled prescriptions for schedule II through V medications is reported electronically each business day to the Prescription Drug Mo nitoring Program (PDMP) in the Department of Public Health's Office of Prescription Monitoring and Drug Control (OPMDC) by all Massachusetts community, hospital outpatient and clinic pharmacies as well as from out -of-state mail order pharmacies that delive r to patients in Massachusetts. Schedules II through V medications consist of those prescription drug products with recognized potential for abuse or dependence (e.g., narcotics, stimulants, sedatives). Consequently, they are among those most sought for il licit and non - medical use. The specific medication as well as the dosage and the number of pills or amount are also captured. In order to facilitate the monitoring of individuals who receive scheduled medications, basic identifying information like full na me, gender, date of birth, and full address are also recorded as well as information about the prescriber and dispensing pharmacy. Availability of data: PDMP reporting is comprehensive for pharmacies within the Commonwealth with very few instances of non -compliance among pharmacies. PDMP data arrives daily and is considered complete and accurate for export and analysis within approximately two weeks. Limitations of the data: The PDMP dataset has a few noteworthy limitations. First, methadone clinics do not report to the Massachusetts PDMP as they are exempt by statutory language. Specifically, the PDMP only collects data on prescriptions dispensed, and methadone in clinics is administered pursuant to medical order, not prescription. Methadone is only included when prescribed for pain. Second, controlled substance prescriptions dispensed by Veterans Administration (VA) facilities are not included. This represents a high risk population and a significant data gap. Third, prescription drugs that are obtained illegally (e.g., stolen, purchased on the street, etc.) are a potentially significant contributor to the opioid overdose epidemic and are not captured within an individual's PDMP history, but may be captured by the OCME toxicology scr eens. Finally, a filled prescription should not be interpreted to mean that an individual took all or even any of that medication. Linking 92 Accessed at http:/ /www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/hcq/drug -control/PDMP/ on 5/19/2017. 93 The Department of Public Health's Office of Prescription Monitoring and Drug Control (OPMDC) established the Massachusetts Prescription Monitoring Program (MA PDMP) in 1992 pursuant to joint regulations (105 CMR 700.012) with the Board of Registration in Pharmacy (247 CMR 5.04). 64 these records with toxicology data can provide some insight into the proportion of scheduled medications that are ill egally diverted for other purposes than originally intended. Massachusetts Ambulance Trip Record Information System (MATRIS)94 - Office of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS)95 What data are collected: The Department of Public Health's Office of Emergency Med icine (OEMS) established the Massachusetts Ambulance Trip Record Information System (MATRIS) in December 2010 as a statewide system collecting emergency medical service (EMS) incident data from licensed ambulance services. Under EMS System regulations, amb ulance services are required to document each EMS call and include the data elements pertaining to the call specifically referenced in an administrative requirement issued by OEMS governing the statewide EMS minimum data set. MATRIS data elements are based on the National Emergency Medical Service Information System (NEMSIS) Version 2.2.1 dataset standard developed in 2005. This includes demographic, clinical, operational, and billing data. Demographics required are patient age, birth date, gender, and pati ent home address. Also required are incident type, incident address, dates, times, destination facility type, destination facility name, and destination facility address. Patient name is not currently required but is submitted approximately 70% of the time . MATRIS can identify nonfatal -opioid - related events, even when the patient refuses transport to the hospital. MATRIS tracks when naloxone was administered either by the EMT or as \"prior aid\" by other first responders, (fire, police) or bystanders (friends , family). Evaluation on interventions provided by EMTs can be performed to correlate survival and other outcome rates when linked with outcomes from ED and death data. Availability of data: Ambulance incident information is submitted into the MATRIS secure website electronically from all licensed ambulance services in Massachusetts within 14 days of the call; however frequency of submission varies by service. Many of the larger ambulance ser vices have automated daily submission, while others can take longer to submit. There are currently over 6.4 million ambulance trip records in MATRIS. There were 1.3 million records in MATRIS for incidents occurring in both 2013 and 2014. There are 1.4 mill ion for 2015 available for future analysis. Limitations of the data: MATRIS has several limitations. The first is that the NEMSIS standard does not specifically identify incidents as being opioid -related, but rather \"poisoning/ingestion .\" The second, the d ata are not uniformly reported by EMS providers. The third limitation is that the overall usability of the data submitted by ambulance services varies by provider, with roughly 30% of the provided data being partially or completely unusable. These issues a re partially mitigated through the integration with other datasets listed above. Finally, whether a specific ambulance trip involves an opioid overdose is not a simple judgment. The classification of opioid trips was based on an algorithm developed in conj unction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Their assistance was invaluable. 94 For more information see: www.mass.gov/dph/oems/matris 95 The collection of detailed ambulance trip data by OEMS is authorized under 105 CMR 170.345(B). 65 Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (RVRS)96 - Birth Records97 What data are collected: The collection and dissemination of this data are to facilitate the surveillance of births and birth trends in the state of Massachusetts, including those based on demographic information and data on birth outcomes. Data are reported to the Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (RVRS) by all licensed birthing hospitals and birthing centers and by city and town clerks if they are establishing a home birth that occurred in their city/town in Massachusetts. The birth data contains identifying information about the parents of record and the child. These data are critical to understand the health risk to a mother who delivers a Substance Exposed Newborn (SEN) or an infant with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). Availability of data: Natality information is reported electronically using the Vitals Information Partnership (VIP ).98 The VIP system is web -based and receives information 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Substantial quality control efforts are required to assess the accuracy and completeness of birth records. As a result, the final dataset of birth records is usuall y available by May of the following year. Limitations of the data: As legal records, the information recorded on birth certificates is considered highly accurate. However, some information like race and Hispanic ethnicity are not always fully populated. Massachusetts Cancer Registry (MCR)99 - Cancer Staging100 What data are collected: The Massachusetts Cancer Registry (MCR), a database managed by the Department of Public Health, is a population -based registry that tracks the incidence of cancer within the Co mmonwealth. Since 1982, the MCR has captured key data elements such as date of diagnosis and cancer stage at diagnosis, in addition to various demographic data elements. For this purposes of this work, MCR data was included because palliative treatment for late stage cancers often includes the use of opioid medications to control pain. Being able to distinguish those cases of high opioid use for cancer treatment from cases where an individual may be abusing prescription medications was critical to this study. Availability of data: Reporting facilities are required to report case level d ata to the MCR within 180 days of diagnosis or first date of patient interaction. Analysis of supporting documentation related to determining the stage of a cancer also takes considerable time. Typically, MCR data availability lags the calendar by approxim ately two years. Limitations of the data: Defining the stage of a cancer is not an exact science. It is based on a number of written reports and laboratory tests. Furthermore, not all cancers cause significant pain even in late stages. These data can provi de an indication that medications may have been prescribed for pain but they cannot definitively rule out the possibility that there was underlying abuse. 96 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/a dmin/dmoa/vitals/ on 5/19/2017. 97 The collection of Confidential Birth Information is authorized under 105 CMR 350.000. 98 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/admin/dmoa/vitals/vitals -information - partnership 5/19/2017. 99 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/admin/dmoa/cancer -registry/ on 5/19/2017. 100 The collection of detailed cancer incidence and staging by the MCR is authorized under Chapter 111, Section 111B. 66 Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME)101 - Circumstances of Death and Toxicology Reports102 What d ata are collected: The OCME, a part of the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, gathers a great deal of information about unattended and other deaths where the underlying causes may not be apparent. Not of all of the information collected is rel evant to opioid -related overdose deaths, so the work reported here has focused on the circumstances of death recorded on the OCME intake forms and the toxicology reports used to determine the cause of death. The data field labeled \"circumstances of death\" is a brief narrative that describes the setting and environment of an unattended death. It is often written by the State Police in the case of acute opioid -related overdoses. These narratives are analyzed by searching for the presence of key words. The tox icology reports describe the presence of hundreds of specific chemical compounds that might be found in the body of the decedent. This study has focused primarily on the presence of natural and synthetic opioids. Availability of data: The intake forms that contain the circumstances of death narratives are usually available within about 72 hours of a case being accepted by the OCME. Toxicology screening and confirmatory tests are conducted by the Crime Laboratory run by the Massachusetts State Police as well as the NMS Labs (Willow Grove, PA). Toxicology tests lag the date of death by about 60 days. Limitations of the data: Written narratives will provide initial impressions of the circumstances of death. As first impression, these can be misleading in some c ases. Final causes of death must be provided by physicians and medical examiners. Toxicology results can be extremely complex to interpret. Levels of drugs found a decedent's tissue are affected by the timing of the test, the type of tissue, and other factors. Many drugs also metabolize into a variety of different chemical compounds. For all these reasons, toxicology results are generally examined in broad categories to simplify interpretation. OCME data are connected directly to the death records using name, date of birth and date of death. A unique OCME ID number is used to link to toxicology reports . Finally, the vast majority of the toxicology records for early 2013 were only available on paper and thus not practical to include in this report. Case Mix Database103 - Inpatient hospitalization, emergency department visits, and outpatient observations managed by the Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA)104 What data are collected: The Case Mix data contains all inpatient hospitalizations, emerge ncy department visits, and outpatient observation in the state. Massachusetts acute care hospitals are required to submit Case Mix data to the Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) in order to track disease burden and associated costs statewide . Detailed information is available for each encounter, including geography (e.g., zip code, town, county, state, country), demographics (e.g., age, race, ethnicity), and costs by service (e.g., medical/ surgical, behavioral health), admission and discharg e dates, diagnosis, and the facility providing patient care. Case Mix data can identify individuals who received past treatment for a substance overdose including healthcare encounters 101 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eopss/agencies/ocme/ on 5/19/2017. 102 The collection of death certificate data is authorized by MGL Chapter 38. 103 Accessed at http://www.chiamass.gov/case -mix-data/ on 5/19/2017. 104 Massachusetts acute care hospitals are required to submit Case Mix data in accordance with Regulation 114.1 CMR 17.00. 67 associated with detoxification, psychiatric care, and overdose based on procedures rendered or diagnoses made when these services are offered by acute -care hospitals. Availability of data: The Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) receives data quarterly. Significant work is required to clean and harmonize the da ta across hospitals. As a result, there is approximately a one year lag between final data submission to CHIA by acute care hospitals and receipt of the data by DPH and other approved organizations. Limitations of the data: The Case Mix data does not include hospital services rendered to Massachusetts residents by non -Massachusetts hospitals or hospitals operated by the Veterans Administration (VA), thus reducing the observable analytic universe. Similarly, CHIA does not currently collect information f rom behavioral health hospitals. Demographic data included in Case Mix is not considered as accurate as those recoded on birth of death records. Consequently, the linkage of these records to other datasets may be incomplete. Furthermore, the coding of enco unters for overdose or for behavioral health services is not considered fully complete. Finally and possibly most important for the Chapter 55 project is that Case Mix data are available on a Federal fiscal year. The most recent data available is through 9 /30/2014 which means that any data on nonfatal overdoses, substance abuse treatment, or mental health diagnosis codes w ill not be captured in the final three months of the study period. The low linkage rate for infant records produced a smaller number of N AS-related records for mothers. Non -Scheduled Pharmacy Claims105 - Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database (APCD)106 What data are collected: The Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database (APCD) is managed by the Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA). The APCD contains health and pharmacy insurance claims data from the approximately 80 private health care payers, public health care payers (including Medicare and MassHealth) and publicly -supported managed care organizations and senior care organizations across the entire state of Massachusetts. The APCD insurance eligibility files include basic identifying information like full name, address, gender, date of birth, race, ethnicity, and Social Security number. Most APCD data requested from CH IA focused on pharmacy claims for non-scheduled medications. Availability of data: The APCD is overseen by CHIA, the independent state agency responsible for collecting, cleaning, maintaining, and managing access to the data. Data are reported out once a y ear and each report contains all data from the previous calendar year. The newest version is available approximately six months after the close of the preceding calendar year. Limitations of the data: The APCD forms the backbone or spine of the linked data sets. Its completeness and accuracy are critical to the entire effort. In recent years, CHIA has expended significant resources to link records across payers. The current APCD contains roughly 15 million unique records which is substantially above the 6.3 million residents in Massachusetts. Most of these records are single records unconnected to a full set of identifiable records. Other analyses 105 Accessed at http://www.chiamass.gov/ma -apcd/ on 5/19/2017. 106 CHIA has statutory authority to collect data from both public and private health care payers under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 12C, section 10. By July 2010, Regulations 114.5 CMR 21.00 and 114.5 CMR 22.00 formally established the APCD in Massachu setts. 68 undertaken for this project suggest that the unique records prepared for the APCD serve the purpose intended. Other known limitations of the APCD include exclusions such as Workers' Compensation, TRICARE/Veteran's Health Administration, and the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan claims. Additionally, uninsured individuals (approximately 3% of the state's populatio n) are not captured. Finally, healthcare services provided but paid for out of the patient's own finances, e.g., cash payment for a convenience care clinic service like a strep throat culture, are excluded because these services do not generate claims. Department of Correction (DOC)107 - Incarceration and Treatment108 What data are collected: The Department of Correction (DOC), a part of the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, is required by statute to maintain adequate records of persons committed to the custody of the Department. In addition, DOC must establish and maintain progra ms of research, statistics, and planning, and conduct studies relating to correctional programs and responsibilities of the Department. To achieve those goals, DOC maintains a database of individuals incarcerated in Massachusetts prisons. This database inc ludes the substance abuse treatment received by prisoners. Identifiers like full name, gender, date of birth and Social Security numbers are also included. Availability of data: As releases from prison are routine, these data are kept current. Releases fro m January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2015 were included. Limitations of the data: DOC data includes incarcerations for those in prison and does not include data for people in jails or houses of correction (HOC). That data is separate and does not include all the same information as the DOC data. Analyzing only the DOC data could yield misleading results since HOC serves a higher volume of inmates per year in comparison to DOC, primarily due to shorter sentences and those waiting trial within H OC. An additional limitation arises if residents of Massachusetts are incarcerated outside of Massachusetts as that data is not captured by DOC. Department of Mental Health (DMH)109 What data are collected: The Department of Mental Health, as the State Mental Health Authori ty, assures and provides access to services and supports to meet the mental health needs of individuals of all ages, enabling them to live, work and participate in their communities. The Department of Mental Health (DMH), under the umbrella of the Executiv e Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), is required by statute to maintain adequate records of persons receiving services of the department. This database includes psychiatric hospitalizations, substance abuse treatment and the desire for change and stage of change, loss of housing, incarceration, use of crisis stabilization beds and employment status between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2015 . Identifiers included gender, race, and age. Availability of data: Different programs and services provid ed by DMH are kept current and are available for the period from 1/1/2011 through 12/31/2015. 107 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eopss/agencies/doc/ on 5/19/2017. 108 The collection of detailed incarceration data by DoC authorized under MGL c. 124, s. 1(j) and MGL c. 124, s. 1(k). 109 Access ed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dmh/ on 5/19/2017. 69 Limitations of the data: The Chapter 55 DMH data only includes data for services provided by DMH such as Community Based Flexible Supports (CBFS) and Clubhouse C oalition programs. It does not include routine or crisis mental health services provided in hospitals, emergency departments, and the private offices of licensed mental health providers. Some of these data can be found in the APCD and Case Mix data sets. Department Housing and Community Development (DHCD)110 - Family Homelessness What data are collected: DHCD's mission is to strengthen cities, towns and neighborhoods to enhance the quality of life of Massachusetts residents. This agency provides leadership, professional assistance and financial resources to promote safe, decent affordable housing opportunities, economic vitality of communities and sound municipal management. DHCD collects and maintain s data on all persons receiving services from the Departmen t. For this report, DHCD created a subset of the records of families (heads of household) who received services from the Emergency Assistance Program between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2015. Identifiers included gender, race, age, veteran status and disability. Availability of data: Different programs and services provided by DMH are kept current and are available for the period from 1/1/2011 through 12/31/2015. Limitations of the data: While DHCD offers supportive services for individuals who are h omeless, the Chapter 55 data only includes services provided to families. The linkage to the APCD is made through the listed Head of Household in the DHCD data set. This may represent an underestimate of housing instability even for individuals within fami lies because only the head of household is linked to the APCD. Department of Veterans' Services (DVS)111 - Benefits Programs What data are collected: The mission of the Department of Veterans' Services (DVS) is to be the chief advocate for the nearly half -million veterans of the Commonwealth and their families. DVS establishes policy, proposes legislation, ensures that adequate funding for veterans' pro grams is included in the Governor's budget, and represents the interests of veterans in matters coming before the General Court. In addition, DVS represents all state agencies and individual veterans before the federal Department of Veterans Affairs in sec uring federal compensation and other benefits that might be available. DVS collects information of all Massachusetts veterans receiving benefits through DVS. Among other data, DVS collects data on persons who received DVS medical, housing or other benefits from DVS through communities. Identifiers included name, date of birth, social security number, race, gender and address. Availability of data: For Chapter 55, DVS provided DPH with payment information for medical, housing or other benefits made between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2015. 110 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/hed/economic/eohed/dhcd/ on 5/1 9/2017. 111 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/veterans/about -veterans -services/ on 5/19/2017. 70 Limitations of the data: These data include only benefits directed to Massachusetts veterans by DVS. Any federal, private, other donations are not captured in the DVS data set. Therefore, these data will be an underestimate of all services provided to Massachusetts veterans. MassHealth112 - Opioid Related Services for the Massachusetts Medicaid population What data are collected: In Massachusetts, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are co mbined into one program called MassHealth. MassHealth maintains and updates reports quarterly on member enrollment, application activity and services provided. Identifiers included name, date of birth, social security number, gender, race and city of resid ence. Variables included disability status, type of MassHealth Plan and coverage type, dually eligible status (Medicare and Medicaid), and number of enrollment days per month. Variables also included if client received services from Department of Developme ntal Services, Department of Mental Health, Department of Children & Families, Department of Transitional Assistance, Department of Youth Services, and Massachusetts Commission for the Blind. Using CCS, ICD -9 and 10 codes other variables included inpatient psychiatric hospital, semi -acute hospital, specialty hospital for substance use disorder, Serious Mental Illness diagnosis, Mental Illness diagnosis, Substance Use Disorder diagnosis. Payment variables included MassHealth payments, patient payment amounts , third party payment amounts, pass through claim payments and claims passing through MassHealth for federal match. Unstable housing was an additional variable (defined as three or more street addresses in a calendar year). Availability of data: MassHealt h medical claims are included in the APCD dataset. The additional data provided by MassHealth for Chapter 55 includes information on type of coverage, disability status, payment amounts, specific types of opioid related services and whether an individual w as served by any of the following agencies: Department of Developmental Services, Department of Mental Health, Department of Children & Families, Department of Transitional Assistance, Department of Youth Services, and the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind. Limitations of the data: As with any medical claim, the information contained in the MassHealth records cannot be tied directly to a specific clinical judgment about an individual or about that person's behavior. For example, diagnosis codes may be included for the purposes of billing and may not provide a full picture of a patient's health. Similarly, the fact that a payment was made for a medication cannot guarantee that an individual used the medications as prescribed. Opioid -services tracked and paid for by MassHealth will not include any services privately paid for or provided free of charge; therefore, these services could be underrepresented if only MassHealth records are included. Finally, the information provided by MassHealth only includes person covered by MassHealth for the period they were covered. If a person had interruptions in their MassHealth, equivalent services may have been provided by other insurers or entities for which we do not have comparable data. Massachusetts Sheriff's As sociation113 - Incarceration in Houses of Correction What data are collected: It is the mission of the Massachusetts Sheriffs' Association to promote, 112 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/masshealth/ on 5/19/2017. 113 Accessed at http://www.mass.gov/msa/ on 5/19/2017. 71 advocate and support the office of sheriff in all fourteen counties of the Commonwealth, to secure their co operative working relationship with one another, to enhance their work as the chief law enforcement officers of the counties, and to advance efforts to unify their efforts in policy development, operations and training while preserving the autonomy of each office. The Houses of Correction operate on a county level. They are required to track releases to the public through the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security. Individual releases are the basis for the data included in Chapter 55. The informatio n includes basic identifiers as well as specific release dates. Availability of data: The Chapter 55 data set include releases of sentenced offenders between July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2015 as reported by the county sheriffs' departments. These data are reported to the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety (EOPSS) quarterly. Limitations of the data: Incarceration dates are not reported for all county releases, so the full period of incarceration is not available for the data set. Hampshire and Berkshire counties did not submit data for FY2012 quarter 2, and Worcester county did not provide offender date of birth for CY2012 through CY2013 Q4, so their information is excluded for this analysis. These data should be combined with data from the Department of Correction to provide a fuller perspective of incarcerations for Massachusetts residents. However, residents of Massachusetts incarcerated outside of Massachusetts are not captured. Community Level Data Census : What data are collected: name of city/town, EOHHS Region, EMS Region, total population, age group (18 age groupings), median age, gender, race, spoken language, unemployed individuals, food assistance received, income below poverty level, median household income, own or rent, and education level. Availability of data: Data from the American Community Survey, five year -Estimates: 2006 -2010 Limitations of the data: Since the data from a community or a zip code are applied to all residents of that community or zip code, the data can help in understanding the context in which an individual lives but not whether that data applies to any specific individual in the data set. Naloxone : What data are collected: Data from the MDPH Naloxone program from 2011 -2015 including enrollments by mon th and town, refills by month and town and rescues by month and town. Availability of data: 2011 -2015 by city/town Limitations of the data: Since the data from a community or a zip code are applied to all residents of that community or zip code, the data can help in understanding the context in which an individual lives but not whether that data applies to any specific individual in the data set. Needle Exchange : What data are collected: The Bureau of Substance Abuse Services has gathered data on needle exchange programs by town. Availability of data: 2011 -2015 by city/town 72 Limitations of the data: Since the data from a community or a zip code are applied to all residents of that communit y or zip code, the data can help in understanding the context in which an individual lives but not whether that data applies to any specific individual in the data set. MDPHnet Depression Scores by Town : What data are collected: MDPHnet is a distributed n etwork of EHR -based data depositories. MDPHnet utilizes custom algorithms to detect cases that integrate diagnosis codes, laboratory tests, prescriptions, and other clinical indicators to accurately identify key conditions. In this case, MDPHnet was used t o produce town level estimates of depression. Availability of data: 2011 -2015 by city/town Limitations of the data: Since the data from a community or a zip code are applied to all residents of that community or zip code, the data can help in understanding the context in which an individual lives but not whether that data applies to any specific individual in the data set. Drug Seizure Data : What data are collected: Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety & Security record s the number of incidents where drugs were seized between 2011 -2015 by month. Each seizure is recorded by town. Variables included the type and amount of each drug seized. Availability of data: 2011 to 2015. Limitations of the data: These data report the number of incidents where drugs were seized, many may have resulted in arrests but not all of them. ICE (Index of Concentration at the Extremes) : What data are collected: There are three ICE measures by census tract - one for income, another for race/ethnicity and the third which combines race/ethnicity. ICEinc sets as the extremes the American Community Survey household income categories that most closely approximate cutpoints for the US 20th and 80th household income percentile, currently <$25k and >=$100k. ICErace sets as the extreme groups persons who self -identify as non -Hispanic White vs. non - Hispanic Black, over the total population for whom race/ethnicity data are available. ICEwbinc combines race/ethnicity and income and sets as the extrem e groups non -Hispanic White persons whose household income is great than or equal to the 80th income percentile vs. non -Hispanic Black persons in households below the 20th income percentile, over the total population for whom data on race x income are avai lable. Availability of data: American Community Survey five year estimates (2011 - 2015). Limitations of the data: Since the data from a community or a zip code are applied to all residents of that community or zip code, the data can help in understanding the context in which an individual lives but not whether that data applies to any specific individual in the data set. 73 74 Appendix B: Data Linkage Data linkage for the Chapter 55 work was conducted by the Center for Health I nformation and Analysis (CHIA) in consultation with the Department of Public Health (DPH). Ten levels of matches were tested between individual Chapter 55 datasets and identifiers found in the All Payer Claims Database (APCD). All matches were deterministi c. A conservative approach to matching was used, so no \"near\" or \"close\" matches were considered. In other words, all successful matches had to be exact at one of ten levels. The complete matching scheme is described below. The most reliable match is a \"1 ,\" and so on down the chart to the least reliable, a \"10 .\" Match Level Identifiers To Be Matched 1 Exact match on first name, last name, Social Security number, gender, birth date, street address #1, street address #2, town of residence, and zip code. 2 Exact match on last name, Social Security number, gender, birth date, town of residence, and zip code. 3 Exact match on Social Security number, gender, and birth date. 4 Exact match on first name, last name, gender, birth date, street address #1, street address #2, town of residence, and zip code. 5 Exact match on first name, last name, gender, birth date, town of residence, and zip code. 6 Exact match on first name, last name, gender, and birth date. 7 Exact match on first name, last name, gend er, and birth date 8 First and third letters of first name, first and third letters of last name, gender, birth date 9 Street address #1, street address #2, town of residence and zip code 10 Exact match on first name, last name, and birth date CHIA processed each Chapter 55 file independent of all other files. To speed the process of the linkage work, there was no requirement for CHIA to perform data standardization or to deduplicate the data within or across files. Since data fields, collection methods, oversight, and quality vary from source to source - and even r ecord to record - it is possible that \"John Smith\" got a Level 1 match in File1 but then the same \"John Smith\" appeared twice in File2 , getting a Level 2 and a Level 3 match due to algorithm rules and/or missing data. Alternatively, the various John Smiths may not be related . Without a focused deduplication effort, or a secondary weighted probabilistic match, it is impossible to know how often this might have occurred. Other tests o f reliability of the matching scheme indicated that this was not a frequent occurrence. If duplicates were found within a file, each of these records was assigned the same project -specific ID. A summary of the matches across all datasets can be found in table below. 75 1. All Payer Claims Database 100.0% 2. Births Records linking Mothers (Vitals) 91.7% 3. Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (Treatment) 88.6% 4. Cancer Registry 88.3 % 5. Case Mix (Hospital, ED, and Outpatient Records) ~70.0%114 6. Deaths Records (Vitals) 96.7 % 7. Department of Housing & Community Development 82.6% 8. Department of Mental Health 97.8 % 9. Department of Correction 89.7% 10. Department of Veterans Services 78.4% 11. Houses of Correction (MA Sheriffs' Association) 81.8% 12. MassHealth 99.8% 13. Massachusetts Ambulance Trip Information System (MATRIS) 71.1% 14. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner 96.7% 15. Prescription Drug Monitoring Program 92.3% After reviewing the detailed matching data for each table, it was determined that match level 9 was too vague to be useful. It was dropped from consideration for record level matches. That issue aside, the matching procedure described above produced matches across all the tables in that data set that ranged from 7 1.1% on the low end for MATRIS to above 95% on the high end for the APCD (100%), Death records from the Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (96. 7%), Department of Mental Health (9 7.8%), and MassHealth (99. 8%).115 114 Case Mix records are stored without the usual compl ement of identifiers making estimates of linkage rates difficult to compute. Comparisons of non -fatal events in raw Case Mix were ma de with those same events in the linked data set. Approximately 30% more nonfatal opioid events were found in the raw records, thus the estimate of a 70% linkage rat e. 115 Data from Partners Healthcare for a project proposed by Harvard School of Public Health and Partners was also linked to the APCD data. Since this data was not available to other researchers, it is not included in the table above. Appendix C: Data Privacy and System Architecture A determination was made at the outset of the Chapter 55 project to be able to examine all datasets in relation to each other. This required the development of a linkage or crosswalk so that individuals in one set could be located in the others, yet without revealing the identity of the matched person. The privacy concerns about holding, managing, and processing direct identifiers for so many sensitive datasets are considerable, and the processes developed to address these concerns were both thoughtful and innovative. In order to protect the privacy of the individual datasets, four approaches were used: Encryption: All data w ere encrypted in transport and at rest. De-identification: Direct identifiers were removed from each dataset prior to analyst access. The unique identifiers randomly generated for individuals were project -specific , meaning that no record IDs could be used to trace information back to any dataset held by any data owner now or in the future. Securing the Server: The server on which the Chapter 55 datasets were stored was secured so the likelihood of unauthorized access was minimized to the extent possible. Preventing Misuse by Analysts: Additional restrictions were placed on authorized access to the server on which the Chapter 55 datasets were stored in order to minimize the likelihood of intentional or unintentional misuse of the data. Each of these approaches is described briefly below. Encryption Given the sensitivity of the data involved in the Chapter 55 analysis, multiple levels of encryption were used with the in tent to limit data access to only authorized parties. Whenever data was stored at rest, whether on the server or other hard media, it was protected by at least 256 -bit encryption and industry - standard strong passwords. Further, whenever data needed to be t ransported - for example between DPH and CHIA - it was placed in an encrypted file container o n physical media that used hardware -based encryption. This doubly -encrypted drive was then manually transported by a trusted and authorized team member to its des tination and hand -delivered to the proper recipient, or similarly retrieved for a return trip. De-identification Chapter 55 datasets are not truly linked in the most commonly used sense of that word. In most cases, linkage implies a merger of datasets. For Chapter 55, a crosswalk is developed between datasets but the datasets themselves were never actually merged. This is an important distinction. By not merging data, it is argued that risk of re -identification of individuals who have information in two or more datasets is minimized. Furthermore, the unique identifiers contained in each dataset are not found in any other project. Thus, if any breach of data or transmission protocol occurred, then the data could not be linked back to any source data file. The specific steps taken to minimize of the risk to data privacy through de -identification are below. See Figure F.1 for a visual depiction of this process. 77 1) A pool of roughly 54 million random, non -sequential, 20 -digit IDs (Random IDs or RIDs) was created at DPH. This number of values was sufficient to assign to every record of each of the constituent Chapter 55 raw datasets an ID that was unique across the entire project. 2) With RIDs affixed, each dataset was divided into two parts: direct identifiers (Iden tifier set) and analytic data (Analytic set). The only common information across both was the RID. The Identifier sets were hand delivered to CHIA. As noted under the Encryption section, all data was encrypted using 256 -bit AES encryption with strong prote ction consistent with EOHHS and MassIT policy regarding password contents and length. 3) Distinct from DPH's RID -creation effort, CHIA created an extract of the All Payer Claims Database (APCD) that included only the fields to be used for the linkage scheme m atching (Appendix D), plus an additional project -specific ID (PID). This PID was a random unique 20 -digit number. It was in no way related to, nor derivative of, CHIA's Master Person Index (MPID) or any other persistent identifying code. This master extrac t-plus-PID is known as the APCD -Spine. 4) For each Identifier set, CHIA compared each record to the APCD -Spine. (For additional details on the data linkage, please see Appendix D.) Where a match was found, the PID and match level were associated with the RID from the Identifier set. 5) Upon confirmation from CHIA that an Identifier set was successfully matched to the APCD -Spine, DPH then deleted that Identifier set from its server. 6) The result set of matched PID/RID and match level were returned to DPH through the same secure mechanism as the delivery of the Identifier sets. 7) The RIDs within the returned result set were used to appropriately assign PIDs (and match confidence) to match ing records in the Analytic sets. This allows the Analytic sets to be de - identified, but also connectable across datasets. 8) Because DPH had deleted the Identifier set, it was never in possession of the PID, RID and direct identifiers at the same time. 9) After assigning the PIDs to the Analytic sets, DPH securely delivered each Analytic file to the Massachusetts Information Technology Center (MITC) to be securely loaded onto the designated server. 10) In order to prevent merging of data, the project -specific ident ifiers and the analytic files for each Chapter 55 dataset were permanently stored in separate folders. 11) After all Chapter 55 Identifier sets have been matched and the Chapter 55 project no longer needs the APCD -Spine, CHIA will then delete it, destroying a ny connection between direct identifiers and PIDs at CHIA. Figure C.1: Step by step process for transferring data securely from DPH tp CHIA to MITC Securing the Server There were three main goals in securing the SAS server: 1) Deve lop a clear audit process . 2) Ensure proper encryption for the different needs of the users . 3) Make it so that it was possible to handle more than a small number of group types in the system . These three goals were achieved in the following manner: The disk partition on which the Chapter 55 data was stored was encrypted using LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup). Linux is the open -source version of the UNIX operating system and LUKS is the standard hard disk encryption method for Linux servers. To provide further f lexibility in the design of the secure data ecosystem to the needs of the Chapter 55 project, Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.0 was used. Accounts were authenticated by LDAP, which is the MITC standard, and account creation was handled through specific (not automated) requests to the MITC Linux team. A unique mount point for the Chapter 55 project was created so that only group participants could gain access. The interface for Chapter 55 work was through the web server interface with data encrypted at rest including all individual work files. An audit process was implemented to record when and who was doing maintenance on/for SAS. All inbound requests to the server were blocked unless the requestor was on a pre -approved whitelist. The firewall restricte d access to specific ports on the server. Ports were continuously monitored. Preventing Misuse by Analysts: To minimize the risk of misuse of Chapter 55 data by authorized users, the following processes were implemented as what has been collectively terme d a Privacy Shield . Access to Chapter 55 data was only permitted using Enterprise SAS Studio software Only authorized users were given User IDs and passwords to access the Chapter 55 data. Authorized users were required to demonstrate that DPH -required pri vacy and confidentiality trainings were up to date. Only de -identified Analytic sets were accessible by analysts. Analysts had \"read only\" access to Chapter 55 datasets. Writes were not permitted. Analysts were not permitted to see the raw Chapter 55 Analy tic data. This was accomplished by turning off the ability of authorized users to open and view raw Analytic data files. Analysts were not permitted to see small cell sizes. The common SAS procedure for producing counts and cross -tabulations (PROC FREQ) wa s altered so that it masked (by displaying asterisks) any cell count that was between one and 10. All temporary SAS work files were deleted in one of three ways. If shutdown of a process was typical, files were deleted upon shutdown. If shutdown was atypic al (e.g., power outage), the system searched for orphaned work files every 15 minutes and these files were deleted. If any data query was open for more than 72 hours, then the system administrator could manually shut down a process which would delete any a ssociated SAS work files. An audit process of all commands issued to SAS was implemented. Logs were checked to ensure that no analyst made any attempt to export, print, or otherwise view any Chapter 55 data. See Figure C.2 for a visual depiction of the Ch apter 55 Data Warehouse.

Specifically, likely heroin - related overdoses are inconsistently distinguished from morph ine-related deaths because they have similar toxicology. Furthermore, fentanyl -related deaths have been classified as \"prescription opioid - related\" although young evidence has demonstrated that the fentanyl that is causing increased overdoses is illicitly made outside of the pharmaceutical fentanyl distribution system. Study will thoroughly examine historical and active prescribing along with post -mortem toxicology and how timing of prescriptions relates to fatal and non -fatal overdose. What fraction of ove rdoses with opioid A are attributable to opioid A prescriptions versus other sources for opioid A? Project Title : Factors Associated with Overdose Death Among Inpatient Detoxification Patients Project Lead : Alex Walley (BMC) Project Team : Marc LaRochell e (BMC), DPH Resources Approved: 1/30/2017 Project Summary : The population of patients who undergo inpatient detoxification represents a narrow, but specific group of those who have baseline risk for opioid overdose. People who seek inpatient detoxificatio n are trying to reduce their risk of overdose ; however, detox lowers opioid tolerance, thus increases overdose risk in the immediate post -detox time period. Patients who seek inpatient detoxification are both easy to define and recognize in the dataset, as well as, relatively easy to reach in the real world if an intervention comes out of this project. The protective and risk factors will be data elements that are both available in the datasets and have clinical and public health implications. This study will examine the protective and risk factors ass ociated with different modalities of substance use disorder treatment. Project Title : Developing a Predictive Model for Homelessness in Massachusetts and Relating Risk Estimates to Fatal and Non -Fatal Opioid Overdose Project Leads : Tom Byrne (BU) Project Team : Marc Dones (C4SI), Travis 1/30/2017 82 Project Summary : Homelessness has been related to substance abuse, low education levels, incarceration status, co -morbidity with other chronic conditions, financial catastrophe, and other factors. Identifying the homeless or those at risk of homelessness is challenging because we do not have data directly from homeless shelters, nor is there a direct flag f or \"homelessness\" in most databases. The study will use logistic regression models to identify data patterns associated with homelessness. This predictive model of homelessness will be used to assess ongoing risk of fatal and non -fatal opioid overdose for this population. Project Title : Multivariate Analysis of Risk Factors for Death Using Data from the PDMP and Fatal Overdoses Project Lead : Carly : This application proposes to develop a PDMP -specific risk model. All potential factors for risk will be examined and included in a multivariate model if they are supported by the data. The goal is to develop a tool or alert system that could be incorporated into the PDMP to guide prescribers and pharmacists about risks linked specific patients. All algorithms will be self -contained in that they would only utilize P DMP data to compute risk assessments on which alerts would be based. Project Title : Examination of opioid prescriptions across the VA and non -VA systems to reduce fatal and non-fatal opioid overdoses in Massachusetts Project Lead : Guneet K. Jasuja (BU/ Bedford VA Medical Center ) Project Team : Omid Ameli (Bedford VA), David Smelson (UMASS Med), Dan Berlowitz (Bedford VA), Donald R. Miller (BU), Keith McInnes (BU), Adam Rose (RAND), Jim Burgess (BU), Avron Spiro (BU) , DPH Resources Approved: 1/30/2017 Project Summary: Veterans may be at particular risk for opioid overdose given that they have high rates of pain that is often treated with prescription opioids. Further, many Veterans are \"dual users\" who get both VA and non -VA medical care, and this dual use has been shown to increase risk for adverse outcomes in other areas of care. Thus, the objective of these analyses is to examine whether Veterans who receive prescriptions for opioids in both systems (VA and non -VA) are at an increased risk of fatal and n on-fatal opioid overdose as compared to Veterans who receive all their opioids in one system. Further, we will examine whether the pattern and times of transition of opioid prescriptions between VA and non -VA systems would increase this risk of opioid over dose. Project Title : Developing a Dynamic Model for Predicting Opioid Overdoses with the Opportunity to Identify Effective Points of Intervention Project Lead : Harry Sleeper (MITRE) 83 Project Team : Project Team Six - The MITRE Corporation , DPH Resources Approved: 1/30/2017 Project Summary: The team hypothesizes that patterns exist in the timing and type of interactions preceding fatal and non -fatal overdose occurrences. Their objective is to identify patterns in the timing and type of interactions that pr ecede fatal and non -fatal overdose occurrences. Interactions include those that occur with the healthcare and behavioral health systems , the criminal justice system , social services and other interactions that can be analyzed with the available data. The s tudy plans to use most or all Chapter 55 data sets to examine complex interactions related to timing of events and subsequent fatal and non -fatal overdose. A dynamic model will be developed. Survival analyses and logistic regression will be used to define the states of change and the amount of change in the model. Project Title: Non -Fatal Overdoses, Differential Health Services Utilization, and Subsequent Risk Project Kimberley Geissler (UMASS Med) Resources Approved: 1/30/2017 Project Summary: Based on previous research examining substance use disorders, treatment after an initial non -fatal overdose is likely to vary based on insurance type (e.g., Medicaid, private insurance). Differences in treatment patterns may change the likelihood of repea t overdoses. We hypothesize that individuals with Medicaid insurance receive less treatment after an initial non -fatal overdose and are more likely to have a repeat overdose. Therefore, we will examine differences in repeat non -fatal and fatal overdoses am ong individuals with different insurance types after an initial non -fatal overdose. Project Title: A Machine Learning Approach to Identify Patients at Risk of Fatal and Non -Fatal Opiate Overdose Project Leads: Joscha Joscha Legewie (Yale) DPH Resources Approved: 1/30/2017 Project Summary: The objective of the analysis is to develop a predictive model based on PDMP that produces patient -level risk scores for opioid -related deaths and overdose. The key hypothesis is that consumption of prescription opioids captured in PDMP together with soci o-demographic data is predictive of opioid -related deaths. This hypothesis is a pre -requirement for developing a risk score based on PDMP. We will use logistic regression and random forests as our initial models and experiment with other machine learning m ethods such as support vector machines, adaptive boosting and decision trees. Machine learning methods automate analytical model building and iteratively \"learn\" from data, which allows computers to find hidden patterns such as complex non -linearities or i nteractions. These non-linearities and interactions are particularly relevant for the case at hand considering the different pathways and likelihoods of transitioning into illicit drug use. This work may embed other machine learning models within the large r model (e.g., homelessness). The methods proposed in this study promise to significantly improve the prediction of fatal and non -fatal opioid overdose. Cross -validation 84 will be used to limit problems like overfitting and assess how the results of our mode l generalize to an independent data set. Project Title: Risk of Opioid Poisoning Associated with Medical Opioid Prescribing opioid prescribing is thought to play a key role in this trend and there has been concern that providers have had inadequate information about the risks of medical opioid. There are a number of studies in different settings looking at patient -level risk factors for an opioid poisoning (overdose). However, the absolute risk of an overdose for an individual receiving a new opioid prescription is not well characterized. Empirical evidence about the risk of poisoning is crucial for providers to better evaluate the risk -benefit profile of opioid treatment in patients with potential medical indications for opioid treatment. The objective of this analysis is to characterize the risk of opioid overdose for individuals receiving a new opioid prescription. Project Title: Risk of Overdose and Death after a Nonfatal Opioid There are a number of studies in different settings looking at patient -level risk factors for an opioid poisoning (overdose). However, more information is needed about the risk of death after a healthcare encounter for opioid overdose and the factors that mediate this risk. The objective of this analysis is to characterize the risk of subsequent death after a healthcare encounter (EMS, ED visit or hospitalization) for opioid poisoning and to understand individual demographic characteristics and co - morbidit ies as well as indications for opioids that mediate the risk of death after a nonfatal overdose. Project Title: Receipt of Pharmacotherapy among Adolescents and Young Adults with Opioid Use Disorder and its Impact on Fatal and Non -Fatal Overdose Project Lead: Scott Hadland 1/30/2017 Project Summary : Despite preexisting clinical practice guidelines and a new policy statement from the American Acade my of Pediatrics recommending pharmacotherapy for youth with OUD, no prior studies have examined the extent to which youth in Massachusetts receive medications (buprenorphine, naltrexone, or methadone) and how these medications reduce the likelihood of fat al and non -fatal overdose. The BMC team will address this knowledge gap by obtaining valid, precise, and up -to-date estimates of the percentage of youth receiving pharmacotherapy and relate this information to fatal and non-fatal events. They will also exa mine retention in care and rate of drug use relapse among youth 85 receiving pharmacotherapy. They will identify time trends and potential disparities in receipt of pharmacotherapy among youth with OUD in Massachusetts using the All Payers Claim Data (APCD), and measure retention in care and rates of drug use relapse among youth receiving pharmacotherapy. Project Title: Mortality of Patients who Received Pre -hospital Administration of Naloxone Project 1/30/2017 Project Summary: There has been significant emphasis on availability of naloxone for the lay public and prehospital administration as a means to prevent overdose death. Naloxone is now available as a standing order prescription from most commercial pharmacies, and by a sp ecial waiver, it can be administered by Basic Life Support medics. It is theorized that naloxone is saving a significant number of lives in the Commonwealth, but paradoxically, the opioid -related death rate continues to climb despite increased availability of naloxone. The purpose of this study is to determine the medium - and long -term mortality of patients who receive naloxone prehospital. The applicant hypothesizes that naloxone administration is a temporary life -saving measure for many patients, that >50 % of patients who eventually died from an overdose had a previous episode of reversal with naloxone. Project Title: GIS, Spatial Epidemiological, and Geostatistical Analysis of Opioid Overdose in MA Project Lead: Tom Stopka (Tufts) Project Team: Kenneth Chui (Tufts), Anna Kaplan (Tufts), Rachel Hoh (Tufts), and DPH Resources Approved: 1/30/2017 Project Summary: The study will characterize the geospatial distribution and clustering of non -fatal and fatal opioid overdose and its associated outcomes in MA. W e will employ descriptive GIS mapping and hotspot cluster analyses that look to control for time, geography, and demographics as we work to portray the unfolding of the opioid epidemic in terms of deaths, non -fatal overdoses, and repeat overdoses in Massac husetts between 2011 and 2015. We will determine whether changes in the epidemic are related to relevant community -level factors to better understand the current state of the opioid epidemic and to project future patterns. Project Title: Examining Interv ention Points to Reduce Fatal and Non -Fatal Opioid Overdoses in Massachusetts Project Lead: Tom Stopka (Tufts) Marc LaRochelle (BMC), Adam Rose (RAND), Alex Walley (BMC), Kenneth Chui (Tufts), Anna Kaplan (Tufts), David Landy (Tufts), Rachel Hoh (Tufts) , and DPH Resources Approved: 1/30/2017 Project Summary : This study will examine touchpoints to identify potential opioid use disorder (OUD) interventions in the health care delivery, criminal justice, and public health systems. We will identif y distinct subpopulations, times, and venues for which potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) is 86 associated with fatal and non -fatal overdose. We will conduct spatial epidemiological analyses to characterize the geographic distribution and clustering of PIP, touchpoints before overdose events, non - fatal and fatal overdoses, and access to OUD services across Massachusetts (MA). Project Title: Opioid Prescription and Utilization after Orthopedic Surgery Approved: March 6, 2017 Project Summary: The purpose of this study is to identify the incidence and risk factors for prolonged use or misuse of op ioids, opioid overdose, and opioid -related mortality in patients who have undergone orthopedic procedures in different orthopedic subspecialties. Understanding the characteristics of these patients and their prescribers will facilitate development of futur e protocols that minimize early opioid dependence after orthopedic surgery, and thereby minimize the risk of long -term opioid -related morbidity and mortality. We hypothesize that there is a substantial and underestimated incidence of prolonged post -operati ve opioid use beyond the initial perioperative period, and that there are identifiable risk factors that predispose to ongoing prescription opioid use in this population, including both patient factors and prescriber factors listed below. Project Title: Effect of treatment for opioid use disorder on opioid -related death among patients with intravenous drug associated endocarditis Lead: Simeon 6, 2017 Project Summary: In this analysis, we will define the effect of medications for opioid use disorder on opioid related mortality in intravenous drug associated endocarditis (IE -IDU) . Reporting the number of patients in Massachusetts wi th IE -IDU who receive recommended treatment for opioid use disorder after an episode of endocarditis will add to our understanding of the current opioid epidemic. Moreover, describing the impact of treatment for underlying opioid use on overdose and overal l mortality can guide public health and clinical strategies to improve mortality in this high -risk population. Treatment with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in patients with injection drug associated endocarditis is associated with reduced opioi d-related and all -cause mortality utilization and opioid overdose among families involved in the Emergency Assistance (EA) shelter system Project Title: Assessing the relationship between patterns of shelter and behavioral health services utilization and opioid overdose among families involved in the Emergency Assistance (EA) shelter system Project Lead : Thomas Byrne (BU) Project Team : Margaret Thomas (BU), Daniel Miller (BU), Yoonsook Ha (BU), Travis Baggett (BHCFH) , and DPH Resources 87 Project Summary : The proposed project seeks to assess the extent to which, among families using the Emergency Assistance (EA) shelter system, different patterns of shelter and behavioral health services utilization are associated with the risk of fatal and non -fatal opioid overdose. . The project is motivated by prior research demonstrating that heads of households in families that make episodic (i.e. multiple discrete episodes over time) use of EA shelter have higher rates of substance abuse and mental health treatment his tories than do their counterparts in families that make either transitional (i.e. a single, brief episode) or long term (i.e. a single extended episode) use of EA shelter. By assessing whether such variation in shelter utilization and behavioral health ser vices use is associated with opioid overdose, the project stands to provide actionable information that could be used to help prevent future overdoses among EA -involved families. Specifically, findings could be used to inform the development of a tool that would identify EA -involved families who may be appropriate candidates for targeted screening and intervention efforts. Project Title : Understanding the Impact that Mental Health has on the Likelihood of Opiate Addiction, Overdose, and Death Project Lead : Christer Johnson (Ernst & Young) Project Team : Ankur Jindal ( Ernst & Young ), Debra Cammer Hines ( Ernst & Young ), and DPH Resources Project Summary : Much of the analytical focus in creating insights to reduce the number of opiate related overdoses and de aths has been focused on medical claim and prescription data, but very little focus has been given to behavioral health claims associated with mental health diagnosis and treatment. We propose to use exploratory data mining techniques to examine the relati onship between a patient's mental health diagnosis and treatment history and opiate abuse and overdose. This analysis will allow us to create a patient risk profile for opiate abuse which can be used to inform treatment plans and help health care providers identify patients who are good candidates for interventions before they become addicted and thus prevent opiate related overdose and death Project Title : Benzodiazepines, ADHD stimulants and overdose in buprenorphine maintenance treatment Project Lead : Tae Woo Park (BMC) Project Team : Marc LaRochelle (BMC), Alex Walley Benzodiazepines and ADHD stimulants are commonly prescribed for patients receiving buprenorphine maintenan ce treatment (BMT). BZD and stimulant - related poisoning deaths have increased in the US. No large epidemiological study has tested the association between BZD or stimulants and fatal or non -fatal overdose in people receiving BMT. Additionally, the benefits of BZD or stimulants in the BMT patient population are largely unknown. Prescribing BZD or stimulants may increase patient adherence to BMT (see BZD maintenance treatment studies in methadone maintenance) and thus decrease risk of overdose. The study will focus on two primary questions. Is receipt of BZD or stimulant associated with BMT treatment retention? Is the relationship between BZD or stimulant and OD mediated by BMT treatment retention? 88 Project Title : Assessing Racial Differences In Accessing Treatment Subsequent To A Non -fatal Opioid Overdose Related Hospital Patient Encounter Project Lead : Dan Dooley (BPHC) Project Team : Snehal Shah (BPHC) , and DPH Resources Project Summary : Our purpose is to gain a better understanding of the relationship b etween opioid - related hospital care and subsequent substance abuse treatment admissions. Specifically, we seek to assess whether race and other factors in the hospital record predict follow -up substance abuse treatment among individuals who experienced a n on-fatal opioid overdose. To determine if and to the what extent there are racial/ethnic differences in the rates of individual residents receiving subsequent substance abuse treatment services among those who have received acute hospital care for non -fatal opioid overdose and for any substance abuse -related diagnosis within the prior month and to assess factors within the Case Mix record that may play a role in predicting direct follow -up to treatment services. Project Title : Defining the cascade of care for substance use disorder detoxification in Massachusetts Project Lead : Jake Morgan (BU) Project Team : Josh Barocas (BU), Ben Linas (BU), Jenny Wang Jenifer Jaeger (BPHC) , and DPH Resources Project Summary : The goal of this pro ject is to describe the cascade of care and churn (i.e., frequent relapse and readmission) in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment in Massachusetts for those entering acute treatment services (ATS, detoxification) to inform policies to reduce the risk of fatal and non -fatal opioid overdoses in the Commonwealth. We will describe the movement from ATS post -detox treatment (lower levels of care including CSS and TSS) to longer term residential services, and to outpatient treatment such as outpatient based op ioid treatment (OBOT), describing relapse associated with each treatment level and transition (time between treatment services) as well as the rate of successful transitions to lower levels of care. The flexibility of our model will incorporate the variety of paths from ATS through the cascade, and we will describe the impact of each point in the cascade on fatal and non -fatal opioid -related overdose outcomes. Project Title : Community Distribution of Naloxone Kits and Naloxone Rescues Project Lead : Alex W alley (BMC ) Project Team : Traci Green (Brown), Tom Stopka Marc Larochelle (BMC), Na Wang (BMC) , and DPH Resources Project Summary : Community overdose response with naloxone is one of the core strategies identified by the US Department of Health an d Human Services to address the opioid epidemic. The Massachusetts' Governor's Opioid Working Group identified access to naloxone as a key strategy to addressing the opioid crisis. Massachusetts is an early adopter of community overdose education and naloxone distribution. The objectives of this analysis are to use the Chapter 55 databases to generate the amount of naloxone distributed to the community per community (municipality, zi p code) over time and the amount of naloxone administered by community members during rescue attempts per 89 community per month. A secondary objective of the project is to assess the geospatial distribution of naloxone, as well as rescue attempts, by zip cod e. This project will generate community level rates of naloxone distribution and naloxone rescue attempts from multiple sources linked through the chapter 55 databases. Project Title: Iatrogenic Opioid Addiction and Overdose Matthew Basilico (Harvard) Project Team: Abhiram Bhashyam (Harvard), Marilyn Heng (Harvard), Alan Xie (Harvard), Chethan Bachireddy (Harvard) , and DPH Resources Project Summary: This natural experiment utilizes the insight that clinicians differ in their individual propensities to prescribe a particular treatment course among many available options. To identify the relationship between opioid prescribing and addiction, they will use t he econometric technique of \"instrumental variables,\" and use first -year resident assignment as the discharging clinician in orthopedic trauma surgery as an \"instrument\" \u2014a feature that is essentially random in its assignment \u2014 for the opioid prescription the patient receives. For comparison, they will also utilize two additional instruments, differing levels of trauma severity in a motor vehicle accidents, and facility -level propensities to refer to medication assisted treatment after discharge, as well as p redictive techniques from machine learning to give co ntext to our causal estimates. 90 Appendix D Section 2: Full -sized maps of opioid overdose death rates by year. 2011 91 2012 92 2013 93 2014 94 2015 95 Appendix D Section 3: Community Quintile Scores (Alphabetical Order) Community Quintile116 Community Quintile Community Quintile Abington 1 Braintree 2 Dudley Acton Brewster 3 Dunstable 4 Acushnet 2 Bridgewater 2 5 1 Brimfield 2 East Bridgewater 1 Agawam 2 Brockton 1 East 3 Alford 2 Brookfield 3 East Longmeadow 2 Amesbury Brookline 5 Eastham 1 Amherst 5 Buckland 4 Easthampton 2 Andover 4 Burlington 3 Easton 3 Aquinnah 2 Cambridge 4 Edgartown 5 Arlington 4 Canton 3 Egremont 4 Ashburnham 4 Carlisle 5 Erving 2 Ashby 3 Carver 1 Essex 5 Ashfield 5 Charlemont 3 Everett 1 Ashland 4 Charlton 3 Fairhaven 2 Athol 1 Chatham 4 Fall River 1 Attleboro 2 Chelmsford 4 Falmouth 1 Auburn 3 Chelsea 1 Fitchburg 1 Avon 1 Cheshire 5 Florida 5 Ayer 1 Chester 4 Foxborough 3 Barnstable 1 Chesterfield 4 Framingham 2 Barre 1 Chicopee 1 Franklin 3 Becket 4 Chilmark 3 Freetown 2 Bedford 4 Clarksburg 4 Gardner 1 Belchertown 3 Clinton 1 Georgetown 4 Bellingham 3 Cohasset 3 Gill 3 Belmont 5 Colrain 5 Gloucester 1 Berkley 2 Concord 5 Goshen 4 Berlin 5 Conway 4 Gosnold 5 Bernardston 1 Cummington 3 Grafton 3 Beverly 2 Dalton 4 Granby 3 Billerica 2 Danvers 2 Granville 4 Blackstone 4 Dartmouth 2 Great Barrington 4 Blandford 3 Dedham 2 Greenfield 1 Bolton 4 Deerfield 4 Groton 4 Boston 1 Dennis 1 Groveland 4 Bourne 1 Dighton 4 Hadley 4 Boxborough 5 Douglas 3 Halifax 2 Boxford 5 Dover 5 Hamilton 4 Boylston 3 Dracut 2 Hampden 3 116 Lower quintiles indicate highest relative burden.

Four different types of agreements were signed. 1) Linking - This agreement between DPH and Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) allowed for the exchange of data for the purposes of securely connecting data at the indivi dual level across secure datasets without exposing the identity of the individual so connected. 2) Sharing - This agreement outlined the methodology and restrictions allowing for the sharing of data between different departments or agencies that were not previously sharing - or even allowed to share, outside of the Chapter 55 project. Each of the data -supplying entities was a signatory to this ISA. Specifically, signa tories include: the Department of Public Health (DPH), the Department of Correction (DOC), the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) for Houses of Correction data (HOC), the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), the Department of Ve terans' Services (DVS), the Department of Mental Health (DMH), the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), MassHealth, and the Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA). While CHIA has previously signed the Linking agreement, they a re also the provider of analytic data from the All Payer Claims Database (APCD) and Case Mix. 3) Hosting - An agreement between DPH and MassIT specifying the hosting responsibilities and restrictions for the data infrastructure. 4) Access - An additional agreeme nt created for ad hoc access to data outside of the purview of the prior three agreements. For example: If the Data Office within MassIT were to assist in a way that required analytical data access that is not covered by the 3rd agreement (which is hosting specific). This 4th agreement essentially outlines the responsibilities of being a good data steward and requires a signature for access. There would conceivably be n number of these agreements signed over time. 105 Appendix F: Partnerships The Chapter 5 5 project brought together analysts and researchers from across government, more than a dozen academic institutions, and two private consulting firms. First and foremost, the Department of Public Health would like to thank all those who participated in th is effort. Without everyone's assistance, this report could not have been completed in time. The work done here has been groundbreaking and the collaboration has been extraordinary both inside and outside government institutions.

These overdoses are driven by the underlying chronic disease of opioid addiction or opioid use disorders. People with opioid addiction are at high risk of overdose and death. Opioid-related deaths in the state were more than four times higher in 2015 than in 2000. This recent rate of increase is several times faster than anything seen here before. In 2013-2014 alone, opioid-related deaths occurred in two-thirds of the cities and towns in Massachusetts.

In fact, 2014 marked the first year since 1999 that the fatal overdose rate in the Bay State was more than double the national average. While opioid-related deaths have been on the rise across the country during that period, the situation in the Commonwealth has become especially worrying.

Understanding the causes and deadly ef fects of this issue can be a challenge. It' s a complex problem that has many layers and no single solution. It often raises more questions than answers. Why do people start \u2014 and why do they continue - taking opioids? How many people does this af fect? What can be done about it and what steps are being taken? What is an opioid, anyway? Learn More About Opioids What are opioids? The term opioid means \"opiate-like.\" It generally refers to a family of substances that include natural opiates (like Morphine and Codeine), as well as synthetic and semi-synthetic opioids like Heroin, Oxycodone, and Fentanyl.Definition Uses Side Ef fects Dr. Scott L ukas Dr. Scott L ukas Dr. Scott L ukas3/1/2019 Opioid Epidemic https://chapter55.digital.mass.gov/#top 3/14CHAPTER 55 In the face of this emergent public-health issue, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts took an unprecedented deep dive into available data on opioid-related deaths to investigate the crisis. As part of a multi-faceted ef fort to combat the epidemic, Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2015 (https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2015/Chapter55) was passed by the Legislature and signed into law by Governor Baker in August 2015. This new law permits the analysis of dif ferent government datasets to guide policy decisions and to better understand the opioid epidemic. Recently , a groundbreaking report highlighting the current state of the crisis was released as part of this ef fort.Governor Charlie Bak er Governor Charlie Bak er Governor Charlie Bak er Led by the Department of Public Health (DPH), the Chapter 55 analysis involved 10 datasets (http://www .mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/stop- addiction/dph-legislative-report-chapter-55-opioid-overdose-study-9-15-2016.pdf#page=58) from five dif ferent government agencies. In total, 29 groups (http://www .mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/stop-addiction/dph-legislative-report-chapter-55-opioid-overdose-study-9-15-2016.pdf#page=95) from government, higher education, and the private sector provided information and expertise. This level of partnership is what makes the Chapter 55 report (http://www .mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/stop-addiction/dph-legislative-report-chapter-55-opioid-overdose-study-9-15-2016.pdf) a milestone achievement in Massachusetts. Before this legislation was passed, such a comprehensive look at the opioid epidemic in the Commonwealth would not have been possible. In addition to providing significant insights into the opioid crisis by answering seven key questions (http://www .mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/stop- addiction/dph-legislative-report-chapter-55-opioid-overdose-study-9-15-2016.pdf#page=41) , this project demonstrates how private and public organizations can collaborate to answer complex public-health questions. This model of cooperative data analysis has the potential to become the standard in Massachusetts and across the United States. The Chapter 55 project represents a process that should be continued, adapted, and refined as new public health challenges and new collaborators step forward.3/1/2019 Opioid Epidemic https://chapter55.digital.mass.gov/#top 4/14ADDICTION AND SUBST ANCE USE DISORDERBelow are examples of opioid use trends that were uncovered by Chapter 55 analysis. Real, actionable steps to curb the epidemic can be taken as a direct result of this innovative data ef fort. Similar to diabetes or cancer , addiction is a complex disease impacted by certain risk factors like behavior and family history . Compulsive substance abuse, cravings, and continued use despite known harmful consequences are hallmarks of the condition. This disease is also more widespread than some may realize \u2014 according to a study from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) (http://www .samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-FRR1-2014/NSDUH-FRR1-2014.pdf#page=6) , nearly 1 in 12 Americans over the age of 12 have a substance abuse disorder . Cost of Addiction Economically , addiction is more costly than other brain conditions like Alzheimer 's disease, Parkinson' s disease, and stroke. In fact, data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (https://www .drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics) shows that costs related to substance abuse top more than $700 billion annually in the United States. However , economic impact is hardly the most negative aspect of addiction and, more specifically , the opioid epidemic. Addiction to opioids can put people at greater risk for infectious diseases like HIV or hepatitis, deteriorating conditions like cirrhosis or cognitive decline, family disruption like domestic violence or child abuse, job loss, exposure to criminal behavior , overdose, and death. Dr. Sar ah W akeman Dr. Sar ah W akeman Dr. Sar ah W akeman Growth of Addiction in Massachusetts Data from the DPH Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS) shows an increasing need for opioid-related treatment in Massachusetts. In 2000, about one third of admissions to substance abuse treatment centers and programs were opioid-related . By 2015, that figure had increased to more than half , overtaking alcohol as the most prevalent substance recorded by BSAS at treatment intake. The (HPC) (http://www .mass.gov/anf/budget-taxes-and-procurement/oversight-agencies/health-policy-commission/public- meetings/board-meetings/20160907-commission-opioid-presentation.pdf#page=1 1) recorded similar numbers for emergency room visits and hospitalizations during that time. Along with the rise in demand for opioid use treatment, nationally and in Massachusetts, there has been an increase in opioid-related overdoses, both fatal and nonfatal.

However , because they are so potent, they can be dangerous if misused. T o understand the opioid epidemic, it' s important to realize how both legal prescription medications and illegal substances impact the crisis in Massachusetts. T o investigate the scope of the problem, the entire population of adults was analyzed.14 Prescriptions The number of opioids prescribed to residents of Massachusetts has increased roughly 7% annually since 2000. In 2015, nearly one in six Massachusetts residents obtained an opioid prescription from a health care provider . Those receiving prescriptions obtained more than three filled prescriptions on average. Prescription History for Fatal Overdoses 2011 - 2014 1 Month Before Death3/1/2019 Opioid Epidemic https://chapter55.digital.mass.gov/#top 7/14Sources: Massachusetts Registry of V ital Records and Statistics .mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/admin/dmoa/vitals/) , Massachusetts Prescription Drug Program (http://www .mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/hcq/drug-control/pmp/) , Massachusetts Department of Public Health (http://www .mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/) Whether using them for legitimate medical reasons or not, anyone can become dependent on or addicted to opioids. When this happens, the body' s craving for an opioid continues even if a prescription runs out. In these cases, many people keep using opioids, but illegally . More than two-thirds of people who died from an opioid-related overdose had a legal opioid prescription at some point from 201 1-2014. However , only about 1 in 12 of those who died had an opioid prescription in the month before their death. It should be noted that opioid-related deaths began increasing sharply in 2012, no similar increase in opioid prescriptions was recorded. This suggests that no single substance or health care practice is solely responsible for the current opioid crisis. Rather , it's a complex issue with a number of contributing factors.About 8 in 12 people who died from opioids in 2013 and 2014 had an opioid prescription at some point from 201 1-2014 Deadly T rend: Switching from Legal to Illegal Opioids Some people make the transition from legal to illegal opioid use, driven by the disease of addiction. This becomes clear by looking at the amount of people who had a prescription six months, three months, and one month before death. This is found regardless of the substance that caused a fatal overdose. 154 people had a positive toxicology screen for prescription opioids from 2013-2014 Heroin Fentanyl Both Fentanyl & Heroin Precription Opioids Methadone Of those with a positive toxicology screen for prescription opioids , 83% had a legal opioid prescription at some point from 201 1-2014 2011-2014 6 Month Before Death 3 Month Before Death 1 Month Before Death Had legal prescription Did not have legal prescription 83% 17% = 1% of people with a positive toxicology screen for prescription opioids15 15 173/1/2019 Opioid Epidemic .csv) Sources: fice of the Chief Medical Examiner (http://www .mass.gov/eopss/agencies/ocme/) , Massachusetts Registry of V ital Records and .mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/admin/dmoa/vitals/) , Massachusetts Prescription Drug Program (http://www .mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/hcq/drug-control/pmp/) Department of Public Health (http://www .mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/) Multiple Prescribers One risk factor for fatal overdose that was identified was the number of opioid prescribers for an individual. There are legitimate reasons why someone might have multiple prescribers \u2014 primary care plus specialists or multi-provider practices \u2014 but there is an elevated risk for this group. The fatal opioid-related overdose rate for individuals with three or more opioid prescribers is seven times higher than the rate for other people. Multiple Substances Using multiple substances at the same time is also a risk factor . For example, Cocaine showed up in 30% of toxicology screens for opioid- related deaths from 2013-2014. Nearly 60% of post-mortem toxicology screens were positive for benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are a type of tranquilizer , including drugs like V alium, Xanax, and Ativan, and are typically used to treat anxiety . While Cocaine is always illegal, benzodiazepines are legally available but might be used outside a prescription. Although benzodiazepines were present in nearly 1,000 toxicology screens from 201 1-2014, only about half that many people ever had a prescription for one during that period. Fewer than 200 had a benzodiazepine prescription within a month of death. This suggests that the supply of benzodiazepines involved in overdoses includes both prescribed and diverted pills.18 19 Illegal Drugs When it comes to illegal opioids, Massachusetts is facing a dangerous combination of trends. Some individuals are transitioning from legal to illegal opioid use, perhaps due to dependence and addiction developing beyond prescribed thresholds. At the same time, the availability of illegal drugs is strengthening across the region. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) surveyed law enforcement of ficials about the availability of Heroin in eight regions across the country from 2007 to 2014 . Each year , New England led all regions in the percentage of respondents who reported high Heroin availability Heroin, perhaps expectedly , is commonly found in toxicology reports for opioid-related deaths. Data from 2013-2014 shows Heroin was likely or definitely in the individual's system at the time of death in more than 60% of opioid-related overdose deaths. What might be surprising is the increasingly deadly role Fentanyl is playing in the crisis. While Fentanyl can be available as a legally-prescribed medication, it is most often used illegally . Only about 3% of people who died from an opioid-related overdose and had Fentanyl present in their toxicology screen during the study period had a prescription for Fentanyl at the time of death. However , toxicology data shows Heroin, Fentanyl, or both substances were present in 85% of cases.203/1/2019 Opioid Epidemic https://chapter55.digital.mass.gov/#top 9/14DEMOGRAPHICSFentanyl: Legal and Illegal Fentanyl is an opioid that can be prescribed for pain management. However , it's also used illegally either on its own or combined with Heroin, often without the user's knowledge. According to the DEA, illegally produced Fentanyl can be up to 50 times more potent than Heroin. Fentanyl is increasingly recognized as a problem across the United States, and particularly in Massachusetts. T oxicology data from recent post-mortem cases indicates Fentanyl is adding to the state' s deadly epidemic more than Heroin . In 2015, more than 60% of toxicology samples tested positive for Fentanyl.

The crisis in Massachusetts af fects people from all backgrounds. The widespread nature of the epidemic makes addressing it an especially challenging task, because the path to opioid addiction has dif ferent starting points from person to person. While definite solutions might still be a mystery , knowing how the epidemic plays out among dif ferent sections of society can help Massachusetts find ways to strongly and ef fectively address this problem. Male and Female Despite the fact more men die from opioid overdoses than women, both genders are at risk, yet in dif ferent ways. T oxicology reports show men are more likely than women to have Heroin in their systems, while prescription opioids are more likely to be found in women than in men at the time of death. Part of this discrepancy may be down to a simple fact \u2014 women are more likely to use the health care system. This could present a particular risk for women because they are also more likely than men to have multiple prescribers for opioids, which is a risk factor as mentioned above.

The percentage of opioid-related deaths for different age groups shows the young people of Massachusetts are especially at risk. From 2013-2014, opioids accounted for more than a quarter of all fatalities in the 18-24 age group. For individuals from 25-34 , opioids were responsible for more than a third of all deaths, rising to more than 40% for men in this group. In 2015, roughly two out of every three people who died from opioids were younger than 45.

That rate has increased steadily since then, with the figure hitting 1 1.1 per 100,000 in 2012. However , the increase in the last three years has been especially sharp. By 2015, there were 23.3 fatal overdoses for every 100,000 residents. While the death rate within Massachusetts dif fers for various racial and ethnic groups, people from all backgrounds in the Bay State are caught up in the deadly epidemic. In the adjoining graph, we can see the overdose rates of three of the state' s largest groups for the last two years. By comparison, the national average was 9.7 per 100,000 in 2014. As seen in the graph, the age-adjusted, normalized data reveals that the epidemic is hitting the White non-Hispanic population at a rate around twice that of Black non-Hispanic population for the last two years, and roughly 50% more than the rate for the Hispanic population over that time.

Interpreting Data Using age-adjusted data is important because different groups have different age distributions, whether those groups are broken out by racial/ethnic, gender, or geographic lines. For example, the Hispanic population in Massachusetts is relatively younger than other racial/ethnic groups in the state. Without taking age distribution into account, the fact that younger people are more likely to die from opioid-related overdoses could result in an over-estimated death rate for the Hispanic community as a whole. We might experience similar mischaracterization when looking at cities and towns that skew older or younger than the rest of the state. In these ways and others, age-adjusting population data helps public health officials get a more accurate picture of the crisis and better target the most problematic areas and populations.Age-Adjusted Rates Confidence Intervals Normalizing Rates Incarcerated Population3/1/2019 Opioid Epidemic https://chapter55.digital.mass.gov/#top 12/14THE FUTUREWhen an inmate is released from prison in Massachusetts, their ability to re-enter society is being threatened by the opioid crisis. The risk of opioid-related death following release from incarceration is more than 50 times greater than for the general public. What' s more concerning is that the threat is immediate. Fatal overdoses during the first month after release are six times higher than for all other post- incarceration periods. Among inmates who both were released and died between 2013 and 2014, opioid-related overdose was the cause of death for 40% of these people. Following the age trend noted above, the risk of death for people aged 18-24 in this group is roughly 10 times higher than for individuals 45 or older . While some inmates receive substance use treatment while incarcerated, the data from this study does not include how , when, or for how long that treatment takes place. The opioid epidemic won't be solved overnight, and there' s no easy solution to make this problem disappear . However , there are signs of hope and a turning tide. The state has recently taken a number of important steps to address the crisis. From campaigns aimed at shifting the culture around how the public views addiction, to giving our health care professionals the tools they need to responsibly prescribe opioids and monitor prescriptions, Massachusetts is working to end the epidemic. While there is still a lot to do, findings from the Chapter 55 report have helped elected of ficials and public health leaders determine what should be done next. Stopping Stigma \u2014 Shifting the way that people view addiction and individuals with substance use issues is a top priority. DPH launched the State Without StigMA (http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/stop-addiction/state-without-stigma/) campaign to encourage the public to rethink how they perceive and treat people with addiction. Stories from people in recovery \u2014 like Sue and Stephanie, and Cotto \u2014 have helped reframe addiction as the disease it is. Promoting the Good Samaritan Law \u2014 Another state campaign, Make the Right Call (http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/substance-abuse/make-the-right-call-public-information- campaign.html), has helped spread awareness about the state's Good Samaritan Law. It ensures a person won't be charged with possession of a controlled substance if they call 9-1-1 to report an overdose. Prescription Monitoring Reforms \u2014 To help pharmacists and doctors better monitor active opioid prescriptions, DPH launched the Massachusetts Prescription Awareness Tool (MassPAT) (http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/newsroom/press-releases/dph/admin- launches-new-prescription-monitoring-program.html). This new online system is more efficient and user-friendly than older technologies. Expanding Prescription Drug Training \u2014 More resources and programs have been offered to dental schools (http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/newsroom/press-releases/eohhs/dental-core-competencies-to-combat-addiction-announced.html) and nursing and physician assistant programs (http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/newsroom/press-releases/eohhs/core- competencies-to-combat-opioid-epidemic-expanded-.html) to train students and professionals on how to prevent prescription drug misuse.Recent Steps T aken What to Do Next SueSueSue3/1/2019 Opioid Epidemic https://chapter55.digital.mass.gov/#top 13/14Opioid Addiction and Use Resources Massachusetts Substance Abuse Helpline (800) 327-5050 (tel:8003275050) Substance Use (https://www .mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/substance-abuse/prevention/prescription-dropbox- The confirmed opioid-related death rate was suppressed in towns that were detected as strong outliers using T ukey' s outlier filter . All values that fell outside of the upperbound, calculated using three times the interquartile range, were considered strong outliers. Rates for Provincetown, Cummington, and Granville were suppressed from 2001 to 2005. Rates for Aquinnah, New Ashford, and T yringham were suppressed from 201 1 to 2015. 2. In both 2014 and 2015, there was one death of a Massachusetts resident whose city/town of residence was not known. 3. Please note that data for 2000-2013 have been updated following a review of cases that did not receive an of ficial cause of death at the time the file was closed. Death data for 2014-2015 are preliminary and subject to updates. Case reviews of deaths are evaluated and updated on an ongoing basis. A large number of death certificates have yet to be assigned final cause-of-death codes. These counts are based on the estimates rather than confirmed cases. 4. Cases were defined using the International Classification of Disease, T enth Revision (ICD-10) codes for mortality . The following codes were selected from the underlying cause of death field to identify poisonings/overdoses: X40-X49, Y10-Y19. All multiple cause of death fields were then used to identify an opioid-related death: T40.0, T40.1, annual opioid-related death rate was calculated in five-year intervals. The death rate displayed is the crude, non age-adjusted rate. 6. In 1999, the International Classification of Diseases, T enth Revision (ICD-10) replaced the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) for coding all mortality data. Because there were changes made in the codes that are assigned to causes of death, changes to the rules used to determine the underlying cause of death, and changes in the codes that comprise the leading cause of death categories, direct comparisons of causes of death between 1999 and previous years cannot be made. 7.

Emergency room visits might also fall under this category . 19. Some health centers or clinics could have a pool of multiple physicians who collectively treat all patients. This could result in one patient receiving multiple opioid prescriptions from dif ferent physicians on separate visits for various reasons, including for immediate pain relief. 20.

The chart above shows the month- by-month estimates for fatal opioid -related overdoses for all intents from January 2017 through December 2018. In 2018, there are 1,617 confirmed opioid -related overdose deaths and DPH estimates that there will be an additional 320 to 394 deaths. Despite the spike in the third quarter of 2017, overall, there was an estimated 2% decrease in the number of opioid- related overdose deaths in 2017 compared with 2016, followed by another 4% estimated decrease in 2018 compared with 2017. The count for 2018 represents an estimated 6% decrease from 2016. 165 159 165152138 136160175191165 99 18 16998 6 67 37 5 6 4 10 36124 146 050100150200250 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 2017 2018Number of deathsFigure 1.

In order to obtain timelier estimates of the total number of opioid- related overdose deaths in Massachusetts - confirmed and probable - DPH used predictive modeling techniques for all cases not yet fi nalized by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). Based on the data available as of January 15, 2019, DPH estimates that there will be an additional 104 to 117 deaths in 2017 and an additional 320 to 394 deaths in 2018 , once these cases are final ized. Opioid -Related Overdose Death Rates, All Intents In 2018, DPH estimates a 4% decrease in the rate of opioid -related overdose deaths compared with 2017. This follows an estimated 3% decline in the rate of opioid -related over deaths from 2016 to 2017. Toxicology Analysis: Fentanyl and Other Drugs Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that has effects similar to heroin. It can be prescribed for severe pain. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration's 2015 Investigative Reporting, while pharmaceutical fentanyl (from transdermal patches or lozenges) is diverted for abuse in the United States at small levels, much of the fentanyl in Massachusetts is due to illicitly -produced fentanyl, not diverted pharmaceutical fentanyl. The stan dard toxicology screen ordered by the Office of the Chief Medical E xaminer includes a test for the presence of fenta nyl. Among the 1,445 opioid-related overdose deaths in 2018 where a toxicology screen was also available, 1,292 of them (89%) had a positive screen result for fenta nyl. In the third quarter of 2018, heroin or likely heroin was present 379506 526614514575660 642 622 6385606567429611,3621,7102,099 1,945 1,6172,0561,974 02004006008001,0001,2001,4001,6001,8002,0002,2002,400 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Number of deathsFigure 3.

Rate of Confirmed and Estimated Opioid- Related Overdose Deaths, All Intents Massachusetts Residents: 2000 opioid -related overdose deaths that had a toxicology screen. Cocaine was present in approximately 48% of these deaths and benzodiazepines were present in approximately 38% . In the first quarter of 2014, amphetamines were present in 4% of opioid- related overdose deaths that had a toxicology screen . The presence of amphetam ines has been increasing since 2017 to approximately 12% of opioid -related overdose deaths in the third quarter of 2018. Since 2014, the rate of heroin or likely heroin present in opioid- related overdose deaths has been decreasing while the presence of fentanyl and cocaine is still trending upward. While screening tests can be used to note the ra te at which certain drugs are detected in toxicology reports, they are insufficient to determine the final cause of death witho ut additional information. The cause of death is a clin ical judg ment made within the Office of the Chief Medical Exa miner. 1. This is most likely illicitly produced and sold , not oxymorphone, and tramadol Please note that previous estimates may change slightly as DPH routinely receives updated toxicology data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the Massachusetts State Police. Technical Notes Opioids include heroin, illicitly manufactured fentanyl, opioid -based prescription painkillers, and other unspecified opioids. Data for 2017- 2018 deaths are preliminary and subject to updates. Beginning with the May 2017 report, DPH started reporting opioid- related death s for all intents, which includes unintentional/undetermined and suicide. This report tracks opioid -related overdoses due to difficulties in identifying heroin and prescription opioids separately. The Department regularly reviews projections as more info rmation becomes available. Information from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the Massachusetts State Police are now incorporated into the predictive model. This additional information has improved the accuracy of the models that predict the likelihood that the cause of death for any person was an opioid- related overdose. DPH applied this model to death records for which no official cause of death was listed by the OCME. The model includes information from the death certificate, Medical Examin er's notes, and the determination by the State Police of a suspected heroin death. DPH added this estimate to the number of confirmed cases in order to compute the total number of opioid -related overdoses. Should new information become available that cha nges the estimates to any significant degree, updates will be posted. 0102030405060708090100 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Percent Year and QuarterFigure 5.

The agency recognizes that abuse-deterrent opioids are not abuse- or addiction-proof but are a step toward products that may help reduce abuse. The FDA fully supports efforts to better understand the impact of these products in the real-world setting and convened a public workshop on July 10-11, 2017 (/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm540845.htm), to discuss the current data and methods for evaluating ADF products postmarketing and what can be done to improve national data and methods moving forward. The FDA also supports the development of innovative formulations that have the potential to make abuse of these products more difficult or less rewarding. This does not mean a product is impossible to abuse or that abuse- deterrent properties necessarily prevent addiction, overdose, and death. Notably, currently marketed technologies do not effectively deter one of the most common forms of opioid abuse -- swallowing the tablet or capsule. Because opioid medications must in the end be able to deliver the opioid to the patient, there may always be some potential for addiction and abuse of these products. What does abuse-deterrent really mean? Abuse-deterrent formulations target the known or expected routes of abuse, such as crushing in order to snort or dissolving in order to inject, for the specific opioid drug substance. The science of abuse deterrence is relatively new, and both the formulation technologies and the analytical, clinical, and statistical methods for evaluating those technologies are rapidly evolving. The FDA is working with many drug makers to support advancements in this area and helping drug makers navigate the regulatory path to market as quickly as possible. In working with industry, the FDA is taking a flexible, adaptive approach to the evaluation and labeling of potentially abuse-deterrent products. Opioids with FDA-Approved Labeling Describing Abuse-Deterrent Properties FDA has approved these opioids with labeling describing abuse-deterrent properties consistent with the FDA's Guidance for Analgesics https://www opioids with FDA-approved abuse-deterrent labeling. How does the FDA decide what drugs are considered abuse-deterrent? To meet the FDA's standards, it is essential that every opioid with labeling describing its abuse-deterrent properties be grounded in science and supported by evidence. Any claims regarding abuse-deterrent properties must be truthful and not misleading based on a product's labeling, and supported by sound science taking into consideration the totality of the data for the particular drug. Absent sufficient science, there can be no claim of abuse deterrence. Permitting insufficiently proven claims does not serve the public health. The FDA has issued two guidances to help industry understand how the agency currently is evaluating these innovative products. \"Guidance for Industry: Abuse-Deterrent Opioids - Evaluation and Labeling (/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM334743.pdf)\" (final guidance) explains the FDA's current thinking about the studies that should be conducted to demonstrate that a given formulation has abuse-deterrent properties. It also makes recommendations about how those studies should be performed and evaluated, and discusses what labeling claims may be approved based on the results of those studies. \"General Principles for Evaluating the Abuse Deterrence of Generic Solid Oral Opioid Drug Products (/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM492172.pdf)\" (final guidance) includes recommendations about the studies that should be conducted to demonstrate that a generic opioid is no less abuse-deterrent than the brand name product, with respect to all potential routes of abuse. How will abuse-deterrent opioids help with the epidemic? Because abuse-deterrent products are expected to reduce abuse compared to non-abuse-deterrent products, the agency is very interested in exploring new methods for analyzing and evaluating abuse-deterrent features; evaluating the nomenclature use to describe abuse-deterrent features; facilitating development of science for generic versions of these drugs; and taking new steps to encourage the conversion of the market to effective ADFs as part of the FDA's Opioid Policy Work Plan. The FDA looks forward to a future in which most or all opioid medications are available in formulations that are less susceptible to abuse than the formulations that are on the market today. To achieve this goal, FDA is taking steps to incentivize and support the development of opioid medications with progressively better abuse-deterrent properties. These steps include working with individual sponsors on promising abuse-deterrent technologies; developing appropriate testing methodologies for both innovator and generic products; and publishing guidance on the development and labeling of abuse-deterrent opioids. We continue to encourage the development of innovative abuse-deterrent technologies, and we are also prioritizing the need for data that will help determine the impact of products incorporating abuse-deterrent technology on misuse and abuse. To collect this important information, all the companies that have brand name opioids with abuse-deterrent labeling claims are being required to conduct post-market studies to determine the impact those products are having in the real world. Having that information is critical and will allow us to take the next important steps in this area. In addition, FDA supports the development of assessment tools to evaluate packaging, storage, delivery, and disposal solutions, as well as product formulations, designed to prevent and deter misuse and abuse of opioids. To further this effort, the agency held a public workshop on December 11-12, 2017 (/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm571797.htm), regarding the role of packaging, storage, and disposal options within the larger landscape of activities aimed at addressing abuse, misuse, or inappropriate access of prescription opioid3/1/2019 Postmarket Drug Safety Information for Patients and Providers > Abuse-Deterrent Opioid Analgesics https://www .fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/%20PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm600788.htm 3/3drug products.

This report summarize s data and methods that we use to evaluate the trends in sales, volume, and prices of prescription opioid analgesics over time . Definitions of the retail prescription opioids analgesic market The complexity of opioid risks, such as with misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and death and the increasing rates at which they are occurring, all contribute to the significant public health burden of the opioid epidemic. Opioid products dispensed for outpatient use may be more likely to be misused and abused than opioid products used in the inpatient setting.1 This may be due to greater availability and easier access and the difference in healthcare provider oversight in outpatient settings compared to inpatient settings. For example, for years 2012-2016, sales data, measured in dollars, of products sold from manufacturers to pharmacies and other settings of care show that sales to the retail setting accounted for the majority of annual opioid analgesic sales (>80%) and injectable formulations accounted for less than 0.2% of those sales. 2 Therefore, this analysis focuses on sales to the retail setting and includes all formulations of opioid analgesics except for injectable formulations, which are not commonly dispensed in an outpatient setting . Additionally, we focused on opioid analgesic products for the purposes of this analysis; opioid-containing products used as part of medication- assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid dependence and opioid-containing cough/cold products are not included in our analysis because of their different indications and patterns of use. Results Quantity Quantities of analgesic opioids, as measured in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) sold from manufacturers to retail pharmacies gradually increased from near ly 50 billion MME in 1992 to about 73 billion MME in 1998, increased more steadily in 1999 - 2000 to 92 billion MME, and then rapidly increased by an average rate of more than 15 billion MMEs per year for the next decade, peaking at nearly 250 billion MME of opioids sold in 2010 (figure 1). Over the entire timeframe, generic versions of opioids were available for many of the opioid products on the market, and comprised most of the MMEs sold to pharmacies over the entire timeframe studied. The generic share of MMEs has steadily increased in the most recent timeframe with generics comprising 53% of MMEs sold in 2000, and rising 1Notification letters for the expansion of the Extended- release and long -acting opioid analgesic REMS IQVIA National Sales Perspective (NSP). 2012 -2016; extracted January 2018. 1 to account for over 90% of MMEs sold in 2016. Overall p rescribing trends have similarly shown increased dispensing rates for generic drugs, including non-opioid drugs, during this interval.3 Figure 1: Total MMEs s old for aggregate opioid analgesic market - by brand / generic T he rapid uptake of opioids sold was primarily produced by a few key active moieties : oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, fentanyl, and morphine products, which comprised less than 25% of MME sold in 1992, grew to account for over 80% of MME sold by 2011. Propoxyphene, which is no longer marketed, comprised the majority of opioids MME sold between 1992 and 1995. S ales of propoxyphene products had gradually declined over time , until its removal from the US market in 2010 because of serious heart risks associated with its use. 3 Generic Pharmaceutical Association Annual Report 2014 ; http://www.gphaonline.org/media/wysiwyg/PDF/GPhA2014AnnualReport.pdf 2 Figure 2: Total MMEs s old for aggregate opioid analgesic market - by active moiety W ithin these active moiety groupings, it is important to note that most of these opioids are mar keted under multiple formulations, including immediate -release and extended -release versions as well as opioids in combination with other analgesics such as acetaminophen. To evaluate these aggregate trends at a more granular level, we identified specifi c products (i.e., the opioid active moiety and/or other analgesic, and the formulation, but not the strength), which comprised most MMEs sold for each opioid. (figure 3) Figure 3: Total MME Sold for Leading Opioid Products 3 Particularly notable in figure 3 are the differences in the rates of change in quantities sold (in MME) of these different products and in the dates for the peak quantities sold, which precede 2016 for all products with the (apparent) exception of Oxycodone + Ace taminophen IR relative to the overall aggregate trends in opioid MME observed in figure 1. Changes in the annual total of morphine milligram equivalents sold may be due to a number of factors such as drug product, dosage, strength, or quantities ultimately prescribed and dispensed; further investigation is necessary to fully understand the complex factors contributing to these pattern changes over time. Sales and Prices We also evaluated total sales and quantities sold in MME to calculate average annual prices per MME for these products to see if any clear relationship between prices and sales volume were present. It is important to point out that the sales measures provided by IQVIA represent invoice prices that pharmacies pay to manufacturers and drug wholesalers, and not prices paid by patients or insurance providers. The price measure is interpretable as an average price per unit of analgesic relief, and is not the price of the pharmaceutical product per se. Unlike the standard price indices used by economists to measure the average price level of sundry goods, the measure $ / MME provides an interpretation based on equivalent analgesic effects across various opioid active moieties. The retail opioid market had grown dramatically over this timeframe, from less than $1 billion in sales in 1992, peaking at $8 billion dollars in 2015 (Figure 4). Oxycodone and fentanyl products, which had combined retail sales of less than $150 million in 1992, accounted for $5 billion dollars in sales and ove r 70% of the retail opioid market share by 2009. Figure 4 : Combined Retail Sales of Analgesic Opioid Products A s shown in Figure 5a, the average price of retail analgesic opioids rose significantly from about 1993 to 2000. It then plateaued until 2004 before dropping to a new lower level for the years 2004 to 2005. 4 This trend shows no clear relationship with the total prescription retail analgesics sold as measured in MME. Figure 5a : Total MMEs S old and Price per MME for Aggregate Opioid Analgesic Market W e also decomposed average price by brand and generic version (figures 5b and 5c) and similarly find no clear price / quantity relationships, with prices for both brand and generic products generally increasing over time. The average price for generic opioids were found to be less than 2.5 cents per MME over the entire timeframe, while average brand prices ranged from roughly 6 cents per MME in 1992 to 12 cents per MME in 2012. Beginning in 2013, branded prices increased more sharply to 20 cents per MME in 2016. Figure 5b: Total MMEs S old and Price per MME for Brand Opioids 5 Figure 5c: Total MMEs Sold and Price per MME for Generic Opioids Alt hough no price / volume relationships are observable in the data, we do find that products having a lower price per MME tend to do well relative to higher-priced products. (F igure 6). In 1992, 78 % of MMEs sold were for products with an average price of less than 5 cents per MME , with this ratio steadily declining to 59% by 2002. Beginning in 2003 that trend reversed and has steadily increased with 85% of MMEs sold in 2016 coming from products with an average price below 5 cents per MME. Figure 6: Proportion of MMEs Sold by Average Price Formulation Trends We also evaluated these data to quantify trends in use of abuse-deterrent formulations of opioid products. These formulations are intended to make certain types of abuse, such as crushing a tablet to snort or dissolving a capsule to inject, more difficult or less rewarding. For the purposes of our analysis we only included products which have received FDA-approved abuse- deterrent labeling . The science of 6 abuse deterrence is relatively new , and we evaluated these trends beginning in 2011 and found very low uptake of these new products, with only 5- 6% of MMEs sold during that timeframe coming from ADF - formulated opioids. In 2016 the average price per MME for ADF formulated opioids was roughly 15 cents per MME, compared to only 3 cents per MME for non-ADF opioid products. There are currently no generic opioids with FDA-approved abuse- deterrent labeling. Figure 7: Proportion of MMEs that are for Abuse Deterrent Properties W e also analyzed trends in MMEs sold for both immediate release (IR) opioids and extended release/long acting (ER/LA) opioids (Figure 8a and 8b). From 1992 - 2010 the quantity of MMEs sold for both IR and ER/LA opioids increased dramatically. However, during that timeframe, ER/LA opioids which comprised only 7% of MMEs sold in 1992, accounted for 1/3 of MMEs sold in 2000, and over 40% of MMEs sold by 2003 (figure 8c). While MMEs for ER/LA products began to decline in 2010, the decline in the quantity of IR MMEs did not begin until 2013. Over 60% of the roughly 50 billion MME decrease in MMEs so ld observed from 2010 - 2016 are from decreased sales in ER/LA products. Figure 8a: Total MMEs sold for Immediate Release (IR) Opioids 7 Figure 8b: Total MMEs sold for Extended Release / Long- Acting (ER/LA) Opioids F igure 8 c: Total MMEs sold by IR and ER / LA 8 Appendix: Key characteristics of the IQVIA data file for the retail opioid analgesics market Data was extracted from the IQVIA, National Sales Perspectives: Retail and Non -Retail Database. The IQVIA National Sales Perspectives measures the volume of drug products, both prescription and over-the-counter, and selected diagnostic products moving from manufacturers into various outlets within the retail and non- retail markets. Volume is express ed in terms of sales dollars, \"eaches\", which may be interpretable as bottles of pills, extended units, which may be interpretable as number of pills, and share of market. These data are based on national projections. Outlets within the retail market inclu de the following pharmacy settings: chain drug stores, independent drug stores, mass merchandisers, and food stores. Data were provided from 1992 - 2016 for all retail analgesic opioids grouped by molecule, formulation, manufacturer, and strength. Brand and generic drug identifiers were also provided. Annual measures of extended units sold and total sales dollars were provided for each product. The definitions of these variables are provided below. Definitions of key IQVIA variables Sales$ This variable is a measure of the amount of money non-retail and retail outlets spent on a drug product acquired from manufacturers and drug distributors/wholesalers based on the outlet's invoice for bulk order purchasing, since 1992. Combined Molecule This v ariable identifies products with a unique molecule or combination of molecules. Strength This variable identifies the different potencies or strengths. These are expressed in different ways depending on the presentation of the product, for example millig rams for oral tablets and capsules, milligrams per milliliter for oral and injectable liquids, micrograms per hour for transdermal products, and such. Brand/Generic This data element classifies products by their status as brand, generic, branded generic, or other , as classified by I QVIA . It enables identification of products by this status and reports on totals and trends for brand and generic products in a particular market. Overall, this classification of products may differ from FDA's standard terminology based on whether a product approval derived from a New Drug Application or an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). IQVIA appears to classify all trade name products as brand or branded generic. \"Generic\" products appear to include only those products with no trade name. Products approved as NDAs and ANDAs are classified as \"brand\" prescriptions if they have a trade name, while prescriptions for products with no trade name, including some approved as NDAs are defined by FDA as \"generic\" prescriptions. 9 Extended Units Extended units are the number of tablets, capsules, milliliters, ounces, etc. of a product shipped in each unit. Extended often are not meaningful above the package level, because a product may have different forms and strengths and, therefore, a different type of unit for each presentation. Product Form This data element refers to the physical dosage form of a drug, such as oral or injectable. This system consists of three levels, with each successive level containing more detail about the product form. For example: Product Form 1 = O contains all orals Product Form 2 = OL contains all oral liquids Product Form 3 = OLS contains all oral liquids in syrup form Our data captures opioid products at the more granular product form 3 level. Limitations of these data Numerous metrics are not available consistently for the types of historical data we were seeking. In addition, IQVIA made changes to the underlying source data and projection methodologies over time. Therefore, our analysis focu sed on data for the variables and metrics available consistently from 1992- 2016 in a form that allowed for the calculation of a prices based on morphine milligram equivalents (MME) of the selected opioid analgesics. Of note, National Drug Code ( NDC ) product identifier data are not available historically back to 1992, therefore we used product formulation and strength of molecules to calculate MME based on the volume of extended units sold. Findings from this review should be interpreted in the context of the known limitations of the databases used. These data do not provide a direct estimate of use but do provide a national estimate of units bought by retail outlets from distributors and wholesalers through the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain. Sales of products outside of the supply chain are not captured, for example illicit sources of opioids such as fentanyl. The amount of product purchased by these channels of distribution may be a reasonable surrogate for use, if we assume the facilities purchase drugs in quantities reflective of actual patient use, i.e., that waste or diversion is constant or negligible. Standardization of data using morp hine milligram equivalents (MME ) Morphine is often used as the reference point for other opioids. The CDC developed a conversion reference table that contains MME conversion factors for opioid medications, organized by molecule and National Drug Code (NDC). The table contains all the fields necessary to compute the MMEs. A summary table of opioid MME conversions is provided in Table 1. 10 Table 1: Opioid Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) Conversion Factors4 Type of Opioid (strength units) MME Conversion Factor Buprenorphine film/tablet (mg) 30 Buprenorphine patch (mcg/hr) 12.6 Buprenorphine 0.03 Butorphanol Codeine (mg) 0.15 Dihydrocodeine (mg) 0.25 Fentanyl buccal or SL tablets, or lozenge/troche Hydromorphone (mg) 4 Levorphanol tartrate (mg) 11 Meperidine hydrochloride (mg) 0.1 Methadone (mg) 3 Morphine (mg) 1 Opium (mg) 1 Oxycodone (mg) 1.5 Oxymorphone (mg) 3 Pentazocine (mg) 0.37 Tapentadol (mg) 0.4 Tramadol (mg) 0.1 For all products in our dataset, the opioid component and corresponding extended unit (tablet, capsule, milliliters of liquid, transdermal patch, lozenge, spray, etc.) were identified, along with the strength, strength unit (mg for most oral dosage forms, mcg or mcg/hr for other presentation such as transdermal patch, spray, lozenge, etc.). For all products and presentations, we expressed all strength units from the IQVIA data in terms which directly corresponded with the strength units in the MME conversion reference table. We then calculated the quantity of MMEs sold per product per year by multiplying opioid strength times the MME conversion factor times the total number of extended units sold in each calendar year.

5 Executive Summary The Commonwealth is in the midst of a serious and dangerous epidemic. Prescription drug use is skyrocketing, opioid overdose deaths are steadily increasing and while support for these addiction treatment programs has increased, it is not sufficient to meet the needs of this growing problem. The Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission was established unde r Chapter 302 Section 56 of the Acts of 2008 by the Massachusetts State Legisl ature to investigate and study the impact of the OxyContin and heroin epidemic on the state and munici pal governments and recommended policy solutions to help stem the tide of this epidemic. Between 2002 and 2007 the Commonwealth lost 78 soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the s ame time period, 3,265 Massachusetts residents died of opiate-related overdose s. The Commonwealth is losing men and women on its streets at a rate of 42 to 1 compared to what the state is losing in two wars overseas. Addiction is a medical disorder, and we have a public health epidemic on our hands that is larger than the flu pandemic. If the H1 N1 virus killed 3,000 people in a five year period in Massachusetts, the crisis would be center stage and the entire Commonwealth would be working to find a solution to protect the public. Howe ver, because of the stigma surrounding substance abuse the opiate epidemic is left in the shadows and little light has been put upon reforming the policies involving substance abuse in the Commonwealth. In 2005, 21.8 percent of the total state budget was spent on substance abuse a nd addiction related programs.1 This funding represents a broken system as 202 people entered an ATS treatment program over 10 times in 2007. In 2007 there were 105,552 admissions to DPH-funded substance abuse program s in Massachusetts. 2 The total amount spent on substance abuse and addiction in the justice sy stem in 2005 was $1.084 billion, which was 5.3 percent of the state budget. 3 Nearly 70 percent of inmates in state and local prisons throughout the country admit to regular drug abuse. 4 The cost of opiate addiction is seen in the families who deal with the disease each day and in the increasing costs to the state. The pain and heartache that this disease inflicts on families across the Commonwealth is widespread. It appears that regardless of soc ioeconomic status, race, religion, or sex, the disease of addiction is devastating families at an alarming rate. Throughout the Commission hearings family members and loved ones provided some of t he most powerful evidence of this terrible problem. Our understanding of the problems surrounding addiction and the new wave of prescription drug abuse is constantly evolving and as a state we have a duty to our citizens to provide comprehensive programs and treatment for thos e affected with this terrible disease. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 6 Summary of Recommendations In looking at the specific problems with OxyContin and heroin abuse, the Commission was able to tailor its recommendations to the particular concerns surrounding opioid addiction. Substance abuse affects each individual differently and there is no single s olution to ending opioid addiction in the Commonwealth. The Commission believes that there ar e a variety of steps that can be taken to improve the prevention, treatment, safety and long-term outcomes of this devastating disease. Thus, the recommendations that are made in t his report offer the widest array of policy solutions. Based on the nearly 30 hours of oral testimony, thousands of pages of written testimony and the many heartfelt stories the Commission received, the recommendat ions reflect twenty broad areas of public policy pertaining to addiction and treatment of addiction. T he major points of reform include; improving education and prevention measures in schools, revamping our pr escription monitoring program to fall in line with more comprehensive plans from other states, regulating pain management training for doctors, dentists and nurse practitione rs, ensuring that health insurance companies cover the necessary treatment for each individua l, implementing a comprehensive jail diversion program for first-time, non-violent offender s, developing more effective strategies to support long-term engagement in treatm ent, and correcting the CORI system to better reflect the nature of substance abuse related crime s. I. Massachusetts Prescription Monitoring Program One of the most efficient ways at the state level to stop fra ud, and reduce the availability of dangerous prescription drugs, is an active and effective Prescri ption Monitoring Program. a. The Massachusetts Prescription Monitoring Program should be overhaul ed so that it is a useful resource for the many state agencies, and non-governm ental entities that have a stake in the careful monitoring of pharmaceutical distribution. b. The Commission believes that if the Department of Public Health is unable to assist in making these overwhelming changes in the PMP, the system may ne ed to be moved to another regulatory agency. II. Pain Management Training and Education The Commission believes that educating our doctors, dentists, physic ian's assistants, nurses and pharmacists is a major tool in fighting the legal prescription drug abus e trade. a. Continued support of the use and development of evidence-based educational materials for teachers, law enforcement and other health professionals. b. Improved training on the identification and intervention of prescription and illicit drug abuse. c. Improved pharmacy training on the identification of prescription drug abuse and the security measures necessary to deter such abuse. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 7 III. Tamper-Resistant Prescription Pads Implementing a fraud-resistant prescription pad program would all ow additional safeguards to be built into the prescription delivery system without incurring major additional expense or creating a major disruption to the system saving the Commonwealth millions of dollars in counterfeit prescription costs. a. The Commission recommends that all prescriptions for controlled substa nces be written on official state prescription pads, which contain tamper r esistant features, and that no exemptions to this rule may exist. IV. Preventing Overdose Deaths with Limited Liability Legislation Limited liability legislation would provide limited immunity from drug possession charges and prosecution when a drug-related overdose witness or vict im calls for medical attention. a. Sensible Good Samaritan legislation should be enacted similar to Ne w Mexico's that will be effective in decreasing the number of overdose deaths. V. Overdose Prevention for Minors Under current statutes and regulations, minors can check themselves out of the hospital and a parent may never be informed. This has obvious consequences for both the minor and parent and leads to a complete breakdown in communication. a. The Commission urges that legislation be enacted to mandate that hospitals report to parents in the event of a minor overdose and enable parents to take the ne cessary steps to seek treatment for their child. VI. Case Management Case management could provide some of the necessary supports to assist individuals with substance use disorders in moving through a difficult process with many obstacles . a. The Commonwealth should further investigate the state's capabilit ies to provide case management services to individuals identified with a substance use disorder. VII. Insurance The Commission understands the current climate in which Massachusett s finds itself in and the overwhelming support for cost containment and reform in the health care industr y as a whole. a. The Commission recommends strengthening Federal and state mental health parity laws to limit loopholes and provide comprehensive services in the form t hat is best suited to the individual suffering from substance use disorder. b. Mandating a medical necessity definition which includes a determinat ion for behavioral health issues, providing for consistency across the state. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 8 c. Ensuring that should an individual chose the course of treatment that re quires medication assisted treatment, proper coverage by insurance compa nies be mandated through the state. VIII. Addiction and the Criminal Justice System The Commission recommends that probation supervise post-release so that the substance abuse treatment afforded through the Community Corrections Centers (CCCs) can be implemented for a time duration that is consistent with evidence-based practic e. a. Adopting practices such as the Bureau of Justice Assistance's S equential Intercept Model, where interventions can occur at any and every point along a pers on's involvement with the criminal justice system. b. Enacting mandatory post-release supervision that could compel a pers on leaving prison into treatment. c. Sentencing reform should include a variety of components, those which all ow the Department of Correction to \"step down\" inmates through the various se curity levels prior to release. d. Enhanced residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment programs which are essential during incarceration. e. Permitting substance abuse intervention not only for probationers who are \"sentenced\" post-disposition but those who are awaiting trial and under pr e-trial probation supervision. f. Additional substance abuse treatment intervention through the reintroducti on of \"split\" and \"suspended\" sentences to state prison adjudicated in the superior court. IX. Jail Diversion The Commission believes that we must drastically alter the manner in which we deal with those suffering with substance use disorders before they enter our criminal j ustice system. a. The diversion of first time, low-level offenders from a correc tion setting into treatment is the best first step towards reforming a system in dire nee d of attention. b. A jail diversion model requires up to 90 days of inpatient treatment, followed by a year of case management and support. X. Interdiction and Law Enforcement Law enforcement officials play an important role in the substance abuse equation as they are often the first responders in instances of illegal activity and play a crucial role in the implementation of policies throughout the Commonwealth. a. The Commonwealth can be better served by improving the methods of communication with federal enforcement agencies responsible for targeting internet suppliers which are often found to be the route source for expansive cr iminal enterprises. b. Improving educational awareness and providing access to the Massac husetts Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) would be the next step in the drive to better Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 9 equip our law enforcement professionals to fight prescription drug abus e and illegal activity. XI. Long-Term Treatment Long-term treatment programs are needed in the Commonwealth to provide a continuum of care for individuals with substance use disorder. a. The Commission recommends that a comprehensive approach to long-term treatment, providing individuals with comprehensive substance abuse monitoring, case management, support groups, pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy. b. Additionally, long-term treatment must include family and child care services, vocational rehabilitation, mental health services, housing, financial a nd medical services. XII. Education and Prevention The Commission believes that raising awareness about the harms of drugs, alcohol and substance abuse is an issue that must be addressed at an early age. a. Given the changes in substance abuse in the Commonwealth, drug awareness programs must be updated to include illicit drug use such as prescription drugs. b. A statewide program should be implemented to require the program throughout all levels of a child's education, including the upper grades of elementary school. c. Licensed drug and alcohol counselors should be present in each middle school and high school throughout the state providing diagnostic services and refer rals for students with substance use disorders. XIII. Recovery High Schools For many students suffering from substance use disorder, having an envir onment such as a recovery high school provides them with a safe haven, where they c an both learn the state mandated curriculum and receive proper addiction treatment. a. The Commission recommends that the state continue to support recovery high schools, by increasing the number of recovery high schools in the Com monwealth through more funding and legislative support. XIV. Disabled Population The Commission believes that as with all substance abuse issues, t reatment must be individualized and must adapt to meet the needs of specific populations, s uch as those who are also physically disabled. a. Vocational rehabilitation counselors and social service case manag ers need to recognize and address substance in their clientele and increase referra l to treatment. b. Provider sensitivity to treatment barriers training (political , attitudinal, or physical) is crucial while devising evaluations and individual treatment plans. c. Treatment programs will need to address the attitudes of thei r staff and improve accessibility of their facilities, policies, and materials. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 10 d. Substance abuse treatment professionals must pay close attention to the unique aspects of the lifestyle of persons with disabilities, which may affect the outcomes of substance abuse treatment. XV. Co-occurring Mental Illness and Addiction Co-occurring disorders place additional restraints on the treatm ent and recovery process and deserve special attention for the type of treatment required. a. The Commission would recommend implementing lessons learned from the SAMHSA Co-Occurring State Initiative Grant (COSIG) that eva luated how 17 states addressed the common problem and developed more effective ways to ide ntify and treat individuals with co-occurring mental illness and addiction (dual diagnosis) . XVI. Cultural Competencies The Commission were struck by the lack of information about the problem which this section discusses and, similarly, about the lack of suggested solutions. a. The Commonwealth should increase support for the worthwhile translator services provided by the Commonwealth and improve access for those who need them. XVII. Veterans' Issues The Commission recommends continued funding support for veterans outreach, referral services, and the Department of Veterans' Services. a. The Commonwealth must continue to improve upon its methods for identifying returning veterans so that they may benefit from the services available to th em. XVIII. CORI/Job Training An integral part of recovery is reintroducing those who have recovere d from addiction both into society and the job market. This process is stymied by th e inability of former substance abusers to find work because of CORI offenses, even after they have shown that they are rehabilitated and are making every attempt to stay sober. a. Increasing funding of the Correctional Recovery Academy (CRA) and other prog rams that focus on treatment and reentry. b. Mandating a program for Certificates of Rehabilitation and Recov ery for offenders who complete correctional programs. c. When CORI reform takes place in the upcoming legislative sessi ons in the Commonwealth, the issue of better displaying individual crimes be examined. XIX. Family Issues Addiction is a family disease and recovery is a family process . It is important for families to be both educated on the illness and supported throughout the recovery proces s as caring for a loved one who is struggling with an addiction is one of the most difficult situations that any individual or family will have to endure in their lifetime. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 11 a. Increasing availability, access and funding to family services and peer support groups to ensure that families are given all options regarding treatment and services both for families and individuals with substance use disorder. b. Increasing access to information on drug overdoses so that parents and loved ones have the lifesaving tools in the event of an emergency. XX. Federal Issues These issues are intertwined throughout many of the recommendations in this report; however, the Commission felt it necessary to include a separate s ection in the report on the specific issues that are beyond the purview. a. Federal law enforcement and regulatory programs must be involved in t he policing of illegal prescription drug activity on the internet. b. Mental health parity must be strengthened nationally to include provisions for substance abuse coverage by insurance companies. c. Continuing and increasing assistance from the Massachusetts Congres sional delegation in obtaining funding for vital programs in the Commonwealth. d. Continuing progress is necessary in regards to prescription medica tion monitoring through the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) proces s at the Federal Drug Administration. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 12 Opioid Abuse in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts The rate of substance abuse in the Commonwealth is not a new topic, a nd the widespread abuse of opiates has increased to epidemic levels. Since the mid-1990s the widespread abuse of opiates became evident when substance abuse treatment systems in Massac husetts and several other states were inundated with opiate addicts. Addiction to the powerful painkiller, OxyContin, became evident almost immediately following FDA approval of the dr ug in 1995. In Massachusetts, OxyContin became so widely abused, that the addicti on rate for the drug in Massachusetts increased by 950 percent over the last ten years.5 The problem also became clear from the immediate rise in opioid related hospitalizations in the Commonwealth. I n 2002, Boston had the highest rate of OxyContin related emergency department visits in the country and in 2005, there were more than 18,000 opioid related emergency department hospita lizations and hospital stays.6 Public and private treatment systems have been overwhelmed by the increase in those seeking treatment. Consider this startling statistic. Between 2002 and 2007 the Commonwealth lost 78 soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the same time period, 3,265 Massachu setts residents died of opiate-related overdoses. The Commonwealth is losing men and women on i ts streets at a rate of 42 to 1 to what the state is losing in two wars overseas. From th ese statistics one can see the increasing need for an in-depth look at the public policies surrounding sub stance abuse issues. A tremendous burden has been put on state and local governments, courts, corr ections and hospitals. The state paid almost $200 million in emergency room c osts related to overdoses in 2005, the Massachusetts Department of Corrections is at 143 percent oc cupancy, and the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services, MassHealth and the uncompensated care pool account for more than 75 percent of the dollars spent on substance abuse services in the Commonwealth 7. In fact, private insurance payments for substance abuse treatment decreas ed 11 percent from 1991 to 2001 while public payments increased by 68 percent.8 Addiction is a medical disorder, and we have a public health epidemi c on our hands that is larger than the flu pandemic. If the H1N1 virus killed 3,000 people in a five year period in Massachusetts, the crisis would be center stage and the entire Commonwealth would be working to find a solution to protect the public. However, because of the stigm a surrounding substance abuse, this epidemic is left in the shadows and little light has been put upon reforming the policies involving substance abuse in the Commonwealth. Purpose of the Commission The Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission (\"The Commission\") was established in Chapter 302 Section 56 of the Acts of 2008 by the Massachusetts Stat e Legislature to investigate and study the impact of the OxyContin and heroin epidemic on state and municipal government, the substance abuse treatment system and to identify potential str ategies to more effectively cope with substance use disorders in the Commonwealth. The Commission i s comprised of 14 members; 3 members from the State Senate; 3 members from t he State House of Representatives; 1 member from the Bureau of Substance Abuse Servic es; 1 member from the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association; the chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 13 University of Massachusetts Medical School; 1 member from the tr ial court; 1 member from the Department of Correction; 1 member from the Department of Menta l Health; 1 member from the Department of Community Corrections; and 1 member from the Interage ncy Council on Substance Abuse and Prevention. The Commission was charged, through the enacting legislation, with examining a variety of policy issues as they pertain to substance abuse. Specifically, t he Commission looked at an evaluation of the total direct and indirect cost of substance abuse t o the Commonwealth; the sources of heroin, OxyContin and other prescription opiates available on the street; the number of repeat detoxifications which take place on an annual basis; the numb er of inmates suffering from opiate dependency; and the recidivism rates of those committed in civil commitment programs for abuse of OxyContin or heroin. Secondly, the Commission looke d at policy changes in the following areas: civil commitment laws; long-te rm residential programs that are of at least 90 days; neurobiological impacts that affect the ti me an addicted individual may need to be committed for OxyContin or heroin abuse; an intensive case manage ment system; the establishment of a system of regional secure treatment center s; statutory restrictions on parents and families with adolescents addicted to OxyContin or heroin; enhancem ents to the Commonwealth's prescription monitoring program; and the establishment of an outpatient commitment program. Commission Format From March 2009 through September 2009, the Commission held seven public heari ngs throughout the Commonwealth on a variety of issues pertaining to substa nce abuse. The hearings were held in Boston (2), Salem, Fall River, Pittsfiel d, Worcester, and Hyannis and each focused on a specific area of substance abuse. The Commission heard from the public and private healthcare industries, medical experts, probation and police off icers, unique populations, including the elderly and veterans, treatment coordinators and many addicts, pa rents and family members directly affected by substance use disorders. The public hearings provided the Commission the opportunity to hear from experts from all aspects of substance abuse policy and receive public feedback on where changes can be made to policies in the Commonwealth. Throughout the hearing process the Commission came to know the many int ricacies of this disease and the many pieces that contribute to solving the disease of addiction. The Commission was deeply moved by the overwhelming support that was received t hroughout the hearing process. In addition to the public hearings the Commission met on several occas ions to discuss various aspects of the recommendations.

This report is not meant to be the end of the discussion, but rather the beginning of the next chapter for subst ance abuse policy in Massachusetts. Findings As part of the enacting legislation, the Commission was charged w ith finding data on a variety of issues. This included the following information: \"the number of inmates suffering from opiate dependence; recidivism in the criminal justice system for OxyC ontin and heroin abuse\" as well as \"the total direct and indirect cost to the commonwealth as a r esult of substance abuse; the number of repeat detoxifications on an annual basis; recidivism of thos e committed in civil commitment programs for abuse of OxyContin or heroin.\"9 The following section details the findings of the Commission pursuant to the enacting legislation. The total cost of substance abuse and addiction to the Commonwealth in 2005, the most recent year for which aggregate data is available, was over $4.5 billion, which represented 21.8 percent of the total state budget in 2005. 10 Out of the over $4.5 billion, less than 2 percent, or just over $66 million, was spent on prevention, treatment and research outside of t he money that the state is required to spend. The other 98 percent represents the cost to public programs, which includes spending on justice, education, mental health services, and public safety. Massachusetts ranks in the lower 50 percent of states in terms of spending on prevention, treatment and research. For every $100 the state spends on substance a buse and addiction, only $1.45 goes towards prevention, treatment and research. By comparison, for every $100 the state of Connecticut spends on substance abuse and addiction, over $10 goes towards preve ntion, treatment and research. 11 [A pie chart showing that 1% of Massachusetts' overall state spending is spent on prevention, treatment, and research] [A pie chart showing that 10% of Connecticut's overall state spending is spent on preve ntion, treatment, and research] Hospitalizations/Overdoses in Massachusetts An overdose occurs when excessive use of an opioid requires an individual to seek immediate hospitalization. In 2006, there were 23,369 alcohol and substance abuse relate d hospitalization discharges for non-fatal opioid-related overdoses associated with opioi d abuse, dependence or poisoning. This accounted for 2.93 percent of all hospitalizations in Massa chusetts that year.12 National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.

Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 16 The number of poisoning deaths in Massachusetts increased by 23 percent in 2006 with nearly 65 percent of poisoning deaths associated with opioids. 13 In 2007, 645 Massachusetts residents died from an opioid-related overdose.14 This is a conservative estimate, as often times other causes of death are listed on a death certificate. Acute Treatment Services Acute Treatment Services (ATS) programs, also known as \"detox,\" a re medically monitored detoxification services that provide 24-hour care under the consultation of a medical director to monitor an individual's withdrawal from alcohol and other drugs and alle viate symptoms. 15 In 2007, there were 18,516 individuals admitted to a state-funded ATS program for at least one ATS admission. Most of these individuals\u2014about 64 percent\u2014were admitted to an ATS program just once. However, 202 people entered an ATS treatment progr am over ten times in 2007. The burden of paying for state-funded ATS programs falls under t he Bureau of Substance Abuses Services and MassHealth, with each ATS costing the state around $1,000. Therefore, the total cost to the state from ATS programs in 2007 was over $22 million. 16 [Pie chart shows the number of Acute treatment service admissions. 64% people had one admission, 17% had 2, 8% had 3, 4% had 4, 2% had 5, 1.2% had 6, .8% had 7, .5% had 8, .4% had 9, and .9 had 10 or more.] Substance Abuse Treatment Program Admissions The Department of Public Health's Bureau of Substance Abuse Servi ces keeps data on over 500 substance abuse treatment programs throughout the state, including Acut e Treatment Services (ATS) and post-ATS inpatient and outpatient services. In 2007, there were 105,552 admissions to DPH-funded substance abuse programs in Massachusetts. 17 Of the people admitted, 39 percent reported heroin use in the year prior to admission. 18 Of the 41,850 hospitalized who admitted heroin use in the previous year, 85 percent also reported heroin as thei r primary drug and a majority reported heroin as their reason for seeking treatment. 19 [Line chart shows Admissions to Treatment Facilities in Massachusetts. A ll Admissions to Treatment Facilities in Massachasutts begins at about 25,000 and steadily incr eases until 2002 where they reached 35,000 admissions. From 2004-2007 admissions plateaued around 30,000 - 32,500.] Criminal Justice The impact on the criminal justice system of the Commonwealth is demonstrated by the number of substance abusers in the corrections system, how many crimes a re related to illicit opiate abuse, and the total impact on the judiciary system relating to s ubstance abuse. These crimes burden the Department of Correction, the courts, and public safety agenc ies. The total amount Massachusetts Department of Public Health. \"Substan ce Abuse Services Description. n.d.

Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 17 spent on substance abuse and addiction in the justice system in 2005 was $1.084 billion, which was 5.3 percent of the state budget. 20 [Pie chart showing 5.3 percent of Total State Spending Spending is Criminal Justic e Spending] Corrections In Massachusetts today over 200,000 adults, or nearly one in twenty four, a re under some kind of correctional supervision, including prison, jail, parole or probation. 21 Research has shown that 80 percent of offenders nationwide are either addicted to alcohol or drugs , or alcohol or drugs were involved in the commission of the crime. 22 Therefore, it can be established that up to 150,000 offenders in the Commonwealth have a substance abuse issue or are in correctional supervision because of their past substance abuse. The total cost to the Commonwe alth on substance abuse for adult corrections in 2005 was $810 million, over four percent of the state budget that year .23 Judiciary The total cost to the judiciary on substance abuse and addiction was $168 million in 2005.24 The impact on the judicial system on substance abuse and addiction cases i nvolves criminal, drug, family and juvenile courts. This includes personnel, contracted services and administration costs. Incorporated in the total cost to the judiciary are cases in which arrestees t ested positive for drugs or reported recent drug or alcohol abuse, had previously been in a trea tment program or were in need of treatment, and cases that were linked to substance abuse in other ways. 25 Crime Under Massachusetts law, heroin and other opiates are classified as Class A substances. 26 According to the Massachusetts Sentencing Commission's Survey of S entencing Practices, 1,705 offenders were convicted for an offense involving a Class A substanc e. Out of these offenders, 771 were convicted of distributing and 934 were convicted of possessing a Class A substanc e. 27 MassHealth The impact of opiate abuse on MassHealth relates to the number of members who receive drug therapy, in the form of methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone and Subutex). In a ddition to the cost of drug therapy, MassHealth's annual expenditures relating to opiate abuse include hospitalizations, transportation, and physician services. The following data represent total Medicaid costs, including expenditures from the Medicaid Managed Care partner orga nizations. The number of MassHealth members who received any methadone or bupre norphine in fiscal year 2007 was 18,102. 28 The total annual expenditures for members receiving methadone and for buprenorphine was $276.2 million and $49 million, respectively, for a total expenditure for National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.

Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 18 drug therapy of over $325 million. 29 Out of the 13,951 members who received methadone in fiscal year 2007, over 40 percent (6,240) received twelve continuous months of methadone, at a cost of over $91 million. 30 The average cost per member for methadone was $19,799 and for buprenorphine was $11,820. 31 Municipalities - City of Boston As the largest municipality in the Commonwealth, the City of Bost on serves as an excellent illustration of how the substance abuse epidemic impacts the servic es and budgets of large cities. The large population of Boston provides a data set that enables the Comm ission to gauge the impact of substance abuse on a densely populated city. Furthermore, in recent years Boston has been one of the Commonwealth's epicenters of illicit OxyContin and heroin abuse. This increase correlates to a spike in hospitalization and mortality rates. From 1999-2007 the mortality rate surrounding substance abuse increased 77.3 percent.32 The Drug Unit of the Boston Police Department (BPD) tracks of the number of sam ples of illegal controlled substances that are obtained by officers through arrests and controlled buys. These samples are submitted to a laboratory that determines the type of substance. The number of heroin seizures made by the BPD in 2008 was 1,099 and the number of OxyCodone seizures was 247. 33 Opiate abuse also has a significant effect in the daily work of Boston's Emergency Medical Services (EMS). The cost transporting of a patient to a hospita l is difficult to quantify given the level of service needed, either basic life support or advanced l ife support, and the possibility that two units respond to the same incident. In 2008, Boston EMS personnel spent over 140 hours responding to heroin-related incidents, with 117 basic life support response s and 86 advanced life support responses. 34 The total charge for the basic and advanced responses are $935 and $1,870 respectively, so the total cost to the city on EMS relating to heroin in 2008 was $270,215. 35 State Workforce While not originally required from the enacting language, this dat a contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of substance abuse and addiction in Massachusett s. Substance abuse and addiction have a significant negative impact on the stat e's workforce. Employees with drug or alcohol problems are more likely to miss work, be involved in w orkplace accidents, file workers' compensation claims, and are 33 percent less productive than their non-abusing coworkers. Nationally, it is estimated that productivity loss due to substance abuse was close to $15 billion in 2000. 36 In 2005, it is estimated that the Commonwealth spent $21.37 million on state workforce costs relating to substance abuse and addiction. 37 [Bar chart showing Projections of National Costs Due to Drug Abuse is Steadily increasing.] Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 19 Recommendations The following section outlines the twenty issue areas for which t he Commission recommends policy changes. Throughout the public hearing process these core issue ar eas were brought up on numerous occasions and therefore represent the most important area s for policy change. The Commission feels that by utilizing multiple aspects of these s olutions the most effective outcomes can be achieved. National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. S hoveling Up II: The Impact of Substance Abuse on Federal, State and Local Budget s . May 2009. Print. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 20 Regulations A variety of changes in regulations have been proposed to improve t he services the state provides and give better insight to various under-monitored areas of subst ance abuse regulation. It is the hope of the Commission that through the Commonwealth's regulat ory process many policy changes can occur in a manner that enables state agencies the greatest flexibility and control. These regulatory changes include improving the prescription monitoring program (PMP), which entails expanding the schedule medications that are m onitored and allowing physicians and law enforcement to access the valuable information that the PMP can provide; requiring those administering prescriptions which may include pres cription opioids to use tamper-resistant prescription pads, ensuring that doctors can mor e safely administer medications and save the Commonwealth millions of dollars in prescription fraud; re quire pain management training for all doctors, nurses, physician's assistants and dentis ts; preventing overdose deaths with limited liability legislation and requiring that should a minor overdose and be taken to a hospital, that their parents be informed of the overdose and provided wi th information about seeking treatment. Massachusetts Prescription Monitoring Program A consistent theme at the Commission's hearings was the failure of the Massachusetts Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) to be an effective resource to combat the opiate epidemic. The opiate crisis in Massachusetts is largely fuele d by the misuse of prescription medication; to this end the Commission analyzed the variety of wa ys that legally manufactured pharmaceuticals end up being used for illegitimate purposes. In almos t every case of the ways which these medications reach the street, the PMP could have acted as a preventat ive measure. One of the most apparent uses of the PMP as a resource to cut off access to these dangerous prescription opiates is ending the deceptive practice of \"doctor shopping\" by addicts. Doctor shopping, or pharmacy shopping, is a common practice among those addicted t o opiates; whereby drug seeking individuals target doctors who are known to be bus y or sympathetic, or visit multiple doctors and pharmacies until the addict has the desire d prescription filled. Doctor Carol Bates, Primary Care Program Director at Beth Isra el Deaconess Medical Center, said in testimony regarding updates to the PMP: \"There is a strong sense across teaching institutions that we s ee a flood of drug seeking patients - particularly in July when new interns arrive in tr aining. Drug seekers are knowledgeable about the healthcare system and often target those with the least experience... Programs in other states with complete registry informati on have been highly effective. As I understand it, there have been no example s of breach of confidentiality or inappropriate access to systems in those state s that have complete registry provider access.\"38 While it is impossible to completely end the misuse of prescript ion medication, drastically reducing the flow of these drugs so that they are not as prevalent in communities across the Commonwealth is an attainable goal. One of the most efficient w ays at the state level to stop Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 21 fraud, and reduce the availability of dangerous prescription drugs on the street, is an active and useful PMP. For the past decade while Massachusetts has been f aced with a prescription drug crisis, at the same time, our PMP system has fallen behind other states. The lack of attention to its status, and utilization of this program, has further enabled t his epidemic to flourish unchecked. For these reasons, the resuscitation of the PMP is one of the most promising recommendations of this Commission and we believe its proper administr ation will be a tremendous asset going forward. The state's inability to use this system to intervene in cl ear cases of prescription drug abuse, to reduce the frequency of \"doctor shopping\" or use data from this progr am to target resources is, perhaps, one of the greater tragedies in this decade long struggle with opiate abuse. The lack of dedicated resources to the Commonwealth's PMP continued across se veral administrations and, as a result, cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. The PMP is funded in part by the Massachusetts Drug Control Program and by federal grants and is assigned one half of a full- time employee for its administration. Through several administrations the program lacked staffing and was ignored as fraudulent prescriptions and prescription overdose death rose at alarming ra tes. In addition to being a preventative tool for public health officials, the PMP presents an opportunity for the state to prevent Medicaid fraud and keep close track of its spending on this cla ss of pharmaceuticals, on which Massachusetts spends millions of dollars each year. Background on Prescriptions Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) A Prescriptions Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) is an electronic database managed by the state to collect data on substances prescribed within the state. T he database management and reporting structure is housed in a specific state agency, gener ally a law enforcement or public health agency. The responsible agency will send notifications, report s and information to specific groups or individuals authorized by the state to receive this informat ion. This data may be relayed to a patient, medical practice, or law enforcement agency. According to a report by the National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws (NAMSDL) a PDMP may serve multiple purposes, including: To support access to legitimate medical use of controlled substances. To help identify and deter or prevent drug abuse and diversion. To facilitate and encourage the identification, intervention with and treatment of persons addicted to prescription drugs. To help inform public health initiatives through outlining of use and abuse trends. To help educate individuals about PDMPs and the use, abuse and diversion of an addiction to prescription drugs. 39 The Massachusetts Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) was deve loped in 1992 through a joint regulation of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) Drug Control Program (DCP) and the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy ( Board) with funding from a Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 22 federal grant.40 The program uses a computer-based, electronic data transfer (ED T) system to collect prescription data. Medical Review Groups (MRG's) compri sed of practitioners and pharmacists provide peer review of the medical data and assist the Drug Control Program in reviewing data for release to law enforcement and regulatory agencies. The Massachusetts Prescriptions Drug Monitoring Program was deve loped in 1992 through The Mass PMP receives data on all Schedule II controlled substances di spensed by Massachusetts community pharmacies and Massachusetts registered hospital outpatie nt and clinic pharmacies. Information is sent through an electronic data transmission (EDT) through a third party vendor, Atlantic Associates Inc. The information is analyzed by the De partment to look for prescribing and dispensing trends, and to provide case information to regulatory and law enforcement agencies concerning drug distribution and potential diversion.\"41 In FY2008 3.3 million Schedule II prescriptions were monitored by the Mas sachusetts PMP. 42 Reports are provided to authorized end users (regulatory boards, state a nd federal law enforcement); however they are not available for prescribers or pharmacies to research their client base. Some of the types of diversion cases reviewed by Mas sachusetts PMP include illicit prescribing, doctor shopping, forgery and pharmacy diversion. Additionall y, pharmacies and registered health care facilities are required to submit a monthly report to Atlantic Associates. 43 [Line chart showing prescriptions of schedule II Opioids is Steadily Incr easing beginning in 1996 at $750,000 to around $2 million in 2007] This reporting structure means that the information being used to ana lyze reports is 3-4 weeks old, limiting the ability for law enforcement agencies investiga te potential illegal behavior. The most egregious failures of the Commonwealth's PMP may well be Dr. Michael Brown, a Cape Cod Doctor who practiced in Sandwich. According to evidence presented to t he Board of Registration in Medicine, Dr. Brown was the single leading pres criber of OxyContin in the entire state, with his prescriptions accounting for 288,859 of the 922,985 OxyContin t ablets filled through pharmacies in 2004. If the PMP was operating as an active bureau processing incoming data in real-time, an analyst working at the PMP would have im mediately recognized this disproportionate trend and provided notices to law enforcement. The Prescription Monitoring Program's records show that Brown, an i nternist working alone in Sandwich, prescribed about 1.7 percent of the OxyContin prescribed in the state in 2004. The 144,435 tablets of the narcotic he prescribed in the first six months of this year led the state's doctors by a wide margin. Although monitors collect information on more than 2 million prescriptions for potentially addictive drugs each year, they rare ly release information about individual doctors unless police or regulators request it - and then only if a panel of doctors and pharmacists agrees that release of information will not unfairl y raise suspicions. Dr. Brown's case highlights the gap in the prescription drug monitoring system.44 One of the most compelling stories the Commission heard was a mot her from Pittsfield who testified about her daughter's struggle with prescription drugs a fter being legitimately prescribed Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH). D rug Control Program. Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) Handbook for the Pharmacist and Pharm acy Software Provider. 16 Sept. 2008. Print. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 23 painkillers. Her story is a prime example of both the nature of this disease, and the failures of the prescription monitoring system. In several instances, the daugh ter went to multiple pharmacies and doctors that prescribed her opiates, each doctor and pharm acy not knowing she was receiving prescriptions from multiple sources. In this case the PMP should have been a preventative tool, to both stop the fraudulent prescriptions and call her addiction and multiple prescriptions to the attention of her health care providers. Unfortunat ely, the young woman is no longer with us. Comparison Programs Two examples of progressive, gold standard PMP programs exist in the Kentucky and Connecticut models. These programs provide real-time, online access to their data for several groups of stakeholders, and have demonstrated their ability to effect ively monitor and intervene with illegal prescription drug use. Kentucky, similarly impacted by a prescription drug epidemic, c reated Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting (KASPER) in 1999. KASPER is a PMP that has set a high standard for effectiveness. While Kentucky is able to collect and update data from prescription monitoring every 8 days, the Massachusetts PMP updates data once a month. The Kentucky program has some 5,500 requests for reports every month while Massachus etts averages 10 requests per month. Of the requests in Kentucky, 92 percent are from prescribers, as compared to Massachusetts where 61 percent of requests come from law enf orcement and 30 percent from licensing boards. 45 The Kentucky program can provide doctors and police agencies with infor mation on suspected prescription-drug abusers within 24 hours.46 Kentucky's program, which is being used as a model for other states, has been successful because it includes privacy protections and tracks all scheduled prescriptions that can be addictive or misused. The effective ness of this program can be seen in the ability for several stakeholders to use the data i mmediately in order to limit the ability for people to mis-prescribe, or to abuse the prescription medication. Kentucky has implemented KASPER trend data reporting and anal ysis to produce Geographic Information System (GIS) maps identifying controlled substance us age along with increases and decreases over time by geographic area. These reports are i ntended to provide a tool for the licensure boards and law enforcement to identify where they need to focus investigative resources. The trend reports will also provide a tool to increase t he awareness of health care providers about potential problems with controlled substances in selected geographic areas. Similar to the Kentucky program the Connecticut PMP, which went into effect on 2008, requires pharmacies to submit their orders for all Schedule II - V prescri ptions. The Connecticut PMP is a web-based application that allows prescribers and pharmacists to access a patient's prescription information online. As a safety measure these licensed healthcare professionals must register for access to the database by supplying the PMP with the appropriate credentials prior to receiving any patient information.47 The website is accessible 24/7, and in many cases a patient re port can be viewed in a matter of seconds. The report data is based on inform ation submitted by the dispensing pharmacy. The information in a report can alert a physic ian or a law enforcement Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 24 group to the number/times a prescription has been filled for a patient , as well as who prescribed the prescription. This real-time information allows for physicians and law enforcement agencies to monitor, and quickly react to the individual abuse of prescription drugs . Effective management and monitoring of this information can limit the amount of n arcotics in the market, as well as limit access points for illegally obtaining the drugs. Many states would like to see the integration of a national progr am, which would create a standard model for reporting, and use of this data. The success that s tates are having with the tracking systems has led advocates to push for a national system that would link together the states' databases. A national program would deter individuals from cros sing state lines to fill prescriptions in other states. The Commission recommends that the Massachusetts Prescription Mo nitoring Program be overhauled so that it is a useful resource for the many state agencies, and non-governmental entities that have a stake in the careful monitoring of pharmace utical distribution. This system must be a real-time database; prescribers should have the most information at their disposal when making decisions relevant to pain management. Law enforcement and state accounting agencies should have access to these records to detect patterns of fraud and i llegal activity. Public health officials must be able to use this data to target state resour ces to combat startling rates of addiction. If the technology must be updated for this to occur, it would be money t hat would almost be immediately recouped by the state in savings. New York, aft er implementing an active PMP in conjunction with serial prescription pads, realized a 500 percent savings in their health care accounts. While improvements in the ability to access this data is important, the role of the PMP must be redefined. A culture change and redefinition of the role of the PMP is nec essary to make this a worthwhile program. The structure of how the information gathered by the PMP is disseminated appears to be one of the primary obstacles for. While ideally this program shoul d be housed at the Department of Public Health, many other states run their PMPs out of the Board of Pharmacy, or in the Attorney General or Inspector General's offices. The structure of how the data is processed should also be re-evaluated; the current system is ent irely too restrictive and does not provide any entity, aside from the medical review group, with the requisite inf ormation. The flow of information must be streamlined, and the current bottlene cks in the system must be removed. Staffing this system must also be made a priority by the Department of Public Health. Currently, the PMP acts as a repository for information with fe w examples of usefully investigatory or analytical activity. For the PMP to be a use ful tool for the Commonwealth, the PMP must be more than that, changes need to be made so that the P MP actively provides information to the many entities that find this data critical. The reinvention of the PMP represents an opportunity for this state to make a practical and immediate change for the better. A substantive reform of the Mass achusetts Prescription Monitoring Program is one of this Commission's highest priority recom mendations for immediate action that has the ability to make a worthwhile impact on the opiate e pidemic. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 25 Pain Management Training and Education Studies show that nationally, fewer than 40 percent of physicians re ceive any type of pain management training in medical school. 48 This includes training indentifying prescription drug abuse, proper prescribing methods and drug diversion. According to Dr . Nathanial Katz, Director of Program on Opioids Risk Managements at Tufts Univers ity School of Medicine, \"many specific prescription opioid fatal overdoses and cases of ad diction are linked to prescribing errors, primarily prescribing to patients at high r isk of abuse and addiction, and failure to monitor for adverse outcomes.\" According to national da ta from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 17 percent of individuals abusing pres cription drugs received them from one doctor. This is more than those who bought the drug off a fri end or relative, stole the drug from a friend or relative and bought the drug from a dealer combined. [Pie Chart: Source of Pain Relievers for Non-Medical Use. 60% Free from fr iend or relative, 17% from one doctor, 7% from other source, 4% bought from dealer, 4% took from friend or relative without asking, 8% bought from friend or relative.] The Commission believes that educating our doctors, dentists, physician's assis tants, nurses and pharmacists is a major tool in fighting the legal prescription dru g abuse trade. Given the increased need for pain management and abuse training, the Commissi on recognizes three areas of improvement for the Commonwealth. 1. Continued support of the use and development of evidence-based educational materials for teachers, law enforcement and other health professionals. 2. Improved training on the identification and intervention of prescription and illicit drug abuse. 3. Improved pharmacy training on the identification of prescription drug abuse and the security measures necessary to deter such abuse. Continued support of the use and development of evidence-based educational mater ials for teachers, law enforcement and other health professionals. The Bureau of Substance Abuse Services has developed a pocket-sized g uide for clinicians, \"Opioid Analgesics and Stimulant Medications: A Clinician Guide t o Prevent Misuse.\" It contains screening tools for adults and adolescents, points for prescr ibing medications and counseling patients, and further clinical resources. It has been sent to physicians across the Commonwealth. Over 3,000 of these guides have been distributed, primaril y to prescribers of these medicines. The Commission recommends that the Bureau prepare an updated guide for re- distribution. These materials should address substance abuse prevention, the warni ng signs of drug abuse and methods of intervention and identification of treatment r esources available to consumers across the Commonwealth.

Office of Applied St udies, NSDUH Series H-30, DHHS Publication No. SMA 06- 4194. Rockville, MD. Web. 22 Oct. 2009. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 26 Improved training on the identification and intervention of prescription and illi cit drug abuse. The Commonwealth should take steps to ensure that Massachusetts phy sicians who prescribe narcotic medications receive substantive training in: 1) effective pain management, 2) identification of patients at high risk for substance abuse, and 3) other aspects of drug abuse. DPH and the Board of Registration in Medicine should work closely to gether to further develop effective strategies to ensure that physicians are properly and effect ively trained. Clinician training should be targeted to individuals with identified nee ds to ensure the most effective, focused and meaningful programs as well as the most efficient use of resources. The professional Boards of Registration (e.g., Medicine, Dentistry, Podi atry, Veterinary Medicine, Nursing and Physician Assistants) have the authority as well as the infrast ructure and expertise to oversee clinical practice issues, including training requirements. The Commission recommends that the Department of Public Health (DPH) work through the Presc ription Monitoring Program Advisory Council, which includes the professional Boards of Registration, to identify ways to improve information sharing and coordination that will assist the Boards in targeting programs to improve clinical skills assessment, pain management, drug diversion, a nd abuse. In 2004, the Board of Registration in Medicine adopted the Federation of State Me dical Boards' Model Policy for the Use of Controlled Substances for the Treatment of Pain, which is a communication to physicians on the best practices for safely prescribing pain medications. Continuing education courses are presented many times each year at various locations throughout the Commonwealth. Moreover, DPH has proposed regulations to authorize providing clinicians w ith prescription monitoring information to help them identify their patients' potential diversion or harmful use of Schedule II pain medications through an online prescription monitoring da ta system. DPH is developing guidelines to help clinicians reduce opportunities for drug d iversion and increase prevention of and facilitate intervention in drug addiction and abuse. At present there is no mechanism to mandate prescriber training a s a condition of obtaining a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Controlled Substance Regi stration Certificate. Similarly, by current statute the Massachusetts Controlled Subs tances Practitioner Registration issued by DPH provides no basis to mandate prescriber training. Whi le the Massachusetts professional Boards of Registration mandate continuing education as a basis for licensure, the Boards do not require specific training in this area, and are reluct ant to embark on a precedent of mandating focal training for all practitioners. Any new mandate for training would likely require legislative action in the form of a statute or regulation. The Commission also recommends that opportunities for encouraging voluntary prescriber education should also be pursued. For example, collaboration between the profe ssional Boards of Registration, the Department of Public Health and the Universi ty of Massachusetts Medical School could result in a web-based training curriculum for physicians and dentists which could provide free risk management Continuing Medical Education. Such a resource , if well-designed and publicized, could result in a significant number of prescribers rec eiving targeted training in the absence of any mandate for a relatively modest appropriation. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 27 Improved pharmacy training on the identification of prescription drug abuse and the security measures necessary to deter such abuse. The Board of Registration in Pharmacy should consider developing a re quired course as an integral part of the continuing education requirements for pharmacis ts who store, distribute and dispose of drugs subject to abuse. Both pharmacies and pharmacist s licensed by the Board of Registration in Pharmacy (the Board) are mandated to maintain strict security controls of all prescription medications ordered, received and dispensed, in accordance wi th deferral and state statutory and regulatory requirements. The Board provides training to pharmacists regarding security requirements as part of the continuing education course curri culum present on multiple dates and at various locations throughout the Commonwealth each year. Phar macists complete coursework in these areas as part of the school of pharmacy curric ulum. To qualify for licensure as a pharmacist in the Commonwealth, individuals must successfully complete the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination that includes federal and Massa chusetts laws and regulations on the topics. The Commission recommends that the Board revi se 247 CMR sections pertaining to the Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) that apply to the dispensing of controlled substances by pharmacists when the revisions currentl y proposed to the PMP regulations are promulgated to reduce opportunities for drug diversion and facilitate intervention. In addition, the Drug Control Program (DCP), in cooperati on with the Board, will develop training programs and materials for pharmacists to implem ent the proposed amendments. The training will include guidance on utilization of PMP information to assist patients with potential Schedule II pain medication problems and faci litate prevention of and interventions with drug addiction and abuse. The DCP will also cooperate with the Board on the development of information on dispensing, storage and disposal of controlled substances to reduce opportunities for drug diversion. Tamper-Resistant Prescription Pads Currently in Massachusetts, there are far too many ways for individuals who have not lawfully been prescribed OxyContin to obtain it. An individual could unlawfully obt ain the drug, buy it on the street, or obtain a prescription for the drug by presenting a fraudulent prescription at a pharmacy. Fraudulent prescriptions have become a growing problem in the Commonwealth since the advent of OxyContin and other strong prescription pain medica tions. Three basic categories of false prescriptions exist. The f irst is writing a fraudulent prescription on a legitimate prescription pad\u2014an individual might steal a doctor 's prescription pad and then, at a later time, write a prescription. The second is writi ng a forged prescription on a counterfeit prescription pad\u2014an individual might copy a legitimate prescription written for them by a doctor and manipulate it in such a way to create a forged prescription pad on which they are then able to write counterfeit prescriptions. Lastly, is altering a legit imate prescription to increase the quantity, dosage or to add an additional drug. 49 50 51 It should be made clear that falsified prescriptions are not sol ely related to abuse from OxyContin. Instead, the issue of fraudulent prescriptions is one that af fects all drugs which have off-label uses (illegal and otherwise). The issue then is how t he Commonwealth can eliminate the ability of people to obtain drugs and therapies without legitimate medical need .52 Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 28 One solution to eliminating the number of fraudulent prescriptions is ine xpensive and would not require a complete redesign of the current prescription drug deli very system. The creation of a tamper-resistant prescription pad program would allow Massachusett s to take action toward limiting the abuse of all three types of prescription fraud without having to eliminate written prescriptions and move toward a web-based prescription program. The Com mission believes that the implementation of such a program has the ability to dram atically cut the number of fraudulent prescriptions that are filled in the Commonwealth each year. Many states such as New York have implemented such programs and are seeing great success. Additionally, tamper-resistant prescription pads are already requi red by the federal government in order for Medicaid to reimburse patients and states for the cos t of prescription drugs. Starting on October 1, 2008 all written, non-electronic prescriptions were require d to contain at least three tamper-resistant features, one from each of the three ba seline characteristics outlined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in order for Medicaid to reimburse. A \"regular\" prescription pad may include the name of the doctor's pra ctice; the doctor's address and telephone number; the name of the patient to whom the drug or the rapy is being prescribed; the date the prescription was written; perhaps the address of the patients; whether the prescription maybe refilled (and how many times); and, space is also provided for the prescribing medical professional to write the name and dosage of the drug bei ng prescribed and to sign the prescription. These pads are not regulated, except in the case of Medicaid prescriptions and a doctor may print them him/herself. A tamper-resistant prescript ion pad, on the other hand, is essentially the same as a \"regular\" prescription pad save the paper that has been used to produce the pad itself and the addition of several security features. Fir st, instead of being normal copy paper the tamper resistant pad has been made of special paper which is resistant to erasures and alterations. This means that a prescription cannot be amended to increase the dosage or to increase the number of renewals available to the patients. Additi onally, a tamper-resistant prescription pad is also printed in such a way that an individual is unabl e to photocopy the prescription for duplication. This is done much in the same way tha t bank checks are protected against photocopied reproductions. Finally, a tamper-resistant presc ription pad has a security back print.53 54 55 56 57 As stated above, New York recently adopted a tamper-resistant pres cription pad program. The New York program requires that all prescriptions for controlled subst ances be written on official New York State prescription pads, which contain tamper-resistant fe atures, and that no exemptions to this rule may exist. Additionally, under the New Y ork State program prescriptions for non-controlled substances must also adhere to strict requirements. In order to be accepted a prescription for a non-controlled drug must either be written on an official New York State pad, or it must be written on a facility's own pres cription pad with a facility label affixed to it. 58 A facility label is a label on which a bar code has been print ed that contains facility specific information readable by a computer. In addit ion, a facility label also contains safeguard which protect against the production of fraudulent labels in or der to authenticate an illegitimate prescription. 59 For example, an authentic facility label in New York State contains a light blue pharmacist test area on the right side of the label, slight perforations along all sides of the label which prevent the label from being easily removed once it has been affixed to a Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 29 prescription, and the labels are individually serialized in the sam e way as official prescriptions. A New York style program would benefit Massachusetts greatly by minimizing the illegitimate prescriptions and standardizing the prescription pad system in the Commonwealth. [Image showing a photocopied prescription pad where VOID appears throughout] [Text Box: The word VOID appears on the prescription if it has been copied, scanned, or physically or chemically erased. The Pharmacist Test Area on the front of the prescription is heat -sensitive ink and the color will change from blue to light blue or transparent when rubbed. The Secure Standard Register on the back of the prescription is heat -sensitive ink and the color will change from orange to yellow when rubbed.] Implementing a tamper-resistant prescription pad program would allow additional safeguards to be built into the prescription delivery system without incurring major additional expense or creating a major disruption to the system while significantly limiting prescription fraud and saving the Commonwealth millions of dollars in counterfeit prescript ion costs. A sound policy such as this would provide Massachusetts with yet another tool to comba t prescription drug abuse and curb this dangerous epidemic. Preventing Overdose Deaths with Limited Liability L egislation From 1990 to 2006, the Massachusetts age-adjusted poison death rate more than doubled from 5.6 to 14.9 per 100,000 residents. Almost 65 percent of Massachusetts' poisoning de aths in 2006 were caused by opiate overdoses.60 Many of these deaths could have been prevented if the opioid abuser had received proper emergency medical services. Researc h shows that only 15 percent of fatal overdoses result in instant death, meaning that man y lives could be saved if people who overdose receive prompt medical attention.61 The fear of arrest and prosecution often keeps opioid abusers from calling authorities when a friend or family member overdoses. Recent studies indicate that over half of the drug users interviewed did not call 911 during an overdose for fear that the polic e would prosecute them for illegally using drugs.62 Many of these deaths could be avoided if Good Samaritan legislati on were enacted in the Commonwealth. A Good Samaritan law would provide limited immunity from drug possession charges and prosecution when a drug-related overdos e witness or victim calls for medical attention. The law would not however, protect people from prosecution from offenses other than possession of illegal drugs when calling 911, no r would it protect individuals with outstanding warrants against them or those who interfere with law enforcement procedures to secure crime scenes. New Mexico was the first state to enact limited immunity l egislation in 2007 and has seen very positive results. Several other states - Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinoi s, Nebraska, New York, Rhode Island - are considering similar bills. Many colleges and universit ies around the country have New York State. Department of Health. Bureau of Nar cotic Enforcement; Pharmacy Update , Winter 2008. Web. 19 Oct. 2009. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 30 also led the way on this issue by including limited liability pol icies for their student population. Currently, at least 91 schools in the country have implemented a Good S amaritan policy for alcohol or drug abuse.63 A recent study showed that after Cornell University implement ed a medical amnesty protocol, calls for emergency medical servic es for alcohol-related incidents increased. 64 The Commission recommends that the Commonwealth enact a sensible limited liability law similar to New Mexico's that will be effective in decreasi ng the number of overdose deaths. The Commission also recognizes the need to include language that will ensure that offenders will not be able to exploit the law to evade prosecution and that it will only apply to potentially fatal situations. The implementation of this law will also require a si gnificant effort to educate the public on the components of the law. Educating the public on these laws wi ll enable the Commonwealth to prevent many senseless and preventable overdose deaths. Overdose Prevention for Minors The Commission believes that parents should be given the right to know w hen their child has an overdose. Many parents told the Commission that when their child exper ienced an overdose and was taken to the hospital they were never notified. Under current s tatutes and regulations, minors can check themselves out of the hospital and a parent may never be informed. This has obvious consequences for both the minor and parent and leads to a complete brea kdown in communication. Currently, if a minor is caught under the influence of drugs or alcohol in a public space, such as a park, a police officer is required to retur n that minor to the custody of their legal guardian. However, if a minor is admitted to a hos pital with the symptoms of an overdose, they can be released from the hospital on their own accord and no notice is given to the minor's legal guardian. Healthcare providers have the right to report to parents; however, most do not follow that protocol and as a result parents are never info rmed of their child's life threatening disease. There appears to be significant inconsistenc ies in the ways in which we handle overdoses of minors. While there are issues with patient/doctor confidentiality, the Commission believes that parents do have a right to know if their minor has experienced an overdose. The Commission urges that legislation be enacted to mandate that hospitals report to parents in the event of a minor overdose and enable parents to take the necessary steps to seek treatment for their child. This is not meant to deter young adults from seeking proper medical treatment, but provide parents with a tool that they cannot currently use. Currentl y, 75 percent of colleges and universities in the Commonwealth have policies in place that require that school officials notify parents in the event of a student receiving medical attention or any illegal activity that occurs on a college campus. Including such a regulation in the Commonwealth woul d allow for intervention by parents, enabling them to take the action necessary to help their chi ld. Case Management It is widely accepted in the mental health profession that case management is necessary to assist individuals in moving through the complex treatment process. The same can be said of the substance abuse field and the need for intensive case management in a constantly changing, Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 31 difficult to navigate and complex system. Case management coul d provide some of the necessary supports to assist individuals with substance use disorders in moving through a difficult process with many obstacles. The Commission recommends that the Commonwealth further investigate the state's capabilities to provide case m anagement services to individuals identified with a substance use disorder and ensure that the case ma nagement provided in the Commonwealth includes the framework provided below various established programs. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAM HSA) defines case management as \"a set of social service functions that helps clients access the resources they need to recover from a substance abuse problem.\" 65 It is understood that effective case management is comprised of (1) assessment, (2) planning, (3) linkage, (4) monitor ing, and (5) advocacy. 66 Clinical practice and empirical observation suggest that individuals with substance use disorders who seek treatment have significant exterior issues in addition t o using psychoactive substances. In addition to substance use disorders, individuals often suffer from addit ional health issues including liver disease, HIV/AIDS, and strains of hepatitis. Furt her, they may have problems with procuring housing, employment, and difficulty in their relati onships.67 68 When combined, these additional problems can exacerbate the underlying substance us e disorder. The principal goal of case management is to keep an individual in effective tr eatment for the desired length of time. By focusing on the whole individual, case management allows fo r the external issues to be handled in combination with treatment, providing better long-term outcomes for the individual. The Commission understands the role that case management plays in e ffective treatment, and believes that in order for case management to be effective, it m ust cross all agencies and allow the case manager to fully encompass all areas, including, housing , employment, medical, health insurance and substance use disorder treatment. Further, all agencie s must be willing to work together for the common goal. SAMHSA along with the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment provides the necessary framework upon which for the Commonwealth to model a success ful case management program. Given that many managed care organizat ions reimburse for case management services, the Commonwealth should be able to combine this f unding with that of competitive federal block grants through SAMHSA. Positive results have been seen in mental health and children's menta l health services that involve intensive case management and the same results are possible with substance abuse issues in the Commonwealth. Additionally, various treatment providers in the Com monwealth have implemented a model of case management within their pain management and addicti on treatment programs. Berkshire Health Systems (BHS), operating in Berkshire County, provides comprehensive health services in western Massachusetts. The BHS Pain Management Initiative includes inclusive case management and combines the \"effort of he althcare providers, substance abuse specialists and members of law enforcement and the court sys tem, designed to address the twin goals of improving chronic pain management services and combating dr ug diversion and misuse in the Berkshires.\"69 The program has received acclaim for this innovative model which combines interagency services to patients seeking treatment for chronic pain with prescription pain medication and patients who have become addicted and are seeking tre atment for their substance use disorder. Their model relies on the coordination with mul tiple disciplines to best facilitate treatment for their patients. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 32 [Image is a flow chart showing Berkshire County Community Pain Management Pr oject at the center of Pain Providers, Mental health Providers, Emergency medicine Provi ders, Primary Care Providers, Community Partners, Academic Partners, Regulatory Agencies: M A DPH, and Criminal Justice all communicating with each other] [Bar chart showing Average Monthly healthcare Costs to Individuals Pre Trea tment and One Year After Starting Treatment.

Individuals who were enroll ed in the program for one year have seen dramatic decreases in healthcare costs, e specially in the area of behavioral health visits. Case management is a cost saving tool. Individuals who are enrolled i n a program providing case management have fewer multiple detoxifications, relapses a nd unnecessary treatment. Connecticut provides a good program model through their Targeted Case Management (TCM) Services. TCM Services are determined by \"persistent substa nce dependence as evidenced by one or more of the disorders indicated below as defined by the current edition of the DS M and by a history of multiple unsuccessful treatment episodes.\" 70 The Connecticut program provides diagnosis, treatment and follow up for individuals who have not responded to pre vious treatments, such as multiple detoxifications or outpatient care. In one year the case management program in Connecticut saw a 66 percent decrease in the total number o f days that residential detoxifications were used.71 The Commission recommends that a model, such as the one Connecticut or Berkshire Health Systems provides, be examined for poss ible application in the treatment model in the Commonwealth. It is the hope of the Commission that this tool woul d not only save money but provide more comprehensive services for those suf fering from substance use disorders.

Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 33 Mandated coverage for substance abuse and mental health disorders has bee n an issue in state legislatures since the 1970s. 72 California was the first to pass legislation regarding menta l illness in 1974, followed by 32 other states in the past 30 years. 73 There are two generally mandated types of state legislated insurance coverage. Mandated offerin g, which required that a plan offered in the state must treat physical and mental illness es the same only if the insurance company offers coverage for those specific ailments in a given he alth care plan. 74 Mandated benefits on the other hand provides that coverage for mental and substance use disorders be complete and that minimum inpatient and outpatient coverage is specifi ed by the state. It was not until 2001 that the Commonwealth recognized any form of substance use disorders as a form of mental health and required mandated benefits from the insurance indus try. 75 Prior to the passage of the updated mental health parity laws of 2001, alcoholism and mental and nervous conditions were the only conditions covered under the mandated benefits mode l. 76 To Massachusetts's credit, the state is one of only nine states t hat have adopted parity statutes for substance use disorders. 77 The Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the use of limi ts on substance abuse treatment has steadily increased since the 1980s, when such data began to be tracke d. 78 According to the survey, in 1988, less than 60 percent of insured workers in medium and large firms were subject to limits on impatient treatment. 79 By 2002, 89 percent of workers insured through medium and large firms had limits placed on their inpatient treatment for substance abuse. 80 This dramatic decrease in services, coupled with the increase in deductibles, have negatively affected the treatment of individuals suffering from substance use disorders, even as federal and state laws have attempted to increase benefits, end discrimination for substance use disorders and reduce costs for those seeking both inpatient and outpatient treatment. In this rapidly changing system, health insurance companies are m oving to a \"carve-out\" system to provide mental health and substance abuse services. \"Carve-outs, the management of mental health care by firms that are legally and administratively s eparate from the firm managing general medical care, have become common in both the public and private health care sectors.\"81 Currently in Massachusetts the top insurance providers, including MassH ealth, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Tufts Health Plan and Fal lon Community Health, contract their mental health and substance abuse services out to United Beha vioral Health, Beacon Health Strategies and the Massachusetts Behavioral Health Partnership. Research on the effects of carve-outs is still not conclusive; however, given the testimony provi ded to the Commission, there is ample reason to be concerned that health insurance providers i n the Commonwealth are able to reduce spending on mental health and substance abuse services by using the carve-out programs as gatekeepers and decreasing the services provided to i ndividuals requesting mental health and substance abuse services. Throughout the Commission's public hearings parents, loved ones, doctors, trea tment providers and addicts continually brought up the various issues addressed above regardi ng insurance companies. One parent at the September 10, 2009 hearing stated that her son was denied further treatment after receiving an initial five-day detox until he ha d medically overdosed and was rushed to the hospital. At that point her insurance company approved a 14 -day inpatient care; however her insurance later denied coverage for because the ways in which the provider coded Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 34 the treatment. She is still fighting with her insurance company to have that treatment paid for and has gone to the Massachusetts Attorney General's office to get the state invol ved. The Commission understands the current climate in which Massachusett s finds itself in and the overwhelming support for cost containment and reform in the health care industry as a whole. Given these factors the Commission recognizes three areas of r eform that must occur in the insurance industry to better enable those with substance use disorders to receive the treatment they, as individuals, needs: 1. Strengthen federal and state mental health parity laws to li mit loopholes and provide comprehensive services in the form that is best suited to the individ ual suffering from substance use disorders. The state must ensure that insurance compa nies do not apply different utilization management standards to mental health and substa nce abuse treatments than they do to other medical interventions. 2. Mandate a medical necessity definition which includes a determinat ion for behavioral health issues, providing for consistency across the state. 3. Ensure that should an individual chose the course of treatment that re quires medication assisted treatment, proper coverage by insurance companies be mandated through the state. While these reforms will not completely solve the discrepancies and inconsistencies within the insurance industry in regards to substance abuse treatment coverage, they will help to close the loopholes and work to end the heartache and frustration that many individuals in the Commonwealth experience. Strengthen state mental health parity laws to limit loopholes and provide compr ehensive services in the form that is best suited to the individual suffering from substance use dis order. As referenced above, federal and state mental health parity a re often at odds with one another. The Federally mandated requirements do not specifically include subs tance use disorders at this time and the state mandated parity is only now beginning to require coverage for substance use disorders. Federal issues will be discussed at length in a corre sponding section of the report. As of July 1, 2009, substance use disorders have been added to the list of manda ted coverage disorders under the Massachusetts Mental Health Parity legisla tion. The law requires the coverage include up to 30 days inpatient treatment and $500 worth of outpatient treatment. According to the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, Department of M ental Health; \"Health plans must provide mental health benefits on a nondiscriminatory basis for the diagnosis and treatment of biologically-based mental health disorders , as described in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of M ental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association (\"DSM\"). \"Nondi scriminatory basis\" means that copayments, coinsurance, deductibles, unit of service limit s (e.g., hospital days, outpatient visits), and/or annual or lifetime maximums are not greater for mental Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 35 disorders than those required for physical conditions, and office visit copayments are not greater than those required for primary care visits.\"82 The state is still in the process of implementing these new regulations, and insurance companies are beginning to change their internal regulations on substance use dis order coverage to fall in line with the state law. The Commission believes it is of the upmost importance to ensure that insurance providers continue to uphold the central tenet of this legislat ion. Additionally, the Commission believes that the state must actively enforce the legislation, through the Office of Patient Protection and the Attorney General's office. Without s trict enforcement insurance companies will find loopholes to covering treatment Mandate a medical necessity definition which includes a determination for be havioral health issues, providing for consistency across the state. There are two issues that arise within state insurance law as it applies to medical necessity. First, is the issue of the definition of medical necessity and how to best define the term while requiring all insurance companies in the Commonwealth to comply with a standard definition. Pennsylvania requires that medical necessity for drug and alcohol treatment be determined by a licensed physician external from the insurer. 83 Given the Commission's understanding of the difficulties that loved ones and individuals with substance use disorders face in securing adequate treatment, a recommendation is made to include a referral process by the Division of Insurance, in coordination with the Bureau and Substance Abuse Services, t o the standardized definition of medical necessity. Second, is the issue of the appeals process when individuals are deni ed coverage by their insurance company. While the Office of Patient Protection does a llow for external reviews of denials of treatment for medical necessity, the Commission recom mends strengthening the regulations to include more stringent guidelines. Further, if the a bove statutory change is made, a change in the appeals process will need to be made to reflect the state 's comprehensive medical necessity criteria. Again, coordination with the Division of Insuranc e and the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services is needed. Vermont has the most rigorous cr iteria for appeals involving mental health services and substance abuse treatment. Thei r criterion establishes an independent seven member review board for mental health services and substance abuse treatment.84 The Commission recommends using Vermont's statute as a model for legislation in the Commonwealth on medical necessity review boards. Finally, an issue that was not widely addressed but deserves furthe r attention is the distinction between fully-insured/fully-funded plans and self-ensured/self-funded pl ans. Currently there are two ways in which an employer may contract health insurance benef its for employees. Fully- insured/fully-funded plans require that all premiums be paid to a spe cific insurance company who pays the various providers for treatment. Self-ensured/self-funde d plans require that employers pool all premiums and put said premiums into an escrow acc ount and then contract with a health insurance company as a third-party provider. The origi nal employer pays for all services out of the escrow account. The second type of employer supplied health insurance is not under state regulations or mandates and because this type of pla n can save the employer the profit margin that they would have to pay to the insurance company, they make up nearly 50 Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 36 percent of all employer supplied health insurance plans in the Commonw ealth. The Commission recommends that further research be done, in conjunction with the Commonwe alth's delegates in Congress, to determine the best course of action for federal la ws to close loopholes involving self-ensured/self-funded plans. Ensure that should an individual chose the course of treatment that require s maintenance and harm reduction medication, proper coverage by insurance companies be mandated through the state. Of the six insurance companies surveyed, four provide some level of me thadone maintenance coverage and five of the six provide some level of buprenorphine/suboxone maintenance. Most companies stated that co-pays are required for maintenance medic ations and that there were no plans in place for individuals to move off maintenance medications at any time. For many individuals this is the best course of treatment and the Commission applauds the insurance industry for investing in this valuable tool towards sobriety. Howe ver, the Commission recommends that this is not the only tool for individuals to use and it ca n be misused and abused, just as other prescription opiates can. There should be strict guide lines to ensure that these medications are regulated and not abused. These alternative treat ments must be covered by all insurance plans in the Commonwealth. As mentioned above, comprehensive follow up care from doctors and case managers is also a necessary component of e ffective opioid treatment and working with insurance companies to ensure that this occurs should be inc luded in Department of Public Health regulations. Addiction and the Criminal Justice System The number of adults involved in the criminal justice system has soar ed from approximately 1.8 million in 1980 to 7.3 million in 2007. 85 During that same period, the number of people in prison for drug offenses rose roughly from 41,000 in 1980 to 500,000 today. 86 Nearly 1 in 31 adults in the United States is currently under some form of corre ctional supervision. In Massachusetts, that number is 1 in 24, up from 1 in 127 in 1982. 87 [Line charting showing increasing demands on the department of corrections 1998 -2007. Chart shows Individuals in MA Corrections System - women in system fluxuates betwe en 908 females to 1089 between 1998 - 2007. Male individuals in the Correction System beginning in 1998 at 1,923 reduces until 2001 where 1,347 males were in the system. The total males in the Correction system then increases steadily until 2007 where 2,227 males are in the sys tem.] The connection between drug abuse and crime is well known. Substance abuse is implicated in at least three types of drug related offenses: a) offenses d efined by drug possession or sales, b) offenses directly related to the substance use (prostitution to ge t money for drugs, stealing to get money for drugs, etc.), c) offenses related to crimes committe d while under the influence of substances (DUIs, etc.). Individuals who use illicit drugs are more likely to commit crimes and it is common for many offenses, including violent crimes, to be committe d by individuals who had used drugs or alcohol prior to committing the crime, or who were using at the time of offense. In fact, according to the National Institute of Health, over 70 per cent of inmates in state and local Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Department of Correc tion. DOC Reentry Initiative . DOC, 2008. Print. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 37 prisons abuse drugs regularly.88 Clearly, harsh punishment for drug offenders swells state and county prison populations, but does little, if anything, to reduce drug use. The Commission recognizes the need for reforms in drug policy and sentencing practi ces. These recommendations will be reviewed in detail below. It is estimated that nationally 97 percent of individuals who are i ncarcerated will eventually return to living in the community.89 In Massachusetts approximately 8 percent of the Department of Correction population is serving first or second degre e life sentences; therefore, 92 percent of the inmates within the prison system will return to M assachusetts communities. More than 2,800 inmates were released in 2008 from the state correcti ons agency. A much higher number of individuals are processed through the Commonwealth's jails and Houses of Corrections on a routine basis. Most of these individuals are returni ng to Massachusetts neighborhoods with an untreated substance use disorder, which significa ntly increases the likelihood of their engaging in a variety of high risk behaviors, including criminal offending. However, there is an abundance of research which indicates that substa nce abuse treatment works for drug abusing offenders, even when it is entered involuntarily. Research also shows that the outcomes for drug abusing offenders transitioning to the com munity following incarceration can be dramatically improved through participati on in aftercare programs. Left untreated, drug abusing offenders can relapse and return to crimina l behavior, often within the first 72 hours after release. This jeopardizes public safety, lea ds to re-arrest and further stretches an already over-burdened criminal justice system. In light of t hese facts, the Commission recommends adopting practices such as the Bureau of Justice Assi stance's Sequential Intercept Model, where interventions can occur at any and every point along a per son's involvement with the criminal justice system, and enacting mandatory post-relea se supervision, that could compel a person leaving prison into treatment. These recommendations will be reviewed in de tail below. Spending on corrections has been the fastest growing or second fastest growing item in state budgets over the last fifteen years. In FY2009, the budget for corre ctions spending in Massachusetts was greater than the budget for higher education. 90 Despite this increased spending, recidivism rates have remained largely unchanged. Research s hows that strong community supervision programs for lower-risk, non-violent offenders cost significantly less than incarceration. According to NIH, $1 spent in treatment results in savings of at least $4 to $7 dollars for the state. 91 The Commission supports the formulation of effective, cost-efficie nt recommendations that support treatment and insure public safety for t his unique population. These recommendations will be reviewed in detail below. Sentencing Reform and Post-Release Supervision In the mid 1990s sentencing reform focused on \"truth in sentencing.\" R eformers sought to restore integrity to the criminal justice system through stat utory changes that ensured that the sentence that was indicated was the sentence that was served. This meant increasing incarceration capacity through alternative sentencing, amending arca ne sentencing rules, and funding new prison construction through municipal bonds. Today, scarce resources mean that reform must do more than create additional capacity. For sentenci ng reform to be effective, it must promote evidence-based approaches that target recidivism and debilitated offenders. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 38 Sentencing reform should include a variety of components, including those whi ch allow the Department of Correction to \"step down\" inmates through the various s ecurity levels prior to release. In this way, individuals are better prepared to reenter the community, having progressed to minimum security and pre-release status. Such preparation prior to release is shown to reduce recidivism by gradually introducing the individual back into the communit y environment. Individuals currently serving mandatory minimum sentences are not a llowed to participate in such programs, thus increasing their likelihood of reoffending. Many if not most of these \"mandatory\" sentences are related to drug use in one way or anot her. Given that these same individuals will be released to the community at some point, it is i n the best interest of the state to better prepare them for such release by availing them of ne cessary reentry services through lower security programs. Despite the overwhelming evidence that substance abuse programming is effective, if for a sufficient duration, even when required, the Department of Correction was only able to provide such services to approximately 45 percent of the inmates in need of s uch services in 2008 due to a shortage of resources. Since that time, the outpatient service s component has been eliminated due to mandated executive funding cuts and budget reductions, further reducing the availability of critical services. Given that the majority of individuals inc arcerated have either offended while under the influence of drugs or alcohol or committed crimes t o procure such substances, enhanced residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment progra ms are essential during incarceration. Linkage with aftercare services upon release and the incentive to participate, as dictated by post-release supervision, is extremely important. The Massachusetts Trial Court, Office of Community Corrections ( OCC) is a government agency founded in 1996, to establish and implement intermediate sanction prog rams for the intensive supervision of probationers, parolees and inmates returning to t he community after a period of incarceration. The OCC operates 27 Community Corrections Cent ers (CCC) statewide in collaboration with county sheriff's and community-based human servic e agencies. CCC's combine sanctions and services through Intermediate Sanction Levels, as promulgated by the Massachusetts Sentencing Commission. Sanctions include community-se rvice, day-reporting, drug and alcohol screening and electronic monitoring. Services include substance abuse treatment, education, life-skills training and job development. In FY2009 more than 4,000 criminal offenders received substance abuse trea tment as a component of intensive supervision at a CCC. In order to increase acce ss to substance abuse treatment at another point in the criminal justice process, consis tent with the Sequential Intercept Model, the Commission recommends amending existing statutory law at Chapter 211F, Section 3 so that individuals on pre-trial probation can be referred to a CCC at ISL III or IV. Currently, by law, probationers must be \"sentenced to\" an intermediate sanction p rogram as a condition of probation. A change in this law would permit substance abuse interventi on not only for probationers who are \"sentenced\" post-disposition but those who are awai ting trial and under pre-trial probation supervision. This simple change would thereby cr eate a ready-made, substance abuse treatment diversion program for those involved in the criminal justice system. Additional substance abuse treatment intervention can be promoted through the reintroduction of \"split\" and \"suspended\" sentences to state prison adjudicated in the s uperior court. Under Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 39 current law, superior court judges do not have the authority to suspend a se ntence of incarceration in whole or in part. Thus, superior court judges must choose exclusively between probation and incarceration. As a result, judges who might opt for a combination substance abus e intervention through intensive supervision and a period of incarceration are likely to take the \"safer\" approach of incarceration alone. The Commission recommends the restoration of suspended and split sentences. This move would provide judges with the authori ty to combine intensive supervision probation with a period of incarceration for single offense convictions in the superior court. This change will permit judges to more readily access substance abuse treatment either before or after a period of incarceration for a single of fense conviction. So-called \"split\" sentences provide the opportunity for additional post-re lease supervision. The Commission recommends that this post-release supervision be administe red by probation so that the substance abuse treatment afforded through the CCC can be i mplemented for a time duration that is consistent with evidence-based practice. According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, substance abuse treatment in criminal justice applications i s effective when it lasts long enough to produce stable behavioral changes. 92 Consistent with this principle the OCC mandates the use of benchmarks to determine when a participant is able to make a transition to standard supervision. While all criminal justice supervision can be intensifi ed through the CCC, only probation has the institutional focus and apparatus to coerce longer dura tion substance abuse treatment. The duration of parole or sheriff department supervision is often less than 90 days, which is inconsistent with evidence-based practice for substance abuse treatment in criminal justice supervision as articulated by NIDA. Voluntary and Involuntary Commitments There are currently two ways that an individual with substance use disorder can be placed into a locked-down setting, either through a civil ruling or as a result of a criminal offense. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 123, Section 35 (\"Section 35\") pe rmits the courts to involuntarily commit someone whose alcohol or drug use puts themselves or others at risk. Such a commitment can lead to an inpatient substance abuse treatment for a period of up to 30 days. Under the law, the person can be committed to a licensed treatment facility or, if none are available, to a separate unit at the correctional facility. Those who commit a crime, and are found to be addicted to a controlled su bstance, can be placed in a locked-down treatment center through a number of innovative programs currently operating in the Commonwealth. There are 20+ drug courts in Massachusetts that can place an individual with substance use disorder in a locked-down facility for treatme nt as an alternative to incarceration. The Legislature, in the FY2007 Supplemental Budget, pr ovided $1 million to start a pre-arraignment pilot program in the Essex County District Att orney's Office. The District Attorney is able to direct non-violent offenders into a locked-down substanc e abuse treatment facility, in lieu of arraignment and a subsequent Criminal Offende r Record Information (CORI) record. Additionally, these offenders agree to enter and remai n in treatment as well as pay restitution for any crimes committed in exchange for their arra ignment being held in abeyance. Thus far, this program has been a great success and merits consideration for its application state- wide to serve as a siphon for the secure treatment centers. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 40 In the summer of 2009 the Department of Corrections announced the closure of the Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center (MASAC). An imme diate public outcry occurred, as many parents and loved ones who turn to the involuntary commi tment statute as a means of protecting their loved ones when they have nowhere else to tur n. Due to the overwhelming support for this program the Department of Corrections has put an indefinite hold on the closure of the facility. While this is a short-term vict ory for those who need this type of secure treatment, long-term solutions must be put in place. Additionally, two treatment centers, the Men's Addiction Treatment Center (MATC) in Brockton, and the Women's Addiction Treatment Center (WATC) in New B edford, have recently opened to provide secure treatment facilities for those individuals who are civilly committed. Approximately 92 percent of individuals who enter MATC succe ssfully complete the program and 13.6 percent voluntarily extend their stay for furthe r treatment. 93 While these units are providing much needed services for this population is individuals, including detoxification, case management and aftercare, they are constantl y at capacity and in need of resources. These programs are providing many individuals with a viable option to treat their opiate addiction. However, without proper funding these programs will not be able to sustain their current treatment levels. The Commission recommends that in light of current budgetary constraints secure treatment facilities, including MASAC rema in in place until suitable alternatives can be established. Jail Diversion The Commission believes that we must drastically alter the m anner in which we deal with those suffering with substance use disorders in our criminal justice sy stem. The diversion of low-level offenders from a correctional setting into treatment is an exce llent first step towards reforming a system in dire need of attention. A jail diversion program will not only save the state tens of m illions of dollars in correction costs, but also ensure that those with substance use disorders are r eceiving proper treatment. The findings thus far of the OxyContin and Heroin Commission have substantia ted that the state is not providing a comprehensive treatment infrastructure and is, therefor e, hemorrhaging money from this broken system. National estimates show that states disburse up to 15 percent of their budgets on substance abuse related costs. In Massachusetts this amounts to $4.2 billion of our state budget being used on corrections, public safety, children and family services, and health care costs associated with substance abuse.94 Jail diversion will create immediate savings and will take t he pressure off of our overburdened corrections and court systems, allowing those branches to concentrate on their core missions. The Department of Corrections is clearly fulfilling a role tha t they are ill-equipped to handle. Evidence shows that 17 percent of all inmates claim to have committ ed their crime solely to obtain money to buy drugs. The neurobiological evidence proves that the impulse to get high becomes a survival function for individuals affected by this disease . For the most part, these individuals are not bad people, they are sick and in need of proper treatment. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 41 A jail diversion model that requires up to 90 days of inpatient treatm ent, followed by a year of case management and support has the ability to change the way Mas sachusetts handles substance abuse issues. Many other states are adopting this model for tre atment and seeing great success. We cannot afford to let Massachusetts fall behind other states i n this area. We are a state that provides strong social services, excellent universal healthcare, t op-rated schools, outstanding workforce development, mental health services, and resources for lo w-income individuals. Making a substantial change in our approach to this epidemic will make Massachus etts a national leader on this issue, and an example for other states to follow. In 2007, Texas chose to address a projected shortfall of 17,000 available pr ison beds by 2012 by taking $241 million out of the prison budget and spending it on increased drug and alcohol treatment programs and other diversion efforts. It also expanded its drug courts. 95 Texas officials estimate that expanding the treatment and diversion programs will el iminate the 2012 bed shortfall and in will save the state $430 million over FY2008 and FY2009. 96 The Commission believes that we must care for these sick individual s through a jail diversion program and that through this program, the Commonwealth will save money and lives. Interdiction and Law Enforcement Law enforcement officials play an important role in the substance abuse equation as they are often the first responders in instances of illegal activity and play a crucial role in the implementation of policies throughout the Commonwealth. In 2008, the United S tates Drug Enforcement Agency seized, 211.9 kilograms of cocaine, 7.6 kilograms of heroin, 2.9 kilograms of Methamphetamine and 988.6 kilograms of marijuana. Consequently, arrests for drug violations have risen in the last year with 540 taking place in 2007. 97 [Bar chart shows drug violation arrests in Massachusetts from 2003 - 2007 2003: 431 2004: 409 2005: 402 2006: 402 clearly shows a large increase from 2006-2007] United States. Drug Enforcement Administration. DEA Briefs and Backgrounds -Massachusetts . Drug Enforcement Administration, 2008. Web. 19 Oct. 2009 . Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 42 With the majority of state budgets concerning substance abuse going t owards the aftermath of substance abuse, including crime and law enforcement, the Commission ha s a particular interest in ensuring that there is efficient funding and programming in place. Internet The availability of opioid analgesics on the internet is a concer n that has garnered significant attention on both a state and federal level. The internet is riddled with online pharmacies that provide access to opioids, including those that do not require a prescripti on. In 2005, The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) concluded \"Operation CYBERx\" success fully shutting down over 22 pharmacies and nearly 5,000 web sites that were not requiring prescriptions. 98 While the Commission acknowledges that the complexities involved in pol icing the internet remain largely a federal matter, it is imperative that em phasis is placed at the state level to monitor these transactions. The Commonwealth can be better served by improving the methods of communication with federal enforcement agencies responsible for t argeting these internet suppliers which are often found to be the route source for expansive criminal enterpri ses. Law Enforcement The role of law enforcement in combating the proliferation of ill egal opioid use is critical, yet often complicated and expensive. The Commission heard testimony from l aw enforcement officials who cited difficulty in disrupting the illegal sale of opioids without devoting significant time and resources to developing what eventually leads to a length y investigation. Due to the highly organized structure of the groups involved in trafficking opioids, the investigators rely heavily on long drawn out wire tap operations that become a particularly costly endeavor. With this in mind, the Commission feels it is imperative that work be done to expand the available tools our law enforcement officers have to combat this il legal activity. Law enforcement officials need to work in conjunction with the medical prof essionals who prescribe these pain medications. Improving educational awareness and providing access to the Massachusetts Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) would be the ne xt step in the drive to better equip our law enforcement professionals. With limited funding a vailable and the majority of the cost burden associated with assistance based programs, acces s to the PMP would be a very effective tool for law enforcement. Long-Term Treatment Research from the mid-1970s demonstrates that treatment can he lp patients addicted to drugs to \"stop using, avoid relapse, and successfully recover their lives\".99 However, more often than not addictions go unnoticed or untreated. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Se rvices Administration's (SAMHSA) National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), indicat es that in 2007, 23.2 million people in the US (9.4 percent of the population) age 12 and old r equire treatment for drug or alcohol use. 100 Of the 23+ million people needing addiction treatment Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 43 services only 2.4 million (10 percent of the population needing treatment) received the necessary treatment to successfully move into recovery, thus, 20.8 million persons (8.4 percent of the population aged 12 or older) needed treatment for an illicit drug or alc ohol use problem but did not receive it. 101 Long term treatment programs are needed to provide a continuum of c are to move the individuals from addiction to recovery. Long-term treatment programs are designed to provide individuals with a treatment program that includes residential treatment, stabilization services, vocational rehabilitation and social support structures. These programs provide a continuity of care that exte nds through the life cycle of an individual with substance use disorder. Studies show that the best long-t erm programs are characterized by \"a combination of therapies and other services t o meet an individual patient's needs. Specific needs may relate to age, race, culture, sexual ori entation, gender, pregnancy, other drug use, comorbid conditions (e.g., depression, HIV), parenting, housin g, and employment, as well as physical and sexual abuse history.\"102 Among the needed treatment programs, the best programs focus on substance abuse monitoring, case manag ement, support groups, pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy. Coupled with these trea tment efforts, are the support structures needed for the individual to move into successful recover y. These support structures include family and child care services, vocational reha bilitation, mental health services, housing, financial and medical services. See all the com ponents of comprehensive drug abuse treatment listed below. 103 The Commission recommends that a comprehensive approach to long-term treatment, include the following: Treatment program attributes: substance abuse monitoring, case ma nagement, support groups, pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy. Recovery support attributes: family and child care services, vocati onal rehabilitation, mental health services, housing, financial and medical services. Several studies have demonstrated the importance and efficacy of long-term treatment programs, especially those that institute a continuum of care program that serve the individual's specific needs and vulnerabilities. A study by the Institute for Behavioral Health found that \"adolescents who received another service within 14 days of their residential dis charge had approximately a 92 percent higher likelihood of being in recovery at the end of the 3 -month follow-up than adolescents who did not receive another service within this time fra me.\" 104 In a similar report the Journal for Drug Education found a significant relationship between social supports, economic self sufficiency and substance abuse outcomes in long-term pr ograms. 105 Evidence about this relationship has been provided before, yet many programs ha ve reduced their services and lengths of stay. 106 This study found that \"reductions in substance abuse were associated with measures of self-sufficiency...among women who participated in our study; economic outcomes, substance abuse, and general functioning went hand-in-hand.\" 107 This research demonstrated that eliminating services, specifically employment related s ervices will negatively impact the clientele. 108 Short-term treatment should not be ignored or dismissed in regards to the overall spectrum of treatment options. However, with individuals who have a history of substanc e abuse, long-term treatment and continuum of care must be available. In 2001, the Journal Psychiatric Services looked at outcomes for short-term and long-term programs. The study det ermined that \"patients Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 44 in the long-term program were significantly more likely to bec ome engaged in treatment, and after discharge they were more likely to maintain abstinence and less likely to experience homelessness.\"109 A middle aged woman who is a resident of Phoenix House in Springfield testified at the commissions hearing at the State House on March 27, 2009 about her experi ences with treatment programs. \"The Phoenix House is the first long-term treatment f acility I have tried and it is EXACTLY what I need... In my opinion is the only thing that gives addi cts a chance at a so called normal life. Giving us structure and a chance to work on our issues and take care of things that we have put off for so long gives us hope that we can leave here and stay drug fr ee.\" Substance abuse treatment needs to be flexible and adjusted to the nee ds of the individual. Long-term treatment can provide the flexibility and adequate tim e to obtain the services needed to support the individual in their recovery effort. Research suggests that the length of treatment should not be pre-determined and should meet the need of the individual. 110 Similarly, \"for residential or outpatient treatment, participation for less than 90 da ys is of limited effectiveness, and treatment lasting significantly longer is recommended for maintaining positive outcomes.\"111 Recovery from drug addiction is a process that takes time and in s ome cases may require multiple episodes of treatment.112 In Massachusetts FY2007 there were 45,902 admissions to treatment progra ms, reporting heroin use. Of these admissions 8.8 percent (4,047) were admitted to Long-Term Residential Services for longer than 30 days. 113 These programs included Recovery Homes, Therapeutic Communities, social models, residential programs specifically f or offenders, and women and family oriented shelters. It is interesting to note there are only 1,885 of long-term treatment beds available in Massachusetts. With calls from providers and consumer s for more long-term treatment options, and no shortage of people needing the beds, the number of long-term treatment programs needs to be increased to meet this rising demand. [Pie chart shows 8.8 percent of total treatment admissions are Long Term Tr eatment Admissions in FY2007] John McGahan, President of the Gavin Foundation testified before the Commission on March 27, 2009 on his experience in working with long-term treatment programs . He stated that there are only 105 residential beds for adolescents in the Commonwealth. Cushi ng House, a 30-bed adolescent program run by the Gavin Foundation, is currently running at maximum capacity with a two month waiting list. The waiting list for Gavin House, a 33 bed residential progr am for men is just as long. 114 McGahan also commented that regulatory options need to consider the importance of cost effective treatment versus the high cost of i ncarcerations, social consequences, and that those affected are real people, mothers, father s, sons and daughters. Long-term treatment programs need to be expanded to address this epidemic that is continuing to grow. Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Department of Public Health. Substance Abuse Treatment Fact Sheet - FY 2007 Heroin Users . Bureau of Substance Abuse Services, 2008. Web. 25 Sept. 2009. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 45 \"Long-term residential treatment provides care 24 hours a day, genera lly in non-hospital settings. The best-known residential treatment model is the therapeutic comm unity (TC), with planned lengths of stay between 6 and 12 months. TCs focus on the \"re-sociali zation\" of the individual and use the program's entire community\u2014 including other residents, staff, and the social context\u2014 as active components of treatment. Addiction is viewed in the context of an individual's social and psychological deficits, and treatment focuse s on developing personal accountability and responsibility as well as socially productive lives. Treatment is highly structured and can be confrontational at times, with activities des igned to help residents examine damaging beliefs, self-concepts, and destructive patterns of behavi or and adopt new, more harmonious and constructive ways to interact with others. Many TCs offer comprehensive services, which can include employment training and other support services, on site.115 While many of these concepts are not foreign to treatment pro grams in the Commonwealth, the concept of long-term treatment is considered an expensive course of action. In-patient treatments, involving intensive 24-hour care can also be a commitment t hat an individual with a substance use disorder may not be willing to take. This being said, for some individuals it is the only way to recover from their disorder and maintain sobriety long term. Youth OxyContin, other prescription medication and heroin abuse has continued to be a prevailing problem with the Commonwealth's youth. In 2007, there were 4,544 substance abuse treatment admissions in the Commonwealth for citizens ages 15-19. 116 This age group accounts for 4.3 percent of all substance abuse treatment admissions. 117 An increasing number of young adults are being exposed to prescription painkillers. The Commission heard f rom parents and family members whose young adults became addicted in a variety of ways . According to statistics from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), of youths misus ing prescription opioids, one third reported that they obtained the drugs for free from fam ily and friends. The second most common source for obtaining prescription opioids was through a physi cian. 118 Whether as the result of using painkillers after a major surgery or from experimentation with friends, the devastating and long-term effects of opioids in one's system are tremendous and the C ommission feels that drastic steps must be taken to curb this epidemic in today's youth. Education and Prevention There are a variety of issues that affect young adults. Firs t, is the need for prevention through schools and other community measures educating students about the dang ers of substance abuse and working to deter them from trying drugs. Additionally, there i s a need for licensed drug and alcohol counselors to be present in schools and provide the needed support to st udents who may be afflicted with addiction. The Commission found that many early points of interception for the Commonwealth's young adults are not being addressed. Throughout the public hearing process the Commission heard many stor ies from community organizations and schools about the need for education and prevention progra ms. Due to strains in the budget since 2003, national programs such as D.A.R.E. have been cut fr om the state budget and as a result all but died out from the Massachusetts elem entary and middle school Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 46 curriculums. Many schools were not able to keep up with the burden o f paying for the program themselves. Raising awareness about the harms of drugs, alcohol and substance abuse is an issue that must be addressed at an early age. Additionally, given the ch anges in substance abuse in the Commonwealth, these programs must be updated to include illicit use of pr escription drugs. D.A.R.E. Massachusetts has seen a recent resurgence and to date bet ween 75 and 95 towns use the program in their schools. This is a drastic cut from the mid -1990s when most of the 351 towns in the Commonwealth accessed the program. 119 The program is attempting to modernize many of their original lesson plans, including topics on prescript ion medications, bullying and lesson plans for parents, however without widespread use, the program la cks the coherency to be broadly analyzed. The Commission recommends that a statewide p rogram be put into place and required throughout all levels of a child's education, including the upper g rades of elementary school. The curriculum should include lessons on the dangers of prescrip tion medication abuse, as well as many of the other modern abused narcotics. A recent study from the National Institute of Health suggests that when school-based prevention programs began in elementary school they significantly reduced the number of students that engaged in substance abuse, violent behavior, or sexual activity. 120 It is the hope of the Commission that with a program in place in all schools, the rate of drug use would decrease among our youth. In addition to improving education programs in schools, the Commission rec ommends that licensed drug and alcohol counselors are present in each middle school and high school throughout the state. While it is not necessary that a counselor be a separate staff member within the school, providing a teacher, health professional, principle or other s taff member with the necessary training to recognize drug and alcohol abuse in youth, and as sist parents and students with the available resources should a problem arise. Pennsylvania has a comprehensive approach to counseling and support services in schools, including a professiona lly trained team which includes school staff and experts from community substance abuse agencies that work together to monitor issues in the school and provide the best learning environment possible.121 Recovery High Schools Recovery high schools are not a new concept to Massachusetts, however in recent months they have received increased attention and praise both within the state and nationally. In April 2009, CNN did a large print and television story on the students at the Beverly Recovery High School. 122 The three Massachusetts Recovery high schools are boasting gre at successes and in the 2006-2007 school year 72 percent of the youth referred to the three schools completed the school year. 123 Massachusetts Recovery high schools follow the traditional public high school format, meeting the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Curriculum Framework, but incorporate the traditional addiction recovery 12-step program. These schools have seen success since their inception in the Comm onwealth in 2006. In recent months, legislation in Massachusetts has been approved to require public school districts to put the portion of expenses for a given student attending a recovery high school towards that student's education at one of the three state recovery high schools. This is a vast improvement over the previous system and will aid the recovery high schools in conti nuing their mission and expanding the number of students they are able to serve. The Commiss ion met with several students who attended a recovery high school in the Commonwealth and each s tudent spoke that their success was due entirely to the drug-free zone the schools pr ovided and are now giving Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 47 back to the schools, as teachers, mentors and staff members. The Com mission recommends that the state continue to support these worthwhile schools, by increasing the number of recovery high schools in the Commonwealth through more funding and legislative support. Throughout the hearing process the Commission heard from a variety of parents who expressed similar sentiments. We must do all that we can when children ar e young to expose them to the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse. Further, if a child has issues wit h alcohol or substance abuse, schools must be equipped to aid parents in knowing their options and assisting them in getting treatment for their child. Finally, when necessary, students should be given the option to attend an area recovery high school, as their success is clearly see n in the positive and successful graduates of these programs. The Commission believes that wit h these recommendations, the youth of Massachusetts who may become addicted or are currently addicted ca n be given a better chance of success. Unique Populations Throughout the Commission's public hearings, a variety of individuals spoke a bout so-called unique populations, which has their own special needs and considerations. The he aring in Hyannis focused solely on these unique populations dealing with substance abus e, including veterans and those with co-occurring disorders. The following sec tion outlines the individual issues surrounding unique populations as they pertain to substance use disor ders. Overall, the Commission believes that more attention must be paid to these individua ls and the special needs they have. Disabled Populations In America there are 7 million people with disabilities (PWD) who receive federal support and health care benefits from the Supplemental Security Income (S SI) program. 124 Individuals who receive SSI have a long-term disability which will bring them in contact with state and federal health care systems as well as social service systems. T hese individuals receive treatment for their disabilities in many forms; however, the prevalence of s ubstance abuse disorders among this population can increase the cost and complexity of those services . 125 One report focusing on substance abuse rates among people with multiple sclerosis (MS) f ound that \"substance abuse may be present in up to 19 percent of this sample and contribute to hi gh rates of depression. There may be greater risk of harm due to substance abuse in people w ith MS because of the potential magnification of motor and cognitive impairments.\"126 With the prevalence of substance abuse among PWD, it is critical for treatment programs to be cognizant of the access barriers to treatment for this population. In addition much of the trea tment for co-occurring disorders focuses on substance use disorders and mental health disorders, not on physical disabilities. 127 Much of the difficulty in providing services for PWD is meeting t he physical needs and access issues related to this population. A study by the Massachusetts D epartment of Public Health, in conjunction with the Center for Survey Research out of the University of Massachusetts Boston found that there were three main barriers to accessing needed health care. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 48 [Pie chart showing reasons for not accessing proper healthcare Cost Prohibitive - 30% Difficulty in figuring out who to see - 37% Hard to leave home - 33%] Given the differences that PWDs face, substance abuse treatme nt programs for PWD must look to provide adequate access, treatment specific programs that ta ke into consideration the physical impairments of the population. Another barrier to accessing treatment for PWD who also have a substance use disorders is that \"typical policy in state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agenci es requires people with substance use disorder to be \"clean and sober\" for six months prior to receivi ng services.\"128 For PWD to receive vocational training as a point of increasing independent li ving and quality of life, these services need to be available during, not after substance abuse trea tment. This research demonstrated that vocational rehabilitation programs should be integrat ed into substance abuse treatment, not provided after the fact to improve an individual's independence and quality of l ife. Recent studies have demonstrated that current best practice progra ms for PWD seeking treatment will merge the biopsychosocial theoretical perspective of addict ive disorder. According to the study conducted by the Department of Alcohol and Drug Services in Cal ifornia, this model includes \"supportive counseling, motivating client readiness for cha nge and coping skills- training techniques. The goals of treatment are to establish and maintain abstinence from the illicit use of all psychoactive drugs, foster development of (nonchem ical) coping and problem- solving skills to stop and ultimately eliminate impulses to \"self -medicate\" with psychoactive drugs, and to enhance and sustain client motivation for change.\" 129 A report by the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland provided guidelines for removing access barriers to substance abuse treatment. This report cited that \"interventions to address disparities in treatment access will need to coordinate across multiple communities to address the numerous barriers.\"130 The study cited the following findings. 1. Vocational rehabilitation counselors and social service case manager s will need to recognize and address substance in their clientele and increase referra l to treatment. 2. Treatment programs will need to address the negative attitude s of their staff and improve accessibility of their facilities, policies, and materials. 3. Substance abuse treatment professionals must pay close attention to the unique aspects of the lifestyle of PWDs, which may affect the outcomes of SA treatment. 4. Provider sensitivity to treatment barriers (political, attitudina l, or physical) is crucial while devising evaluations and individual treatment plans. Leaders in t he disability community have a role to play in informing their members about SA and treatment.131 Massachusetts Department of Public Health. (MDPH) O ffice of Health and Disability. Study of the Unmet Needs of Adults with disabilities in Massachusetts , 2007. Center for Survey Research. University of Massachusetts, Boston. July 2008 . Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 49 The Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) is striving to ensure that reasonable accommodations for access to programs and services neede d by PWD are met. In accordance with the American with Disabilities Act, EOHHS i s \"committed to facilitating compliance with these important Civil Rights Acts among agencies that provide prevention, intervention and treatment services for alcoholism and other drug abuse.\"132 The Commission recognizes that there is a lack of specialized se rvices for this population. Access to care is a major burden for individuals with substance use disorders who are also disabled. As with the other unique populations, many of the issues coi ncide with one another. The Commission believes that as with all substance abuse issues, treatment must be individualized and must adapt to meet the needs of specific populations, suc h as those who are also physically disabled. The Commission recommends more resear ch to ensure that proper care is given to this unique population. Co-Occurring Mental Illness and Addiction According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, the t erm dual diagnosis, or co- occurring disorders is a common term that indicates the simultaneous presence of t wo independent medical disorders. 133 Recently, within the fields of mental health, psychiatry, and addiction medicine, the term has been popularly used to describe the coe xistence of a mental health disorder and a substance abuse disorder. Substance abuse is a common and devastating disorder among persons wi th severe mental illness (SMI). \"Dual disorders occur in about 50 percent of individuals wit h SMI and is associated with a variety of negative outcomes, including higher rates of relaps e, violence, hospitalization, homelessness, and incarceration.\"134 135 According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), \"persons with a co-occurring disorder have a statistica lly greater propensity for violence, medication noncompliance, and failure to respond to treatment t han consumers with just substance abuse or a mental illness.\"136 In many cases mental health programs and services are not prepared or able to handle individuals with both a mental illne ss and substance abuse disorder. Often substance use disorders come out of mental illnes s due to the environment in which a mentally ill individual lives. Mentally ill individuals te nd to live in low-income environments with little social support and easy access to drugs and alcohol. 137 The statistics on the dual diagnosis population are startling. For example, 42.7 percent of individuals with a 12-month addictive disorder had at least one 12-month me ntal disorder, and 14.7 percent of individuals with a 12-month mental disorder had at least one 12-month addictive disorder.138 Studies have also found that individuals with severe mental disorders were at significant risk for developing a substance use disorder during their lifetime. Individuals with schizophrenia are more than four times as likely as the general popul ation to have a substance abuse disorder. 139 Further, individuals with bipolar disorder are more than five times as likely a s the general population to have a substance abuse disorder.140 In many cases individuals classified with dual diagnosis struggle to obtain the services needed to support both disorders. According to the Massachusetts Executive Offi ce of Health and Human Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 50 Services (EOHHS) \"an individual with a substance abuse problem is eligible for continuing care services if he or she is determined to have a qualifying mental disorder, meets impairment and duration criteria, requires DMH continuing care services, and has no ot her means for obtaining them. The qualifying mental disorder must be confirmed before asse ssing whether the applicant meets duration and functional impairment criteria. The individual may need substance abuse services in addition to mental health services.\"141 It is generally understood amongst the treatment community tha t treatment programs designed for people whose problems are primarily substance abuse are genera lly not recommended for people who also have a mental illness. These programs tend to be confro ntational and coercive and most people with severe mental illnesses are too fragile to benefit from them. Heavy confrontation, intense emotional jolting, and discouragement of the use o f medications tend to be detrimental. These treatments may produce levels of stress tha t exacerbate symptoms or cause relapse.\"142 There are a variety of programs in Massachusetts that atte mpt to handle dual diagnosis patients in a way to better enable the success over the disease. \"Desi rable programs for this population should take a more gradual approach. Staff should recognize that denia l is an inherent part of the problem. Patients often do not have insight as to the seriousness and scope of the problem. Abstinence may be a goal of the program but should not be a precondition for entering treatment. If dually diagnosed clients do not fit into local Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) groups, special peer groups based on AA principles might be developed.\"143 Massachusetts the programs who received grants from the US Depa rtment of Health and Human Services offer services designed for individuals with co-occurring disorders is listed below. Henry Lee Willis Community Center , Worcester, Massachusetts - $400,000 each year for five years to address the needs of person 16 years of age and ol der who are chronically homeless and have mental illness and/or physical disability and substance abuse problems. Casa Esperanza , Roxbury, Massachusetts - $400,000 for five years to develop aftercare services for persons of the Latino population in an existing residential treatm ent program. Boston Medical Corporation , Boston, Massachusetts - $589,304 per year for three years, to support the BMC ACCESS Project that will work with the Massachus etts Department of Mental Health to create an enhanced safe haven shelter for homeles s persons providing mental health, substance abuse and primary care services. ServiceNet, Inc. , Northampton, Massachusetts - $534,846 per year for three years, to support the Integrated Sheltering and Treatment Program to address t he complex needs of homeless adults struggling with co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders. 144 While these programs are good initial steps in improving service s to those classified as dual diagnosis, more must be done to increase understanding of these multi-la yer disorders. The Commission would recommend implementing lessons learned from the SAM HSA Co-Occurring State Initiative Grant (COSIG) that evaluated how 17 states a ddressed the common problem and developed more effective ways to identify and treat individuals with co-occurring mental illness Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 51 and addiction (dual diagnosis). This effort would require a joint plan betw een the Department of Mental Health and the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services. Cultural Competencies According to the 2000 U.S. Census 12.2 percent of Massachusetts residents are foreign born and 18.7 percent of all Massachusetts residents speak a language other tha n English at home. 145 Obviously then, Massachusetts possesses a significant population for w hom English is not their first language and who, potentially, have limited English proficienc y. There are many cultural, racial and ethnic differences that drastically change effecti ve treatment for each subgroup of individuals. In 2007, the Latino population in Boston had the highest substance abuse mortality rate among all the racial/ethnic groups. In fact from 1999 to 2007, the Latino rate increased more than 500 percent.146 It is important to note that the rate for African American and Caucasian populations decreased 20.3 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively, from 2006 to 2007, but those decreases are still well above the 1999 levels for mortality.147 The Bureau of Substance Abuse Services provides interpreter services for those individuals in nee d of translators. For many people culturally appropriate treatment is an important piece of the continuum of care for substance abuse treatment. [Substance Abuse Treatment Admissions by Race/Ethnicity, 2001-2008 Chart shows percent of total admissions by race. Chart shows Latino admissions staying relatively consistent but decrease by 4%. Black admissions decrease from 35.6% decreasing to 22.5%. White admissions steadilyl increase from 40.2% to 57.6%] Casa Esperanza in Roxbury is a model in Massachusetts seeing i nitial success. By creating a situation where everyone speaks and understands the same language one e liminates the possibility that an incorrect translation might occur or that som e misunderstanding could take place. Perhaps more importantly though eliminating the need for a t hird party\u2014a translator\u2014 allows for treatment provider and client, and for the clients thems elves, to interact naturally. 148 While this is an obvious benefit to non-English speakers there are some unintended consequences to factor in. Allowing for natural interactions to take place has several benefits in and of itself, most intuitive but some not. First, placing individuals w ith substance abuse disorder who speak the same language exclusively into the same fa cility could lead to charges that members of that community are being ghettoized. While this obviously would not be the intension of such a program there is no doubt that it could possibly be a n unintended consequence. Second, one has to be concerned that in increasing the availabi lity of treatment services for a specific language population the total number of beds woul d remain the same and treatment for individuals with a substance abuse disorder who are not a member of a minority language population would have a more difficult time finding a trea tment bed; in short creating magnet centers de facto decreases the number of bed available , and the flexibility of those beds, for the majority of those seeking substance abuse treatment. The C ommission recommends that further funding be given to the current programs in place that support cultural compe tency. Health of Boston 2009. Boston Public Health Commiss ion.

Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 52 Veterans' Concerns The Commission believes that veterans are a demographic increas ingly at risk for substance abuse. To date, Massachusetts has over 430,000 veterans throughout the stat e, including 30,000 veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Commission found that substance abuse is most often related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) or other mental health issues in veterans. The Massachusetts Department of Veterans Services' (DVS) State wide Advocacy for Veterans Empowerment Program (SAVE) issued a report finding that approxima tely 4 percent of veterans admitted to problems of substance abuse coupled with PTSD, TBI or other issues. 149 However, the percentage only reflected veterans who had self-identified subst ance abuse and mental health issues. Current service members are facing an increased numbe r of deployments as compared to older veterans. DVS notes that there has been increased concern over service members who may not report mental health issues or an increase in symptoms and wi ll instead turn to self- medication through substance abuse. 150 Veterans dealing with PTSD and related issues reported most of ten abusing narcotics (specifically heroin and morphine), alcohol and marijuana. Outreach coor dinators with the SAVE program have also seen an increased number of veterans abus ing both their own and other's prescription drugs to cope with lingering mental health issues.151 The Statewide Advocacy for Veterans Empowerment Program is Massachusetts' leading advocacy program for veterans suffering from mental health issue s. SAVE was created in 2008 as collaboration between DVS and the Department of Public Health and offers outreach, advocacy and referrals for veterans and their families. Their m ain focus is on issues facing returning veterans such as PTSD, TBI and mental health issues, s ubstance abuse issues and suicide prevention. Program coordinators track and refer veterans to the proper resourc es for the issues they are facing. SAVE notes that substance abuse is most-often occurring in conjunction with other mental health issues and is not isolated to veterans of current con flicts. It is important to note that DVS does not offer specific treatment options for substance abus e but rather has the SAVE program direct veterans to other state and local resources who can properly help the m. The Commission recommends continued funding support for veterans outreach, re ferral services, and the Department of Veterans Services. In order for this recommendation to be effective the Commonwealth must continue to improve upon its methods for identifying re turning veterans so that they may benefit from the services available to them. Ma ssachusetts offers some of the most comprehensive benefits and services to veterans and should continue to set an example for the rest of the country through effective veteran advocacy and rec ognition of the issues facing returning service members. CORI/Job Training Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 53 Today in Massachusetts approximately 2.8 million people have records i n the Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) system.152 Many former offenders have trouble finding employment, securing housing or taking out loans because they have c riminal records. The lack of opportunity provided to ex-offenders and the stigma of having a CORI l eads many to fall back into old habits, which often include addiction and limits their ability to put their lives back together. An integral part of recovery is reintroducing those who have recovered from addiction both into society and the job market. This process is stymied by the inability of former substance abusers to find work because of CORI offenses, even after they ha ve shown that they are rehabilitated and are making every attempt to stay sober. A parent of an individual with a substance abuse disorder testified at the Commission's hearing in Salem that when her son was unable to continue on a path of sobriety a fter going through a 30-day treatment program, she concluded that the best way to help he r son was to have him arrested for a drug offense. Unfortunately, her son is now in j ail and while he is on his way to recovery, she expressed remorse that she is the reason why her son is in jail and now has a criminal record for the rest of his life. The Commission reco gnizes that many families struggle with the decision of helping their children beat addiction, even if that requires inca rceration and a CORI for life. According to national studies, jails and prisons around the country are c rowded with offenders who have substance abuse issues. Research has shown that 80 percent of offenders are either addicted to alcohol or drugs, or alcohol or drugs were involved in the commis sion of the crime. 153 Those who are in the Commonwealth's jails and prisons are not immune from this high level of substance abuse. According to state data, 20 percent of pris oners in Massachusetts are incarcerated because of a drug-related crime, and another 20 perc ent of defendants turned to crime to support a drug habit. 154 To deal with the high rate of incarcerated substance abusers, t he Department of Corrections offers a six to eight month program called the Correctional Recove ry Academy (CRA), which targets substance abuse, anger management, criminal thinking and relapse prevention. However, the program's capacity does not come close to meeting its dem and; the program has 552 inmates participating across seven facilities with a waiting list of 400 inmates. In 2007, only 48 percent of the releasing offenders eligible for the program attended.155 The lack of support for the majority of incarcerated addicts is detrimental to the recove ry process. Once offenders are let out of jail, their problems do not end. Often many employers will not h ire a potential employee simply because they have a CORI. Ex-offenders currently have no way to prove they are rehabilitated, creating an undue burden for the rest of their lives. The Commission recognizes that CORI reform is a major issue t hat must be addressed. Therefore, the Commission recommends increasing funding of the CRA and other programs that focus on treatment and reentry. The Department of Correction recomm ends that increasing the CRA by 240 beds would cost approximately $900,000. 156 The additional funding will save money by preventing future incarcerations for minor drug offenses, whi ch at $47,679 per offender in fiscal year 2008, are a great burden on the state. 157 In addition to increasing funding, the Commission recommends that a program for Certificates of R ehabilitation and Recovery for offenders who complete correctional programs like the CRA be create d and included in CORI Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 54 reform legislation. A program such as this would enable ex-offender s to show prospective employers and landlords that they have gone through a recovery process. Finally, the Commission recommends that when CORI reform takes p lace in the upcoming legislative sessions in the Commonwealth, the issue of better dis playing individual crimes be examined. By allowing potential employers, landlords and other offic ials to see a clearer picture of an ex-offender's record, the hope is that the official would take i nto account a person's complete background. Further, such proposals as sealing CORI records for felonies and misdemeanors after less time would enable ex-offenders to get t heir lives back on track more quickly. The Commission expects that these incremental changes will provide those with CORIs who have chosen to continue on a sober path the opportunities they deserve. Family Issues Families traveled from across the state to each of the seven publ ic hearings held by the OxyContin and Heroin Commission in order to testify and break the silence of this deadly epidemic. The members of the Commission received both written and oral testimony that openly and honestly spoke to the struggles and devastating effects that opiat e use and abuse has had on the families living in the Commonwealth. The testimonies spoke t o the uniqueness of each family's situation, yet provided a window into the similarities of the lives of the families living with the repeated heartache and devastation caused by opiate addict ion. The Commission recognizes that addiction is a family disease and recovery is a family process. It is important for families to be both educated on the illness and supported throughout the r ecovery process as caring for a loved one who is struggling with an addiction is one of the most difficult situations that any individual or family will have to endure in their lifetime. Throughout the public hearing process the Commission listened to heart felt testimony from individuals who described the overwhelming experience of trying to blindly navigate through a system they knew little or nothing about to get treatment for an illness they knew just as little or nothing about. Many who testified admitted that they did not realize that a member of their family was addicted or that they didn't see any of the signs unti l there was a crisis that brought it to the forefront. At the July 10, 2009, hearing a mother spoke about her oldest son's addiction to heroin: \"Until three years ago my only exposure to heroin had been in the movie s and popular culture. I had never known anyone who had used it, and never thought it woul d ever become a part of my reality. But it did.\" Many individuals stated in their testimony that they lived in an \" idyllic\" neighborhood, raised \"good kids\" and didn't know that such \"hard\" drugs were even being us ed or could be purchased within their community. National surveys of substance abuse, including t he 1999 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, \"strongly suggest that most new users of heroin are young,\" exemplifying the fact that today's opiate addict and opiate addiction cannot longer be confined to the old stereotypes of an older street addict lurking in the shadows of an urban high rise and shooting up in an alleyway. 158 Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 55 The Commission listened to individuals as they provided testimony det ailing how painful and exhausting it was when discovering a loved one was addicted to opiates and the shame and isolation that followed. They described feeling embarrassed and that they were reluctant and scared to tell anyone about the situation. Their lack of information and desperation to do anything to help their loved one caused them to franticly search for answers, often times resulting with more questions and feelings of helplessness. The longer the addiction goes untreated, the higher the chance those m embers of the family who are not addicted will also develop destructive behaviors such as denial , enabling and co- dependency. 159 Research has shown that when an alcoholic or drug addict is progres sing with the disease, the loved ones in their lives often become worse off than the addict themselves and suffer from emotional and psychological stress. 160 In addition, these individuals often suffer from physical problems such as headaches, allergies, insomnia, and cardiovascular disease. 161 At the July 10, 2009 hearing held in Hyannis, another mother spoke about needing trea tment for not only the addict in her family but everyone in her family. She sai d that the support they received help them make some of the most difficult decisions they would have t o make but it was, \"the best thing we could have done, for it brought us to where we are today- recovery for not only for our son, but for the whole family.\" Education and support for the family will bring much stabi lity into the life of chaos that they are experiencing. The Commission identifies that the role of the family needs to be valued and recognized in the delivery of drug treatment and has the following recommends: Increasing availability, access and funding to family services and peer support groups to ensure that families are given all options regarding treatme nt and services both for families and individuals with substance use disorder. Increasing access to information on drug overdoses so that parents and loved ones have the lifesaving tools in the event of an emergency. Increasing availability, access and funding to family services and peer sup port groups to ensure that families are given all options regarding treatment and servic es both for families and individuals with substance use disorder. The support and education received in this type of program provides a valuabl e tool for loved ones to cope with the different stages of addiction and recovery and ha ve proved effective. These programs support family members in addressing their own unwarranted s elf-blame and alleviate the feelings of pain and suffering caused by the shame and isola tion of this disease. Often times the isolation and stigma attached to addiction cause families to suffer in silence. Many family members find the support they need from the members who lead and partic ipate in these groups; as they educate and involved loved ones and family members in the treat ment and recovery process. Local and national peer groups, such as Al-Anon, Nar-Anon, Learn to Cope, and the Massachusetts Organization for Addiction Recovery (MOAR) offer the friends and family members of individuals who are addicted a safe and supportive environment t o learn about the Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 56 disease, care for their loved ones, and themselves. The 2006 Al-Anon Family Groups Member Survey stated that members were \"significantly affected\" by another person's drinking. It was also reported that 82 percent of the responders stated that their att endance and participation within the group much improved their mental health, 58 percent reported \"muc h improved\" overall health status and 73 percemt reported \"much improved\" daily f unctioning at home, school and work. 162 These groups offer individuals who feel very much alone, a connection to those who have or are currently going through a similar situation and strength to ca rry on. Increasing access to information on drug overdoses so that parents and loved ones have the lifesaving tools in the event of an emergency. Programs such as the Opioid Overdose Prevention and Reversal Project in the Commonwealth should be utilized to prevent dangerous overdoses. Further, parents and loved ones should be trained in administering Naloxone in the event of a opioid overdose. Acc ording to research, \"death from a heroin overdose most commonly occurs 1 to 3 hours after i njection, most deaths occur in the company of other people and that medical help is not sought or is sought too late. 163 The estimated mortality rate in heroin overdoses managed at home is 10 percent.164 Beginning in Europe and Australia in the mid-1990s and moving to the Uni ted States in the 1999, naloxone is intravenous or intranasal prescription, with no abuse potential . Naloxone effectively blocks the opioids and restores normal breathing when used on an individual experiencing a drug overdose. 165 Currently, 11 communities participate in the pilot project in the Commonwealth. The Opioid Overdose Prevention and Reversal Project offer s counseling and referrals to substance abuse treatment for all participants who are misusing opioids. These programs train opioid users, their families and their friends on how to prevent and recognize an opioid overdose, and what to do if one occurs. 166 In addition to training individuals on using the prescription naloxone, the programs cover the importance of calling 9 -1-1, how to perform rescue breathing, how to administer nasal naloxone, and how to provide aft er-naloxone care. 167 The Commonwealth has seen some of the most promising results of any community using naloxone with enrollment to date in the program at over 3,000 with 350 reported reversals. Naloxone Prescription Programs in the United States 1999-2007 City/State Year of Establishment Number of Trainings/ Prescriptions Number of Reported Overdose Reversals Chicago 1999 4600 416 New Mexico 2001 1312 222 San Francisco 2003 650 141 Baltimore 2004 951 131 New York City 2005 938 73 Massachusetts 3000 350 Sporer, Karl A. MD and Alex H. Kral, PhD. Prescript ion Naloxone: A Novel Approach to Heroin Overdose Prevention. Annals of Emergency Medicine. Vol. 49, No. 2: Feb 2007. 172-177. Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 57 These programs have proven effective and lifesaving in the communiti es they have been administered. Thus, the Commission recommends increasing funding to ex pand the current pilot program to a statewide program in all communities. At the Commis sion hearing in Fall River on May 15, 2009, Joanne Peterson, founder of Learn to Cope, set her prescription for Narcan out of the table as she began to testify and spoke about how she and other p arents in the area carry Narcan in case they must use the lifesaving medication on an overdose victim. Thes e individuals are well-trained in administering the drug and know the proper follow up steps to ensure a continuum of care. New Mexico saw a 20 percent decrease in overdose deaths after the state Department of Health began a naloxone distribution program in 2001. 168 The Commission recommends increasing access to this lifesaving program and providing continuing support to parents and families seeking use of Narcan and other similar drugs. Federal Issues In many ways the opiate epidemic in Massachusetts and around the c ountry started at the federal level with the failure of the Food and Drug Administration to adequat ely monitor prescription medications. Federal issues are intertwined throughout many of the recommendations in this report; however, the Commission felt it necessary to include a sep arate section in the report on the specific issues that are beyond the purview. The following a reas have been identified as key components to federal interaction with the Commonwealth in reaction to the opioid epidemic . Federal law enforcement and regulatory programs must be involved i n the policing of illegal prescription drug activity on the internet. Mental health parity must be strengthened nationally to include pr ovisions for substance abuse coverage by insurance companies. Continued and increased assistance from the Massachusetts Congress ional delegation in obtaining funding for vital programs in the Commonwealth. Continued progress is necessary in regards to prescription medicat ion monitoring through the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) process at the Federal Drug Administration. The Commission believes that for the state to be truly success ful in combating the problem of addiction, coordination with the federal government is essential in the above areas. Swift action should be taken by the federal government to engage the state in capac ity building measures and better equip the state the handle the opioid epidemic the state is facing. Federal law enforcement must be involved in the policing of illegal pre scription drug activity on the internet. As was mentioned in the Interdiction section of this report, internet monitoring is acknowledged as a federal issue with little state interaction. The fed eral government is best equipped to take steps to counteract the illegal prescription market online. The Dr ug Enforcement Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 58 Administration, along with the American Medical Association and sta te boards of medicine and pharmacy have all condemned the illegal activity of filling a pr escription through so-called \"cyber doctors.\"169 While many individuals use the internet to legally obtain prescr iptions at a lower cost, the internet has become an increasingly dangerous place to purc hase prescription pain relievers. Unreliable suppliers, faulty dosages, expired medicat ion and lack of warnings and directions all contribute to this faulty industry. The Commission t herefore recommends that federal law enforcement increase their involvement in internet poli cing for illegal narcotics prescription websites and that more federal dollars go towards this important pr ogram. Mental health parity must be strengthened nationally to include provisions for substance abuse coverage by insurance companies. Nationally, mental health parity lagged behind those of individual stat es. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the first federal legislation to require mental health benefits, prohibit the use of special annual and prohibit lifetime dollar limits on coverage for s ervices associated with mental health. 170 The bill was reauthorized most recently in 2007. The law does not e xplicitly list substance use disorder and a mandated benefit or mandated offering, but r ather instructs the Comptroller General to issue a study on the implementation of a m andated substance abuse treatment requirement for insurance companies. At this time it is unclear about any potential changes to the legislation that may occur to include substance abuse in the definition of mental health parity. Assistance from the Massachusetts Congressional delegation in obtaining fundi ng for vital programs in the Commonwealth. Better coordination with the Massachusetts Congressional delegation , officials in Massachusetts must acquire the resources for innovative programs such as jail diver sion and recovery high schools. The Commission believes that the Commonwealth could greatly benefit from a dditional funding and resources from the federal government, especially in the areas of treatment and prevention. The Obama Administration is developing a new model for drug addiction policy in the United States and there is evidence showing that the focus is on treatment and prevention measures. As this process continues, the state must concentrate on harnessing the possible new federal dollars in these areas to improve current programs and install new ones. Continued progress is necessary towards prescription medication monitoring t hrough the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) process at the Federal D rug Administration. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was given the authori ty to assess drug and biological products for the risks they pose to those taking them. A dditionally, the FDA was given the authority to use the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strat egy (REMS) to deem a drug unsafe and issue regulations on the proper use of the medication. This y ear the FDA issued new guidelines regarding the re-evaluation of certain opioid drug products previously approved by the federal guidelines. A total of 24 products were called in for eval uation, including Hydromorphone, OxyCodone, Fentanyl and Methadone. The FDA is planning on holding a series of public meetings regarding prescription medication safet y, some of which have already Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin Commission - 59 occurred, with the hopes of issuing new guidelines for the medications l ater this year. This process is essential to the original intent of the FDA and wi ll ensure that the FDA is mitigating risk of these powerful prescription medications. The Commonwealth must engage the Congressional delegation at all le vels in the reform process and ensure that as the Commission moves forward with policy recommenda tions the federal government is kept involved. Conclusion Throughout the many hours of Commission testimony and conversations wit h citizens in the Commonwealth who deal with substance abuse on a daily basis, it is e vident to the Commission that more must be done to provide for this vulnerable and often overlooked popul ation. The face of addiction has drastically changed in the last 30 years and no longer is an individual with substance use disorder one who should be shunned and pushed to the bottom of the list for adequate services. Each day in the Commonwealth, two citizens die of an opioid-related ove rdose. This statistic is a call to action for the state to reconsider long-standing polic ies surrounding substance abuse and treatment. We are faced with a public health crisis. Like any other public health emergency, whether the pandemic influenza infection of the early part of the last century, the polio epidemic of the 1950's, the HIV/AIDs health crisis, or the rapid spread of H1N1 inf luenza we face today, resources must be allocated to minimize the scourge that is subs tance abuse disorder and, specifically, opiate abuse and addiction. Unlike some of these crise s, there is no vaccine or medication that offers hope of elimination. We must concentrate our e fforts at every interstice where we can lessen the impact of this dreaded disease. In addressing the opiate epidemic the one thing we do understand is that there is not a one size fits all solution. The treatment community is divided between two philosophies. Those who believe in medication assisted treatment, such as methadone and buprenor phine/suboxone, and those who believe in abstinence. While there are merits to both side s, and the Commission does not endorse one mode of treatment over another, as long as there is evidence that supports a specific mode of treatment or a method of prevention, it must be consi dered. The Commission has suggested an ambitious set of recommendations for the Commonwea lth to adopt and while the policy process can be tedious at times, we must continue to fig ht for the individuals who are suffering from the deadly disease of addiction.

Exhibit N 1 COMMENDATIONS OF THE GOVERNOR'S OPIOID WORKING GROIJP JIJNE tt, 2015 WWW.MA~.GOV /STOPAD0It1ION Overview The Commonwealth has a long history of trying to combat addiction. We began to address the harm of opioids in 2004, when 456 individuals died of an opioid overdose. Since 2004, more than 6,600 members of our community have died, and behind those deaths are thousands of hospital stays, emergency department visits, and unquantifiable human suffering. We are in the midst of an epidemic. Our response requires a strong partnership between the medical community, law enforcement, the judiciary, insurers , providers, health and human services agencies, elected officials, and the public. Our law enforcement agencies are a critical part of the opioid solution; however, we cannot arrest our way out of this epidemic. These recommendations aim to ensure access to pain medication for individuals with chronic pain while reducing opportunities for individuals to access and use opioids for nonmedical purposes. The Commonwealth must build upon and accelerate the prevention, intervention, treatment, and recovery support strategies recommended by prior task forces and commissions and acted upon by the legislature. Equally important, we must implement BOLD NEW STRATEGIES . To that end, the working group developed more than 65 actionable recommendations for the administration to consider for implementation. The challenge is great. Addiction is a complex disease. There are no easy or quick solutions, nothing short of a comprehensive approach to this opioid epidemic will turn the tide of overdose deaths and reduce the harms that opioids are inflicting upon individuals, families and our communities . 2 COMMONWEALTIIOFMASSAO- IUSCTTS RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE OPIOID WORKING GROUP Objective Produce actionable recommendations to address the opioid epidemic in the Commonwealth Goals Reduce the magnitude and severity of harm related to opioid misuse and addiction Decrease opioid overdose deaths in the Commonwealth To Meet the Objective the Working Group Hosted 4 listening sessions in Boston, Worcester, Greenfield, and Plymouth Held 11 in person meetings Received and examined documents and recommendations from more than 150 organizations Heard from more than 1,100 individuals from across the Commonwealth Reviewed academic research, government reports, and reports of previous task forces and commissions 3 4 1987 : Commonwealth announces to halt sending civilly committed women to the correctional facility in Framingham 1 1992 : Commonwealth establishes the prescription monitoring program (PMP) 2010 : Legislature: Requires practitioners to receive training on: Pain management; Identifying patients as high risk for substance abuse; Counseling patients about the side effects, addictive nature, and proper storage and disposal of prescription medications 11 2015 1994 30 Years of Combatting Addiction in the Commonwealth 2011: DPH issues report on Alcohol & Drug Free Housing12 2004 : Legislature: Establishes Massachusetts OxyContin and Other Drug Abuse Commission6 2006: Massachusetts OxyContin and Other Drug Abuse Commission issues report7 2012: Legislature: Reforms prescribing practices, requiring: Automatic enrollment into the PMP for practitioners Tamper resistant prescription forms Dissemination of educational materials when a pharmacist dispenses a schedule II or III drug Prescription lock boxes be sold at pharmacies14 2006 2012: Substance Use Prevention Education: A cost analysis report issued 15 2011 : Legislature: Reforms \u00a735 civil commitment statute, increasing the maximum time that a person may be held from 30 days to 90 days Funds expansion of \u00a735 services13 2013 : Legislature: Requires practitioners to utilize the PMP prior to issuing a schedule II or III drug to a patient for the first time Funds expansion of \u00a7 35 services 16 2014 : Legislature: Establishes trust fund to increase access to treatment Requires BSAS to establish a helpline and website for consumers to be informed of available treatment Authorizes pharmacists to dispense Narcan (naloxone) Requires DPH to certify Alcohol and Drug Free Homes that meet specific guidelines17 2014 : Legislature: Mandates minimum insurance coverage for ATS/CSS - effective October 1, 2015 Requires pharmacists to dispense interchangeable abuse deterrent drugs Requires hospitals to report incidents of substance exposed newborns Requires regulations that mandate coordination of care and discharge planning for BSAS licensed facilities 18 2014 2012 2013 2011 2009 : Legislature: Authorizes recovery high schools 9 2009 : Recommendations of the OxyContin and Heroin Commission submitted to the legislature10 2008 : Legislature: Establishes commission to investigate the impact of OxyContin and Heroin on state and municipal government8 2009 2008 2004 2010 June 2015: Working group submits recommendations21 February 2015: Governor Baker appoints opioid working group20 2014: Findings of the Opioid Task Force and DPH Recommendations released 19 1987 1996 : SJC Chief Justice Liacos states that substance abuse programs prevent crime; estimating that between 85% and 90% percent of criminals have a substance abuse problem3 2000 : Legislature: Mandates parity for behavioral health treatment4 1992 2000 2015 1996 2010 : Commonwealth issues Substance Abuse Strategic Plan2 Sources listed in Appendix A 5 338468429549 456525615 614561599 526603668888 6009671,008 02004006008001,0001,200 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Number of deathsOpioid -Related Deaths, Unintentional/Undetermined Massachusetts: 2000 -2014 Confirmed EstimatedMA Department http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/quality/drugcontrol/county -level -pmp/data -brief -apr-2015 -overdose -county.pdf 6 MA Department of Public Health Data, February 2015 7 1. Create new pathways to treatment Too many individuals seeking treatment utilize acute treatment services (ATS) as their entry point, even when a less acute level of treatment may be appropriate. By creating new entry points to treatment and directing individuals to the appropriate level of care, capacity will be managed more efficiently and the Commonwealth will be better able to meet the demand for treatment. 2. Increase access to medication-assisted treatment Medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder (e.g. methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) has been shown to reduce illicit opioid use, criminal activity, and opioid overdose death. Increasing capacity for long-term outpatient treatment using medications as well as incorporating their use into the correctional health system, can be a life-saving intervention. 3. Utilize data to identify hot spots and deploy appropriate resources By the time DPH receives overdose death data from the medical examiner, the data is stale. The Commonwealth should partner with law enforcement and emergency medical services to obtain up- to-date overdose data, which can be used to identify hot spots in a timely manner and allocate resources accordingly. 4. Acknowledge addiction as a chronic medical condition Primary care practitioners must screen for and treat addiction in the same way they screen for and treat diabetes or high blood pressure. This will expedite the process for timely interventions and referrals to treatment. 5. Reduce the stigma of substance use disorders The stigma associated with a substance use disorder (SUD) is a barrier to individuals seeking help and contributes to: the p oor mental and physical health of individuals with a SUD; non-completion of substance use treatment; higher rates of recidivism; delayed recovery and reintegration processes; and increased involvement in risky behavior. The Working Group's KEY STRATEGIES: COMMONWEALTIIOFMASSAO- IUSCTTS RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE OPIOID WORKING GROUP 8 6. Support substance use prevention education in schools Early use of drugs increases a youth's chances of developing addiction. Investing in the prevention of youth's first use is c ritical to reducing opioid overdose deaths and rates of addiction. 7. Require all practitioners to receive training about addiction and safe prescribing practices Opioids are medications with significant risks; however, safer opioid prescribing practices can be accomplished through education. 8. Improve the prescription monitoring program The Commonwealth's prescription monitoring program (PMP) is an essential tool to identify sources of prescription drug diversion. By improving the ease of use of the PMP and enhancing its capabilities, it will no longer be an underutilized resource. 9. Require manufacturers and pharmacies to dispose of unused prescription medication Reducing access to opioids that are no longer needed for a medical purpose will reduce opportunities for misuse. 10. Acknowledge that punishment is not the appropriate response to a substance use disorder Arrest and incarceration is not the solution to a substance use disorder. When substance use is an underlying factor for criminal behavior, the use of specialty drug courts are effective in reducing crime, saving money, and promoting retention in drug treatment. It is important that treatment occur in a clinical environment, not a correctional setting, especially for patients committed civilly under section 35 of chapter 123 of the General Laws. 11. Increase distribution of Naloxone to prevent overdose deaths Naloxone saves lives. It should be widely distributed to individuals who use opioids as well as individuals who are likely to witness an overdose. 12. Eliminate insurance barriers to treatment Removing fail first requirements and certain prior authorization practices will improve access to treatment. By enforcing par ity laws, the Commonwealth can ensure individuals have access to behavioral health services.

Disorder as a Chronic Disease with Periods of Acute Needs and Periods of Stability Increase points of entry to treatment, eliminating the need for individuals to access other levels of care only through acute treatment services (ATS) and clinical stabilization services (CSS) Establish and promote a longitudinally based treatment system and continuum of care Increase Treatment Access by Matching Demand and Capacity Develop a real -time, statewide database of available treatment services, making information available via phone and the internet Increase the number of post -ATS/CSS beds (transitional support service, residential recovery homes) Fund patient navigators and case managers to ensure a continuum of care Pilot a program that provides patients with access to an emergent or urgent addiction assessment by a trained clinician and provides direct referral to the appropriate level of care Establish revised rates for recovery homes, effective July 1, 2015 16 Finding 1: Individuals in crisis cannot access the right level of treatment at the right time Recommendations Related to Treatment Increase Access to Evidence-Based Medication-Assisted Treatment Increase the number of office-based opioid treatment and the number of practitioners prescribing buprenorphine and naltrexone Enforce and strengthen the requirement that all licensed addiction treatment programs accept patients on an opioid agonist therapy Promote Integration of Mental Health, Primary Care, and Opioid Treatment Create a consistent public behavioral health policy by conducting a full review of all DPH and DMH licensing regulations for outpatient primary care clinics, outpatient mental health clinics, and BSAS programs removing all access barriers Explore state mechanisms to establish opioid treatment programs as Health Homes Conduct a review of the license renewal process for programs accredited by The Joint Commission or Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF)

Acetaminophen Hepatotoxicity: Acetaminophen has been associated with severe hepatotoxicity following acute and chronic ingestion. Maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen for adults is 4 grams/day . Be sure to consider and ask about all potential sources of acetaminophen (e.g., OTC, combination analgesics) when determining daily acetaminophen dose. Risk may increase with concurrent alcohol use, underlying liver disease, and/or the fasting state. PA is r equir ed for any acetaminophen-containing product that exceeds 4 grams/day . Aspirin Dose Limit: The maximum recommended dose of aspirin for adults is 4 grams/day .3/1/2019 MassHealth Drug List - Health and Human Services https://masshealthdruglist.ehs.state.ma.us/MHDL/pubtheradetail.do?id=8 3/18morphine controlled- release tabletMS Contin PA PA r equir ed for any aspirin- containing pr oduct that exceeds 4 grams/day .

Duplicate Opioid Therapy: Standard practice in chronic pain management includes a long-acting opioid for chronic pain and a short- acting opioid for acute/breakthrough pain as needed. PA is requir ed for two long- acting opioids for > two months. PA is r equir ed for two short- acting opioids for > two months. Allergy: True systemic opioid aller gy, such as a generalized rash, or angioedema, is unusual. A local, itchy wheal formation at the site of narcotic injection, generalized pruritus (no rash), or flushing may occur , and is due to histamine release. Renal Dysfunction: Accumulation of certain opioids in patients with significant renal dysfunction can lead to excess sedation, respiratory depression, delirium, myoclonus, or seizures. avoid use: Analgesics Drug Generic NameDrug Brand NamePA Status acetaminophen * PA stool softener in combination with acetaminophen: Generically available solution formulations continue to be available without P A within dose limits.

Exhibit P Massachusetts Department of Public Health Findings of the Opioid Task Force and Department of Public Health Recommendations on Priorities for Investments in Prevention, Intervention, Treatment and Recovery June 10, 2014 1 Executive Summary In response to the growing opioid addiction epidemic in Massachusetts , and across the nation , Governor Patrick declared a public health emergency on March 27, 2014 . The Governor directed the Department of Public Health (DP H) to take several action s to combat overdoses, stop the opioid epidemic from getting worse, help those already addicted to r ecover , and map a long -term solution to ending widespread opi oid abuse in the Commonwealth. Per the Governor's directive, DPH utilized the Executive Committee of the Interagency Council on Substance Abuse and Prevention to create the O pioid Task Force (Task Force). This Task Force was charged with providing recommendations to strengthen the Commonwealth's opioid abuse prevention and treatment systems to reduce overdose events, prevent opioid misuse and addiction, increase the numbers o f persons seeking treatment, and support persons recovering from addiction in our communities. This report summarizes the findings of the Task Force and provides recommendations for strengthening our Commonwealth's ability to respond to the opioid crisis with a focus on prevention, intervention, treatment and recovery . These recommendations include, but are not limited to , the expansion of treatment beds; the formation of a centralized navigation system for patients, families, and first responders to loc ate treatment services ; a public -facing dashboard that would help facilitate consumer choice of services ; additional opioid prevention coalitions for support and education ; more stringent safeguards for those opioids which are most frequently abused and misused ; a meeting of New England governors to develop a regional response to the opioid epidemic; and the expansion of the use of injectable naltrexone for persons re -entering the community from correctional facilities. Since the convening of this Task Force, the Massachusetts L egislature has also taken action s to address the opioid epidemic in Massachusetts. The recommendations included in this report complement the Legislature's proposals, and DPH looks forward to continuing to work closely with the Legislature on the important issue of opioid misuse, abuse and overdose. 2 Despite having one of the strongest treatment systems in the country as measured by the robust continuum of care offered and the presence of dedicated addiction treatment providers, there are still opportunities for improvement. DPH believes that with the policy recommendations made here, particularly with an emphasis on safe opioid prescribing, the Department will be able to help those struggling with addiction, their loved ones and communities. Introduction Massachusetts is experiencing an opioid addiction epidemic. From 2000 to 2012 the number of unintentional fatal opioid overdoses in Massachusetts increased by 90 percent.1 In 2012, 668 Massachusetts residents died from unintentional opioid overdoses, a 10 percent increase over the previous year.2 The Massachusetts State Police reported that in jurisdictions in which they respond to homicides at least 140 people died of su spected heroin overdoses between November 2013 and March 2014. Various communities in the Commonwealth have reported previously unseen spikes in both fatal and non -fatal opioid overdose in recent months. The Department of Public Health (DPH) Bureau of Su bstance Abuse Services (BSAS) data shows that in FY13 nearly half of all persons receiving treatment in the publicly funded system reported opioids as their primary or secondary drug of choice. In addition, approximately 40 percent of persons served in FY 13 in the BSAS system were between the ages of 13 and 29. Massachusetts is not alone in struggling with the devastating consequences of opioid misuse, abuse and addiction. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services deemed prescription -opioid overdose deaths an epidemic.3 In the United States, deaths from 1 Fatal Opioid -related Overdoses Among MA Residents, 2000 -2013.

Available at: http://www.cdc.gov/homeandre creationalsafety/overdose/hhs_rx_abuse.html 9, 3 prescription opioid overdose quadrupled between 1999 and 2010.4 People who are abusing opioids are also at high risk for, among other things, liver disease, Hepatitis C, and HIV infe ction.5 Opioid addicted individuals live approximately 15 years less than people who do not have the disease.6 Opioid addiction is a chronic disease, which like other chronic illnesses, cannot be cured but can be effectively treated and managed.7 On Marc h 27, 2014, in response to the crisis of opioid abuse in the Commonwealth and after meeting individuals and families impacted by it, Governor Patrick declared a public health emergency and, among other actions , committed an additional $20 million in state funding to increase treatment and recovery services and directed the Commissioner of the Department of Public Health to establish an Opioid Task Force (Task Force) within the Interagency Council on Substance A buse and Prevention (Council). The Task Force was charged with providing recommendations to reduce overdose events, prevent opioid misuse and addiction, increase the numbers of persons seeking addiction treatment, support persons recovering from addiction in our communities , and map a long term solution to address opioid abuse in the Commonwealth. This report contains a description of the Task Force's methodology , an overview of substance abuse services offered by the Commonwealth, findings from the Task Force's deliberations, and actions recommended by DPH in response to the Task Force's work and findings . Task Force Methodology In addition to the Executive Committee of the Council, the membership of the Task Force included those struggling with addiction and their families, providers, insurers, first responders, public safety officials, local 4 Jones CM, Mack KA, Paulozzi LJ.

The mission of the Task Force was to develop recommendations to improve on the Commonwealth's current efforts to (1) prevent opioid abuse, addiction and overdose; (2) educate the public about opioid addiction and treatment options; (3) facilitate access to treatment though improved care coordination; (4) expand the current treatment system; (5) ensure access to the full continuum of treatment services by all insurers; (6) divert non -violent criminal offenders with substance use disorders to ap propriate treatment; (7) assist persons with addictive disorders re -entering the community from correctional facilities to maintain opioid abstinence; and (8) expand community based recovery supports. Given the urgency of the opioid epidemic and taking int o consideration the 60-day time frame in which to consider and develop recommendations, the Task Force formed focus groups (Appendix V) to maximize stakeholder input and to allow for a comprehensive overview of the current system. A total of 19 focus grou ps and/or interviews were held with stakeholders from across the Commonwealth, including persons who were actively using opioids, persons in recovery, parents, prevention coalitions, law enforcement, members of the judiciary, state agency representatives, schools and colleges, behavioral health providers, pharmacists, hospitals, emergency room physicians, physicians specializing in addiction medicine, first responders and insurers. As previously noted, approximately 40 percent of persons served in FY13 in the BSAS system were between the ages of 13 and 29, so particular attention was given to this age group when discussing priorities. The Task Force met as a committee of the whole three times. During the first meeting, the Task Force members discussed th e opioid problem and its charge, agreed upon the focus group approach, and brainstormed potential investments. During the second meeting, members reviewed and commented on early findings and proposed recommendations from the initial focus groups , which ca n be found in Appendix IV . During the final meeting, the Task Force members reviewed a series of focus group recommendations and provided feedback to DPH on those 5 recommendations. Finally, DPH reviewed and prioritized those recommendations based on their ability to have a positive impact on the public health emergency in the short and long term. Overview of Massachusetts Substance Abuse Services Massachusetts has one of the strongest substance abuse t reatment systems in the country .8 The Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS) is the single state authority on substance abuse and provides a robust system that provides services across the full continuum of care. The BSAS is charged with licensing addiction treatment programs as defined in 105 CMR 16 4.012, licensing addiction counselors as defined in 105 CMR 168.000, and funding a continuum of prevention, intervention, treatment and recovery support services . The BSAS also sets policy in this area and serves as the payer of last resort for persons se eking treatment services who are either uninsured or underinsured. The types of services are summarized below. Prevention The BSAS prevention efforts include funding community based primary prevention campaigns across the state aimed at preventing the mis use and abuse of, and addiction to, alcohol and other drugs. Other BSAS prevention efforts include the development of print materials and media campaigns to educate various stakeholders about the consequences of underage drinking and the misuse of alcohol and other drugs, the dissemination of evide nce based prevention practices and the expansion of education about addictive disorders in various training programs for health professionals , including physicians and allied health professionals. 8 See, for example, treatment rates as documented in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N -SSATS), 2011. Population: U.S. Census Bureau, Population Estimates, State population - SCPRC -EST2009 -18+POP -RES. From: The Ce nter for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Available at: http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DASIS/2k11nssats/NSSATS 2011Tbl6.33.htm . Accessed on: June 5, 2014. 6 Intervention The BSAS intervention efforts include providing funding to groups that support and advocate for individuals and families dealing with addictive disorders such as the Massachusetts Organization for Addiction Recovery (MOAR) and Learn to Cope. The Massachusetts Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution program is a model for the nation in terms of how to widely distribute naloxone (sometimes referred to as Narcan ), a lifesaving medication that can reverse opioid overdose, to persons likely t o witness an opioid overdose. Treatment The BSAS provides a full continuum of licensed treatment services in inpatient, residential and outpatient treatment settings. In FY13 there were approximately 40,000 enrollments to the BSAS -funded acute treatmen t services (ATS) or detoxification programs. The primary purpose of these programs is to medically treat withdrawal symptoms in persons dependent upon opioids, alcohol or other drugs. Specialized services are available to those under 18 through Youth Sta bilization Programs. Detoxification services are paid for by commercial insurers, MassHealth and other public payers, and the BSAS. Typically, individuals remain in detox programs for 4-6 days. Best practice dictates that persons in these programs shoul d continue in \"step -down\" treatment services in order to maximize their potential for continued abstinence from drugs of abuse. Focus groups that included active consumers, consumers in recovery and family members all emphasized this point. There are a number of step -down services available, including Clinical Stabilization Service (CSS) programs which provide a range of services, including nursing, intensive education and counseling on the nature of addiction and its consequences, relapse prevention and a ftercare planning for individuals beginning to engage in recovery. The usual length of inpatient stay in a CSS program is 10 -14 days. These programs are paid for by MassHealth, the BSAS and some commercial insurers. Transitional Support Service (TSS) pr ograms are another example of a short term 7 residential \"step -down\" service. The expected length of stay in these programs is up to 30 days. TSS services provide intensive care management services to prepare individuals for long -term residential rehabilit ation or a return to the community. TSS services are solely funded with the BSAS dollars. Residential rehabilitation treatment programs feature a planned program of substance abuse treatment withi n a 24 -hour residential setting located in the community. These residential treatment programs serve individuals in the early stages of addiction recovery, where safe and stable living environments are essential to recovery . Residential rehabilitation facilities primarily serve adults, but there are some facili ties that focus on youth or families. Individuals and families typically receive treatment in residential settings for 6 -12 months while youth programs are generally 3 months in duration. Like TSS, residential rehabilitation is only funded by the BSAS. Outpatient substance abuse treatment is also available across the state. Paid for to varying extents by commercial insurers, MassHealth and other public payers, and the BSAS, services may include individual, group and family counseling, intensive day treatment and educational services. A subset of outpatient programs focus on providing services to individuals dually diagnosed with substa nce abuse and mental health conditions, persons who have been convicted of driving under the influence of substances and/or adolescents. Many opioid addicted people utilize outpatient medication assisted treatment (MAT) services. Opioid Treatment Progra ms (OTP) provide methadone dosing services in combination with an array of other services including counseling, drug screening and case management services. Buprenorphine, sometimes known as suboxone, is another example of MAT. Buprenorphine is available to patients in physician offices. This arrangement is called Office Based Opioid Treatment (OBOT). In order to prescribe buprenorphine, a physician must obtain a waiver from the Drug Enforcement Agency. Physicians are limited to providing OBOT to 30 individuals in the first year of receiving a waiver and up to 100 individuals thereafter. In 2012, injectable naltrexone, known as Vivitrol, was approved 8 for the treatment of opioid dependence. This medication can be prescribed by any qualified health prof essional, including mid -level practitioners , and is given in the form of an injection on a monthly basis in the prescriber's office. All of these medications are FDA approved for the treatment of opioid dependence and are shown to be effective in the scie ntific literature. Methadone treatment is primarily paid for by MassHealth and the BSAS, while buprenorphine and injectable naltrexone are paid for by MassHealth and the majority of commercial insurers. Some persons suffering from opioid addiction do no t see a need for treatment. When these persons pose a danger to themselves or others by virtue of their addictive behaviors, they may be involuntarily committed to treatment. Under Massachusetts General Law Chapter 123, Section 35 (Section 35), \"any poli ce officer, physician, spouse, blood relative, guardian or court official\" can petition the court to commit a \"person who he has reason to believe is an alcoholic or substance abuser\" if that abuse \"substantially injures his health or substantially interfe res with his social or economic functioning, or... he has lost the power of self -control over the use of such controlled substances.\" After reviewing the evidence to determine if the person is an immediate risk to himself or others, a judge may commit a per son to treatment for up to 90 days. There are specific treatment programs that focus on serving individuals who are committed to treatment through Section 35. Recovery is an ongoing process. Today, the BSAS funds 7 Recovery Support Centers (RSC) across the state staffed primarily by peer members in recovery. RSCs offer a drug -free environment and a variety of activities including classes, leisure activities and support group meetings. The BSAS also supports Recovery High Schools which provide a structu red school environment for high -school aged youth in recovery to maintain their recovery and complete their education. Case management services are provided to youth and adults in their homes to support their continued abstinence f rom substances in the co mmunity. 9 Task Force Findings with DPH Recommend ed Actions Below are the findings of the Task Force and DPH recommended actions in the areas of prevention, intervention, treatment, and recovery. The list of recommend ed investments in order of priority can also be found in Appendix I and additional policy and regulatory recommendations in Appendix II . When considering infrastructure investments, especially the addition of inpatient and residential treatment services, the current proposed expansion in the number of treatment beds was taken into account. For example, the Governor's FY15 budget already includes the addition of a new detoxification and clinical stabilization service and both the House and the Senate supported the addition of these 64 beds in their respective budget proposals. Furthermore, as of April 2014, DPH completed an expansion of 80 transitional support services beds and 200 long term residential beds for single adults. Additionally, the Governor's FY15 budget includes the addition of long term residential services under the trial court expansion budget, another initiative supported by the legislature. The Governor's current budget also calls for the expansion of 8 specialty courts to divert non -violent offenders. PREVENTION Finding: There is a n eed for i ncreased education for youth and families about the dangers of drug use. Task Force members emphasized the importance of ongoing education for children and parents about the dangers of drug use, the appropriate use of prescription pain medications and their potential addictive qualities. Focus groups also discussed the potenti al of leveraging community coalitions. Prevention programs designed and tested to reduce risk and increase awareness can help people of various ages develop and apply the skills necessary to stop problem behaviors before, and after, they begin. Research has demonstrated that research -based drug abuse prevention programs are cost -effective. Each dollar invested in prevention saves up to 10 7 dollars in areas such as substance abuse treatment and criminal justice system costs, not to mention their wider impa ct on the trajectory of young lives and their families .9 Recommend ed Action s The Governor should convene a meeting of New England governors to discuss a collective response to the opioid epidemic impact ing the region ; Develop a statewide evidence -based public service campaign on the prevention of addictive disorders targeted at youth and parents ; Add up to five new Opioid Overdose Prevention Coalitions in high need areas . Finding: There is a n eed for increased education for prescribers to ensure safe and effective pain management The diagnosis and treatment of pain is integral to the practice of medicine , and inappropriate treatment of pain, including both over -treatment and under -treatment, is an important problem . Providers must balance the legitimate needs of patients with pain against the dangers to the public of opioids circulating through communities . Prescribers reported that they would like enhanced education about the potential addictiveness of prescription pain medications, how to id entify at risk individuals, how to identify potential opioid abuse, and how to effectively taper people off of prescription pain medications without leading to addiction. Recommend ed Action Practitioners are already required by medical boards to complete training on pain management to renew their licenses. This training could be further enhanced, particularly around safe prescribing 9 National Institute on Drug Abuse. Topics in Brief: Drug Abuse Prevention. Revised March 2007. -in-brief/drug -abuse -prevention . Accessed on: June 5, 2014. 11 practices and managing of medications to decrease the risk of addiction. INTERVENTION Finding: Opportunities exist to improve safe prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances. Deaths from prescription opioid overdoses quadrupled from 1999 to 2010 and far exceed the combined toll of cocaine and heroin overdoses.10 At the same time, prescription opioid pain medications serve an important and legitimate role in the treatment of pain. Safe prescribing and dispensing practices are needed to decrease the risk of misuse and abuse while allow ing for the legitimate use of these important medications . Focus groups discussed the role of p harmacists in providing education to consumers at the time of dispensing , as well as potentially engaging with prescribers. Focus groups also discussed the utility and limitations of the Prescription Monitoring Program, and its role in preventing prescription drug misuse and abuse. Recommend ed Action s Review and develop regulations to promote the safe prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances, including the funding of necessary infrastructure to support these activities ; For those opioids which are most frequently abused and misused , DPH recommends that the DPH Drug Control Program propose regulations mandating all prescribers to utilize the PMP each time they issue a prescripti on for Schedule II or III drug s that have been determined by DPH to be commonly misused or abused and designated as a drug that needs additional safeguards ; 10 Jones CM, Mack KA, Paulozzi LJ. Pharmaceutical overdose deaths, United States, 2010. JAMA 2013;309:657 -659. 12 Task the various boards of registration, within and beyond DPH, with consideration of regulation s to minimize diversion and misuse while ensuring safe prescribing and patient access to medication ; Conside r additional safe prescribing recommendations to be issued by the Joint Policy Working Group. TREATMENT Finding: There is a n eed for centralized treatment resources . Task Force members discussed the challenges to accessing services in a timely manner, noting the importance of getting treatment within the window of opportunity when an individual is ready to accept it. Well- acce pted models recognize that treatment needs to be matched to the patient's acceptance of it for the treatment to be most successful . Across the focus groups , there was not a clear understanding of how to access the treatment network in Massachusetts . Focus group participants described the burden of having to call multiple programs on an ongoing basis to find available services. Recommend ed Actions Develop a central navigation system for adult services that can be accessed through an 800 number. The system would maintain a real time inventory of available substance abuse services across the continuum of care. Central navigation could be utilized to identify appropriate resources by consumers and their families, first responders, schools, and provider s. When contacted, intake staff would work, if appropriate, with the caller to place the person needing services in to the best available setting ; Establish p ilot regional walk -in centers that could coordinate with central navigation as needed. These centers could provide assessment , liaison with central intake to place the person in the best 13 treatment setting , daily clinically run group sessions , and emergency one-on-one counseling ; Develop and implement a public facing dashboard to facilit ate consumer choice by providing quality assessments and other information about treatment options . Finding: Individuals and families report challenges in access ing services beyond simply knowing where they are. Treatment is necessary to provide patients relief from physical withdrawal symptoms and to place patients on the road to recovery. Task Force members heard from several individuals struggling with addiction and their families who described difficulty in accessing treatment services. BSAS notes that approximately 40 percent of persons served in FY13 in the BSAS system were between the ages of 13 and 29, making this an important population to consider . In addition, 20 percent of 16 to 24 year olds served in the BSAS system in FY13 had chil dren under six , highlighting the need for services for families with children. Recommended Actions Add treatment programs with an emphasis on: Community -based treatment programs for youth a nd young adults to provide home -based counseling services ; Residential treatment programs for populations in need, including adolescents and transitional age youth, families, single adults with children, Hispanics , and residents in currently geographically underserved areas such as Franklin County ; and Clinical S tabilization Services program for step down services . Add funding to allow community health centers to increase capacity to provide medication assisted treatment including injectable naltrexone to people in the community. 14 Finding: Providers and consumer s express concerns about barriers to access Even when treatment is available, individuals and families may still have trouble accessing that treatment. For example, p roviders and consumers that participated in our focus group expressed the belief that insurers are too restrictive in authorizing certain care. Other issues that potentially affect access include housing issues and physician reluctance to receive authority to prescribe buprenorphine due to real and/or perceived burdensome regulatory requir ements. Stigma is also an important barrier to treatment . All of these factors can prevent individuals from obtaining the treatment they need as the first step to recovery. Recommended Actions DPH and the Division of Insurance, in consultation with the Health Policy Commission, should conduct a comprehensive review of medical necessity criteria and utilization review guidelines for opi oid abuse and addiction treatment developed by carriers and c onsult with clinical experts to develop minimum criteria for opioid abuse and addiction treatment services that will be considered medically necessary for all plans ; The Interagency Council on Substance Abuse and Prevention should expand its review of substance abuse issues to review interagency regulatory and operational barriers to treatment, such as loss of foster care placement, long wait periods for insurance coverage, lack of drug-free shelters, and physician reluctance to receive author ity to prescribe buprenorphine due to real and/or perceived burdensome regulatory requirements. Finding: Correctional facilities are an important site of care for opioid addiction. Task Force members noted the impact of opioid addiction on incarcerated individuals. Jails and prisons offer treatment for addiction on a voluntary 15 basis; however, in some facilities, individuals receive incentives to participate in treatment programs. Whether or not individuals have received treatment for their substance use while incarcerated, it is important to provide individuals support once they complete their sentence s. Otherwise, without that support, they may relapse, and this relapse could cause them to engage in behaviors that potentially result in re-incarceration. Recommended Actions Enhance the DOC's and Sheriff Offices' continuum of care by increasing the availability of treatment for offenders at designated DOC facilities . Specifically, DOC recommends implementing a basic substance abuse educatio n/motivation enhancement program targeting offen ders with substance abuse issue s, and a graduate maintenance and aftercare program for offenders who have completed the residential sub stance abuse treatment program . Currently, the DOC provides substance ab use treatment for inmates who are nearing release, as research has indicated that offenders receive the maximum benefits of treatment prior to release when they are focused on reentering the community ; Support the expansion of the use of injectable naltrexone for persons re-entering the comm unity from correctional facilities by providing funding for supportive case management services to ensure participants comply with their post -release treatment plan and assist them in navigating access to other cr itical services. RECOVERY Finding: There is a n eed for peer support in the recovery process . Research has shown that recovery is facilitated by social support. Peer recovery support services are designed and delivered by people who have experienced both substance use disorder and recovery. These services help people become and stay engaged in the recovery process and reduce 16 the likelihood of relapse. Because the y are designed and delivered by peers who have been successful in the recovery process, they embody a powerful message of hope, as well as a wealth of experiential knowledge. The services can effectively extend the reach of treatment beyond the clinical se tting into the everyday environment of those seeking t o achieve or sustain recovery. Focus group participants emphasized that opioid addiction is a chronic disease and recovery is an ongoing process that requir es ongoing supports. In addition, they empha sized the need to provide support services not just during normal business hours but on nights and weekends to provide safe, drug -free activities to support the recovery process. Recommended Actions Develop a peer to peer support network by encouraging the hiring of recovering peers to speak with at -risk youth and other special high risk populations , participate in a speakers bureau , and m eet with individuals at critical transition points such as in emergency rooms, time of arrest or when returning to the community. Finding : There is a need for expanded recovery services across the state. There are currently 7 Recovery Support Centers across the Commonwealth that operate 12 hours per day . People in recovery highlighted the value of these services and their desire to have increased access to them . Both the focus groups and Task Force recog nized that there is a need for expanded recovery support services focused on creating healthy commu nities that assist individuals maintain abstinence from drugs and alcohol after formal treatment has completed. Recommend ed Action s Augment the capacity of Recovery Support Centers by e xpand ing the hours of currently existing centers to include nights and weekend s and by adding new Recovery Support Centers ; 17 Add a Recovery High School in Worcester area ; Add Learn to Cope chapters across the Commonwealth ; DPH also recommends developing and implementing a voluntary accreditation program for Alcohol Drug -Free Living housing, also known as sober homes. These homes can provide affordable housing and are an important part of the continuum of recovery support in the community . Conclusion These recommendations are important steps towards addressing the Commonwealth's public health emergency. DPH appreciates the leadership of Governor Patrick and the commitment and hard work of Task Force members who contributed their time, ideas, and expertise to help the Commonwealth address the opi oid epidemic. Since the convening of the Task Force, the Massachusetts L egislature has taken steps to address the opioid epidemic in Massachusetts. The recommendations included in this report complement the Legislature's proposals and DPH looks forward to continuing to work closely with the Legislature on the important issue of opioid misuse, abuse , and overdose. Despite hav ing one of the strongest treatment systems in the country as measured by the robust continuum of care offered and the presence of dedicated addiction treatment providers, we still have opportunities for improvement. DPH believes that with Governor Patrick 's leadership and the policy recommendations made here, particularly with an emphasis on safe opioid prescribing, we will be able to help those struggling with addiction, their loved ones and impacted communities. 18 Appendix I: DPH Recommended Investments in Priority Order Recommendation Funding Estimate Annualized Pending Legislative Action Develop a central navigation system that could be accessed through an 800 number.

MO, MA NEW YOR~, NY LEN PAlJL-OZZI, MD, MPH ATALANTA, GA JON 5TRELTZER 1 MO HQNCUJL.;, H' ART VAN ZEE, MD $1, CHARL::S, 'JA The undersigned clinicians, researchers and health officials from fields that include Pain, Addiction, Primary Care, Internal Medicine, Anesthesiology, Psychiatry, Neurology, Emergency Medicine, Toxicology, Rheumatology, and Pubic Health submit this petition under Section 21 CFR 10.20 and 21 CFR 10.30 and other pertinent sections of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or any other statutory provision which authority has been delegated to the FDA Commissioner to regulate labeling of opioid analgesics. At present, the FDA-approved indication for nearly all analgesics is \"moderate to severe pain\". For extended-release opioids, the indication is for \"moderate to severe pain when a continuous, around-the clock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time.\" These overly broad indications imply a determination by FDA that they are safe and effective for long-term use. As outlined below, an increasing body of medical literature suggests that long-term use of opioids may be neither safe nor effective for many patients, especially when prescribed in high doses. Unfortunately, many clinicians are under the false impression that chronic opioid therapy (COT) is an evidence-based treatment for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) and that dose-related toxicities can be avoided by slow upward titration. These misperceptions lead to over-prescribing and high dose prescribing. By implementing the label changes proposed in this petition, FDA has an opportunity to reduce harm caused to chronic pain patients as well as societal harm caused by diversion of prescribed opioids. In addition, FDA will be able to reinforce adherence to dosing limits that have been recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control 1, the state ofWashington2 and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene3 The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act established that a drug intended to treat a condition must be proven safe and effective for use as labeled.4The current label on opioid analgesics does not comply with this law. By taking the actions requested in this petition, FDA will be able to exercise its regulatory responsibility over opioid manufacturers by prohibiting the marketing of opioids for conditions in which their use has not been proven safe and effective. 920 48th Street, Suite 1510 Brooklyn, b I eopioid prescribing. o rg SPECIFIC ACTIONS REQUESTED FOR CHANGES TO OPIOID ANALGESIC LABELS: I. Strike the term \"moderate\" from the indication for non-cancer pain. 2. Add a maximum daily dose, equivalent to 100 milligrams of morphine for non-cancer pain. 3. Add a maximum duration of 90-days for continuous (daily) use for non-cancer pain. STATEMENTS OF SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR PETITION: 1. Over the past decade, a four-fold increase in prescribing of opioid analgesics has been associated with a four-fold increase in opioid related overdose deaths and a six-fold increase in individuals seeking treatment for addiction to opioid analgesics. 5 2. Prescribing of opioids increased over the past 15 years in response to a campaign that minimized risks oflong-term use for CNCP and exaggerated benefits.6\u00b778 3. Long-term safety and effectiveness of managing CNCP with opioids has not been established.9 4. Recent surveys of CNCP patients receiving COT have shown that many continue to experience significant chronic pain and dysfunction. 1011 5. Recent surveys using DSM criteria found high rates of addiction in CNCP patients receiving COT.12.13 6. A large sample of medical and pharmacy claims records found that two-thirds of patients who took opioids on a daily basis for 90 days were still taking opioids five years later. 14 7. Patients with mental health and substance abuse co-morbidities are more likely to receive COT than patients who lack these risk factors, a phenomenon referred to as adverse selection.15 8. Three large observational studies published in 2010 and 2011 found dose-related overdose risk in CNCP patients on COT.1617'18 9. COT at high doses is associated with increased risk of overdose death 18, emergency room visits19 and fractures in the elderly2\u00b0. There is no environmental impact associated with this Citizen's Petition and we wish to be excluded under 21 CFR Sec. 25.24. The undersigned certifies, that, to the best knowledge and belief of the undersigned, this petition includes all information and views on which the petition relies, and that it includes representative data and information known to the petition which are unfavorable to the petition (21 CFR Sec.
