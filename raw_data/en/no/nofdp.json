Effective vaccination to eradicate the virus is the best approach to safeguarding the globe from it. Our study is considered one of the earliest studies conducted to determine the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. We started data collection from May 2021 till September 2021, which was the beginning period of vaccine distribution in Saudi Arabia. This study aims to look at potential side effects and factors that contribute to their occurrence. Methods: The optimal study design for achieving our goals was survey-based. Following Institutional Review Board approval, we created an online self-administered questionnaire using the Google survey webpage (Google LLC, Mountain View, California, United States). We disseminated the survey to 2293 individuals from May 2021 till September 2021 in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, to males and females above the age of 18 who have been vaccinated by either Pfizer or AstraZeneca in one dose or two doses. Results: The most prevalent side effect was pain at the injection site (60.7%), followed by general fatigue (23.8%) and swelling at the injection site (16.7%), with shortness of breath being the least common (0.9%). When the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine side effects was compared to the socio-demographic characteristics of participants, we discovered that those without associated comorbidity (p=0.025) and non-smoking participants (p=0.009) showed more side effects. On the other hand, those who received Pfizer vaccine (p0.001) and those who exercised regularly (p0.001) had lower rates of COVID-19 vaccine side effects. Also, obesity was shown to be the most commonly related disease in terms of comorbidities (8.5%), followed by allergy (4.9%) and asthma (4.6%). Conclusion: We find that vaccination against COVID-19 has only minor adverse effects. Therefore we anticipate that this study will assist in dispelling rumors about dangerous side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-07-26", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
