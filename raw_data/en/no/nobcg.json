If you are currently a shareholder in PFB Corporation ( [TSE:PFB](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/capital-goods/tsx-pfb/pfb-shares?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_source=yahoo&utm_campaign=Intro_ticker&blueprint=137004)), or considering investing in the stock, you need to examine how the business generates cash, and how it is reinvested. After investment, what's left over is what belongs to you, the investor. This also determines how much the stock is worth. I've analysed below, the health and outlook of PFB's cash flow, which will help you understand the stock from a cash standpoint. Cash is an important concept to grasp as an investor, as it directly impacts the value of your shares and the future growth potential of your portfolio. [ See our latest analysis for PFB ](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/capital-goods/tsx-pfb/pfb-shares?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_source=yahoo&utm_campaign=CTA_ticker&blueprint=137004) What is free cash flow? PFB's free cash flow (FCF) is the level of cash flow the business generates from its operational activities, after it reinvests in the company as capital expenditure. This type of expense is needed for PFB to continue to grow, or at least, maintain its current operations. There are two methods I will use to evaluate the quality of PFB's FCF: firstly, I will measure its FCF yield relative to the market index yield; secondly, I will examine whether its operating cash flow will continue to grow into the future, which will give us a sense of sustainability. Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flows - Net Capital Expenditure Free Cash Flow Yield = Free Cash Flow / Enterprise Value where Enterprise Value = Market Capitalisation + Net Debt Along with a positive operating cash flow, PFB also generates a positive free cash flow. However, the yield of 4.51% is not sufficient to compensate for the level of risk investors are taking on. This is because PFB's yield is well-below the market yield, in addition to serving higher risk compared to the well-diversified market index. What's the cash flow outlook for PFB? Can PFB improve its operating cash production in the future? Let's take a quick look at the cash flow trend the company is expected to deliver over time. In the next couple of years, the company is expected to grow its cash from operations at a double-digit rate of 44%, ramping up from its current levels of CA$7m to CA$9m in two years' time. Although this seems impressive, breaking down into year-on-year growth rates, PFB's operating cash flow growth is expected to decline from a rate of 48% next year, to -2.4% in the following year. But the overall future outlook seems buoyant if PFB can maintain its levels of capital expenditure as well. Next Steps: Although its positive operating cash flow, and high future growth, is appealing, the low free cash flow yield is unattractive. This is because you would be better compensated in terms of cash yield, by investing in the market index, as well as take on lower diversification risk. However, cash is only one aspect of investing. Keep in mind that cash is only one aspect of investment analysis and there are other important fundamentals to assess.
