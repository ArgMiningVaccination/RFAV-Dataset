I experienced dizziness, chest pain, rapid breathing, blurry vision, needle pain all over, dull pain in my head and arms, still got muscle and back pain today but minimal (on/off) and my rhinitis got worse. It was 2weeks of hell and its on and off then it dwindle down on the 3rd week. I can sleep well after that and I think my BODY wants me to get more rest too so I took a 20mins nap/day just to restore again. I tripped 3x to the hospital and get all of the tests and blood works, ALL came normal. I was prescribed with anxiety drugs to tone down the palpitations and diphenhydramine but I only took 2 tabs of diphenhydramine and never bothered the other one. I also took few pain reliever, antibiotics for 2 days and antihistamine again for my on and off rhinitis. But I only take them If I can't go through the day. I also started taking more supplements like 1000mg vit c, vit d, vit E (omega 3), Quercetin,and zinc (1000). I also drink 2L of water and eat proper food. I cut down my coffee and on my 3rd week I can do my usual workouts but light workout only. I live alone so I do most of the things and tend myself even I was ill. The symptoms I have now are blurry vision and less lightheadedness which is on and off too. I am functional at work as I work from home and can do my life and out errands too. I can exert more effort if I wanted to, but I don't force myself cos i don't want to go back to square one and i wanted to heal properly and observe all of my body reactions. I haven't done w MRI yet cos I don't have headache, fever etc, but I will avail it on my next yearly check up just to be sure. Here to those who are battling with these Side effects that you can get better and we will be back to our normal shape. I am now 98% better and praying my blurry vision and less lightheadedness will be over soon. I tried the vestibular workout too which it aids a bit of my dizziness. Hang in there guys, We will all get through this and I won't be getting the next dose again or will ever avail till I am fully recovered and secured with the next vaccine they'll produce. I am now focusing to get my old healthy self or my new healthy self after this ordeal. It takes time, each person has its own phase of recovery and I'm happy that my SE tone down even I still have some good and blahh days in between. Have a great day. Happy to be part of this community Lets stay healthy, happy and grateful each day. Your post gave me hopes. I am having chest pain since few days but it was very slight. A few minutes ago, had a bad one on the right side and it was unbearable. It has now reduced. Does the pain killer help in reducing this? How have you been feeling right now with all the symptoms especially the chest pain. Could you please share about the chest pain and how long it took for it to settle down completely? Were you on any medication? Please help! I'm fine now after having similar symptoms of dizziness. I took the first dose of the vaccine in the first week of June. I had chest pain immediately after taking the vaccine. For the next couple of days, I continued to have chest pain. I had silent reflux issues before, and the vaccine had possibly increased my acid reflux. After about 3 weeks, the acid reflux reduced. I went to both a cardiologist and an ENT to ensure I was doing OK. In the 4th week, I started experiencing dizziness. At first it was mild, but over the next 1 week, it increased substantially. I was dizzy the whole time. The ENT denied that the vaccine could have caused the problem and indicated that it was positional vertigo. He suggested home remedies which I [have linked to]here. I did them for 10 min in the morning and before sleep. In 2 weeks, my dizziness reduced. I'm not sure if the exercises helped or if it was just a short period during which my body recovered. The recovery was gradual and now, about 8 weeks after the vaccine I have no dizziness whatsoever. Though the ENT disagreed that the vaccine caused the problem, the cardiologist mentioned that the human immune system can react to the vaccine. Sometimes your immune system fires up in unexpected ways which can cause certain inflammation internally(for me, it possibly caused something in the ear, which is responsible for body balance). But, this is not because of the vaccine itself. Your body would likely react the same way had you got Covid-19. So, staying away from the vaccine may not be the best idea. For all those who are worried, I'd recommend not stressing over it because stress is known to increase positional vertigo. For me, the worry of the future consequences of the vaccine was bothering me more than the dizziness itself. But, this is only a temporary problem and it will pass. How long it takes can vary from person to person. The dangers of Covid-19 are far bigger than temporary dizziness. Please note: I'm not a medical practitioner. I'm only sharing my experience with the exact same problem. Hope you all get well soon. Regards, Maxim Dsouza, [Productive Club] Hope you're doing well! How long did it take for you to recover from the chest pain? It's been a month that I took the 1st jab and have chest pain since past few days both sides of the chest. A few minutes ago had a very bad pain on the right side which has now subsided a bit. Did you take any medication for the chest pain? Please help! [@medee](https://vestibular.org/participant/medee/) hi there I've been on various different medication, but it seems after a week on anything my body won't tolerate and I get nasty side affects. Was on amitriptyline on the 5th day it caused me crazy heart palpitations so had to stop those. Been on beta blockers recently which for the first 7 days I was really good off but seem to have a side affect from this now causing burning sensations through my legs and numbness. I'm not sure if my body is so hyper active that every time something goes in my body it causes more problems! Having a relapse at the minute last 4 days. So I'm thinking of stopping beta blockers even though they did help my chest pains. Such a shame it's been 5 months for me now and I have a couple days where I'm better but I always seem to relapse breathing has been quite bad lately aswell. How are you getting on? [@lmkk]oh no sounds like your having a rough time also. my main issues have been more heart related and since going on Bisoprolol beta blockers my dizziness has been alot worse but chest pains have been better. but last week yeah numbness and burning in legs. I have been trying to train my legs more this last week as I've been inactive for 2 months so maybe it could be due to that. I have seen a private cardiologist who has confirmed that he thinks here's an autonomic dysfunction, my body seems to be so hyper sensitive to any medication at the minute I seem to have side affects from all medication I'm put on. don't know if the best course is to be on no medication and let my body fight itself! I haven't seen my gp about the leg numbness yet it seems like different things come up all the time. im 4 and a half months now and tbh since being on beta blockers the last 10 days I have seen improvement but also side affects not really sure best solution. scary isn't it Im thinking of paying to see a neurologist just incase they can expand on what my private cardiologist has found. or at least they can rule out some other things. I hope we start feeling better soon there is a lot more coming out now with side affects from vaccines, I just want my life back its hard staying positive isn't it. I do believe that hopefully symptoms do go away some people on here there's seem to have gone. maybe 6-12 months is the most realistic target for everyone? I reckon at least 6-12 months is a much more realistic time frame for recovery. Given that I am three and a half months out and feel about 50% recovered I reckon I could be around 90-100% better by around 12 months but I haven't written off the idea of it taking over a year! I have read about the recovery time for those suffering from peripheral neuropathy symptoms being around a year or so. Although the articles I read where based on peripheral neuropathy damage as a result of antibiotics side effects, nerve trauma after chemo or surgery, I imagine that it will be about the same time frame for the healing process after the covid vaccine. ( Nerve damage is nerve damage regardless of what caused it?) That's my theory anyway! I also have read accounts of people who were affected by covid at the beginning of the pandemic last year who are now finally starting to be clear of their numbness and pins and needles so there is hope for us yet! I now focus on enjoying my better days and try to take it easy on my flare up days. I have chosen not to take any meds and just let my body do its thing. I have changed my diet to anti inflammatory foods and intermittent fasting to help with the healing process, I have experienced some success with this along with Turmeric, ginger, and pineapple. I think by giving ourselves a more realistic time frame for recovery we are putting less stress and pressure on ourselves when we anxiously watch the calendar for that elusive 2/3/4/ month mark recovery time that some forum members here have luckily experienced. I started getting very anxious and down around the 2 month mark as I was really hopeful that I would have recovered by that time as others had, then I pinned my hopes on the magic 3 month mark. Again disappointed to still have symptoms but at least I can tell that they are easing slowly. I'm now more honest with myself that it will be a longer road to recovery but I will get there. If we count the days going by we are going to feel worse because recovery is not as quick as we would like. Maybe see a private neurologist to give yourself some peace of mind and ask about the leg numbness while u are there. I know what you mean about different things coming up all the time. I have experienced peripheral neuropathy, dizziness, nystagmus, migraines, menstrual problems, and other stuff since the vaccine. My GP must think I'm a right hypochondriac haha! I hope any newcomers who read this take note and to try and not get to hung up on dates as I did but to just focus on your recovery with time and patience and not to compare recovery times to closely with others. Did you suffer from chest pain too? If not, great! If you did, you you please share if you're feeling completely okay now? Has the chest pain vanished on it own or did you try any meds for it? The chest pain has been bad for me and I don't know what to do! [@medee](https://vestibular.org/participant/medee/) first couple of days on meds does give relief but I think our bodies are so over reactive that we seem to get all sorts of reactions. Honestly I haven't found anything to really help I get relief off some meds but they cause other issues. I've found that it seems to be flare ups so you will feel worse during some weeks but then they do seem to calm down for a couple days, personally I feel as time goes by some issues seem to drift off and others come up. A hot water bottle seemed to help when I was having bad chest pains I would hold a hot water bottle on my chest. Might of just been a comfort thing but seemed to take the edge off. [@sarahrua](https://vestibular.org/participant/sarahrua/) Here's my story, I hope it helps: I got my first dose (Pfizer) in the beginning of July. First week or so was fine, until Monday I tried laying down at night to go to sleep only to be met with intense vertigo. It was that feeling you get after spending the whole day at an amusement park, like your brain is doing somersaults inside your skull. I'd had some drinks that Saturday and I thought I was experiencing a super late hangover. This feeling subsided for a few days, until on Friday it started again. Horrible dizziness, room was spinning in circles. Days, weeks went by with almost 24/7 vertigo. I felt like I was losing my mind. Got all kinds of bloodwork and tests done, got a brain scan etc. Everything came back normal. The vertigo was accompanied by intense nausea, I never vomited but was on the brink of puking all the time. Now, this went on for, dare I say it, five months. At around the four month mark the symptoms got significantly better. I started experiencing more good days than bad days. It seemed to be two steps forward and one step back. Some days were still awful. The vertigo, as it got better, changed how it physically manifested. Instead of the continuous \"room is spinning\" kind of feeling, it became a sudden \"thump\" in my brain. Like someone shoved my brain forward but my head stayed still. Sometimes it happened three or four times in a row, but never more that ten or so times per day. I was also experiencing flu-like symptoms that lasted for one day at a time and then disappeared, only to reappear next week or the week after. Never any fever, but runny nose, dry cough, feverish feeling, neck/face felt stuffy or swollen. I also experienced extreme thirst that would last a day or two at a time. Drinking water did not help. Never tested positive for Covid, also went to get tested to see if I'd previously already had it and I hadn't. I no longer have vertigo. Nausea, I still have it somewhat every once in a while. The flu-like symptoms I also still have (experiencing them right now actually, won't be going to the gym like I planned haha). The extreme thirst thing I also have sometimes still. But it's getting better. Hey, it must, right, since I no longer have the worst symptom! Yours will go away too. But prepare for it maybe taking a long ass time. It sucks, and it's overwhelming. But take it a day at a time. Actually, take it an hour at a time. Look for those tiny pockets of time, however small, where you feel even slightly normal. Hold on to that, because that will be your primary feeling at some point again. I'm here to encourage you and to answer any questions you might have. -Vera [Covid-19 Vaccine side effects](https://vestibular.org/participant/judes/), [KitKat](https://vestibular.org/participant/lmkk/), [SarahMel](https://vestibular.org/participant/sarahrua/)and 3 people reacted [@medee]hi there I've been on various different medication, but it seems after a week on anything my body won't tolerate and I get nasty side affects.

Thanks for your response. Since I do not know on which comment you have replied, I share some details: I have been having chest pain since past few days and just had a bad episode half an hour ago and the pain qas terrible. It subsided after few minutes but was still evident. I'd read few people saying they've tried home remedies and since my pain was bad, I again jumped back to this forum and happen to see someone mentioning that their doctor said this is the body response to the vax. The vax may have caused inflammation and taking meds might disrupt body's natural process of healing. I jumped to Google to see what helps reduce inflammation and TADA! it was home remedies. I am going to read if home remedies has helped anyone out here as I don't remember the outcome but I think it was positive. By home remedies I mean, ginger, turmeric etc. If it has helped, I'd suggest we try it too. Afterall these are harmless and might help us in curing these. Hope we all recover from this asap! P.S: Please use the 'QUOTE' option when you respond to anyone's comments. That way we know what we spoke previously. Hi, I'm taking turmeric and Tart Cherry. I'm also taking Fish Oil and Vitamin C and D. I'm taking it easy an resting at home. I walk in my neighborhood. Increasing water intake and taking Meclizine. I'm trying to get up and move around every hour and eat anti-inflammatory foods. I was already eating the AIP diet. I started adding fresh ginger to foods today. Next, I'll add turmeric to water and bone broth. Feel better~ I see you had posted this in May. How are you feeling these days? Are you completely cured of all symptoms? What were your symptoms and has the natural remedy - turmeric etc. helped to get cured? Please do respond. Pls use the QUOTE option while responding as it helps in knowing which comment is being responded too. Take care! [@1tahoegal]I was/am so desperate to get permanent relief I found someone's comments about how spicy food seemed to help him as well as several people posted info about turmeric as well as eating almonds. Tried everything and all seem to help but the cayenne and turmeric seem to help the most. Hope you have fully recovered. How are you feeling these days? Did you continue natural remedies like turmeric etc.? Has it got completely cured? What were your symptoms if I may ask. Please use the QUOTE option while responding. Help is knowing which comment is being responded to. Take care! [@lmkk]same here! Was feeling good last week now suffered another big relapse and feel like I'm back to square 1 Strangely enough I am also having a flare up. My right eye is really playing up and my pins and needles got really painful in my hands again. I put it down to the changes in atmospheric pressure now that it's coincided with the cold weather and I stupidly went out a few times without gloves. I've upped my turmeric and started omega 3 fish oil. I'm sure it will settle down soon. Has the turmeric thing helped you in feeling better? Pls use the Quote option while replying to comments as it helps knowing which comment was replied to. Hello everyone, I've been following this forum for several hundred pages now (since August). I Didn't want to get a vaccine but due to my unusual circumstances at work I was backed into a corner on the issue. Some background, I am a mid-30's male, whose athletic and otherwise has no medical problems besides occasional minor joint pain and mild tinnitus. On 8/23/21 I got my Pfizer #1. I felt informed about the risks, but after what I've been through at this point, I really didn't understand what I was signing up for. you'd have to put a gun to my head to make me take another one of these shots and even then, I'm not sure - no I'm not being hyperbolic. I have had a laundry list of symptoms that have waxed and waned over the past 7 weeks. I will just list them. Brain fog, dizziness, mental and physical fatigue, difficulty concentrating, night sweats, chills, numbness, pins and needles, sensory distortion in my skin (hot feels cold, cold feels hot ect), nausea, abdominal pain, extreme diarrhea at various times, body aches, joint pain, head-aches, new eye floaters, tinnitus increased, random circulation issues super cold hands and feet even when its hot out, phantom itches, random muscle pains like \"zaps\" or ant bites, muscle spasms/twitches, feeling like my body is vibrating although this mostly happens in my extremities. Of course, I also had the mental side effects of anxiety, depression, and fear which come with a disease from an experimental jab where no one knows what's going on, why, if it will ever improve, or even what the long-term side effects will be. Like many of you, my symptoms have changed almost daily, with the dizziness/brain fog, fatigue, paresthesia, and muscle twitches been fairly consistent. They were very consistent and terrible for the first 3 weeks then they started to ease up some and id either wake up and have a couple hours where they were less followed by a bad evening or id be bad in the morning take a long nap and be a little better in the afternoon. There really seemed to be no rhyme or reason for any of this. I was desperate for answers, I've been fortunate enough to finally find a group of doctors locally who believe my symptoms are from the vaccine. unfortunately, I apparently know more about the disease than they do. I have a background in medicine and immunology, and when I have been able, I have crawled through the bowels of the interwebs looking for answers. I can't advise this activity as it considerably elevated my anxiety. I've followed and researched a number of theories including Dr. Patterson's and others and concluded the obvious that no one really knows what the hell is going on with us. After weeks of searching for doctors who would even bother to help me, I finally have some orders for a ton of blood work, including d dimer, testosterone, and auto immune markers, chest X rays, and possibly an MRI if the billing code works. Based on everyone else's reports though I expect everything to be normal. I strongly suspect whatever the origin of our symptoms is a marker that is not being looked for (like spike protein). What we do know, is whether this is vestibulitis, or any of these other strange diagnoses, the origin of all of these symptoms looks to be connected to systemic inflammation. Why? Well, there appears to be something about all of us, that did not play well with these vaccines. I am not sure if our immune systems were overwhelmed or if we lack some kind of enzyme to quickly dismantle these toxic spike proteins - whatever it is it appears to be mostly temporary. Although, mileage may vary depending on the mechanism, individual history, and severity of the reaction. As far as a timeline for my symptoms, I would say the first 2-3 weeks were the most intense, with my symptoms diminishing, plateauing, relapsing, then diminishing again in cycle that feels like it will never end. The past several weeks have only been marginally better until two days ago I woke up and just felt better. My fog was almost completely gone, the fatigue was gone, my hands and feet were not tingling, and my dizziness was almost completely gone. There was really no warning for this, I just woke up and felt better. I am right at the 7-week mark. I consider this nothing short of a miracle. I've been taking handfuls of supplements for weeks, adding more as I was able to get them. The full list, is N acetyl L cystine (NAC), aspirin 325mg, quercetin, and ibuprofen only for the really bad flareups. It may be a coincidence but I noticed a large improvement in my symptoms several days after I started taking the turmeric, and the Alpha Lipoic Acid with mag/cal had an almost immediate effect on the muscle spams and twitches. Ive now had almost 3 whole days of feeling \"better\", was able to get out and do some light exercise. I do still have some tingling in my hands and feet and its more intense at night. I have also had some bowel discomfort although that may be due to the high doses of turmeric/curcumin. I obviously have no idea if this will last, If I will relapse, if I will develop some new terrible symptoms in the future. But I wanted to give back to this community. Outside of my faith in God which has been a considerable comfort, this community has been the only hope I have found regarding our condition. It is hard not to feel depressed, anxious, and even angry. We were all lied to about our risks. Furthermore, the institutions of power have all abandoned us. We are an ethical liability to the medical community, an imposition to the political narrative, and a monetary threat to the pharmaceutical companies. Thankfully, we have each other. Its hard to say what the long term results of these side effects will be. I suspect some might be permanent or signs of tissue damage. However, the fact that they do seem to generally be improving is a encouraging that the cause likely isn't auto immune or some other terrifying permanent ailment. My plan is keep taking my supplements, trying to gently ease back into exercise, and eventually ween myself off my supplements and hope I don't have a relapse! I also intend to see what I can rule out with medical tests. I strongly suggest this if you can as its much more helpful mentally to know what it isnt rather than what It could be. I wont post unless I have something new to add. But I will keep reading your posts. I hope we all recover. I know it feels like its never going to end- but it will. You can do it, just take it a day at a time. I'm praying for all of you to recover. Thank you again for your posts- its been a tremendous comfort to know I'm not alone in this journey. You are our hero! Thank you for such a long and detailed post. How have you been feeling recently? I hope you're completely cured and back to your normal self! The list of supplements you've shared, were these prescribed by any doctor or self medicated? I've heard anti inflammatory foods help in curing to a great extent. Has it worked out for you? Do we intake the turmeric with water or how do we go about it? I shall wait for your response! Do use the Quote option while responding to my comment. It helps in knowing what comment is being responded to. Take care! [@pfizervictim]Hi there. Have you tried eating fresh pineapple and having turmeric daily? I find that it does help knock the edge off my symptoms which is better than nothing I suppose. If you haven't already give them a try as they are probably the strongest natural anti inflammatory foods you can get. I'm also stuffing my face with baby sweetcorn as they are supposed to be good for the eyes. My eye pain has mostly gone now I'm nearly ten weeks out from my first jab although I do still get random eye \"wobbling\" at times. How are you feeling these days? I see the turmeric has helped you cure. How do we go about it? Drink water mixed with turmeric or something else? Have you been completely recovered from the side effects? What were your symptoms... Will wait for your response. Do use the Quote option while replying. It helps in knowing which comment is being replied to. Take care! So guys it appears there's actually 3 major psychological and physiological side effets by location in the brain 1. pyramidal - dizness, loss of balance, headache, migraine, blurred vision I have no idea about this one seems most people get this. Some people seem to suggest magnesium and zinc as potentially useful. 2. extrapyramidal - anxiety, twitching, involuntary movement, loss of motor control, fidgety, restless leg, feeling wired or restless This is what I had. Avoid coffee, sugar and anything that's a super energizer. You wanna calm yourself down. I drink a lot of calming teas like chamomille. I also drink like 1/4th of a cup of red wine + water it was helping me a bit calm down. Being active doign stuff consumes your energy helps you relax. I was doing daily short runs helped me out a lot. Was also getting a hot bath before goign to sleep was mellowing me out hardcore so I could actually sleep at night. 3. cardiovascular problems - heart palpitions, microclots, Drink a lot of water to avoid clots and improve circulation. Quercertin and blood thinners like red onion (has quercertin), garlic, cinnamon, turmeric might help with this. One thing that does help is keeping the blood moving daily mild exercise but no vigorous exericse it might make things worse. I think this might be caused by heart muscles being infected with the rna S1 antigens producing spike proteins. Unlucky. You might have a highly active lifestyle and the rna vaccine spread all over your body and some capsules landed on your heart causing inflamation on your heart. Vitamin C seems like an universal cure. The moment I was popping some C I was immediately feeling 3 times better. I would personally recommend probiotics and eating more organic/healthy /veggies /fruits/leafy greens keep it mellow on the heavy stuff. The moment I started eating probiotic organic yoghurt all my anxiety symptoms went down. Turmeric and Vitamin D also appear useful across the board. I hope you guys feel better!! How are you feeling now? I see turmeric and other anti inflammatory foods help. How are we supposed to intake turmeric? With water or milk? Have you completely cured? When had you taken your jab? Will wait for your response. Do use the Quote option while replying to the comments. It helps in knowing which comment is being replied to. Take care!

There's no improvement since 5 months? Just like my last response here to your comment, I went back and checked people posting about natural foods. Seems turmeric and ginger has helped a lot of people here on this forum. You may look it up yourself and try looking for articles on what are some anti inflammatory foods that can cure or protect the body post vax. And what foods to avoid. Here are a few I read about: - Bone broth (chicken especially) - Veggies - Oranges (and few other fruits. You will have to look it up) - Turmeric, ginger, onions (and guess garlic too) - Green tea There may be more but the articles I read stated these helps a lot. I think there's no harm in trying. But please do your own research. And do not over consume any. Try only one at a time. If it works, good for all of us. Keeping you all in my prayers!

[@medee](https://vestibular.org/participant/medee/) I actually never experienced any chest pain or allergic reaction after getting vaccinated. Just standard aches and chills and a headache and then 7 days later, "}
