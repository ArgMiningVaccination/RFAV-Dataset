As we release toxins and un-needed baggage, physically it is a natural segue to reflect on life and purify the emotional body. By letting go of old patterns, we discover new realities that are available to us. Biography work is a term that embraces an experiential approach to understanding human development. It's a practice in reading into our life stories, coupled with the opportunity to listen to the journeys of others. Through fairy tales, biography exercises, artistic activities, and nature observation we will go on a learning journey and discover the wisdom inherent in our life writing, our bio...graphy. We will learn about the life phases and how they relate to body, soul and spirit. When we map our biographies across these phases through themes such as: places we have lived, people who have influenced us, illnesses, the role food has played in our lives, the work we have chosen and the talents we've developed often from our challenges; we discover that there's more to our story than we think. The Triptychon is another powerful instrument in the world of biographical coaching. It's a special way of making contact with your life, a life-event, or with important moments. You will learn to make use of three simple self-made drawings and question the pictures in a biographical way. The Triptychon and Life Phases are tools to use for self-development alone or with friends and family. Who benefits from this work? Parents, teachers, therapists, writers, professionals working in recovery or anyone who is interested in their own inner development and ancestry.
