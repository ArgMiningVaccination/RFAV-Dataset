Stress is a major concern in medicine and the social and health sciences nowadays. In fact, not only are stress-associated ailments and diseases rapidly growing, that is,virtually everywhere in the modern world, but also thecost of treatment and \"collateral damage,\" for example, inoccupational health or the economy as a whole, seems to increase exponentially\u2014for example, see [ 1,2]. This may be due to a more recent phenomenon called \"burn-out\"; how-ever,thereisclearevidencethatmyocardialinfarction,stroke,depression, anxiety, and even some disease-prone immuneprocesses, including proinflammation as a common diseasedenominator that is critically associated with stress [ 3], are continuouslygainingrecognitioninmedicineandbearclearrelation upon stress and its (patho)physiology [ 4]. Thus, preventive and therapeutic options to reduce and preventstressand,simultaneously,improvestressmanagementskillsarestronglyneeded.Mindfulness-basedprogramsandothermind-body medical and cognitive behavioral strategies to(better) deal with stress are taught and evaluated at manyplaces, including academic medical sites and universities[5]; however, their outcome is usually measured in terms of clinical improvements with disease states, inhibition ofdiseaseprogression,orcureandrelapseprevention. Since primary care and health promotion can be seen as the first line of defense in medicine and, yet, as setting-oriented \"places\" where resistance resources, health protec-tion,resiliency,andsalutogenesisarefacilitatedinmorecom-plexsituationsandmodalities,itshouldandwillincorporateself-care-orientedmeans,techniques,andstrategiestolower stress at all levels and improve self- or stress managements k i l l so ft h ep o p u l a t i o na saw h o l e \u2014 a n do fe a c hs i n g l eindividualundertreatment.Researchinthisareaisevolvinganditfocusesonthemanyaspectsthatcontributetoahealthyandmorestress-resilientlife-style,hence,lookingnotonlyat tangiblediseaseoutcomesbutalsoatqualityoflife,happiness, flourishing,subjectivewell-being,optimism,andsoon\u2014forexample,see[ 6].

Conclusions . The web-based training can be a useful tool for stabilizing health/psychological well-being and work/lifebalance. 1. Introduction 1.1. Background. Psychology has long been primarily con- cernedwithperceptionofdisordersandnegativefeelings,but currentscientificattentiononhappinessandtherecognition of positive mental states is at an \"all-time\" high [ 1,2]. Rea- sons for this development are rising levels of psychologicalpressure and stress at work [ 3-5],whichresultsinareduced ability to work due to psychological illnesses. This develop-mentisnoticeableinGermany.Comparedto1994,theindexf o rd a y so fw o r km i s s e dd u et oi l l n e s si n c r e a s e db y1 2 1 . 1 %in 2011 [6]. Since the last decade, researchers increasingly search for answers to the questions of what makes us feelgood and how to generate psychological stability and health2 and vocational success make this a topicofinterestforcompaniesandtheeconomyingeneralaswellas for individuals [ 7]. The investigation of subjective well- beingandhappinessandthequestionofwhetheritispossible to foster positive emotions through training are among theprime topics of happiness studies. Lyubomirsky et al. [ 8] found that a person's happiness level is determined by 3 fac-tors:ageneticsetpointforhappiness,happiness-relevantcir-cumstances, and happiness-related activities and practices.Furthermore,theauthorsfoundthathappiness-relatedactiv-itiesarethemostpowerfulaspectofincreasingandsustaininghappinessthatisunderindividualcontrol[ 7,8].Becausethe brain,principally,neverlosesitsabilitytoadapt[ 9],happiness with it, well-being) is learnable at almost everyage; yet activities for pursuing happiness need to be inten-tional and it takes effort to initiate, carry out, and maintainthem[8]. Positiveinterventions(i.e.,positivepsychologyinterven- tions) help to implement and increase happiness-relevantactivities.Theseare\"treatmentmethodsorintentionalactiv-ities aimed at cultivating positive feelings, positive behav-iors, or positive cognitions\" [ 10]. The German happiness training of Dr. Eckart von Hirschhausen is such a pos-itive intervention: a 7-week online training focusing onexercises for achieving a positive psychological state. Inaddition to an introductory week and a final week, there are5 weeks with 1 happiness-relevant topic each (e.g., \"joy of luck\" or \"joy of pleasure\"). Each week has 3 exercises. The detailed exercises for each week are shown in Table 1.Th e training is voluntary, free of charge and can be accessed athttp://www.glueck-kommt-selten-allein.de .Inthisstudyweaimedtodeterminetheimpactofpositive interventionsinaconcretesetting:weexaminedtheeffectsofonline happiness training on occupational health in a com-pany as assessed with questionnaires. We also investigated 2 other aspects. Because the training contains exercises on mindfulness and as studies have shown that mindfulnesstraining enhances the functioning of attention networks[11], we used the Attention Network Test to assess possible effects on attention regulation. To determine if the trainingreducesstressatanobjectivelymeasurablelevel,wecollectedsalivasamplestomeasurethestresshormonesalpha-amylaseandcortisol[ 12-15]. In a 2011-2012 pilot study, 110 students from Coburg UniversityunderwentthehappinesstrainingprogramofDr.Eckart von Hirschhausen in a randomized controlled trial(unpublished data). The study had some limitations andthe hypothesized effects could not be affirmed entirely, butthe data clearly showed the effectiveness of the training.Due to this outcome, we then decided to test the trainingagainwithamorerigorousdesign,additionalmeasures,and,particularly,inadifferentsetting(i.e.,amoreappropriateandpresumably a more change/training-sensitive target group),followingexpectedstressandstrainlevelsinemployeesintheGerman service sector. We were especially interested in thepossible effects of the training on participants experiencingincreasing psychological demands at work. Employees ofservice companies, especially those who provide telephoneservice,havebeenamongthehighestratesofinabilitytowork duetoburn-out,depression,orotherpsychologicalillnesses inGermany[ 16].Forthisreason,wechosetostudyemployees of an insurance company as our target group, because theya r eo ft e ni n v o l v e di nt e l e p h o n es e r v i c e sa n dt h e r e f o r eh a v eEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 the potential for improving their work/life balance using an interventionsuchthehappinesstrainingprogram.

The primary objective of this exploratory study is the question whether the happinesstrainingimprovesindividualhappinessandsatisfactionwithlifeandrelievesstress,and,asaconsequencethereof,reducesstress-related symptoms in an occupational setting. Accord-ing to this, our primary outcome was psychosocial well-being, in connection with satisfaction (with life) and stresscoping.Theassumedeffectswouldberelevantforthefieldofoccupational health and medicine as a whole (e.g., primarycareandpreventivemedicine). Asasecondaryobjectiveweinvestigatedhowthetraining influencesmindfulness,recoveryexperience,andflourishing.Furthermore,wetestedwhethertherewouldbeadecreaseinobjectivelymeasurablestress(measuredbysalivasamples)oranincreaseinattentionalcontrol(measuredbytheAttentionNetwork Test). Taken together, there were 4 aims of this study: first and as a primary objective, testing whether the happiness train- ing affected satisfaction and stress; second,determining the effects of the training on mindfulness, recovery experience, and flourishing; third,investigating effects on objectively measuredvariablesrelatedtostressandattentionregulation;andfourth,determining if measurable correlations between theanalyzedvariablesexist. 2. Methods 2.1. Ethics. This study was conducted in 2012 and data were analyzed in 2012-2013. Ethical approval was obtained fromthe Coburg University Institutional Review Board/EthicsCommittee in 2012. In addition, the staff council of theinsurancecompanywasofficiallyinformedaboutthestudyinapremeeting(2012).Allparticipantsgaveinformedconsent. 2.2. Design. Ar a n d o m i z e da n dc o n t r o l l e dl o n g i t u d i n a l design (2 groups\u00d73 times questionnaire/2 subgroups \u00d72 timessalivaandANT)wasusedforourstudy,with3differenttime points (pre =0,p (4 weeks later) = 2).Theinterventiongroupunderwentthehappinesstraining partlyatworkandpartlyathome(seealso Section2.6 .),and the control group did not perform any of the online inter- vention activities or training and was passive on a waiting-list. After the end of the actual study, however, the controlgroup also did the training (cross-over design); yet, we didn o tf e e dt h ec r o s s - o v e ri n t ot h ea n a l y s i s .Th er e a s o nf o rthe control group formally receiving the training after theactualstudyperiod(andneverthelesshavingthisprospectivecross-over technically imbedded into the study design rightfrom the start, but no data analysis planned for this) was toguaranteeallparticipantsthesameexperienceoverthecourseoftheproject.Thisseemedtobeappropriate,sinceitcouldbeexpectedthatbeingallocated,forexample,totheinterventiongroup could produce somewhat \"visible\" behavior changes,and so it rendered important to not produce a \"loser\" group by random allocation to the control group. In fact, all par-ticipants could be sure that they would, finally, get the sameexperience(happinesstraining),iftheywanted. The questionnaires were completed at 0,1,a n d2.Th e salivasamplesandtheANTwereonlytakenat 0and1. 2.3. Participants/Recruitment. The sample consisted of 147 German-speaking,employed,adultvolunteersfrom2depart-ments of a local insurance company with a total of 4330employees. The 2 participating departments were chosen by the company and we had no influence on this decision. In total about 1050 employees of the two departments werepossible participants due to the same hierarchy level. All ofthem had been invited for voluntary participation. 15% ofthem wanted to participate, were proved to be eligible, andwerethusincludedforrandomization( Figure1).Theemploy- ees of the 2 participating departments were addressed andinformed about the study by their group leader. Inclusioncriteriawere(1)regularaccesstotheInternetathome(astheyperformed the training partly at home and partly at work),( 2 )n ov a c a t i o no fl o n g e rt h a n1w e e kd u r i n gt h es u r v e yperiod, (3) no prior knowledge of or experience with theonline happiness training program. Every participant gaveinformedconsentbyformallysubscribingtothetrainingandt h e ya l lp a r t i c i p a t e di na ni n t r o d u c t o r yc l a s si nw h i c ht h e yhad the opportunity to individually ask the project teamquestions. 2.4.Randomization/Allocation. Concerningtheclassification of the participants into intervention (IG) and control group(CG), we also considered local and structural conditions of thecompany.ToavoiddirectcommunicationbetweenIGand CG(e.g.,whenIGparticipantsworkedoninstructionsfromthe web-based training program at their desks, other)wedifferentiatedbetween partici- patingsites.Wehad2differentdepartmentssigningup.One department had open (cubicle) offices, the other one con- sisted of smaller offices with 2 to 6 employees per room. To prevent a direct influence between IG and CG, we stratified for groups, so that participants in one office were in the same group and not in \"competing\" groups. As not allemployees of each department decided to participate in thestudy,therewerealwayssomenonparticipantsintheoffices.Hence, randomization took place at an individual level, butviaformationofstrata.Carefulstratificationprocedureswereapplied in the process and prior to it, due to given practi-cal/structural constraints and statistical considerations. Yet,weestablished\"virtual\"studypopulationcompartmentsthat,following department structures in the company, werederivedfromdepartmentaffiliationofparticipants.Anaddi-tional goal of the illustrated processes was to carefully avoidhierarchic structures or uneven distribution of hierarchypositions and functions between intervention and control groups. To summarize related randomization procedures, we performed,withinthestratifiedcompartmentsestablishedby4 of company ( n=4 3 3 0 ) Employees of participating departments ( n = 1050 ) Employees assessed for eligibility ( n = 157 )Excluded ( n=1 0 ) Not in case participants worked in smaller offices (size of, e.g., 2 people) and share direct office space that both participants were allocated to the same group. In this regard, our study compartments (strata) were \"physical.\" The reason for these somewhat complex measures was to keep spill-over effectsfromIGtoCGreasonablysmall. In addition to the general study group allocation we h a d2s u b s a m p l e s :( 1 )f r o mw h i c hs a l i v aw a sc o l l e c t e da n d(2) who performed the Attention Network Test (ANT). Thesubgroups were composed of participants from only onedepartment. We split all participants of this department and randomly assigned them either to ANT or saliva testing; therefore,bothsubgroupswerenonoverlapping. Randomization procedures were performed by drawing pieces of paper (in lots) from a bag (an untransparent clothbag). All lots had the same look and were put into the bagand mixed thoroughly by one of the authors. The bag wasprovided by the author and a noninvolved person wasdrawingthelots(blinded). The147participantsweresplitintoaninterventiongroup with85participantsandacontrolgroupwith62participants.The difference in size between the groups is due to theEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 different size of the open space offices in the company. See theflowchartforparticipationanddrop-outs( Figure1). 2.5. Instruments. Happiness and well-being are predomi- nantly subjective measures, which need to be defined fromthe subjective perspective of a person. For this reason, weused an online questionnaire consisting of different sub-questionnaires to collect individuals' self-reports for ourprimary/secondary objectives. For our primary objective weusedthefollowing. Atfirst,weusedaVisualAnalogScale(VAS),whichasked t h eq u e s t i o n\" H o wh a p p ya r ey o ur i g h tn o w ? \"a n da n o t h e rasking\"Howsatisfiedareyourightnow?\"ona6-pointratingscalewithasadfaceontheleftandahappyfaceontheright. TheWHO-FiveWell-beingIndex(WHO-5)wasderived from a larger scale originally developed for a WHO project studying diabetes patients [ 18]. WHO-5 is a generally acceptedqualityoflife/well-beingscreeninginstrumentcon-sistingof5questionsdevelopedbytheWorldHealthOrgani-zation(PsychiatricResearchUnit,WHOCollaboratingCen-terforMentalHealth,Frederiksborg,Denmark(Germanver-sionfrom1998)[ 19-22].Itcoverspositivemood(goodspirits, relaxation), vitality (being active and waking up fresh andrested), and general interest (being interested in things) ona 6-point Likert scale from 0 (not present) to 5 (constantlypresent). In our study it was used to evaluate the generalquality of life and changes during the treatment. Exampleitems are \"I woke up feeling fresh and rested\" or \"My dailylifehasbeenfilledwiththingsthatinterestme.\" The Stress Warning Signals Scale (SWS) is a list of 61 stress warning symptoms divided into muscular reactions, vegetative-endocrinological reactions, and cognitive, emo- tional, and behavioral reactions. Using the SWS, data on thesubjective stress experience of the participant was collected.The rating follows a 10-point system (0 = does not stress meat all, 10 = stresses me a lot). The scale was developed andvalidatedbyEschetal.[ 23,24].Exampleitemsforvegetative- endocrinological symptoms are \"rapid heartbeat,\" \"chesttightness,\"or\"excessivesweating.\" For testing the impact and determining factors of the training (secondary objective), we used the following addi-tionalquestionnaires: The Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) [ 25]i sa3 0 - itemscalemeasuringmindfulnesswitha4-pointLikertscale(1 = rarely, 4 = almost always). We used the 14-item short version.TheFMIisauseful,valid,andreliablequestionnaire formeasuringmindfulness.Itismostsuitableforuseingen-eralizedcontextsinwhichknowledgeoftheBuddhistconceptof mindfulness cannot be expected [ 25]. The 14 items cover all formal aspects of mindfulness. Example items are \"I amopen to the experience of the present moment\" and \"I amfriendly to myself/do not criticize myself when things gowrong.\" The Recovery Experience Questionnaire (RECQ) [ 26]i s a valid and reliable questionnaire for use in assessing anindividual'sunwinding(i.e.,relaxationor\"wind-down\")andrecuperationprocesses.Itmeasurestheelementsof\"psycho-logical detachment from work,\" \"relaxation,\" \"mastery,\" and\"control\"ona16-itemscalewitha5-pointLikertscale(1=not at all, 5 = very much). Example items are \"In leisure timeIf o r g e ta b o u tw o r k \"a n d\" I nl e i s u r et i m eId e c i d em yo w nschedule.\" The Flourishing Scale (FS) [ 27]i sa n8 - i t e mm e a s u r eo f psychosocial well-being and personal growth and develop- ment(i.e.,flourishing).Apilotstudyshowedinternalconsis- tency and a moderately high reliability and validity [ 27]. We used a German version of this questionnaire (FS-D) trans-lated by Esch et al. [ 23,24]. Example items are \"I lead a purposeful and meaningful life\" and \"I am engaged andinterestedinmydailyactivities.\" In addition to the subjective reports of our participants, we wanted to know if there were any objective physiologicalor behavioral changes that could be detected. Therefore weanalyzed the effects of the happiness training on 2 objectiveparameters. Two subsamples were built of participants fromonedepartment.Thesubgrouptestingwasonlyperformedatpre-andposttest(nofollowup). From one subsample (=45), we collected saliva at 3 different times a day (directly after awakening, 30 minuteslater, and at 8pm) for analyzing saliva concentrations ofcortisol and alpha-amylase, which are indicators for theactivity of the 2 stress axes in the body [ 13-15,28]. It has longbeenknownthatcortisol(i.e.,elevatedplasmalevelsthatarepositivelycorrelatedwithelevatedsalivaconcentrationsasindicators,e.g.,forthehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenalstressaxis) can be an indicator of stress activity. Only recently,a m y l a s er e c e i v e ds p e c i a la t t e n t i o ni nt h i sr e g a r d ,s i n c ei t ssaliva levels seem to correlate with sympathetic-adrenal medullary system activation as an indicator for the sympa- thetic arm of the stress response [ 13-15,28-31], including positive correlations with norepinephrine/(nor) adrenalinelevels. However, since salivary alpha-amylase is not onlyinfluenced by (sympathetic) stress, with higher levels sug-gesting sympathetic activation, but also by salivary flow rate(whichismoreassociatedwithparasympatheticactivity),thisparameter is still under scrutiny. In any case, stress seemsto modulate alpha-amylase levels, as, for example, higherchronicstressseemstocorrelatewithmoredeterioratedcor-tisolandamylaseregulation[ 15,28,30,31],orevenattenuated orflattened(butprolonged)responsecurves.Moreover,acutestress(also,acutestressresponsiveness)ingeneralcorrelateswith higher hormone levels. While still being speculative insome areas of interpretation, we nonetheless included thesesalivary stress parameters in our study to learn more abouta possible influence of a potentially stress-reducing web-basedhappinesstrainingonthestressphysiology.Therefore,participants of the saliva subgroup received 6 salivettes (3 \u00d7 pretest, 3\u00d7posttest) for collecting saliva, as well as detailed informationonhowtotakethesamples,beforethepretest. The second objective instrument was the Attention Net- workTest(ANT;[ 32]),whichwasconductedwithintheother subsample (=42). Within a 30-minute testing session, the test assesses the functioning of 3 attention networks in anatomical and functional terms: alerting, orienting,and executive control [ 32,33]. Reaction time measures for differently cued and uncued stimulus conditions are used toquantifytheprocessingefficiencyofthese3networks.Studies6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine contact the researchers via email fortechnical support. All participants took part voluntarily andneither gave nor received money to participate. There wasan introductory event for giving necessary information; atthe end of the study (6 months after formal termination),participantsreceived a thank-you present and were orientedaboutpreliminaryresults. Onedayaftertheintroductoryevent,thepretestwascon- ducted: all participants filled out the online-questionnairesand the 2 subsamples gave the saliva or performed the ANT(0).Then,thehappinesstrainingstartedandranfor7weeks fortheinterventiongroup.Duringthistime,theIGreceivedanemaileveryweekatwork,explainingthecurrenttopicandthe 3 exercises (time required: approximately 10-15 minutes,once a week). The study of the documents pertaining tothe current topic was done during working hours and theperformance and documentation of the exercises took placeathomeduringfreetime.Thecontrolgroup,whichwasona waiting list, was a passive group and did not perform any of theonlineinterventionactivitiesortraining.Theposttest (1) was completed at the end of the training period, which was7w e e k sa ft e r0. Again, the online questionnaire, the saliva samples, and the ANT were performed. The last survey wasconducted4weeksaftertheendofthetraining(followup; 2). Atthispointonlytheonlinequestionnairewascompleted(nosalivaandANTtest). Filling out the questionnaire and doing the ANT was done during working hours but the saliva samples werecollectedathomebecausethetimeswhentheyneededtobetakenwerenotduringworkinghours. 2.7. Data Analysis. In a first step, the group samples were analyzed according to drop-outs ( Figure1). Weanalyzedthe datafollowingadherence-to-protocol:thoseparticipantswhocompleted all tests were evaluated .This means that for the analyses of the questionnaire, all participants who filled outthequestionsatall3timepoints( 0,1,and2)wereincluded. There was a total drop-out rate (from randomization toanalyses)of31.3%.Ofthese46drop-outs(IG:31,CG:15drop-outs) 15 participants decided not to enter the study (reasonsincluded illness, participants did not show up, or decided toextendvacationduringthesurvey)anddidnotevenperform the first test. During the training ( 0-1) there were 5 drop- outs (paradoxically there were 2 drop-outs more at 0than at1in the CG. Reasons for this could be that participants performed the questionnaire at 0but missed to press the \"send\"buttonattheend,sothatthedatawasnottransferred). Another 10 drop-outs occurred during followup. Due to adherence-to-protocolproceduretherewere18drop-outs. Withthesubgroups,allsubjectswhoparticipatedat 0and 1were included in the analysis. Saliva samples a drop- out rate of 17.8% (=37; IG: 18/CG: 19) and a values (IG versus CG) for 0,1,a n d2,a sw e l la sw i t h i n - g r o u pv a l u e sf o rI Ga t 0-1, 1-2,a nd0-2.Becausesomeofthedatawasnotnormally distributed, we used nonparametric tests for between-group effects were computed with Mann- Whitneytest and the within-group effects were computed withtheWilcoxontest.Withthenonparametricstatisticstherank order values are compared and statistical measures ofcentral tendency such as mean or median are used fordescriptive statistics.

For the questionnaires, the sum of scores of each single subquestionnairewascomputedandcompared. Saliva samples were analyzed at the laboratory of Pro- fessor Dr. Clemens Kirschbaum at the Technical University of Dresden. We collected data at time of awakening ( 0), 30 minutes later (1), and at 8pm (2)a n dt h e nc a l c u l a t e d theawakeningresponse(1minus0),themorningactivity (the mean of0+1), the evening activity (2), and the circadian rhythm amplitude (morning minus eveningactivity).

Discussion Thestudyoutcomesemphasizethehealthpromotingpoten- tials of positive interventions\u2014in this case, with referenceto occupational health and to the specific web-based hap- piness training of Dr. Eckart von Hirschhausen. All sur-veyedvariablesofhealthand/orindividualwell-beingintheonline questionnaire showed significant positive effects forthe intervention group (IG) between 1and0.Th i se ff e c t between1and0was not detectable in the control group (CG). Moreover, at1, the IG showed positive differences in allvariablesofprimaryconcernascomparedtotheCGwith remarkableeffectsizes(e.g.,>1forsatisfactionandquality oflife,with>or=0.8beingalargeeffect). The intervention study was conducted during the most stressful period of the year in the company due to a veryhigh workload. This means that the stress level at work wasconstantly high during our investigation, especially between0and1. For this reason, we decided to calculate not only between-group effects, but also within-group effects for theIG.Evenfailingtofindadeclineofhealth/well-beingintheIGcould have been interpreted as a success. Most of the meanso fth eCGi nth eq u e s ti o n n a i r es h o wad e c l i n efr o m 0to1, which indicates the influence of the heavy workload phase.Butdespitethehigh\"external\"stresslevels(i.e.,circumstan-tialstrain),animprovementinIGwasfound,whichwasmostvisible in between-groupanalyses. As primaryoutcomestheEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 11 subjective feeling of happiness and satisfaction increased significantly,withlargeeffectsizes.ItcouldbearguedthattheVisual AnalogScale mightnotbe the most appropriatetool,but as the gold standard of research on happiness states, itcovers an important field of the participants' self-report [ 34, 35]. More solid evidence is provided by the WHO-5 Ques- tionnaire; these 5 questions are psychometrically valid to assesswell-beingstateand/ortoscreendepressedmood[ 19- 21,36,37].OursignificantchangeswithintheWHO-5canbe interpretedasamedicallyrelevantoutcome,whichcouldalsobe relevant for primary care. This result indicates that theonlinetrainingpotentiallymakestheparticipantspsycholog-ically healthier on 2 levels: subjective and \"medical\" (withreferencetodepressivestates). Becausemindandbodyareinseparable,itisnotsurpris- ing that the positive effects on subjective and mood-relatedexperience,asmeasuredinourstudy,alsohadanimpacton(or were correlated with) awareness of physiological levels.Beingpsychologicallyhealthierandhappierisassociatedwiththe awareness of physiological changes (e.g., as seen in thedecrease of stress warning symptoms). Especially emotionalreactions seem to become more stable after the happinesstraining. This is hardly surprising, because these specificemotions are closely connected to overall happiness andwell-being. Furthermore, the cognitive and vegetative-endocrinologicalreactionsespeciallyimproved. In theANTwe could not find any significant effect of t r a i n i n g ,w h i c hw a sp r o b a b l yd u et ot h eh i g hd r o p - o u tr a t eandthesmallnumberofanalyzableparticipants.Thebigdif-ferenceinage(theIGwasonaverage10yearsolderthanthe CG)mighthaveinfluencedtheresultsaswell,althoughother studieshaveshownthatthereisnonoteworthydifferenceinattentionalcapacitiesbetweensubjects30and40yearsofage[38]. The ANT is one of the most valid and reliable instru- ments for testing attention regulation and has been usedin other studies successfully testing the positive effects ofmindfulnessonattention[ 11,39].Inthosestudiesthetraining ofmindfulnesswasmuchmoreintensive.Ourtrainingusedexercises that fall within the scope of mindfulness, but thetrainingitselfmightbeinsufficientlymindfulness-basedandtoo short to achieve significant effects with the ANT. There-fore, training might need to be more mindfulness-based,more intense, and conducted over a longer period of timetoachieveANTeffects. Regarding the salivaanalyses, we tried to measure possible objective effects of the 2 stress axes in the body.The samples were taken at0and1,e a c ht i m ei m m e d i a t e l y at awakening, 30 minutes after awakening, and at 8pm.Due to the study design and the fact that the participantstook the saliva samples at home without supervision, it wasnot possible to precisely control the exact time when thesamples were taken; therefore, there might have beensome unknown variations in time of saliva collection. Wemeasuredtheconcentrationofcortisolasaparameterforthe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA) [ 14], and alpha-amylase as an indirect parameter of (nor) adrenalin,which is a parameter of the sympathetic-adrenal medullary(SAM) axis [ 13]; seeSection2.5 .Th eS A Mi sr e s p o n s i b l ef o r the short-term stress reaction, the so-called fight-or-flightresponse [ 5,12]. This means that adrenalin increases faster than cortisol in a stress situation because it is a more directp a r a m e t e ro fs h o r t - t e r ms t r e s s .W ef o u n ds o m es i g n i fi c a n teffects, for example, with the amylase morning activity inthe intervention group (=0.002 ,=0.83). The morning activity is an established value and comprises of the sum of the \"awakening value\" and the \"plus thirty value.\" The value of morning activity increased in IG from 35.67U/mL at 0 to 59.95U/mL at1, possibly indicating a \"healthy\"\u2014that is, physiological, well-functioning\u2014regulation with lesser \"alertness\" (in absolute degrees) thanin CG. This effect, compared with the overall tendency ofamylase values in IG to show less responsiveness in IG, forexample,decreasedawakeningresponse,incombinationwithmeasured outcomes of lower vegetative-endocrinologicalstress symptoms, could be interpreted, but with caution,as a sign that the participants of IG possibly started theirday being less alert or \"stressed.\" However, this is a morephysiological interpretation due to the knowledge of the 2stress axes. The evening effect did not show any significantdifferenceorcorrelation.Themorningeffectcouldthus,quitepossibly, be influenced\u2014or \"produced\"\u2014by better recovery(see next passage) in the evening/during the night andcould yet be lost during the day. Since these results andtheir theoretical association with a still vague knowledgein the field of amylase-cortisol-stress pathophysiology arerather speculative, they can only be seen and carefullybe interpreted as \"piloting insights,\" certainly warrantingfurtherandmorethoroughinvestigation. Ac r u c i a lq u e s t i o ni s which determinants of the training led to the measured effects (secondary objective). Possible answers may be offered by results from the other question-naires:thestudyresultsshowthattheparticipantswhoweretrained(IG)feltanincreaseofmindfulnessbetween 0and1, morethantheCG.Furthermore,anincreaseoftherecoveryexperiencecanbeseenbetweengroupsat 1.Itmayhavebeen easier for the IG to \"disconnect\" or detach from work, relax,and assume control in leisure time to meet new challengeswhiletheyunderwentthetraining.Perhapstheyfellbackintoo l dp a t t e r n sa ft e rt h ee n do ft h et r a i n i n g ,w h i c hc o u l db ethereasonwhytherewasnocomparableeffectat 2.Likewise, the Flourishing Scale showed significant differences withinthe IG between0and1and between0and2,a sw e l l as between groups at1.M a y b et h o s ee x e r c i s e sa c ta sa \" dooropener\"forpersonaldevelopmentandself-care[ 9]and p o s s i b l yt h ei n s t r u c t i o n sw e r eh e l p f u lo rw e r et h eb a s i sf o r thatprogress.

By undergoing thehappinesstraining,theparticipantsperhapsgotintouchwiththemselvesandtheirsurroundingandmayhaverealizedthatthey can influence and control, at least to some extent, their environment. Another strong correlation exists between the morning levels of alpha-amylase and satisfaction, so theremaybeaconnectionbetweengettingup,feelinglessarousal,andfeelingsatisfied.

It is possible that the training also initiated a \"cultural change,\" possibly involving an improved work \"climate\" asincidentally reported by participants, through a conceivabledomino effect caused by the intervention group and com-mon hubs at the company (e.g., meeting each other at thecafeteria).

Moreover, because there were no timekeepers attached to the saliva boxes and participants took saliva samples athome without supervision, we cannot guarantee that thesalivasampleswerealwayscollectedatthecorrecttime. Since we used a waitlist control group design and not an activecontrol,measuredeffectsbetweentheIGandCGcouldbeexplainedpartlybyexpectationeffects. Furthermore we did not perform formal sample size estimation. Sample size considerations would have, in thisparticular case, contravened actual randomization proce-dures, and other on-site needs, since the department anddivisionstructuresofthecompany,aswellastheactualoutletofdiversefacilities,werethemaindeterminantforfeasibilityin this regard. However, we tried to acquire the biggestnumber of participants achievable.

Conclusions The online happiness training led to higher scores in the self-report measures of happiness and life satisfaction. Thetrainingalsohadapositiveeffectonstressreactionsbecausethe individual awareness (perception) of stress decreasedsignificantly. Thus, it appears that the online training mayb eau s e f u lt o o li no c c u p a t i o n a lh e a l t hs e t t i n g sa n da m o n gemployeeswithhighlevelsofwork-relatedstress. These results suggest that the training could be a tool withsomeadditionalhealth-promotingormedicalrelevance(e.g., for primary care, health promotion, and preventivesettings). Hence, positive training effects were also seen inan increase in mindfulness, recovery experience, and flour-ishing. Moreover, effects of the training continued and werestillsignificant,persisting4weeksaftertheendofthetraining(except for the muscular Stress Warning Signals and thevariableof\"flourishing\"inthebetween-groupanalysis),thuspointing towards some sustained changes. The training may have initiated a process within the participants that had a long-term (at least 4 weeks) effect. However, underlyingmechanisms and mediators of said effects still remain 13 CG= Controlgroup = e n ' s = Correlationcoefficient =M e a n SD= Standarddeviation.

The aim of the study was to elucidate the immediate, intermediate, and anticipatory sleepiness reducing effects of a salutogenic self-care procedure called progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), during lunch breaks. The second exploratory aim deals with determining the onset and long-term time course of sleepiness changes. In order to evaluate the intraday range and interdaychangeoftheproposedrelaxationeffects,14callcenteragentswereassignedtoeitheradaily20-minuteself-administeredPMRorasmalltalk(ST)groupduringaperiodofsevenmonths.Participants'levelsofsleepinesswereanalyzedinacontrolledtrialusing anticipatory,postlunchtime,andafternoonchangesofsleepinessa sindicatedbycontinuouslydeterminedobjectivereactiontime measures (16,464 measurements) and self-reports administered five times per day, once per month (490 measurements). Results indicatethat,incomparisontoST,thePMRbreak(a)inducesimmediate,intermediate,andanticipatoryreductionsinsleepiness; (b) these significant effects remarkably show up after one month, and sleepiness continues to decrease for at least another five months. Although further research is required referring to the specific responsible mediating variables, our results suggest thatrelaxationbasedlunchbreaksarebothacceptedbyemployeesandprovideasustainableimpactonsleepiness. 1. Introduction Prevalence studies show that around 13% of the population suffers from increased sleepiness during the day [ 1]. Next to obesity and an impaired quality of life, in occupationalsettings, sleepiness also impairs motivation, mood, and jobsatisfaction and can lead to adverse health outcomes [ 2-7]. In occupational settings, self-care interventions are used self-care level within the context of nonshift work and organizational daily life settings [ 16,17]. Hence, the main aim of the present study is to analyze the recovery valueof a promising but rarely evaluated salutogenic break-time activity: PMR. In detail, the study will determine PMR-basedlunchbreaksresultinasustainable,respectively,immediate,intermediate,andanticipatoryeffectsofreduced sleepiness. We expected PMR to reduce sleepiness-related symp- t o m s ,a sP M Rr e s u l t si nag e n e r a lp a r a s y m p a t h i c a lm o d e2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine of deactivation starting a wide variety of recovery processes by reduced cognitive, muscular, and cardiovascular activity[18-21]. Specifically, within laboratory settings, there are many well-documented recovery effects of relaxation andPMRontheneurobiological,cardiovascular,neuromuscular,electrodermal, autonomous, and central nervous processes. These, again, might lead to either a broadly energized state including reduced emotional, motivational, and cognitivestrain or reduced physical and mental fatigue; together,they all might contribute to reduced sleepiness experiences[17,22-24]. Due to both these theoretical and empirical hints connecting PMR with short-term mental and physicaldeactivation and its ability to counteract a broad rangeof cognitive, emotional, and motivational sleepiness-relatedsymptoms[ 25],ourpreliminaryhypothesisclaimsthat PMR- basedlunchbreaksresultinimmediatereducedsleepiness . Additionally, we suggest that due to necessary familiar- izationprocesses,referringtobuildingtrustintherelaxationsetting and the nonnegative reactions of supervisors andcolleagues, an onset of the sleepiness reducing effects mightoccur after several weeks of habituation [ 26]. Therefore, a further refined hypothesis suggests that PMR-based lunch breaksresultinimmediatereducedsleepinesswhenfamiliariza-tion has been completed. As shown above, numerous studies havedocumentedtherecoverypotentialofsystematicrelax-ation techniques in nonworksite research fields. However,theseoccupationalself-careprocedures[ 27]haveneverbeen implemented into organizational contexts before. After sat-isfying the needs of a realistic occupational implementationofPMR,ourHypothesisclaimsthat PMR-basedlunchbreaks result in immediate reduced sleepiness when familiarization has been completed and will then continuously increase for atleastfivemoremonths. After proposing the expected long-term increase of the sleepiness effects over several months (\"interday perspec-tive\"),itstillremainsuncleariftheeffectslastseveralminutes(as demonstratedinseverallaboratorystudies) [ 28]o rifth e impactofPMRenduresforseveralhours(\"intradayperspec-tive\"). Knowing the effects, half-life time helps to determinethetotalimpact,totaladdedvalue,and,thus,individualandorganizational relevance, which are created by PMR breaks.In order to evaluate the total benefit, the analyzed effectshave to be extended from immediate (several minutes) andintermediate (several hours) effects to anticipatory effects(next day). The anticipatory effect reflects a long-rangeimpactofPMRonthesleepinessoftheanticipatorystatusofthe following day [ 17]. Our hypotheses can be summarized as follows: PMR-based lunch breaks result in, respectively, immediate, intermediate, and anticipatory effects (intradayperspective) of reduced sleepiness when familiarization hasbeencompletedandwillthencontinuouslyincreaseforatleastfivemoremonths(interdayperspective) . 2. Method 2.1. Participants. All participants took part voluntarily. Par- ticipantsconsistedofinboundcallcenteragentsrecruitedina medium-sized company in Germany dealing with queriesabout professional installations. Of the 30 agents workingin the call center, 16 were chosen randomly, from which t w od e c l i n e dt op a r t i c i p a t e ,r e s u l t i n gi nat o t a ls a m p l eo f14 participants (participation rate: 47%). Participants metthe following inclusion criteria: (a) having worked as callcenter agents for more than six months, with a regular five-day schedule, 40 working hours weekly, and a fixed daily work schedule from 8:00 to 17:00; (b) being healthy and reportednosleepdisturbances(e.g.,duetohavinganewbornat home); and (c) having no prior experience in systematicdeeprelaxationprocedures. Through the use of randomization procedure, seven pairs, which had been matched in age (range \u00b14y e a r s )a n d gender, were either assigned to the PMR or to the ST group.ParticipantsintheSTgroupweretoldthattheywereputonawaitinglist.Eachgroup(STandPMR)consistedoffourmalea n dt h r e ef e m a l ep a r t i c i p a n t s .Th em e a na g eo ft h ef e m a l eparticipantswas35.0years(SD=9.5)inthePMRgroupand34.5years(SD=7.0)intheSTgroup.Themeanageofthemaleparticipantswas43.3years(SD=8.0)inthePMRgroupand41.0years(SD=11.6)intheSTgroup. 2.1.1. A Priori Group Equivalence Check. With regard to the relatively small sample, we tested the equivalence of thegroups by calculating chi square tests (for sedative medica-tion) and Mann-Whitneytests for age, body-mass index (BMI),lengthofworkwithinacompany,andsleepqualityfordependent groups. In order to reduce the relevant -error, a high level of significance was chosen ( =.20). The results confirmed the likeness of the experimental groups for eachofthedemographicvariables( >.20). The measurements and the experimental procedures wereincompliancewithAmericanPsychologicalAssociation(APA) ethical principles. We considered a written informedconsent from all participants about the measurements andthe experimental procedures as sufficient, as the study onlyinduced negligible risks; that is, it did not involve anyforeseeable risk, harm, or discomfort. This procedure of notinvolvingaresearchethicscommitteeapprovalisinlinewith APAregulations. 2.2. Procedure. After identifying lunch breaks as important recovery occasions in a presurvey, we invited interestedparties to an informative meeting through internal com-munication by the management. In this meeting, the callcenter agents were asked to participate in an experimental s t u d y .A l lp a r t i c i p a n t sw e r es c r e e n e di nas h o r tp e r s o n a l interview in order to ensure that they corresponded to ourcriteria of selection. Participants were told that the purposeof the study was to explore general effects on different waysto spend lunch breaks. However, no specific hypothesesweredisclosed.Inreturnforparticipation,participantswerepromisedreportsaboutbothindividualsleepinessprofilesaswell as the overall study findings. We did not compensateparticipatingemployeesfortheirservices.Inanexperimentalfield control group set-up lasting seven months (one monthpreintervention and six months during intervention fromSeptember to April), call center agents were randomly allo-cated to the experimental lunch break conditions: (a) 20Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 minutes of PMR or (b) 20 minutes ST break.

Participants were instructed to maintain their regular behavior during the seven-month measurement period.Additionally, the PMR group was instructed not to practicePMR in their free time. All participants were questionedabout their leisure time activities. None of the participantshadtobeexcludedduetononcompliantbehavior.Moreover,prior to each lunch break all subjects reported that theyhadabstainedfromalcohol,nicotine,andstrenuousexercisefor the past hour (included in self-report questionnaires).Caffeine consumption was determined at each self-reportmeasurement both in terms of quantity and time of con-sumption;theself-reportmeasurementtookplacefivetimesper day once per month. There were no differences in daily consumptionbetweenthetwogroups( <.05). 2.3.Measures 2.3.1. Self-Report Scales. A well-proven, German version of theKarolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) [ 29], served as primary outcome and was used to determine the sleepiness states.Participants had to choose the most appropriate descriptionof their level. On this one-item KSS5=1 6 : 0 0h ) ,o ns e v e nw o r k i n gd a y s( KSS1-KSS7)o v e r the seven-month measuring period ( KSS1=0.50 months, KSS2=+ 0 . 5 0m o n t h s ,KSS3=+ 1 . 5 0m o n t h 2 months,KSS5= +3.50 months,KSS6= +4.50 months, KSS7= +5.50 months) to duration of PMR effects on sleepiness. The premeasurement KSS0(ST break for both groups) served as baseline findings. Moreover, thePittsburghSleepQualityIndex(PSQI)consistingof18itemswas applied as well as a 10-item questionnaire that capturecaffeine consumption, lunch break activities, and a 3-itemsleepdiary(bedtime,awakeningtime,andsleepduration). 2.3.2. Reaction Time Parameters. To provide an objective measure of the participants' sleepiness, reaction time (RT)measurementsservingasprimaryoutcomeswererecordedbythe call center's inherent performance measurement system. On each working day, call center-specific standard perfor-mance indicators were recorded, specifically, the beginningand end of calls and other in-bound task-related indicators.Thehighlystandardizedstructureofanin-boundcallcenteragent's work-task loop can be described as follows: ringing (e0), accepting call (e1), starting introductory phrase (e2), with the customer's complaints/ending call andlogging-out (e3), postprocessing of call and logging-in (e4),andwaitingforthenextcall/ringing(e5=e0).Accordingly,apartofthecallcenteragent'sregularworkingtaskistoreactasquicklyaspossibletoanincomingcall.Thesystemrecordedeachworkfloweventwithtimestamps. The RT in this study was operationalized as a time difference between ringing (e0) and accepting a call (e1).The average duration of a single work-task loop (and thusthe interstimulus interval) was approximately three min-utes. The corresponding RT was logged during the wholeworking day and was compared to the sleepiness indicatingpsychomotor vigilance task approach (cf. PVT) [ 30]. After this,thecommonlyappliedPVTmetricwascalculatedfromt h eR Tt oc a p t u r et h es l o w e s tR T ,9 0 t hp e r c e n t i l eo fR T(RT90), which indicates a prolonged reaction to a sustainedattention demanding stimulus. In summary, we computedone RT90-measure per hour, eight hours per day ( RT1= 8:00-8:59h,RT2=9 : 0 0 - 9 : 5 9h ,RT3=1 0 : 0 0 - 1 0 : 5 9h ,RT4= =16,464indicatorsovertheseven-monthmeasuringperiod. The missing data (due to technical problems, holidays, and illness; in total 2.9%) of a participant on a specific time ofday was replaced by stochastic regression. That is to say, thecorresponding time-of-day data of the remaining days wereappliedaspredictorsforthemissingvalue[ 31]. 2.3.3. Manipulation Check. We checked compliance and qualityofrelaxationby(a)applyingaVisualAnalogueScale(VAS) [32] to rate depth of PMR relaxation (ranging from 0 = \"no relaxation\" to 100 = \"very deep relaxation\") and achecklist of relaxation symptoms during the PMR breaks,which involved questions about the feeling of heavinessin 16 different muscle groups. Furthermore, the monthlyscheduled checks included (b) informal questioning of par-ticipantsbynonparticipatingcolleaguesabouttheiractivitiesduringlunchbreaks(e.g.,howoftentheyusethesilentroom for the PMR group or how often they participate in small talks for ST group) and subsequent completion of question-naires designed to evaluate certain lunch break activitiesand (c) weekly masked observations by nonparticipatingpeer colleagues (two persons per group). Noncompliantbehavior (nonadherence to the lunch break mode) couldbeextrapolatedfromtheabove-mentionedquestioningsandobservations. Furthermore, reporting less than 50 percentof the relaxation symptoms served as exclusion criterion.None of the participants fell below this criterion. Moreover,the results of the informal questioning showed an averagenumberofadequatePMRbreaksduringthe6-monthexper-imental period of 3.6 per week (72%; SD = 0.2) and for4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine the ST group 4.5 per week (90%; SD = 0.3). Major reasons for not conducting an ST and PMR break were privateobligations,socialobligations(solvingwithin-groupconflictsand emotional support for colleagues), and falling asleepwhilepracticingPMR(lessthan20%ofthewholePMRbreaktrials). 2.4.

Data are shown as ST group: grey color; PMR group: of post hoc comparison(<.05). [13,36].ExceptforthestudybyKrajewskietal.[ 17],to date, intermediate effects of several hours have not been includedwithin existing PMR studies. Therefore, their appearanceprovides the first evidence for an extended range of PMReffects, which highlights the need to include postmeasure-ments of several hours after the PMR session to estimatethe half-life time and the total impact of PMR recoveryeffects. In contrast, the commonly practiced ST break hasshownanalmostnormalcircadianrhythmasexpectedfrompreviousliterature[ 37].Althoughmuchweakeranticipatory effects of relaxation were observed, results were significantfor the first time. It can be speculated that slow adjustmentsin effort might lead to a redistribution of effort and, thus,daily activity. These changes are guided by the prospect of arelaxing break, which indirectly results in higher effort andlowerprebreaksleepiness.Importantconclusions,whichcanbe drawn from these results, are that even measurementsprior to the intervention should be included into an esti- mation of the total impact of an intervention. PMR effects take? Th i sq u e s t i o nw i l lh e l pt od e t e r m i n et h et i m es c a l ef o rstudy designs of future self-care occupational intervention programs. Furthermore, estimating the trend will enable usto estimate the long-term stability and, therefore, the totalimpact and practical relevance of PMR-based lunch breaks.The starting point for the majority of PMR effects is mostlyinthefirstmonth,showingaconstantlyincreasingeffectsizeoversixmonths.Thisresultisofhighrelevancefordesigningfuture studies evaluating the impact of PMR and self-careprocedures in general, because it indicates that at least onemonth of learning and familiarization is needed to buildexpertiseandtrust,bothprerequisitesofdeepPMRrecovery. Results showed an earlier sleepiness reducing effect in subjective measures than in objective measures. Subjectivemeasures might benefit earlier from PMR because they areonlyinfluencedbyoneagent.Effectsinasinglereactiontimebased objective measure shows less clear results due to theirdependence on the agents' effort and cognitive processingspeed. Nevertheless, due to multiple testing, the reaction time measures show comparable results to the subjective indicatorsofsleepiness. This intervention study does not claim to identify single isolated determinants underlying the sleepiness reductionbut rather focuses on ecological validity; this should be keptin mind when mentioning several limitations referring tointernal validity. Specifically, the study builds evidence forthefeasibility,acceptance,andefficacyofaPMR-basedlunchbreak within totally realistic occupational daily life settings.Methodological difficulties referring to the frequency andquality of experimental PMR and ST break realization,8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine therefore, may have occurred.

Identifying these isolateddeterminantsisanimportantsecondstepofaresearchchain;however, it is a necessary first step to prove the overalleffectiveness of an intervention. This approach is often usedin intervention evaluation studies that aim to evaluate theoverallefficacyofaprogram[ 39,40]. It is conceivable that imitation of the PMR break by the ST group might have occurred in leisure time. However,informal interviews gave no hint of this, and even if thisimitation had occurred, the real difference between evenings leep in es so fS Ta n dPMRw o uldh a v ebeenun der es tim a t ed .Furthermore, there are uncertainties to the explanation ofthe anticipatory results: they might be induced by mediatoreffectsofchangedactivityorsleeppatternathome[ 41]rather thandirectlyinfluencedbyPMRbreaks.

We have tried to compensate for a potential lack of robustness, internal validity, and significance of the results by applying repeated measurements. Future research mightattempt to use further physiological [ 42,43], behavioral [44,45], or acoustically based sleepiness measures [ 46,47]. Finally, it might be of further interest to measure indi-vidual performance and productivity indices, which mightbe considered as relevant endpoints from a perspective oforganizationaleffectiveness.

In summary, the results of this longitudinal pilot study indicate that a PMR-based lunch break, as a salutogenicself-care procedure, may significantly reduce sleepiness forseveralhours(immediateandintermediateeffect)inrealisticdaily work settings. Additionally, the current study extendsprior research by revealing anticipatory effects of sleepiness prior and with the prospect of a PMR break.

Finally,the study provides evidence for the long-term acceptanceand sustainability of the salutogenic recovery focused lunchbreak regime utilizing silent rooms as an implementation module enabling them to include PMR within daily lunchbreakroutines.

Introduction With a lifetime prevalence of approximately 5.7% (National Comorbidity Survey Replication, [ 1]), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disor-ders. GAD patients suffer from excessive worry and physio-logicalarousalsymptomssuchaspoorsleep,muscletension, and irritability. The disorder causes significant disabilities in patients'lives;forexample,GADisassociatedwithsignificantimpairmentinsocialandgeneralfunctioning[ 2].According toaWHOstudy,38%ofindividualswithGADhadmoderate to severe occupational role impairment, with a mean of 6.3 disability days per month [ 3]. Furthermore, GAD is also associatedwithbothincreasedhealthcareutilization[ 4]andcomorbid health problems. Disability is, thus, a significant probleminGAD. In order to advance treatment approaches, it is crucial to carefully describe the characteristics of the patient pop-ulation and determine which factors are protective against the social and occupational disability that is associated with the disorder. With newer self-report instruments, furthercharacterization of GAD patients has become possible. Twotraits that have recently received a lot of attention in thecontext of mindfulness-based therapeutic approaches are\"mindfulness\"and\"self-compassion.\" Mindfulnessistypicallydefinedasnonjudgmentalatten- tion to experiences in the moment [ 5,6]. It has beenwellestablishedthatmindfulnesscontributestomental2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine health[7,8].Thereisverylittleempiricaldatatodemonstrate thatmindfulnesslevelsarelowinGADpatients.Sofar,onlyone small study has reported that levels of mindfulness aresignificantlylowerinGADpatientscomparedtononanxiouscontrols(=16,[9]). Self-compassion has been defined as being \"open to and moved by one's own suffering, experiencing feelings of caring and kindness towards oneself, taking an under-standing,nonjudgmentalattitudetowardsone'sinadequaciesand failures, and recognizing that one's own experience ispart of the common human experience\" [ 10]. This emerging psychological construct has been shown to be positivelyassociatedwithmeasuresofpsychologicalhealth,suchaslifesatisfaction,socialconnectedness,andemotionalintelligence[11] ,a n dc o m m i t m e n tt om a k i n ga d a p t i v eh e a l t hc h a n g e s in one's life [ 10,12]. Aside from lower mindfulness in the small sample of GAD patients, Roemer and colleagues havealso reported lower scores in self-compassion compared tononanxious individuals [ 9]. In a large community sample of treatment-seeking but nondiagnosed anxious individuals,self-compassion was associated with symptom severity andqualityoflife[ 13]. In their current operationalizations [ 10,14]m i n d f u l n e s s and self-compassion are highly correlated, and a correlationcoefficient of=0.69 h a sb e e nr e p o r t e di nan o n c l i n i c a l population[ 15].Inthelargesampleofnondiagnosedanxious individuals, self-compassion accounted for ten times moreuniquevarianceinthedependentvariablesthanmindfulness[13]. Thesedatasuggestthatself-compassionandmindfulness are low in anxiety disorders. However, studies are limited by small sizes [ 9] and lack of clinical diagnoses [ 13], and therefore the contribution of both variables to sufferingin GAD has not entirely been determined. Furthermore,both of these studies have employed the Mindful AttentionAwareness scale (MAAS, [ 7]), which is operationalized to mostly address the attentional component of mindfulness.Thefivefacetmindfulnessquestionnaire(FFMQ,[ 14])allows for a more complex assessment of various aspects of themindfulnessconstructandhowtheymightcontributetothesufferinginGAD. Both mindfulness and self-compassion are constructs that describe how individuals relate to themselves and totheir experiences, including unpleasant experiences such aspain and fear. Pain research demonstrates that mindfulnessinterventionscanhelppatientswithchronicpaintoenhancewell being and quality of life, even when chronic painsymptoms continue [ 16,17]. In this context, a distinction is oftenmadebetween\"pain\"versus\"suffering\"(c.f.[ 18]).While pain refers to the sensory aspect of the experience, sufferingrefers to the subjective emotional experience that emergesfromaninternalresistanceagainstaspecificexperience[ 19]. Mindfulness research on pain reveals that with mindfulnesstraining, an experience is possible where while painful sensations might be experienced, and patients might not necessarilyneedtosufferfromthem.Rather,painsensationscanbemindfullyexperiencedaswhattheyreallyare,namely,sensoryexperiences.Whilethislineofargumentationstemsfrompainresearch,theprinciplecan beeasilytransferredtot h efi e l do fa n x i e t y .H e r e ,t h ei d e ai st h a ta n x i e t ys y m p t o m s can be experienced, but with increased mindfulness andself-compassion, patients might feel less disabled by theirdisorder. It is, therefore, possible that mindfulness and self-compassion might ameliorate the amount of disability anindividual experiences from their disorder, even in the presence of high levels of symptoms. Data supporting this role for self-compassion come from research by Neff andMcGehee [ 20], who found that self-compassion was linked to resilience in adolescents and young adults. No previousstudies,however,haveinvestigatedtheimpactofmindfulnessorself-compassionondisabilityinGAD.

Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants. Individuals with current GAD as defined by the DSM-IV-TR [ 21] criteria and healthy controls with high ratings of subjective stress were recruited to the Mas-sachusetts General Hospital Department of Psychiatry toparticipate in a stress reduction course. The patients andcontrols were recruited through two separate protocols bydifferentstaff,duringthesametimeperiod(2008to2011). All participants underwent a psychiatric diagnostic assessment that was performed by trained M.D. or Ph.D.levelstudycliniciansusingtheStructuredClinicalInterviewfor DSM-IV [ 22]. Patients with anxiety were eligible to participateiftheywereoutpatientswithaprimarypsychiatricdiagnosisofgeneralizedanxietydisorder(GAD)andabove18yearsofage.Additionally,patientsmusthavereceivedaratingof 16 or higher on the HAM-A [ 23]d u r i n gs c r e e n i n gt ob e eligible,asthisscoreofsymptomseveritygenerallyindicatesmoderateGAD[ 24,25]. Stressed healthy controls were eligible if they did not have any current psychiatric disorder and did not meet a diagnosis within the last six months. Furthermore, theywere eligible if their score on the four-item Perceived StressScale (PSS) was higher than the population mean of 4.5[26,27], if they were right handed, and between the ages of 23-60. History of significant head trauma, presence ofmetallic body implants, or a history of claustrophobia wasexclusionary, as the protocol with stressed healthy subjectshadaneuroimagingcomponent. Eligibility for both groups required that participants be medically healthy and free from a lifetime history ofs c h i z o p h r e n i ao ra n yo t h e rp s y c h o s i s ,m e n t a lr e t a r d a t i o n ,organic medical disorders, bipolar disorder, posttraumaticEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 stressdisorder,orobsessivecompulsivedisorder(OCD),and alcohol or substance abuse or dependence within the past6 months. In the GAD group, patients taking antidepres-sants or benzodiazepines were allowed by other psychiatricmedications,suchasantipsychoticsandanticonvulsantswereexclusionary.Psychiatricmedicationsofanykindwereexclu- sionaryforthestressedhealthycontrols. Exclusion criteria for both groups included significant previous meditation or yoga experience.

W rittenconsentwasobtainedfromallpartic- ipants and the study protocols were approved by the MGHinstitutional review board. Participants received diagnosticscreens using the Structured Interview for DSM-IV-TR AxisIDisorders[ 21]andfilledoutself-reportquestionnaires. 2.3.Measures 2.3.1.MeasuresforAllSubjects (1) SCS is a 26-item self- report instrument that uses a 5-point Likert scale for eachitem to assess compassion and kindness towards oneself,partiallythroughseeingone'sexperiencesasnotuniqueandspecific to the individual but part of a larger human experi-ence [28]. Individuals respond to how often they behave in themannerthatisdescribedineachstatement,from\"almostnever\" (1) to \"almost always\" (5). Examples include, \"I try tobe loving towards myself when I'm feeling emotional pain,\"and\"whenthingsaregoingbadlyforme,Iseethedifficultiesas part of life that everyone goes through.\" The SCS has sixsubscales. The positive subscales are self-kindness, commonhumanity (realizing that one's experiences are similar toothers),andMindfulness,andthreenegativesubscaleswhicha r et h o u g h tt or e fl e c tt h es a m ec o n c e p t sb u ti nt h en e g a t i v estate, which are reverse-coded; and self-judgment, isolation,andover-identification(becomingabsorbedinone'ssituation andemotionalreaction,losingamoreobjectiveperspective), respectively.ScoresonthesubscalesareaveragedtocomputethetotalSCSscore,witharangeofpossibletotalscoresfrom1.00to5.00;thisisachangefromthesummaryscoremethodt ot h em e a ns c o r ec a l c u l a t i o nm e t h o d ,a sp r o p o s e db yt h eauthor'sscale[ 29].TheSCShasdemonstratedgoodreliability andvalidityinEnglish,Thai,andTaiwanese[ 10,30]. (2) Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) .Th eF i v e Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ, [ 14]) is a 39-item scalethatwasdevelopedbasedonanitempoolofpreviouslyexisting mindfulness questionnaires. Factor analyses overthese items yielded five facets of mindfulness: observing(attendingtoornoticinginternalandexternalstimulisuchassensations,emotions,cognitions,sights,sounds,andsmells);describing (noting or mentally labeling these stimuli with words); acting with awareness (attending to one's currentactions, as opposed to behaving automatically or absent-mindedly); nonjudgingof inner experience (refrainingfromevaluation of one's sensations, cognitions, and emotions);andnonreactivitytoinnerexperience(allowingthoughtsand feelings to come and go, without attention getting caught in them).Responses totheitemsaregivenona5-pointLikert-t y p es c a l e( 1=n e v e ro rv e r yr a r e l yt r u e ,5=v e r yo ft e no ralwaystrue).Thefivesubscaleshavepresentedwithadequatetogoodinternalconsistency[ 14].

The SCID is a semistructured interview for making themajorAxisIDSM-IVdiagnosessuchasanxietyandaffectivedisorders, alcohol and substance abuse and dependence,eatingdisorders,andpsychoticdisorders[ 22]. (4) Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) .Th eA S Ii sa1 6 - i t e ms e l f - report instrument designed to assess fear of anxiety and tomeasure individuals' discomfort with a variety of sensationsassociated with anxiety and panic [ 31]. Individuals score itemsona5-pointLikertscale. (5) Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) .Th eP S W Qi s a 16-item self-rated measure that is used to measure thegenerality, excessiveness, and uncontrollability of patholog-ical worry [ 32]. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale and summed to form a total score ranging from 16to 80. Individuals with GAD have been shown to scoresignificantlyhigheronthePSWQthanindividualswithotheranxietydisorders[ 33].ThePSWQhasexcellentpsychometric propertiesinstudent,community,andclinicalsamples[ 34]. (6) State Trait Anxiety Inventory Trait (STAI) .Th eS T A Ii s a standardized questionnaire for assessing anxiety; the traitanxiety subscale includes 20 items that evaluate a moregeneral and long-standing quality of \"trait anxiety\" [ 35]. Respondents indicate how they generally feel about each statement on a 4-point Likert scale, from \"almost never\" (1)to\"almostalways\"(4). 2.3.2. MeasuresforGADIndividualsOnly (1) Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) .Th eS D Si sa3 - i t e m measure of self-reported social and work related disability due to psychological symptoms [ 36]. The patient rates the extent to which life is impaired by his or her symptomson a 10-point-visual analog scale, which uses spatio visual,numeric, and verbal descriptive anchors simultaneously toassess disability. The three items are in the form of \"thesymptomshavedisruptedyour ...(work/schoolwork;social life/leisureactivities;andfamilylife/homeresponsibilities).\" (2) Beck Anxiety Scale (BAI) . The BAI is a 21-item ques- tionnairemeasuringseverityofanxietysymptoms,includingnervousness, fear, and somatic symptoms, in psychiatricpopulations, 27]). The PSS is a validated self-report questionnaire widely used for assessing an indi-vidual'sself-perceptionofstress.ThePSShas14-,10-,and4-itemversionsandhasbeenshowntoyieldadequatereliabilityand validity [ 26,27]. This study used the 4-item version as an inclusion measure for controls. The scale inquires aboutfeelings and thoughts over the past month, and respondentsindicate how often they felt a certain way using a 5-point-Likert scale (0 = never, 4 = very often); responses are thensummed. Normative scores have been found to be 4.2 (SD2.8)and4.7(SD3.1),formenandwomen,respectively. 2.4. Statistical Methods. Demographic and clinical differ- ences between the GAD group and controls were examinedusing independent samples-tests and Chi-square tests for categorical variables. Associations between clinical variableswere determined by running correlation analyses. Multipleregression analyses were performed using anxiety and self-compassion as predictors of disability in the GAD sample.TheBAIwasusedasameasureofanxietysymptoms,asprevi-ousworkhasdemonstratedthattheBAIscorereflectsoverallanxietysymptomseverity[ 38-40].Statisticalsignificancewas setat=0.05. 3.

The sample consisted of 87 individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for current GAD (51.22% females; meana g ;S D1 3 . 0y e a r s )a n d4 9h e a l t h yc o n t r o l sw i t hhighratingsofsubjectivestressbutnopsychiatricdiagnoses (65.31% females; mean age 38.7 years; SD 10.9 years). Of theGAD patients, 31.25% (and 0% of the healthy controls) were taking psychiatric medications. There were no significant statistical differences in age, gender, and race between thet w og r o u p s ,a n dt h u st h e s ev a r i a b l e sw e r en o te n t e r e da scovariatesinthemainanalysis(see Table 1). 3.2.ClinicalAnxiety,Mindfulness,andSelf-CompassionMea- sures.Ashypothesized,patientswithGADhadsignificantly lower scores on the SCS than did the controls. Patients withGAD had a mean (SD) score of 2.44 (0.59) on the total SCS,compared to 3.17 (0.60) in the healthy controls ( =6.89 , <0.001 All of the subscales were also significantly dif- ferent,withtheGADpatientsscoringlowerinself-kindness,common humanity, and mindfulness, and higher in self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification (all s<0.003, seeTable nonreactivity (alls<0.001,seeTable 1),comparedtohealthyparticipants.

FFMQ and SCS total scores were highly correlated in GAD patients ( =0.62 , <0.001 )a n dh e a l t h yp a r t i c i p a n t s(=0.77,<0.001 ). Consistent with our hypothesis, patients with GAD also hadsignificantly higher scores on the than did controls (see Table 1). There was no difference in self-compassion scores be- tween men and women, neither in the sample of GAD pa-tients (alls>0.14), nor in the healthy participants (allEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 Table 2: (a) Correlation matrix: anxiety measures and self- compassion for the combined sample ( =136). (b) Correlation matrix: anxiety measures and self-compassion for GAD patients(=8 7 ). (c) Correlation matrix: anxiety measures and scoresinGADpatients(alls>0.07)orhealthyparticipants (alls>0.13). Further, in the whole sample, as well as in both GAD patients and healthy participants separately, both SCS andFFMQ scores were negatively correlated with trait anxiety,worry, and anxiety sensitivity (see Table 2). All correlations, except for the correlation between FFMQ and ASI scores inhealthyparticipantsweresignificant. 3.3. Self-Compassion, Mindfulness and Anxiety as Predictors for Disability in GAD. Fourteen of the 87 GAD patients were missing BAI scores, as this scale was introduced to thestudy four weeks after the study began. In order to assessthe relevance of lower mindfulness and self-compassionscores for disability in GAD patients, regression analyseswere performed to predict levels of the Sheehan DisabilityScale. Since anxiety symptoms are an obvious predictorfor disability in GAD patients, BAI scores were also usedas a further predictor. all three variables simultaneously into a multiple regression, only the FFMQ total score ( =0.17 , SE=0.06,=0.003 )b u tn o ta n x i e t ys y m p t o ms e v e r i t yo n theBAI(=0.15,S E=0.09,=0.113 )orSCS(=0.90 , SE=1.62,=0.581 ) ((3,69)=8.41 ,<0.001 ). Thisassociationwasstillsignificantwhenmedicationusewasaddedasacovariate(=0.002 ). To determine what aspects of mindfulness were most strongly related to disability, we ran an additional analysis,entering each of the five subscales into the multiple regres-sion. factors nonjudging and lower mindfulness and self-compassion than controls, andthat both were negatively correlated with levels of anxiety,worry, and anxiety sensitivity. As expected, GAD patients had higher levels of worry and anxiety overall. Intriguingly, mindfulnesswasassociatedwithlevelsofdisabilityaboveandbeyondtheeffectsofanxietysymptomseverityinGAD . The findings of lower mindfulness and self-compassion levels in GAD corroborate earlier research [ 9]. Our findings were also similar to other research in anxiety disorders.Wernerandcolleaguesdemonstratedthatpatientswithsocialanxiety disorder, a disorder also associated with ruminativeworrybutwhichisfocusedonsocialinteractions,havelowerself-compassion than controls [ 41]. Taken together with our study,thismaysuggestthatanxietyofseveraltypesmightbeassociatedwithlowmindfulnessandself-compassion. The data presented here provide additional evidence regarding the unique contributions of mindfulness (andsecondarilyalsoofself-compassion)todisability.Thefindingthatthelevelofmindfulnessisastrongerpredictorthananxi-etysymptomsperseinthepredictionofdisabilityemphasizetheimportanceofconsideringmindfulnessasacrucialvari-ableinthedescriptionofGADandwhentailoringbehavioralinterventions to treat GAD. The usefulness of mindfulness-basedinterventionsfortheameliorationofanxietysymptomshasbeenconfirmedbyarecentmeta-analysis[ 42]. Our study results suggest that low trait mindfulness is r e l a t e dt op s y c h i a t r i cd i s a b i l i t y ,b e y o n dt h ee ff e c to fa n x i e t y on disability, which reveals another pathway to disability potentially not sufficiently affected by current treatments.This finding is similar to research by Wren and colleagues,who demonstrated that among patients with chronic pain,lowself-compassionwasassociatedwithhigherpaindisabil-ity [43]. The authors speculate that higher self-compassion might enable patients to \"have an accepting attitude towardtheir day-to-day limitations without ignoring or fixating ont h e m , \"l e a d i n gt h e mt oa l s oa c c e p te m o t i o n sr e l a t e dt op a i ndisability,\"whilestillmaintainingengagementinmeaningfulday-to-dayactivities.\" Our findings demonstrate that it is particularly higher levels of nonjudging of inner experience (refraining from6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine evaluationofone'ssensations,cognitions,andemotions)and describing (noting or mentally labeling these stimuli withwords) that contribute to lower disability above and beyondanxietysymptomseverity,suggestingthattheyareprotectiveinthepresenceofanxietysymptoms.Theabilitytolabelone'semotions without evaluating them might be an important skill for patients, which might help them continue to pursue meaningfulactivitiesdespitethepresenceofanxietyandpro-motebetteroverallfunctioning.Labelingone'saffecthasbeensuggestedtobeanincidentalemotionregulationprocessthatcanattenuatedistress[ 44].Notjudgingonesexperience,but notingitverbally,mightleadtoastateofdecentering;thatis,the capacity to observe phenomena as temporary, objectiveeventsinthemind,ratherthanreflectionsoftheselfthatarenecessarilytrue[ 45].Thedataofthisstudy,thus,corroborate theargumentthattheabilitytomindfullybeincontactwithone's emotions can be protective of disability, despite thepresenceofanxietysymptoms. The present findings are limited by the fact that subjects in the GAD study and in the healthy control study wererecruited by two different research groups for two separateprotocols, which may have resulted in bias. However, bothgroups received identical self-report questionnaireswith thesameinstructions,duringthesameoverallperiodoftimeandinthesameinstitution,andbothusedclinician-administereddiagnostic assessments to carefully determine diagnoses.Second, the study is limited by having only one measureof disability, rather than a combination of self-report andobjective measures. Finally, it is important to emphasizethat some would argue that the definition of \"mindfulness\" has not yet reached a consensus [ 46] nor does the concept of mindfulness yet have a consistent measuring instrument[47,48]. However, the results of our study emphasize the usefulnessoftheFFMQincharacterizingGADpatients,anditsimportantcontributiontodescribepatients'disability. In conclusion, these data support that mindfulness and self-compassionareworthwhileconstructstofurtherexplorein GAD treatment research, not only because they maycontribute to suffering in addition to that resulting fromanxiety, but also because of the independent relationship oflower mindfulness with greater disability, which suggests itmay be an important target for intervention.

A number of model biopsychosocial training programs exist in the civilian sector [ 10-13]. Several have adapted their programs to the military [ 10,12-14], and a smaller number have provided training to military personnel [ 14]. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive sys-tematic review of multimodal biopsychosocial programs forthe self-management of stress. The authors posit that theseinterventions could be markedly effective for individuals inhigh-stressenvironmentssuchasthemilitary. 1.1. Purpose of the Review. A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to (1) survey multimodal biopsy-chosocial training programs with at least one CAM/IMcomponent for the self-management of emotional stressacross all populations; (2) assess the quantity and quality ofthe research and programs; and (3) characterize the resultsby type of program and strength of evidence on stress-related outcome measures. Due to the massive amount ofthe literature included, the full report of this review will bedetailed in a much larger report, not suitable for detailingin one paper. The purpose of this current report is to (1)f o c u so nt h o s es t u d i e st h a tw e r es c o r e da sh i g hq u a l i t ya n ddemonstrated statistically significant results between groups(i.e.,interventiongroupversuscontrolorcomparisongroup)on outcomes of emotional stress for controlled trial studydesigns;(2)describethemultimodalprogramsavailableandtheir characteristics; (3) describe the results of outcomesrelated to emotional stress; and (4) discuss what the authorsbelieve to be the resource requirements needed to incor-porate these programs into a military setting for service members and their families.

Methods 2.1.ConceptsandDefinitions 2.1.1. Biopsychosocial Model. The biopsychosocial model (abbreviated\"BPS\")isatermintroducedin1977bytheAmer-ican psychiatrist George Engel which describes a health careperspective that acknowledges that biological, psychological(whichentailsthoughts,emotions,andbehaviors),andsocialfactorsallplayasignificantroleinhumanfunctioninginthecontext of wellness and illness. It is a term that is often usedtodescribetheconceptofthe\"mind-bodyconnection\"[ 8].2.1.2. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Modality. CAM is defined at the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine as: any of anumber of \"diverse medical and health care systems,practices, and products that are not generally consideredpart of conventional medicine\" ( http://nccam.nih.gov/ ). For the purposes of this review, the authors included only CAM modalities that also met our criteria for thebiopsychosocial model and self-management technique(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term=complementary +therapies ) and used definitions of CAM techniques of breathing, relaxation, yoga, imagery, hypnosis, and med-itation as described by the National Center without ongoing reliance on a trainer ortherapist.Theauthorsexcludedinterventionswherepatientssolely learn and integrate therapies by themselves (such asthrough a book or online material) or ones that are traineror therapist dependent (i.e., psychotherapy that requires atherapisttoleadthesessions). 2.1.4. Multimodality Interventions. These interventions are definedasthoseonesthathavetwoormoreinterventions(atleast one of which is CAM modality) that require an initialtraining period with a therapist or trainer in which skills arelearned,allofwhichcanbetransferredintoself-managementtechniques. The authors only included programs that havemultimodal interventions. An example is a program thatincludes relaxation, exercise, and behavioral techniques toreduce stress. The thought here was that multimodal pro-grams would allow for more of a biopsychosocial approachtotreatingthewholepersonforthecomplexitiesofemotionalstress. 2.1.5. Types of Program. T y p e so fp r o g r a m st h a tt h ea u t h o r s considered were those that include training in at least oneself-management multimodal training with the intention to reduce psychological or emotional stress. The program did notnecessarilyhavetobeanexistingnamedprogrampersebuthadtoincludeinterventionsthatcouldbedevelopedintoa program (e.g., a potential program). The authors includededucational training programs as long as they met thesecriteria. 2.2. Search Strategy. The following electronic databases were searched from database inception through February2009 across keywords identified: PUBMED, EmBase,BIOSIS, CINAHL, the entire Cochrane library as wellas the database of abstracts of reviews of effectiveness(DARE), PILOTS, PsycInfo, AMED, ERIC, and DoDBiomedical Research. Gray literature was also searchedfor unpublished trials via the Register of the ControlledTrials Publications Database, communicating with iden- tified experts in the field of CAM/IM for additional reportsof studies not included through traditional searching andpearlingreferencesofincludedarticles. 2.3. Study Selection. Studies were included if they involved (1) research on a program or potential program; (2) amultimodal intervention incorporating at least one CAMmodality (as defined by NCCAM and detailed by theNational Library of Medicine (NLM) http://nccam.nih .gov/health/providers/camterms.htm ;http://www.ncbi.nlm .nih.gov/mesh/?term=complementary+therapies ); (3) skills that were learned that could be used as self-managementtechniques, after a training period; (4) at least one outcomemeasure of psychological or emotional stress; (5) humansubjects from any clinical or nonclinical population; and(6) were presented in the English language. To encompassthe construct of \"psychological or emotional stress,\" studieswere included that used outcome measures containing oneof the following keywords: stress,anxiety,post-traumatic stress disorder ,coping,resilience,hardiness,burnout,distress, orrelaxation a tt h es c r e e n i n gp h a s e .S i n c ea l lh e a l t h ya n d clinical populations experience stress (although to varyingdegrees), the authors elected not to exclude any populationbased on predefined criteria about their conditions ordiagnoses. This was consistent with the authors' intent togeneralize about the value of these programs impacting thesymptoms of stress. Thus, all populations, both healthy andclinical (e.g., those with specific conditions or diagnoses), were included as long as the report included a description of emotional stress as defined above. Types of the literatureexcluded from this systematic review, were thought pieces,descriptive reviews or published expert opinions. The authors excluded the following interventions: ones in whichindividuals learned and integrated therapies by themselves; those that involved website training, books, or leaflets as t h es o l es o u r c eo ft h et r a i n i n g ;p h a r m a c o l o g i c a la g e n t so r p l a c e b o s ;a n dp e tt h e r a p y .C o g n i t i v eb e h a v i o r a lt h e r a p y (CBT) was not defined as a CAM practice by itself but wasincluded when it incorporated another CAM technique, such as deep breathing or relaxation exercises that were the predominant feature of the program. All programs had to involve at least one CAM modality as described above; noadditionalmedicalorpsychosocialprocedureswereincluded unless the program integrated those procedures with the CAM modality for the purpose of stress management. SeeBox1forthesearchtermsused. Five investigators (Cindy Crawford, Sasha Knowlton, Raheleh Khorsan, Dawn Wallerstedt, and Shawn Clausen) individually and independently screened all titles and abstracts in duplicate for relevance based on the inclusioncriteria mentioned above. Weekly team meetings were held between all five screeners to resolve any and all disagree- ments. 2.3.1. Quality Assessment and Data Extraction. Themethod- ological quality of included RCT studies was assessed inde-pendently by four reviewers in duplicate using a modifiedversion of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN 50) checklist, a validated and reliable assessmentapproach widely used in the literature [ 17]. Three of the 10 SIGN criteria for assessment of quality were omitted as theydid not apply to our research question (see Table 1). High quality was defined as a SIGN 50 score equal to + (only 1-2 criteria scored as poorly addressed) or ++ (0 criteria scored as poorly addressed); that is, some or all of the internalvaliditycriteriahavebeenfulfilled.Wheretheyhavenotbeenfulfilled, the conclusions of the study were thought unlikelyto very unlikely to alter results [ 17]. All reviewers were fully trained in the methodology employed. All conflicts wereresolved through discussion and consensus or by consultingthe senior author.

The 116 RCT studies from the full systematic review were categorized into the following types of programs: those that have been previously character- ized/named (56 total): Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction(MBSR), Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM),Autogenic Training (AT), Relaxation Response Training (RRT), Stress Inoculation Training (SIT), Anxiety Manage- ment Training (AMT), and Coping Skills Training (CST); andthosethathavenotbeenpreviouslycharacterized/named(60 total): yoga and similar meditation-based modalities (includingprogramsthatincorporatedyoga-typetechniquesastheprimaryintervention)andrelaxationandothersimilarmind-body skills (including programs that used any relax-ation technique, breathing, guided imagery, self-hypnosis,and/or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) as the primary intervention).

Cog- nitive Behavioral Stress Management is a multimodal pro-gram adapted from a variety of meditation and cognitivebehavioral strategies and has been used for more than 20years by a variety of groups. CBSM has been used tohelp individuals with coping, quality of life, psychologicalwell-being, PTSD, and HIV-related stressors [ 20]. CBSM is generally a ten-week group-based program that combinesrelaxation,imagery,anddeepbreathing,alongwithcognitivebehavior therapy, which is designed to help reduce bodilytension,intrusivestressfulthoughts,andnegativemoodsandimproveinterpersonalcommunicationskills[ 21]. 2.6.3. Autogenic Training (AT). Autogenic Training was developed by the German psychiatrist Johannes Schultz in1932. The goal of AT is to achieve deep relaxation andreduce stress by teaching the body to respond to verbalcommands \"telling\" it to relax and control breathing, bloodpressure, heartbeat, and body temperature [ 22]. It includes standardized self-suggestion exercises to make the body feelwarm,heavy ,andrelaxed[ 23-26].Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 Table1:ModifiedSIGN50checklistforRCTstudydesign[ 17].

Relaxation Response Training (RRT). Relaxation Response Training is a stress-management approach first p u b l i s h e di n1 9 7 4b yt h ec a r d i o l o g i s tB e n s o ne ta l .[ 27]. Bensonfoundthatmeditationwasrelatedtogeneralreversal of the sympathetic activation that produces the \"stress response\" (i.e., decreased oxygen consumption, carbondioxideproduction,respiratoryrate,andminuteventilation)[28].RRTwasoriginallybasedontranscendentalmeditation but differentiated into its own technique using the following four elements to elicit the relaxation response: (1) a mental device (e.g., a sound, word, or phrase repeated silently oraudibly to free one's self from logical, externally oriented thought); (2) a passive attitude (e.g., not worrying about how well one is performing the technique); (3) a decreased6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine muscle tonus (e.g., comfortable, relaxed posture); and (4) a quiet environment with minimal environmental stimuli(e.g.,aplaceofworship)[ 29]. 2.6.5. Yoga + Similar Meditation-Based Skills. This miscel- laneous category included studies that were not \"namedprograms\" and did not fit into any of the previously charac-terized categories and so were compiled together as a single,distinct category. These interventions met the inclusioncriteriaasprogramsthatincorporatedatleastoneyoga-basedor meditation-based element as primary intervention. SeeTable 3(b) for a more complete description of each of these programs. 2.6.6. Relaxation + Similar Mind-Body Skills. Another mis- cellaneous category also included studies of programs that did not fit into any of the previously named categories. Theseincorporatedatleastonerelaxationtechnique(suchas progressive muscle relaxation) combined with other modal- ities such as breathing, guided imagery, and/or Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). While all of these studies had in common that they integrated at least one relaxationtechnique, for ease of discussion, the authors have grouped them into three subcategories: those that were based on a CBT model, those that were characterized as \"Stress- Management Training Programs,\" and those that combined relaxation with either guided imagery or breathing tech- niques. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a well-established and effective psychotherapy approach for conditions suchas anxiety and depression [ 62,63], which assist individ- uals to recognize distorted thoughts, devise strategies to reframe them, and change resultant reactions and behaviors (http://www.nacbt.org/ ). An example of a CBT program that incorporates a relaxation component includes sessionson understanding the nature of stress and stress reac- tions, breathing and/or relaxation techniques, and cognitive Programs problem-solving, assertive- nesstraining,andcopingskillswithvariousrelaxationtech-niques,suchasbreathingandProgressiveMuscleRelaxation (PMR).Inthisreview,aprogramwastaggedas\"SMTP\"only iftheinterventionwasdescribedusingthisterm. Guided imagery (GI) is a relaxation technique that focuses on and directs the imagination to produce thera- peuticchange( http://www.healthjourneys.com/ )a ndca nbe administered by a trained practitioner leading an individualor group session or delivered as a recording. GI frequently includes suggestions for breathing and relaxation, followed by a purposeful directing of the imaginal mind to recreatea relaxing scene with sensory recruitment to enhance a multisensoryexperience.See Table 3(b)foramorecomplete descriptionoftheseprograms.2 . 7 .R e s u l t so ft h eH i g h - Q u a l i t yS t u d i e sI n c l u d e d .

The third study used three hours of GI with breathing andrelaxation exercises in 161 breast cancer patients undergoingradiotherapy; while tension scores on the POMS lessenedsignificantly, the Leeds anxiety differences were nonsignifi-cant [59]. The fourth study that used relaxation, breathing, anddesensitizationtechniquesinhighlyanxiouspsychologystudents produced statistically significant reductions in test-takinganxiety[ 61]. 2.8. Resource Requirements of Named Multimodal Programs. In this section, the authors provide a subjective assessmentof the resource requirements for these programs, based onthe descriptive data collected: information describing theamount of time required for individual and practitioneror trainer involvement, facility and equipment needed, andestimated cost ranges. Because the unnamed programs wereheterogeneous with regard to time for training and content involved in each session, the authors elected not to report on resource requirements for these. In determining whatresources would potentially be required during the trainingphaseforthenamedprograms(see Figure2(a) ), theauthors considered this as the period of time when a program wasinitially instituted and would require a trainer or instructorto teach self-management skills to participants. Since datawas collected on the \"dose\" of the program training (i.e., theactualnumberofhoursperweek \u00d7numberofweeksinwhich theprogramwasdelivered),theauthorsthencategorizedtheamount of training time needed as minimal (less than 10hoursonaverage)orextensive(greaterthan10hours).Basedon this information, the authors then estimated the amountofpractitionerortrainerinvolvementrequiredtoteachthese skills. Programs like MBSR and CBSM require substan- tiallymorespecializedtrainingofandsustainedpractitioner involvement, compared to interventions like AT and RRTwhichcanbemorequicklylearnedbyparticipants.Usingthe descriptions of the intervention extracted from the data, the authors then codified facility requirements (i.e., an estimateof how much space is needed to learn the techniques), whether any equipment is necessary to learn the skills, and costsassociatedwiththetraining(basedoninternetsearchesof the described programs). The authors present a similar assessment for the self-practice requirements (i.e., once the individual is fully trained and able to practice on his/herown)inFigure2(b) .Comparedtoconventionaltherapies,the resourcerequirementsforbothtrainingandself-practiceare all overall likely minimal. Once fully trained, service mem- bersshouldbeabletopracticetheseskillseasilyinanysetting, with minimal time required, no equipment necessary, andat virtually no additional cost. While the main focus of this reviewwastoreportontheeffectivenessofthesemultimodal programs in impacting emotional stress, the authors haveadditionally provided information about estimated resource requirementsformilitaryleadership and programmanagers in order to guide their decision making about the feasibilityofintegratingsuchprogramsintomilitarysettings.Whether these programs could be implemented \"as is\" or if they would need to be modified or adapted is not an assessmentthe authors have made, as only those in decision-making positionsareabletodefinitivelydecidesuchfeasibilityissues. 3. Discussion The programs described in this report have potential ben- efits for service members and their families. Since they primarily involve self-management skills, they can becomeself-empowering to the individual and can be used in any environment, with minimal time needed. This may be especially helpful to the population of individuals that arelikely to refuse, delay, or feel stigmatized by conventional therapies. They are cost-effective strategies to prevent or manage stressors. Since they are multimodal, they may offergreaterappealthansingle-modalityprograms.Therearevery few to no adverse effects from these self-management skills whenproperlylearnedandpracticed. Although there are reviews in the literature to describe relevant programs that address specific issues (PTSD, resilience)inservicememberpopulations[ 64,65],thiscom- prehensivesystematicreviewgloballyreviewedtheliterature onbiopsychosocialmultimodalprograms,extractedtheones withhighmethodologicalqualityandstatisticallysignificant reductions in stress (and similar keywords), and presentedthese results with estimated resource requirements. Because of this comprehensive approach, promising programs that haveastrongevidencebase,mostofwhichwerenotevaluatedin military populations, were able to be identified. This information is important for learning approaches that could be applied in these populations, especially since there is so20 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine Extensive Chart area Minimal None Time Practitioner involvement Facility requirements Equipment Cost MBSR CBSMAT RRT (a)Extensive Minimal None Time Practitioner involvement Facility requirements Equipment Cost MBSR CBSMAT RRT (b) Figure2:(a)Trainingrequirementsand(b)self-practicerequirements. little research on these topics in military populations. This data could potentially aid military leaders who are lookingfor evidence-based programs to reduce psychological stressand help guide their decision making about implementingtheseprogramsasdescribed,ortailoringtheneedsofservicemembers. A fundamental problem associated with initial efforts to launch effective mind-body programs in practice is the lim-itedevidencebasetoguideprogramchoice.Whileevidence-based approaches may be desirable, such evidence is scarce.Evenifevidenceisavailable,thebasicstepsofprogramplan-ningmayleadconscientiousplanners toprogramsthathavenot been evaluated for their effectiveness. With this paper,the authors hope to stimulate thinking about translatingthis best evidence synthesis into practice, in order to makeheadway into the prevention and treatment of stress-relatedillness. The message to service members and their familymemberswhoarestrugglingwithstress-relatedconditionsisthat they can change the way their body and mind react tostress by changing their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.To the leadership, that is, understandably wary of makingdecisionswithouttheproperevidentiarysupport,theauthors offer the results of this comprehensive systematic review, demonstrating some promising directions, preliminary evi-dence of effectiveness for stress-related outcomes across all populations, and basic characterizations and descriptions ofsomeoftheself-care,skillstrainingprograms.Thegoalsweretodemystifythemandtoillustratethatmanyoftheminvolveminimalcostandtrainingtime.

Limitations of the Review. The authors of this compre- hensive systematic review were only interested in assessingandreportingonthestress-relatedoutcomesreportedinthearticles; whether they were primary or secondary outcomeswas irrelevant to the review. Because of this, the authorsd i dn o tp a i n tt h ew h o l ep i c t u r eo fe a c hs t u d yc a p t u r e dand may have missed important elements of the originalauthors' intent. It was chosen to capture only those studiesthat reported on stress using the following terms: stress, anxiety,posttraumatic stress disorder ,coping,resilience,har- diness,burnout,distress,o rrelaxation . The authors derived these terms by assessing the literature and consulting withsubject matter experts. The authors acknowledge that thisis most likely not a comprehensive and exhaustive list ofall emotional stress-related terms, and the search may havemissed pertinent studies that would have fit the inclusioncriteriausingothersimilarlyrelatedtermsforstress. Another limitation is that this review only included multimodal programs. The authors felt that these programswould include the dimensions of the BPS model and wouldhave broader appeal by not focusing all efforts on one technique (e.g., yoga).

Conclusion The objective of this paper was to provide a descriptive overviewandquantitativesynthesisofinformationonmulti-modalprogramsthatmightbeusedfortheself-managementof emotional stress in our military communities and toconsider thisbody ofresearch as a guide tonext steps in theresearch on implementation in military populations. MBSR,CBSM, AT, RRT, yoga plus similar meditation-based skills,andrelaxationpracticesarethetypesofapproachesemergingin the literature as the most promising for their benefitsand ease of implementation in different settings. Imple-menting these identified training programs into militarysettings appears highly feasible, considering that resourcerequirementsareminimal.

The increase of psychosomatic disorders due to cultural changes requires enhanced therapeutic models. This study investigated a salutogenetic treatment concept for inpatient psychosomatic treatment, based on data from more than 11000 patients of a psychosomatic clinic in Germany. The clinic aims at supporting patients' health improvement by fostering besustainedasdeterminedina1-yearfollow-upsurvey.Patientswithalowerconcordancewiththevaluesoftheclinicshowedless i n c e1 9 48 ,th eW o r l dH e a l thO r g a n i z a t i o nd e fi n e sh e a l tha s \" as t a t eo fc o m p l e t ep h y s i c a l ,m e n t a l ,a n ds o c i a lw e l l - b e i n g a n dn o tm e r e l yt h ea b s e n c eo fd i s e a s eo ri n fi r m i t y \"[ 1]. This definition suggests a dichotomous categorization into statesofabsolutehealthandnothealthordisease,whichcannotbe adequately addressed by healthcaresystems andinsurances. Our medical system is set up for the treatment of specificdiseases, characterized by the presentation of symptoms or reports, which can be interpreted as an aberration of a physiological equilibrium or norm and which can beattributed to certain internal or external impairments [ 2]. Th ed i a g n o s i so fd i s e a s e si st h u ss t r o n g l yi n fl u e n c e db y social, temporal, and local factors. This becomes obviouswhen looking at internationally used diagnostic tools suchas the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). For example, hysteria, a once-common medical diagnosis [ 3], is no longer recognized as individual illness and not partof the current version of the International Classification ofDiseases (ICD-10) [ 4] .I nE u r o p e ,a nI n d i a nY o g ii nh i s advanced,enduringstateofmeditation,wouldbediagnosedwith catatonic schizophrenia according to the ICD-10 F20.2[4].Anincreasinglydiagnosedgroupofsymptomsknownas \"burnout\"syndromeisnotrecognizedasdiseaseintheICD- 10. These examples illustrate that the definition of disease is dependentonsocialconditionsandnormsandthus,atoolof healthcarepolicy. Over the last century, a major shift in the distribution of disease types has occurred. While in the last century thehealth system had to cope predominantly with infectiousdiseases [ 5], today psychosomatic diseases are increasing2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine the observation that some peopleseemresistanttostressfulexperiences[ 7],researchersinves- tigated health promoting behaviors and found them criticalforhealthimprovementandmaintenance[ 8,9].Thesehealth supporting behaviors include the promotion of mindfulness [10], spirituality [ 11], social support [ 12-14], and a sense of coherence(SOC)[ 15]. The SOC concept was introduced by Antonovsky and encompasses comprehensibility, manageability, and mean-ingfulness [ 7,16]. Meaningfulness refers to the belief that one'slifeoratleastsomeaspectsoflifeareinteresting,haveameaning, are worth spending energy on, and are consideredas an enjoyable challenge. Comprehensibility is the feelingthat things in life happen in an organized and predictableway.Manageabilityisthebeliefthatlifeeventsarewithinone'scontrol[17].IndividualswithagreaterSOCalsotendtomake healthierlifestylechoicesandhaveahigherintakeoffruitandvegetables,greaterphysicalactivity,anddecreasedlikelihoodofsmoking[ 18]. Schumacher et al. [ 19] of CoherenceScaleonhealthyGermans,demonstratingsignifi-cant correlations between comprehensibility, manageability,and meaningfulness and proposed a global factor. TherewerealsosignificantcorrelationsbetweenSOCandage(age-correlated decline of SOC scores), sex (lower SOC scores bywomen),andpsychological/physiologicalwell-being(higherSOCwasrelatedtolesssomatoformsymptoms). H\u00a8ofer and Straus [22]showedintheirstudieshighinversecorrelationsbetween SOCandpsychosomaticsymptoms,underliningthepositivee ff e c to fS O Co nh e a l t h .T s e l e b i se ta l .[ 23]r e p o r t e das i g - nificant inverse correlation between SOC and both burnoutand depression. Further research confirmed the relatednessof higher SOC with less psychosomatic and physiologicalsymptoms [ 24-27]. Finally, a review study analyzing 458 scientific publications and 13 doctoral theses on this topicreported a strong correlation between SOC and perceivedhealth,especiallymentalhealth[ 28]. Antonovsky [ 16] views meaningfulness as the essential motivational component of SOC, having the greatest influ-ence on health. Without the experience of meaningfulness,theoverallfeelingofcoherenceisdiminished,despiteapossi-blehighintensityoftheothertwocomponents.Intheirrecentstudywith232participants,Parkeretal.[ 29]confirmedtha t meaningfulness is more important than comprehensibilityand manageability. Another important factor for health issocialsupport,whichispositivelyrelatedtoSOC[ 14]. Another extended health model is the biopsychosocial model(BPS)proposedbyEngel.TheBPSintegratesbiologi-calinformationfromthepatient'sbody,psychologicalaspectssuch as negative thinking or lack rc o n s t ru ctth a tc a nbei n c l u d e di n t oth ec o n c e p t of salutogenesis is mindfulness. The most common psy-chological definitions of mindfulness mainly describe the constructbyemphasizingtwopoints:firstly,fullattentionto thepresentmomentonimmediateexperience.Secondly,thisawareness should be experienced in a state of equanimity,whateversensationarises,withoutjudgment,elaborationandreaction [ 37,38]. This state of awareness can be trained through mindfulness exercises, and if applied in everyday life, a trait can develop. Furthermore, mindfulness trainingcanincreasespirituality[ 39,40]andgeneralSOC[ 41].Based on prior research, mindfulness can be regarded as a healthsupporter[ 42-44].W ewouldliketobroadenthepurposeof mindfulnessexercises(inthesenseofoldreligioustraditions,see,e.g.,[41])totheeffectthattheycanalsoopenupaccessto personalspiritualityandfindingapersonalsenseofmeaning. In the present study we intend to show the treatment effectsofapsychosomaticclinicwhichaimstoimplementtheabove-mentioned salutogenetic factors. We will investigatehowthesefactorsandvaluesarerealizedinthetreatment,andanalyze the treatmentsuccess. ConceptofPsychosomaticTreatmentinHeiligenfeld (HF) is a psychosomatic clinic which was establishedo nt h et h e o r yo fS O C .Th eo v e r a l lc o n c e p to ft h ec l i n i ci sdesigned to support salutogenetic factors. HF is embeddingthese values in the organization of the clinic and in thepsychotherapeutic community. In addition to the essential component of meaningfulness in the SOC, HF extends this componentwithatranscendentmeaningoflife.HFconsidersitself not merely as a hospital but rather as a place of healthand humanity that aims at substantiating basic humanisticvalues and ways of finding meaning, as covered below. Thecentral idea is to promote holistic intellectual development,a self-determined and autonomous life, the meaningfulnessofpersonalandentrepreneurialactioninaplaceofrecovery,and humanity. These values are represented and lived bythe team of therapists and all employees (including thekitchen and cleaning staff). Awareness and self-realization,mindfulness,personalresponsibilityandself-determination,h u m a n i t ya n dh u m a nd i g n i t y ,c a r ea n dl o v ef o rt h ef e l l o whuman being, authenticity, and sincerity qualify every staffmemberandareintendedtobelivedwhenworkingtogetherwith the patients. Every employee sees himself/herself aspart of the whole process of therapy, and their behavior isthought to inspire and enable patients to start the search forself-realization and meaning. Hence, HF operates under theguideline of Jung [ 45]: \"you cannot tear the human being into two pieces, to delegate one part to the physician and one part to the theologian.\" The pursuit of finding meaning in life which can lead to an increase in SOC and spiritualityis a consistent part of a patients' daily routine\u2014a routine thataccompanieshimorheruntiltheendofhospitalization. Mindfulness plays a significant role, not only as therapeuticintervention but also as a central method to increase (self-)Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 awareness, to connect with one's spirituality and to find meaning. The medical and psychotherapeutic treatment isbasedonaholisticconceptandcombinedwithbody-relatedpsychotherapy,expressiveartstherapy,reality-orientedsocialtherapy,relaxationtechniques,andmeditation. A positive correlation between spirituality, for example, feeling centered, and therapeutic success in HF has been reported previously [ 46]. A study by Hawks et al. found that imagery, meditation, and group support activities maypositivelyaffectthesenseofmeaningandpurposeinlife,self-awareness and connectedness with self, others, and a largerreality[47]. Therapeutic Community .Ba s i c al l y ,i n t e rw o v e nw i thth ec o n - cept is the idea of the therapeutic community providingsocial support and granting an important healing frame forthepatients.Thetherapeuticcommunityallowsthepracticalexperience of meaningfulness and general SOC in daily lifeandalsoconstitutesacrucialelementforenvironment-basedsocial-therapeuticwork. Thisfieldcomprisesmainlythefollowing: (i) general assembly (\"Plenum\") on parting and for welcomingnewpatients(alsoopentovisitors); (ii) assemblyofallpatients; (iii) therapeutic group for support and for improvement ofcommunicativeskills; (iv) sharingofcommunitytasksandresponsibilities; (v) psychoeducation in fields like health and disease, treatmentconcepts,andhealthynutrition; (vi) recreationoffersfortheweekend; (vii) involvement of patients in the improvement and complaintmanagement. Short Description of Interventions .Th et r e a t m e n tp r o g r a m is tailored individually for every single patient. It connectsgrouptherapy,individualone-on-onetherapy,psychoeduca-tion, body oriented and creative treatments, movement andmusic therapy, relaxation techniques and meditation, andmedicaltreatment.Therapeuticmethodsofferedincludedif-ferentformsofmeditation,Holotropicbreathwork,concen-trative Breathwork and body therapy, voice therapy, rhythmtherapy, dance therapy, water therapy, expressive painting, andtherapeutickaratetherapywithanimalsupport. The mental-spiritual aspect of human existence is addressed through various optional offers.

Goals of Our Study . Our study is based on the investigation of how salutogenetic factors and values are realized in HF.Althoughtheassessmentschemedidnotmeasuretheabove-mentioned salutogenetic factors through specific question-naires,severalsalutogeneticcomponentscouldbetestedwith asetofquestionnairesofferedbytheclinic. We will assess treatment effects, also dependent on the respective diagnosis or treatment path, and also analyze theeffect of personal concordance on treatment success andsustainability of effects. Finally we will compare treatmenteffectswithotherclinics. 2. Methods 2.1.Design. PatientsoftheHFclinicswereaskedtocomplete several self-assessment questionnaires and surveys at their arrival (before treatment) and at their release (after treat- ment)withinafewdays.Thereceptionsurveyalsoaskedfor the sociodemographicsituation.For a followup, some of thepatientsreceivedaselectionofquestionnairesagainoneyear aftertreatment(see Figure1). Patients entering the clinic were initially diagnosed by a medical doctor as well as by a psychologist in accordancewithICD-10.Basedonthemainpsychologicaldiagnosis,they were assigned to one of 13 treatment paths (for details see below). A treatment path is defined by the compilation of therapeuticinterventionsandgroupsdependingonthemaindiagnosisforamorespecifictreatmentofvariousdiagnoses. 2.2.Materials 2.2.1. Questionnaires.

It is part of a larger inventory set, the FIG-50 (Questionnaire Integral Health \"Fragebogen IntegraleGesundheit 50\"). In the TPV, 10 questions measure anindividual's spirituality in a scale of 4 options.

Health-Related Total Change (GV) .Th eG V( f r o mG e r m a n \"Gesamtver \u00a8anderung\") assesses global changes in mental and physical states.

Results and Discussion 3.1. Patient Population. Our study focuses on the inpatients in three clinics of the Heiligenfeld group which are alllocated in Bad Kissingen/Germany. Two clinical categoriescan be distinguished: one clinic for patients with a public health insurance (Fachklinik, 37.0%), and two clinics for patientswithprivatehealthinsurance(Parkklinik,52.5%andRosengartenklinik,10.5%). After exclusion of patients who stayed less than 14 days in the hospital data from over 11,200 patients treated during1/2007 to 1/2013 were available. This set consisted of 69%female and 31% male patients, aged between 17 and 74years (average age 45.9\u00b19.9 years) who stayed in the h o s p i t a lf o r54 . 7(\u00b119.5) days on average. 57% of them had a highereducationallevel(universityorsimilar).Patientswithvarious psychosomatic disorders were included.

The most frequent treatment paths were depression (86.3%,=9468 Borderline (7.7%,=799) ,a n da d d i c t i o n( 6 . 9 % ,=680) (seeFigure2). 3.2.RealizationofV aluesinClinicalEn vironment(Q1).

The best votes were given for the clinic being a place of humanity, community,and healing. Almost all patients partly or fully shared theopinion that basic values were realized, people are regardedin their dignity, and compassion is lived. As a result it canbe stated that these values were perceived to be present toalmost all patients during their stay. Unfortunately, due tothe high agreement this questionnaire shows ceiling effects.Further statistics therefore suffers from distributional prob-lems. Another weakness of the whole survey including thisquestionnaire was that it was personalized. This Somatoform pain dis.

In HF, a follow-up survey has been sent out to some patients one year after treatment. Figure7 illustrates the long-term changes related to the health change questionnaires and compares the immediate treatment effects at discharge time with the ratings one year after treatment. In those patients who completed thefollow-up assessment, changes relative to the pretreatment phase were slightly but not significantly reduced compared to the immediate evaluation at the end of the treatment.Table 4presentsthesustainabilityoftheeffectsizeoftheISR symptom reduction. Here, patients with depression, anxiety disorders, and PTSD retain their symptom reduction to 82,88, and 92%. The high numbers after release in patients sufferingfromaddictionandobsessive-compulsivedisorders even increase after one year by 16 and 9%. The largestreduction of symptom improvement (down to about 50%)showed patients suffering from psychosis, suicidal thoughts, andself-harming.Thosepatientsmightadditionallyneedan individualpsychotherapyratherthangrouptherapyonly.At average 79% of symptom, improvement is maintained after oneyear.Patientstreatedinthepathsofpsychoticdisorders,suicidal thoughts, and self-harming are those with the mostsevere symptoms and ICD10 diagnoses. This is especially true in those forms of PTSD caused in early childhood and requireslong-termpsychotherapy.Aninpatienthospitalstayof ten weeks, however, may only reduce acute symptoms associatedwithpsychoticexperiences,suicidalattempts,and self-harmingbehavior.Patientswithtraumaticexperiencesinearly childhood are often unable to maintain interpersonal relationships.Thosepatientsprofitfromthecommunityand group therapy during the hospital stay but are unable tomaintainthesocialrelationsintheirdailylife.Inouropinion only a consistent (parental-like) subsequent 1046patientsareaveragedineachbar. the early human needs for security and confidence could improve such patients' health state. However, to date nocatamnesticdataacross5or10yearsareavailable. The connection between symptom reduction and the improvement in health-related factors of a wider concept ofhealth as assessed by the VEV-K and GV was exemplarilystudied in patients who participated in the depression path.Changes on the depression scale of the ISR were correlatedwith the factors of the VEV-K and GV using Spearman'srank correlations.

Conclusion Startingwiththeassumptionthatasustainableformofheal-inginapsychosomaticinpatientclinicrequiresmorethanthefocus on symptom reduction, we presented one approach ofa psychosomatic hospital in Germany that follows a holisticand specific salutogenetic approach. It should be noted that12 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine Table 6: Psychosomatic treatment effects in comparison between HF and 14 other German clinics. A paired t-test was similar salu- togenetic ideas to a certain extend. The approach of theHF clinics was formulated in a guideline that includes aset of values intended to generate salutogenetic behaviorand experience within the whole clinic environment. Also,patients are supported in living a health-oriented and self-directedlife. In the first part of this study our aim is to demonstrate whetherandhowseveralaspectsofhumanvaluesunderlyingthe holistic concept have been implemented in a clinicalsetting for inpatient treatment of psychosomatic disorders.Therefore, the clinic has developed a self-assessment ques-tionnaire. The results suggest that salutogenetic values havenot only been formulated in the clinical guidelines but werealsosuccessfullytransferredtothetherapeuticenvironment.This self-assessment shows that 90 to 99% of the patientsagreed to the statement that those values were realized andpresent in the clinic. Unfortunately, the high concordancewith the questionnaire statements moved the distributiontowards the upper end of the scale and created a saturationeffect with a non-Gaussian distribution. Therefore, we did not perform correlational analysis with treatment effects. Nevertheless, the high number of patients allowed a linearmodel to be fitted to investigate the connection betweenpatients' perception of the clinical value codex and thetherapeuticeffect.Thestrongdependencybetweensymptomreduction and value ratings and the total score of healthchanges (VEV-K) suggests that it is important for a hospitalto offer a supportive environment that allows patients toget involved with salutogenetic factors. Those factors wereintended to be realized not only within therapeutic sessionsb u ta l s oi no t h e ra r e a so ft h ep a t i e n t s 'd a i l yl i f ei nt h ec l i n i c .The statements about concordance with the ethical valuesmay be biased, due to patients wanting to express theirgratitude towards the clinic. We took a closer look at thosepatients with low concordance ratings, and found that theyfit a certain profile. They were less content and offered ahigher load in symptoms, however, not in depression. From56 \"disagreeing\" patients, 89% had sleeping problems, 88% memory problems, 70% had problems with their sexuality,36%weresuicidal,and32%sufferedfromPTSDsymptoms. Data acquisition for measuring the therapeutic outcome was performed with self-assessment inventories as well. Weare aware of the short comings of self-assessment ques-tionnaires but want to point out that, particularly in thecontextofpsychosomaticdisorders,perceivedimprovementsin health are very valuable to the individual, regardless ofthe explanations for these changes such as possible placeboeffects or insufficiencies of the questionnaires. It should benoted that an F diagnosis assessed by a therapist also isbased on patients' reports. Therefore, it is not a surprisethat, according to the IQP, the self-assessments are roughlyin line with the diagnoses given by the therapist. For somemeasures, especially those asking for mental states andsubjective experiences, one has to rely on the self-ratingsfor now. Nonetheless, the analyses would benefit from aninclusionofmorepopularquestionnairessuchastheSCL90.However, theclinicintendstousequestionnaireswithfeweritems and prefers license-free inventories. Further, it might beinterestingtoadditionallymeasuretheHFvaluesinother clinics to find out whether the ceiling effects occur there aswellandforabetterunderstandingandpossibleconfirmationoftheimportanceofthesefactors. We have introduced salutogenesis as a complex con- struct with many different aspects. Salutogenetic factors areinherent in concepts such as mindfulness, spirituality, socials u p p o r t ,a n dt h es e n s eo fc o h e r e n c et h a tc o m p r i s e sc o m -prehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. Aspectsof those concepts were found to a certain extend in theHF guidelines and/or the treatment concept of the clinic.However, despite not all of the salutogenetic factors wereexplicitly assessed in the questionnaires, the questionnairesVEV-K, GV, and the TPV used in HF during several yearscoverthoseaspectstoacertainextent. The sustainability of improvements in a 1-year follow- up was about 80% and can be regarded as high. However,Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 13 these data are only available for a small proportion of total patients. Comparing the posttreatment data of the follow-up group with the posttreatment group of all patients, thosepatients who returned the follow-up questionnaire alreadyshowed higher treatment effect sizes at release time. There-fore,itisquestionablewhetherpatientswithlowertreatment success\u2014often those with more severe symptoms\u2014would also display such high sustainability. The fact that treatmentpathsinvolvingpatientswithmoreseveresymptomsshowedafarlowersustainabilityarguesagainstit. In direct comparison between HF and the other clinics it should be noted that while the distribution in age andgenderwascomparable,thenumberofpatientswithaprivatehealth insurance was 70% in HF but less than 10% in otherclinics.Thisalsolinkstoasignificantlyhighereducationlevelin HF compared to other clinics. Furthermore, the averagetreatment duration was about 14 days longer in HF than inotherclinics(57daysversus43days).Sincebothparameters,educationallevelandtreatmenttime,arepositivelyrelatedtohealth improvement, the superiority of the HF concept overthe concept of other clinics cannot be definitely stated andwould require further analysis. Considering all results, thedatasuggestthattheperceivedsuccessfulimplementationofa guideline that is based on the idea of salutogenesis affectspatients' health state in a positive way. However, as otherclinicsalsofollowmoreorlesssalutogeneticapproaches,thecomparisonbetweenclinicsisnotverymeaningful. Successful implementation of a salutogenetic concept requires, through the entire hospital staff, the promotion ofanautonomousdevelopmentanddialogofvalues,including meaningfulness and spirituality. Patients might then profit fromtheinnerattitudetheyperceivefromeverybodywithintheclinicalenvironment,possiblyenablingthemtointegratethis experience as an ideal for their own coping strategiesleading to an increase of their SOC. An interesting futurestudy could be to explore the effect of the inner attitude ofthetherapistonthetreatmentsuccessoftheirpatients. The highest symptom reductions were achieved in depression, which was also most commonly diagnosed andalso was the most frequent treatment path. A correlationanalysis of patients with depression revealed medium butsustainedcorrelationsbetweentheimprovementsincoping-related aspects and depressive symptoms. This supports theidea that proactive behavior (manageability in the SOCmodel)isakeyfeatureforhealth. The TPV measures different facets of religiosity related to a transpersonal trust. The pre-post-treatment compari-son only shows medium effect sizes. Probably, the gain intranspersonal trust seems not to be as strongly promoted int h ec l i n i ca so t h e rf o r m so fs p i r i t u a l i t y .Th i sa s s u m p t i o nc a nbe derived from the observation that 90% of the patientsa g r e et h a tH Fi sp a r t l yo rf u l l yap l a c eo fs p i r i t u a lg r o w t h .To address this issue, additional tests investigating meaningand spirituality, for example, LEBE by Schnell and Becker [64], would be useful. In contrast, the VEV.Change Resting f a c t o rt h a tc a nb er e g a r d e da sas c a l er e l a t e dt ot h ec o n -cept of mindfulness offered a high relationship with healthimprovement. Therefore, distinguishing between religiousand spiritual coping aspects seems to be important. It maybe useful to further analyze the effects of mindfulness in psychosomatic treatment with respect to the various ICD10diagnoses. Unfortunately, the measurement of the aspectof mindfulness was not explicitly determined. It could besuggested to use the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI)or another accepted mindfulness inventory at least with a groupofpatients. With these findings we would like to propose the idea that a salutogenetic treatment requires a value driven socialenvironment that provides a learning atmosphere for theacquisitionofhealthsupportingskills,behavior,andattitudesand finally leads the body and mind into a state of self-recoveryandtothedevelopmentofskillsforfurther\"healthdevelopment\" in order to continue the recovery process indaily life. We therefore propose that salutogenesis should beinitiated in the clinical environment and in the therapeuticprocesses, with a continuation beyond the clinical stay. Thisgoalcanonlybemetwhenpatientslearnintheclinicsettinghowtoliveahealthpromoting,self-directed,andfulfilledlife.

Introduction In Germany, teachers leave their jobs on average ten years earlierthanthelegalretirementageof65[ 1].Themainreason for their premature retirement is attributed to stress-related psychosomaticdysfunctions[ 2,3].Inadditiontodepression, stress, or adaptation problems, burnout or exhaustion arealsocitedasspecificwork-relatedrisksofillnessforteachers[4-7]. The high occurrence of these symptoms in teachers shows that their work can be considered as rather stressfulaswellasimpairingfortheirwellbeing,makingthemahighrisk group for the development of burnout. These issueshave also been examined in empirical studies. Sickness- related early retirement [ 1,4,8,9] and the severity and extent of occupational stress in teachers [ 10-12]h a v eb e e n documentedsufficientlyinmultiplestudies. Thereportedimbalancebetweensocialdemandsaccom- panied by stress and resilience can be seen as a possiblestartingpointfortheirdevelopingburnout[ 13].Theprogres- sion of burnout is described as a slow process, coupled withincreasingemotionalfatigue,depersonalization,andreducedpersonal productivity [ 6,14]. The affected individuals are assumedtolackflexiblecopingstrategies,personalresources,andadequatesocialsupport[ 5].Asaconsequencetheactual2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine illness is related to high subjective psychological strain on partoftheindividualsaccompaniedbyprematureretirement.It should also be kept in mind that mental disorders, espe-ciallydepressionandburnout,areassociatedwithenormouseconomiccosts[ 15]. Therefore, one important aim is the prevention of burn- out based on effective measures and therapies. In general, empirical support regarding the efficacy and effectiveness ofsuch prevention measures is scarce. While Awa et al. [ 16], for example, showed that a wide spectrum of approachesfor burnout prophylaxis is available, they regretfully refrainfrommakingstatementsregardingtheefficacyofthedifferentapproaches reported. Van Straten et al. [ 17]s h o w e dfi r s t empiricalresultsofaninnovativestrategytopreventburnoutusing an internet-based treatment manual conceptualizedas a self-help intervention to work-related stress.Anotherpossiblestrategytopreventburnoutcouldbebreaththerapy.Breaththerapyhasbeenviewedcapableofaffectingthe psychosomatic structure and causing positive psychoso-maticchanges[ 18]. The intention of this study is to evaluate the effects of a specific breath therapy, the AFA breathing therapy, as anapproach for primary prevention of burnout in teachers.AFA breathing therapy has a focus on the perception ofindividual breathing, which is taken as a starting pointfor prophylaxis. This approach differs fundamentally frommedical, symptom-related breathing therapy. Due to theholistic approach AFA breathing therapy is regarded ashelpful for different general problems, such as breathingissues, posture problems, coping with stress, preservation of productivity (also as a self-help measure), for strengthening self-competence, and for working on breathing and voicein strongly communicative professions (such as singers andmusicians). In general, the treatment aims at promotinghealth,wellbeing,andresistanceagainststressorburnoutrisk[19]. To our knowledge research to breath therapy is rare. Therefore, in our study a combination of group and indi-vidual therapeutic intervention of AFA breathing therapywas performed to identify possible influences of differentsettings.Theobjectiveofthisstudywastoevaluateshort-andmedium-term effects of breath therapy on the work-relatedandexperiencepatternsofteachers. 2. Materials and Methods This study was designed as a longitudinal controlled inter-vention design with four points of measurements: beforeassessment(T1),afterintervention(T2),threemonths(followup 1) (T3) after intervention, and six months (follow up 2)afterintervention(T4). 2.1.

After signing an informed consent form, thepotential candidates could register using an alias. A totalof 319 teachers showed initial interest and registered online. Thereof,27refusedtotakepartintheinterventiongroupbutwerewillingtocompletequestionnaires(self-selectedcontrolgroup) before assessment (T1), after intervention (T2), andat three months (follow up 1) (T3) after intervention. Theremaining209teacherswererandomlyallocatedtodifferent intervention groups: breath therapy in individual and group setting (=64) and breath therapy in group setting only (=141 ), respectively. Four teachers had to be excluded from analysis because of missing preassessment data. Asan inclusion criterion, only subjects not suffering from adiagnosablementalillnesswereallowedtoparticipateinthestudy.ThiswasdeterminedbyusingtheVDS90(BehaviouralDiagnostic and Therapy Planning Manual) [ 20], a screening instrumentdesignedfordetectingmentaldisordersinaccor-dance with ICD-10. Subjects with a total VDS 90 score of1.0wereincludedinthestudy.64oftheregisteredteachers were assigned to a combination of group and individualtherapeutic intervention using AFA breathing therapy. Theintervention lasted a total of 11 weeks. This included weeklygroup therapy for eight weeks, followed by three weeks ofindividual breathing sessions once a week.

AFA breath therapy was developed in 1958 with participation of different health care professionals(medical and nonmedical professionals) in Germany.

Measurements. The assessments were performed using \"psychopathologyscreening\"(VDS90)andaself-assessmentquestionnaire on \"work-related behaviour and experiencepatterns\"(AVEM).

This self- assessmenttool,designedforoutpatientpsychotherapy,con-sists of 90 items. Based on a factor-analytic study, 26 dif-ferent mental health problems are assessed, which reflectsthe patient's symptoms comprehensively and is essential fora syndrome diagnosis of mental problems, showing highinternal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.93) for the total VDS90score.Thisinstrumentwasusedforratingtheseverity of mental and psychosomatic issues of patients [ 20]. The VDS90 score ranged between 0 (no mental health problem)and3(differentmentalhealthproblems). The questionnaire \"work-related behaviour and experi- ence patterns\" (AVEM) is used for a quantitative evaluationo ft h es u b j e c t i v ep e r c e p t i o no fw o r k - r e l a t e db e h a v i o u ra n dexperience patterns and is a well-known questionnaire ininternational publications [ 22-25]. It includes a total of66 items which were summarized to 11 dimensions/scales based on factor analysis. See Table 2for description of the 11 scales/dimensions. The dimensions show very goodto good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.78-0.87).According to burnout research, professions with increasedpsychological stress are often characterised by an enor-mousimpairmentofsubjectivewellbeingandspecificwork-related performance [ 6,22,26]. AVEM does not only assess professional commitment but also resistance to stress andwork-accompanying emotions [ 21]. This questionnaire was specifically constructed for research evaluating issues con-cerning the psychology of work and health. In contrast to MaslachburnoutinventorydevelopedbyMaslachetal.[ 27], AVEM evaluates a broad range of occupational demandsandaimedtosupportindividualresources.Furthermore,theAVEMseemsimportantforinterventionrelateddiagnosticofoccupationalcopingbehaviour. 2.4.

Thefollowingresultswereevaluatedregardingthework- relatedandexperiencepatternsofteachers.

In summary, the subjects' mean scores showed stability orsignificantimprovementonavarietyofAVEMscalesfrompreassessmentoneuptothefollowuponeaftersixmonths.Inparticularthefollowup,takensixmonthsaftertheendoftheintervention,maybeinterpretedthatAFAbreathingtherapycouldpositivelyaffectwork-relatedexperienceandbehaviourpatterns on an intermediate range. In particular the scales\"emotional distancing\" and \"balance and mental stability\"showedsignificantimprovements.Resistancetooccupationaldemands could have an essential impact to avoid a burnout[28]. There is a growing body of evidence pertaining to AFA breathing therapy. In a study of teachers and managers inpsychosomaticrehabilitation,Beuteletal.[ 29]reportedpos- itiveresultsforAFAbreathingtherapysimilartothoseofthisstudy. Viewing individual comparisons of the AVEM scales,the greatest differences occurred between the preassessmentone and follow up one, a finding which is confirmed by thisstudy. The effectiveness of AFA breathing therapy in specific patientgroupswasthesubjectoftwofurtherstudies[ 29,30]. However, the findings regarding the measure's effectivenessare not conclusive. In one study, the positive effects onpatients with chronic back problems are based merely ontherapist statements [ 31] .I nt h es e c o n ds t u d y ,n os t a t i s t i - cally significant changes could be found for patients withbronchial asthma following breathing therapy, which couldbe attributed to the small sample size of the study [ 32]. Overall, it has been reported that mind-body therapiesas breath therapy can have a positive effect al. showed in a pilot studythatmind-bodytechniquescouldreducephysiologicaland psychological stress which should reviewed in furtherintervention studies with breath therapy [ 34]. It could be assumed that self-care activities are an important treatment conceptforthepreventionofburnout. Despite the positive results reported here, our study has some limitations. Possible effects of sample attrition, whichcannot be assessed with the available data, should be takeninto account. Furthermore, our study is a small pilot studywith an explorative design. However, to be able to detectstrongeffectswithan80%probability70participantswould havetobeanalysedineachgroup. A replication of this study with a larger sample size (intervention and control samples) could help shed lighton these matters. In addition, in view of the voluntary natureofparticipationinthisstudy,whichrequiredacertain amountofmotivationalreadinessonpartofthesubjects,wecannot generalize the results to all types of teachers or toindividuals with other professions. Moreover, we have notassessed further demographic characteristics of the partic-ipating length and amount of employment should be assessed in further studies and evaluated as covariates. To further study the efficacy and effectiveness ofAFA breathing therapy, it would be, of course, interesting to fi n do u tf o rw h i c hg r o u po ft e a c h e r st h i st r e a t m e n tp r o v e s itself most effective and which factors, like interest and/ormotivation, promote access to the approach. Furthermore,such analysis could help determine important indicatorsw h i c hc o u l db eu s e dt os p r e a dt h em e t h o dm o r ee ff e c t i v e l y .Atthesametimesuchresultscouldimprovetheevaluationofthegeneralizabilityofourresults.Itwouldalsobeinterestingto know if the participants of the study keep up the practiceof AFA breathing therapy after the intervention ending andintegrateitintotheireverydaylives.Theeffectsofthisvariablecould prove itself relevant for the interpretation of follow up effects. In spite of the mentioned limitations, this study could provide first insights into a possible strategy to preventburnout by using AFA breathing therapy. Furthermore, our study provides useful information regarding recruitment, kind of therapy, and effects sizes to plan further large-scalestudiesonthisissue.

Within a qualitative research approach, 19 semi-structured telephone interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative contentanalysis. Within the interviews, the inclusion of the patients' individual resources is described as core competence of GPs. Supporting the patients' disease coping strategies and self-help were seen as important by GPs. However, perceptions as to which resources are considered to be fundamental ranged widely across the participant group. The results confirm the important roleof resource-oriented approaches in general practice. However, a general definition of resource orientation is needed.

Fu rther integration of GPs in health promotion and communal structureswouldbebeneficial. 1. Background Resource orientation focuses on individual resources (=\"innerpotentials\")ofthepatienttomaintainandimprovepersonal health. Thereby, it is mainly characterized by thesalutogenic perspective stressing on factors that supporthuman health and well-being. In addition, it overlaps orshares common elements with other concepts used in thecontext of health promotion, and complementary andalternative medicine such as sense of coherence, resilience, patientempowerment,orself-efficacy. Traditionally, resource orientation has been researched in the psychological and pedagogical context. Increasingly its importance for primary care is recognized, in particular with regard to the management of chronically ill patients[1-3]. In Germany, in 2002, a pilot project explored the salutogenic orientation in primary care which is a part ofresourceorientationanddescribedthreelevelsofsalutogenic orientation[ 4,5].However,tenyearslaterevidenceaboutthe useofresourceorientationingeneralpracticeisstillscarce. Nevertheless, resource-oriented approaches are increas- ingly for general practitioners (GPs). For theevaluation of a patient's individual resources, GPs workwithinanidealsettingtodiscoverandpromotetheresourcesofthepatientbasedontheirlong-lastingrelationshipwiththepatient. GPs do not only have medical knowledge regardingdiseases and therapies but also build a therapeutic rela-tionship with patients over time. This enables GPs to gainknowledgeaboutthepatient'scopingmechanisms,hisorherindividualresourcesandadditionalavailableresourcesinthecommunity settings. GPs can potentially anticipate possiblecausesofpathogenesisfromasomatic,psychosomatic,social,and/or human dimension [ 6]. Furthermore, GPs are able to assess possibilities for individual approaches to resource2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine orientation based on their insights about the individual patient. This is of special importance considering the rapidincrease in the prevalence of chronic diseases and multi-morbidity.Commonlyandcharacteristicallyfortheprimarycare setting there arises a long-standing, close relationshipbetween GPs and their patients. Particularly the continuity of care that is concomitant with this long term relationship is associated with greater satisfaction and better healthoutcomes[ 7]. Community resources, such as social services, self-help groups but also sports clubs, kindergartens, or schools areessentialtofacilitatetheidentificationandtheleverageeffectof individual resources. However, including communityresources in a resource-oriented approach requires a well-established cooperation between doctors and local services[8].Todate,littleisknownabouthowGPsareintegratedinto communitiesandhowthiscouldbeoptimizedwithinfuturehealthcaremodels. The study is concerned with the position of resource orientationandresource-orientedapproachesinGPpractice,using a qualitative research approach and focusing on thetreatment of chronically ill patients in primary care. Theprimaryaimwastogainasolidunderstandingofthemeaningof resource orientation from the GP perspective. A furtheraim was to identify possibilities and specific measures tofacilitateresourceorientationintheprimarycaresetting. 2. Methods Togetarealistic,detailedinsightintotheindividual,personalperceptionofGPsregardingresource-orientedapproaches,aqualitative study design consisting of semi-structured one-to-one interviews was chosen and conducted by telephone[9].Thesemi-structuredinterviewguidewasdevelopedand refinedbyconductingtwopilotinterviews. GPs were recruited via the quality circle \"health promo- tion practices\" that took place from 2002 to 2005 (12 invita-tions) and via a German General Practice E-mail List server(300 invitations). Inclusion criterion was the contact with resource-orientedapproaches.Weconsecutivelyincludedall GPsmeetingtheinclusioncriterionandwithinteresttotake partinthestudy. Individual appointments for the interviews were arranged.AllinterviewswerecarriedoutintheDepartment ofGeneralPracticeandHealthServicesResearch,UniversityHospital of Heidelberg, Germany, and were conducted byFranziska Pr \u00a8ufer. Each interview was recorded digitally and transcribedverbatim.Anonymitywaspreservedduringdata analysis, and participants consented on this understanding.Theinterviewswerebasedonthefollowingquestions: (i) Whatdoesresource-orientationmeantoyou? (ii) To what extent are resource-oriented approaches important? (iii) How can resource-oriented approaches be facilitated inprimarycare?Table1:Sociodemographiccharacteristicsofthestudysample( = 18). Gender Female 2 16 4 Ruralarea 7 Sociodemographicdatawasavailablefor18respondentsonly. The goal of the interviews was explained prior to com- mencement to prevent misunderstanding and to allow time for answering possible questions that participants may havehad. The term \"resource orientation\" as understood by the researcher was not explained in prior to every interview, in order to prevent bias as to the meaning of resourceorientation in the responses. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Heidelberg Medical Faculty(S-154/2011). The interviews tookplace fromMay 2011to August 2011. Each interview lasted between 20 and 30 minutes. The anal- ysis was carried out according to the principles of Mayring's qualitativecontentanalysis[ 10] andwasconductedwith the software Atlas.ti. The text material was coded in a deductive and an inductive way. Working independently, Franziska Pr\u00a8uferandAntjeMikschconductedtheprimarycoding.The codes were clearly wasdiscussedinaniterativeprocessamongFranziskaPr \u00a8ufer, Antje Miksch, and Stefanie Joos. In case of discrepancies, discussion took place until a consensus was found. The quotations cited were translated from German by FranziskaPr\u00a8uferandcross-checkedbyAntjeMiksch. 3. Results Altogether, 19 GPs were recruited for the study. Age ranged from 45 to 67 years (mean 55,7 years). Occupational expe-rience as GP ranged between 1 and 37 years. Eighteen weremedical specialists in general practice; one was a medicalspecialistinphysicalandrehabilitativemedicine( Table 1). Two main categories emerged from this analysis: the meaning(abstractideas)andthefacilitation(concreteideas)ofresourceorientationingeneralpractice. Table system Training Research 3.1. Meaning. The interviews showed a very heterogeneous understanding of resource orientation which will be illus- tratedsubsequently.Althoughthefoundationalunderstand-ing appeared similar, GPs focused on different aspects.For the GPs, resource orientation also meant orientatingthemselvestowardstheirownresources. 3.1.1. Meaning for the GP. During the interviews, resource orientation was described as a core competence of GPs. Forexample, \"because these [resource-oriented approaches] arethebasicsofour[GPs']actions\"(GP10).MostGPsstatedthatthese approaches were partly carried out intuitively. More-over, resource orientation was considered to be an attitudet h a tf o c u s e so nt h ei n n e rp o t e n t i a l so fe v e r yi n d i v i d u a l . Some of the GPs expressed a strong need for a common definitiontofurtherestablishresourceorientationandmakeit comprehensible for everybody. During the interviews,resources were amongst other things defined \"as sourcesof a healthy development\" (GP 16). Resources representedan inner potential that differs quite individually from oneperson to another. In addition, assistance towards self-helpandcopingwithillnesswerealsoconsideredtobeanintegralpartofresourceorientationbytheGPs. \"Thatafterallisouraim,tomakepeoplehealthy. Healthy not in a sense that everything is still4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine working,butthatonecanalsobesatisfiedwithlife and the circumstances within which one is living(...).\"(GP10) In addition, the interviews showed the importance of establishingawarenessregardingresources.AccordingtotheGPs, thisisanecessaryprerequisitetoimplementandfosterresource-orientedapproaches. Furthermore, GPs attach importance to resource ori- entation also with regard to their own resources for pre-serving and promoting their own health. Most of the GPswere satisfied with their own living and working situation.However,someoftheGPsreportedperiodsofexhaustionorburnout. During the interviews, the desire for a good work-lifebalancewasevident.Satisfactoryworkingconditionswereemphasized as a core factor in achieving a healthy work-lifebalance.Anappropriateworkload,thepossibilitytoexchangeideaswithcolleagues,andjobsatisfactionallcontributetothestrengtheningofGPs'resources. \"...t h a tIa mt r y i n gt or e d u c em ye m p l o y m e n t duties to a bearable extent, so that it is not too much for me and I can really have an open earforthepatients.\"(GP02) Inaddition,acceptancebytheGPthatthepatientdeclines the GP's preferred therapy method also contributes to theeffectiveresourceorientationofGPs. ParticipantGPsutilizedleisureactivitiestoreducestress. Music, philosophy, and relaxation methods as well as familyandfriendswerementionedfrequently.Ahealthydiet,phys-ical activity, and weight loss were further factors mentionedinthecontextofmaintainingahealthylifestyle. 3.1.2. Supposed Benefits for Patients. The interviews showed theimportanceofcreatingaheightenedawarenessregardingresources.Forexample, \"(...)i ns u c haw a yt h a tap o i n to fv i e we v o l v e s t h a td o e sn o tf o c u so ni l l n e s s ,b u to nap e r s o nwho is now in this special situation and whowi t hh i so rh e ro wnp o s s i b i l i t i e s( ...)wi l lh a v et o cope alone again later on and have to take directresponsibility.\"(GP19) 3.1.3. Opportunities. For the GPs resource orientation opens the potential for working with chronically ill people tobecomemoresatisfying.Intervieweeshadtheimpressionthatpatientscanincreasepersonalautonomywiththeacceptanceof direct responsibility for their health and well-being. Thiscan have benefits for both patients and GPs. Patients canimprove their satisfaction and awareness of health and insharing responsibility, GPs can also achieve improved worksatisfaction. \"Well,Ibelievethatpatientscanprofitimmensely i fo n ep r o c e e d si nt h i sw a y .I ti sam u c hm o r erelaxed working atmosphere for the patient aswell. (...) And in return I do not carry the entireresponsibilityallbymyselfasadoctor,whichisof c o u r s eab u r d e ni nm yp r o f e s s i o n ,b u tc a nh a n doverpartofit.\"(GP19) Additionally, the interviewees explained that when the self-responsibility for health in a patient increases, medicalinterventions and medication intake can be reduced. As anadditional gain, deleterious effects, complications, and costscanbelowered. 3.2. Facilitation. The interviewed GPs did not have a stan- dardizedmethodtostimulatetheirpatients'resources.Meth-odswereveryindividualanddifferedfromdoctortodoctor.In addition, the patient contributed decisively to the choiceof a suitable method of facilitation, as not every patient isreceptive to the same treatment. Furthermore, the opinionsaboutwhichresourcesaremostimportantdifferedconsider-ablyamongGPs. 3.2.1. Communication. According to the interviewees, com- munication is the decisive mean for the facilitation ofresource-orientedapproaches. \" F o rt h et i m eb e i n g ,Iw o u l dl o o ka ti tf r o mt h e p o i n to fv i e wt h a ti ti se s s e n t i a lt oe n t e ri n t oadialogwiththepatient.Thismeansitcannotbeaone-waystreet,wewillhavetoreachanagreementwitheachother.\"(GP03) Inordertoconductaneffectivedoctor-patientconversa- tion, the interviewees considered a common language to beessential.Withrespecttothis,theypointedoutthatlanguagebarriers may emerge during conversations with patientswith a migrant background. Additionally, the importanceof using a language that is comprehensible to patients wasstressed several times. In the context of relevant methods ofcommunication,theintervieweesemphasizedthatquestionsasked by doctors should be open, for instance, questionsabout the patients' subjective theories about their illness:\"How do you explain your illness? \" (GP 12) or to strengthen the patient's own competence: \" What helps you? What does not?\"(GP16).Thishastwoadvantages:ontheonehand,the patientcanbecomeactiveandreflectonhiscurrentsituation.On the other hand, the answers given enable the doctor torespondtothepatientinanimprovedwayandtolookathimorherasawhole. In addition, the interviews showed how rarely questions are actually asked about a patient's background in a GP's practice.Oneofthedoctorsreportedthathehadonlystarteddoingthiswithinthecontextofresourceorientation. In addition to the asking of questions, reporting about otherpatientswasidentifiedasapossiblemethodforopening communication channels. Examples of patients in similar situationscouldhelptoillustratethepresentationofpotential effectsoftherapy.Forexample: \" Th e r ea r ec e r t a i np a t i e n t si nw h i c hi tp r o v e st o be fruitful, but often only if a specific example isgiven,oftheplacewhereitwen twrong. \"(GP08)Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 3.2.2.

Complementary and Alternative Medicine. According to the respondents specific methods of complementaryand alternative medicine offer the opportunity to facilitate resource orientation; explicitly mentioned were Feldenkrais, acoustic bowl therapy, magnetic fields, homeopathy, andkinesiology. \"By this a lot could be adjusted, for example, with acoustic bowls and things could be set inmotion beyond curing effects of course. It is both,preventiveandcurativeanditjustgivesimpetus.\"(GP05) \" S om yo w nr e s o u r c e sIh a v et ob u i l du p ,r e t a i n and improve as well.

Setting realistic goals could also strengthen a patient's motivation. 3.2.5. Settings. The setting (social entities, e.g., schools, dis- tricts, and migrant gatherings) was seen as a further possi- bility to facilitate resource-oriented approaches throughout the interviews. Doctors especially stressed the integrationinto local structures which was described as a very positiveexperience: \" W e l l ,Ia mas p o n s o ro far a c e .I t s 'fi r s tp r i z e goes to the school that enrolls the most studentsfor the run. (...)B yh a n d l i n gi tt h a tw a y ,y o u also signal that you think it makes sense to letchildren exercise without it being about who is the fastest runner but instead about the run as a sharedexperience.\"(GP06) Networking between nonmedical and medical profes- s i o n sw a sp e r c e i v e da sa n o t h e rs t a r t i n gp o i n tf o rt h efacilitation of resource orientation.

From the participating GPs' perspectives, thedevelopment of resource-oriented workplaces in collabora-tion with occupational physicians was an important task,especially considering our aging society. For instance, itwouldbepossibletograntadditionalbreakstoolderemploy-eesandtoconsidertheemployees'agewhenassigningtasks.6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3.2.6.Improvements. Amajorityofrespondentsconsiderthe possibility to spend more time with the patients as well asfinancialreimbursementforconsultationasafoundationforthe improvement of resource orientation. Furthermore, theintegrationofresourceorientationinGPcareby,forexample,establishing resource-oriented consultations was discussed. During the interviews, the question which role a GP plays in regard to resource orientation and health promotion andwhether this is part of his or her professional role at all wasfrequentlyasked. \"...and where it is retorted whether this even is a doctor'sduty.\"(GP14) Additionally,respondentsexpressedtheirwishforbetter representation of resource orientation in medical educationand research. An emphasis was placed on the necessity ofofferingpatient-orientedcounsellingtechniques. 4. Discussion Within this qualitative interview study the importance of resourceorientationforprimarycarewasclearlyemphasized byGPs;neverthelesstherewasaheterogeneousunderstand-ingofwhatresourceorientationmeans.Resourceorientationis regarded to be essential for the doctor-patient communi-cationandrelationship.Furthermore,theinterviewsdemon-strated that resource orientation plays an important role ina double sense: for the GP's own resources and for the careofpatients.Inmanyofourresultsthecloserelationbetweenresource orientation and the concept of health promotionbecame apparent. In contrast to simple resource orientation,thisconceptconcernsallsocietalelementsandconsequentlyananalysisandsubsequentstrengtheningofhealthresourcesisinorder.Asalutogenicperspectiveischaracteristicofboth,resourceorientationandhealthpromotion. The interviewees noted that when GPs use resource orientationtheydonotmerelyseethepatientasapersonwithanillness,butratherasasubjectthatisregardedinhisorherentirety.Sincemedicalmeasuresaretakenbasedonpatient'sindividual resources, most GPs see the consideration ofindividualaspectsasacoreareawithinprimarycare,similartotheGPswithinthisstudy.In2011,theEuropeanassociationWONCA defined six core competences which are requiredfrom a GP, which include an individualistic treatment andah o l i s t i cm o d e l[ 11]. In this context a holistic treatment means the embeddedness in the societal environment. As individualisticandholistictreatmentsarecrucialinresourceorientation,itcanbesuggestedthatresource-orientedactingactually is a fundamental aspect in the working routine ofGPs,evenifthisisnotrepresentedbyprimarycareresearch.Previous studies have shown that GPs feel that they haveinsufficientcapacitiestoexecutehealthpromotiononadailybasis [12]. However, this study shows that resource-oriented methods are already being used intuitively and thereforecould be considered as fundamental approaches withinprimary care that should be addressed more anticipatory.Furthermore, the fact that resource orientation is one of aGPs core competences should be given a larger focus in thediscussion of the redefinition of tasks and responsibilities in thefieldofhealthpromotion. The results indicate that resource orientation plays a crucial role in relation to GPs' own health. Despite thefact that burnout syndrome or exhaustion were only rarelymentionedininterviews,itisnowwidelyknownthatdoctors areparadoxicallyoneoftheoccupationalgroupsmostatrisk of health impairment. Due to the fact that a doctor's stateof health may also impact on a patient's medical care andthereby a patient's health, it is clearly necessary to promotehealthandwell-beingamongmedicalspecialists.Despitethehigh percentage of males in this study, the compatibility offamily and career becomes increasingly important given therising number of women in medicine [ 13,14]. A vital aspect inordertoincreasedoctor'swell-beingisachangeinworkingconditions. A more in-depth examination of methods toincrease resilience and minimise work-related stress wouldalso be beneficial. Moreover, the results pointed out that acontrast to work, for example, leisure activities or relaxationtechniques were an important resource in order to promotemedical specialists' general well-being. In order to combatoverwork, doctors should further learn when to say noa n dt od i s t a n c et h e m s e l v e s[ 15]. Furthermore, psychological problems shouldn't be seen as taboo anymore, in order ford o c t o r st ob ea b l et oa d m i ts i c kp e r i o d sa n dc a t e rt ot h e i rown needs. Other studies concerning stress in the medicalprofession report that doctors need to exchange ideas onstressful situations in a community, which would be easy toimplement,forexample,byutilisingsupervision[ 16]. In addition to an increased awareness of their own re- sources, doctors may also feel relief if patients accept more self-responsibilityfortheirhealth.Inordertodoso,resourceconsciousness as well as watchfulness of one's own bodyneedstobefacilitatedamongpatients.Theymay,forinstance,become more autonomous,active and assume more respon-sibility by receiving instructions from their medical prac-titioner. Thereby, patients can prevent and counteract milddiseases without straining their own health. The provisionof information and skilled advisers in self-help can promoteconfidentinteractionbetweendoctorsandpatients.Thereby,this method increases patient competence and contributesto shared-decision making [ 17]. A limitation, however, is that patients are often not motivated enough to be engagedin independently taking responsibility for their own health[18],especiallyconcerningriskfactorsthatcannotdirectlybe sensed, for example, high blood pressure. Lifestyle changesare often not considered necessary by patients. In this way,the patient should learn how to cope with his or her illnesswith the help of the GP. Therefore patients need to bec o u n s e l e da n ds u p p o r t e db yt h e i rG P .Th i si se s p e c i a l l yt r u efor methods of complementary and alternative medicinewhich are according to this study an important source ofresource orientation. This is in agreement with previousstudies for the field of herbal medicine showing that herbal medicine meets the patients' needs for autonomy, support, andself-care[ 18]. In order to be able to implement resource orientation moreeffectively,doctorswereaskedforageneraldefinitionofthe term. Bringing together the existing approaches aroundEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7 resource orientation with the aim to establish a general definitionwouldbeanimportantstepforpatientcarebutalsoforeducationandfurtherresearch. The results also indicate that currently there is no struc- turedadvancementinimplementingresourceorientation.Inorder to improve this, a working communication between a doctor and his patient is necessary, due to the fact that thisexchangecanpromotecomplianceaswellassignificantlyincreasetheexchangeofinformation[ 19].Techniqueswhich couldpossiblyfosterpatient-orientedcarecouldparticularlyinclude asking questions as well as well-known communi-cation techniques such as active listening. Recent researchshowsthatbalancingdialoguesareafurthermethodofcom-munication,whichcanalleviatethestructuringoflong-termGP treatment of chronically diseased patients. In balancingdialogues, a joint treatment is evaluated, and suggestions ofimprovementarediscussed[ 20]. Th er e s u l t sa l s os h o wt h a tt e a c h i n gc o m m u n i c a t i o n competence as well as resource-oriented approaches areessential in medical training and further education. Existingcompetency-basedcurriculasuchastheCanMedsarepartic-ularlyrecommendedasaguidingmanualforundergraduateand postgraduate education. Within the CanMeds concepthealth promotion and resource-oriented aredescribedintheroleofthe\"Healthadvocate\"[ 21].Integration intoundergraduateandpostgraduatecurriculaisessentialtomake medical students sufficiently sensitive and strengthentheir personal skills in these topics. A manual, which givespractical consultation advice for the use of resources, wouldbeacriticalprerequisiteinordertoimplementandpromote resourceorientation.However,thisrequiresacommondefi- nitionandastrongerevidencebaseforresourceorientation. With regard to facilitation communal resources can offer great potential to treat patients in a resource-orientedmanner.Somedoctorsquestionedwerealreadyintegratedincommunity activities. However, they reported that integra-tionintocommunitiesislargelydependentuponthedoctor'sown commitment due to the fact that structures, whichcould facilitate integration, are generally lacking. In orderto improve these conditions a better network of all actorsinvolvedisadesirablesolution.Thisshouldnotonlyincludeall health-related professions (doctors, nurses, and alliedhealthcareprofessionals),butalsootherprofessionalgroupswithinthecommunity,forexample,inthefieldsofeducationand employment. A key element in supplying healthcare forchronically ill patients is an integration of networking asdescribedwithinthechroniccaremodel,anapproachwhichhas currently also been discussed [ 8,21]. Communal health conferenceswereintroducedforexampleinonefederalstateof Germany in order to supply for network structure. Theseserve as a platform for communication and coordinationfor all actors in health care, and aim to create networks onrelevant topics, in order to jointly solve local problems [ 22]. Additionally, further models for successful interprofessional collaborationshouldbeadvertisedandpromoted. I nt h ei n t e r v i e w s ,t h er o l eo fG P sw a sa l s od i s c u s s e d , and it was mentioned that individual health care is aGP's primary duty within health promotion. Doctors canintroducepatientstohealthpromotionoffers,whichalreadyexist within the community, or can alternatively offer these in their own practices (e.g., nutrition consultation). Oftenhowever,doctorslackknowledgeofhealthcareoffersalreadyestablished within their communities. Another approach infurtherincorporatingGPsintothecommunityandfosteringt h e i rw o r kr e l i e fi sap o s s i b l er e s t r u c t u r eo fa m b u l a n th e a l t h care by strongly integrating other health care professionals. Afterall,mostpatientsvisitingaGPalreadyshowsymptoms.Resource orientation should, however, also be applied tohealthyindividuals. The results, moreover, suggested that there are further possibilities to accommodate for resource-oriented ap-proachesinhealthcare.Aresource-orientedconsultationforchronically ill patients could increase the focus on healthyand positive aspects in the patient's life and improve hisqualityoflife.Anintegrationofresourceorientationinexist-ing structures, for example, established medical check-upsalso seems promising. Lastly, the use of a resource-orientedquestionnaire,whichconcernsthepatients'differentareasoflifeaswellastheircapacities,couldprovereasonable. Ourstudyhasseverallimitations.Onecould,forinstance, view the inclusion criterion as a limitation, \"experience inresource orientation\", for example, was not further defined.An imbalance of gender representation may also be under- s t o o da sal i m i t a t i o n .H o w e v e r ,o u ra i mw a sn o tt od r a w conclusions on a representative basis, but to explore therespectiveGPs'personalinsightsonresourceorientation.Theremoteinterviewmethodhassomelimitationsregardingthecreation of an atmosphere of trust. However, this approach w a sc h o s e np u r p o s e f u l l yt ob ea b l et oi n c l u d eG P sf r o m around Germany, with an awareness of the bias that canarise from this method [ 23]. A further limitation could be that no definition of resource orientation was given to theparticipants before the interviews. This method was chosenin order to prevent bias regarding the meaning of the words\"resource orientation.\" Furthermore, the interviewees werenot asked to what extent they implement resource-orientedmethods, but rather how they would do so. This study doesonlyconsiderGPs,whichseemstogivealimitedviewofthesubject. To broaden and enhance the results of this study, the next step would be to interview patients as well as other healthprofessionalsandtoanalyzethegeneratedhypothesesinfurtherquantitativestudies. 5. Conclusion Resource orientation, as a part of health promotion, playsan important role in GPs' daily work. Therefore it shouldbe increasingly taken into account. Furthermore, resourceorientation should be focused in medical curricula as wella si nd a i l yw o r kr o u t i n eo fG P sa n do t h e rh e a l t hp r o -fessionals. Resource-oriented skills could, for example, betaughtincommunicationclassesorqualitycircles.Moreover,GPs should be more integrated in communal structures.With regard to the demographic development this can con-tribute to respond the growing demand of health care andthe increasing workload and burden within primary care.Additionally, the duty of the patients is to become aware of8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine their resources. They need to take over direct responsibility for their health and health related problems which couldlead to a better quality of life and self-efficacy of patientsespeciallythosewithchronicconditions.Inthisway,resourceorientation could lead to a reduced demand of medicalservicesand,thus,toareductionofGPs'workload.

Methods.Participantsagedbetween18and65yearswithmoderateto high levels of perceived psychological distress were randomized to 8 sessions of mindful walking in 4 weeks (each 40 minutes walking, 10 minutes mindful walking, 10 minutes discussion) or to no study intervention (waiting group). Generalpsychologicaldistressandstress-relateddiseasesare considered to be an important health issue in Western soci- eties. A recent survey with a representative sample showed that between 5% and 15% of the adult German population reported symptoms of marked psychological distress in thelast 3 months, the frequency of chronic stress being higher among women than men [ 1,2]. Another survey suggests that up to 80% of the German population feels distressed frequently,upto30%mostofthetime[ 3].Itisalsoassumed that the share of workers who experience stress and psycho- logicaltroubleduetotheirworkingconditionsisincreasing. In a recent German survey, one-fifth of 1756 employees felt overburdened on work; 43% reported that they experiencedan increase of stress and work pressure in the last years [ 4]. Whereasacertainlevelofstressisgenerallyconsideredtobeof benefit to improve performance, continuous stress affects physicalandmentalhealth[ 5,6]. In several studies, mindfulness training and physical exercise have demonstrated effects in reducing symptomsof psychological distress [ 7,8]. Mindfulness training is a treatment strategy derived from Buddhist mindfulnessmeditation practice. It is described as the tendency toencounter moment-to-moment experiences without beinglost in unhelpful or distressing thoughts triggered by theexperience [ 9]. The most commonly studied mindfulness training program is mindfulness-based stress reduction(MBSR)thathasdemonstratedeffectsnotonlyawiderangeofmentalandphysicaldisorders,butalsoonstressedhealthypeople[7,9].Adirectrelationshipbetweenphysicalexercise and prevention or improvements of health has not onlybeen established for many somatic diseases, but seems alsoplausibleforpsychologicaldistress[ 8].2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine For the future, it is an important public health issue to develop and evaluate simple and cost-effective nonpharma-cologicaltherapiesforthegeneralpopulationtopreventandtreatindividualswithacuteorchronicpsychologicaldistress. Hypothetically it could be a good concept to combine mental and physical stress reduction strategies, especially if the combined exercise program would be easy to learn and run on low costs. Up to date, a combination betweenwalkingexerciseandmindfulnesshasnotbeensystematicallyevaluated.Therefore,wedevelopedaneasytofollowtrainingprogram that combines mindfulness with walking. The aimof this randomized, controlled study was to investigate theeffectiveness of mindful walking in patients with high levelsofsubjectivelyperceivedpsychologicaldistress. 2. Methods 2.1.Design. Thisstudywasdesignedasanopen,single-center randomized controlled trial including two parallel groups.All study participants gave their written informed consentbefore inclusion. The study was carried out at the outpatientclinic for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)atCharit\u00b4eUniversit \u00a8atsmedizinBerlin,Germany.Themindful walking training was performed in the surrounding streetsandparks. Patients were allocated to treatment groups by a ran- domizationwitha1:1ratio.Therandomallocationsequencewas generated using SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). After signing the informed consent form and completing the baseline assessment questionnaires, thesubjects were centrally assigned to intervention or controlgroup by an independent study nurse on the telephone line.Allocationwasconcealedaccordingtotherandomizationlist. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Charit \u00b4eU n i v e r s i t \u00a8atsmedizin, Berlin, Ger- many (EA1/013/11 - ). Participantswererecruitedthroughadver- tisements in local daily newspapers. Study information andprescreeningwereundertakenbyphonebyastudynurseand a student of health science. Eligible subjects that reported a high level of psychological distress were invited for apersonalconsultationwithastudyphysicianforinformation,informed consent, and the assessment of inclusion or exclu-sion.Inclusioncriteriawere (i) catingmorestress). Exclusioncriteriawere (i) regular walking training in the last 6 weeks (at least oneregulartrainingsessionperweek), (ii) psychopharmacologicaldrugs, (iii) regular mindfulness training (at least one regular trainingsessionperweek),(iv) other CAM treatments against stress in the last 6 weeks, (v) acutediseasesorchronicdiseaseatbaseline, (vi) inabilitytowalk.

Theinterventionprotocolwasdevel- oped in a consensus process including a mindfulness-basedstress reduction trainer, a sports therapist, and two medical doctors.Subjectsallocatedtotheinterventiongroupreceived 8sessionsof60-minutemindfulwalkingtrainingwithinfourweeks. Each training group consisted up to 15 individuals.The intervention was delivered by two sports therapiststhat were alsotrainedin mindfulness-basedstress reductiontechniques.Eachsessionwasstructuredasfollows: (i) meeting at a defined meeting point and greetings (5 minutes); (ii) walkingtoapark(5minutes); (iii) gymnastic exercises to warm up and short walking instructions(5minutes); (iv) walking(10minutes); (v) mindful walking (10 minutes). Participants were instructed to mindfully observe and focus on theirbodily sensations while walking remaining focusedon their moment-to-moment experiences withoutbeing lost in unhelpful or distressing thoughts trig-gered by the experience. If this was experiencedas a problem, the participants were instructed tofocus their awareness on their breath while in- andexhaling, (vi) a feedback round was used to share and discuss the experiences(5minutes), (vii) walking(10minutes), (viii) gymnasticexercises(5minutes), (ix) walkingbacktothemeetingpoint(5minutes). Participants of the intervention group were encouraged and advisedtokeeponexercisingforthemselvesaftercompletingthe4-weekprogram. Participants allocated to the control group received no mindfulwalkingtraininginthe12-weekdurationofthestudy (waitinglistgroup).Theywereonlysentstudyquestionnairesafter 4 and 12 weeks by postal service and had no consulta-tions with the study physicians between baseline and week12. After the trial was completed, all subjects of the control group were offered the previously intervention in the abovedescribedmannerforfree. 2.4. Outcome Measures.

Adverse events were monitored by themindfulwalkingtrainersthroughoutthestudy. 2.5. Statistical Analysis. The study was designed to detect a difference of the primary outcome parameter (differencebetween CPSS score to baseline) of 7 points between inter- vention and control group with a power of 90% including a dropoutrateofapproximately20%.Therefore,weincluded37participantspergroup. Data analysis is based on intention-to-treat population. Missingvalueswerereplacedbylastobservedvalue(lastvalue carried forward). Primary and secondary outcome parame- ters were analyzed with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusted for the respective baseline value, two-sided with asignificance level of 5%. The ANCOVA models were used to calculateadjusteddifferenceswith95%confidenceintervals. AllstatisticalanalyseswereconductedinR2.15.1[ 13].3. Results ParticipantswereincludedinthestudyfromFebruarytoMay 2011. Study intervention and followups were completed bySeptember 2011. A total of 168 subjects were screened for eligibility; 94 could not be included. The main reason for noninclusion was not meeting the inclusion criteria mainlydue to the subject reporting a perceived level of stress below40mm on the VAS ( Figure1). Seventy four patients were randomized with 36 allocated to the intervention, 38 to thecontrol group. Five participants of the intervention groupand6fromthecon trolgroupdecidedtotermina tethestudyintervention program before their individual study end forseveral reasons: lost his house in a fire ( =1), moving out of the city (=1), disease (=1), not explained (=2) in the intervention group and job-related stress ( =1), not explained(=5)inthecontrolgroup. At baseline, the SF-36 Mental Component Score was significantly higher at baseline in the control group ( 36.3\u00b1 10.2)t h a ni nt h ei n t e r v e n t i o ng r o u p( 31.7\u00b18.8 ), all othercharacteristicsshowedcomparablevalues( Table 1).The mean age of the participants was 52.3\u00b18.6 (SD) in the intervention and49.5\u00b18.8 in the control group at baseline.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ran- domized trial evaluating a mindful walking program forthe treatment of perceived general psychological distress. There are not many stress reduction programs combining exercise with mindfulness practice or relaxation. Michalsenet al.

In this study, the exercise component consisted only of walking, which is easier to practice than yoga exercises, but misses the specific stretching and flexibility component.

Background . This pilot study examined the feasibility and efficacy of providing Qigong treatment in a health center to Chinese Americans with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods. Fourteen Chinese Americans with MDD were enrolled, and they received a 12-week Qigong intervention. The key outcome measurement was the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17); the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I), the MSPSS. Conclusions . The Qigong intervention providedatahealthcaresettingforthetreatmentofprimarycarepatientswithMDDisfeasible.Furtherstudieswithlargersample sizesarewarranted. 1. Introduction 1.1. Depression and Disparities in Treatment among Chinese Americans. There are tremendous racial health disparities in the treatment of depression [ 1]. Ethnic minorities face both practical and cultural barriers to mental health care.Asian Americans frequently lack the resources to seek help, sufferfromlanguagebarriers,andholdstrongstigmatowards psychiatric illnesses, leading to the undertreatmentof major depressive disorder (MDD) [ 2]. There is a pressing need for culturally sanctioned interventions for depressed AsianAmericans. 1.2.QigongfortheTreatmentofDepression. Qigongisaform of exercise that incorporates orchestrated body postures,breath practices, and meditation to attain deeply focusedand relaxed states [ 3]. The Qigong practices are thought toactivate naturally occurring physiological and psychological mechanisms of self-repair and health recovery [ 4]. Most Qigongformsinvolveslowgentlemovementsthatcanbeeas-ily adapted and are thus appropriate for people of all ages,fitness levels, and physical conditions. Furthermore, Qigong is relatively inexpensive and easy to learn and requires very littlespacetopractice. The health effects of Qigong have been reported in various populations with chronic conditions, including highblood pressure [ 5,6], bone loss [ 7], and cardiac disease rehabilitation [ 8]. While there is increasing evidence on the benefits of the Qigong practice for physical symptoms, itseffectsonpsychologicalsymptomshaveyettobeestablished.Preliminary research has shown Qigong's beneficial effectson a range of psychological well-being measures, includingmood, anxiety/depression, general stress management, andqualityoflife[ 9-12],butmostofthestudiesrecruitedhealthy2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine subjects or patients with a chronic medical condition but notpatientsdiagnosedwithMDD.IthasbeenproposedthatQigong, as a mind-body group exercise, is useful for self-managementofdepressionbyalleviatingthestresseffectsonthehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenalaxis,decreasingnegativethoughts,andincreasingsocialsupport[ 13,14]. In this study, we examined the feasibility and safety of offering Qigong at a health center for Chinese Americanswith MDD as a stress management technique. We hypoth-esize that it is feasible and safe to use Qigong for treatingChinese Americans with MDD in a health care setting andthatQigongiseffectiveinreducingdepressivesymptomsandimproving social functioning, based on standardized ques-tionnairesondepression,qualityoflife,andsocialsupportasperceivedbythepatient. 2. Methods 2.1. Participants. Fourteen Chinese Americans were recrui- tedfromtheprimarycareclinicsatSouthCoveCommunityHealthCenter(SouthCove)betweenMayandOctober2011.South Cove is a federally-funded community health centerin Boston that serves predominantly Chinese Americans.In 2011, South Cove served more than 25,000 patients, andthe majority of them (>92%) were Chinese immigrants. All participantswererequiredtobefluentChinesespeakersbothto ensure comprehension in the Qigong classes, which wereconducted in Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin), and toe n c o u r a g es o c i a li n t e r a c t i o na n dm u t u a ls u p p o r t .Th es t u d ywas approved by the Institution Review Board (IRB) of the MassachusettsGeneralHospital. Inclusioncriteriaincluded(1)self-identificationasbeing of Chinese ethnicity and fluent in Mandarin and/or Can-tonese, (2) 18-70 years of age, (3) Diagnostic and StatisticalManual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV),diagnosis of MDD, and (4) baseline score on the 17-itemHamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D 17)12.

Participants receiving treatment for depression, including antidepressants, conventional psychotherapy, or complementary treatments, were allowed to continue withtheirtreatmentandwereadvisednottochangetheirexistingtreatmentsduringthestudy. 2.2.ParticipantEnrollment. Asforrecruitment,fliersempha- sizing the use of Qigong for stress management were placedat South Cove. This is considered a culturally sensitive wayto recruit less acculturated Chinese patients as they tend tohave strong stigma against depression or any mental illness.In addition, primary care physicians at South Cove wereencouragedtoreferpatientstothisstudy.Potentialparticipantswereprescreenedoverthephoneby our bilingual research staff using an IRB-approved the semistructured psychiatric interview (CB-SCID- I/P)[15]toassessthediagnosisofMDDandadministeredthe HAM-D 17todetermineeligibility. 2.3. Intervention. The Qigong intervention consisted of 1- hour group classes held twice weekly for 12 weeks in a largeconference room in the health center. The instructor hadtaughtQigonginacommunitysettingformorethan20years.The instructor followed a standard protocol [ 16,17]; the 12 weeks of training started with 20 minutes of traditional warm-up exercises which involved arm swinging; gentlestretches of the neck, shoulders, spine, arms, and legs; andtraditional breathing methods. These exercises focus onreleasingtensioninthebody,incorporatingmindfulnessandimageryintomovement,increasingawarenessandefficiencyof breathing, and promoting overall relaxation of body andmind. After the warm-up exercise, there was a 10-minutebreak to encourage peer learning and discussion to facilitatesocial interaction and mutual support, which is consideredan important therapeutic element in Qigong. The Qigongexercise instruction (30 minutes) following the intermissionincluded repetitions of slow, standardized Qigong move-ments.ClasseswereconductedinMandarinChinese.Partic-ipantsalsoreceivedaDVDdemonstratingtheexercisesfromthe instructor and were encouraged to practice at home atleast3timesperweekandtorecordhowmuchtheypracticed. 2.4.OutcomeAssessments.

The Q-LES-Q-SFis a self-report measure, and each item is rated from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). Results arepresented as the total score and as an average of the singleoverall assessment item, with higher scores representingbetterqualityoflife.TheChineseversionoftheQ-LES-Q-SFhas been demonstrated to have good reliability and validityamong Chinese patients with psychiatric disorders [ 25].Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 TheMSPSSisaself-administered12-itemscaleusedtoassess perceptionsofsocialsupportfromfamilymembers,friends,a n ds i g n i fi c a n to t h e r s .I t e m sa r er a t e do na7 - p o i n tL i k e r tscale (1: very strongly disagree; 7: very strongly agree), withhigher scores indicating greater level of perceived support.Confirmatory factor analysis has consistently reported a 3- factor o rth epa rtici pa n tst oreport their opinions on how effective they consider Qigongas treatment of depression. At each class, participants wereasked to fill in an attendance sheet, an adverse events log,and an adherence to the Qigong practice log to report thefrequency and duration of their Qigong practice in the pastweek. 2.5. Data Analyses. All the participants were evaluated at week 6 and week 12 assessments; measurements made at thebaseline were compared to week 12 assessments.

Results FourteenChineseAmericanswithMDDwereenrolledinthestudy(64%female,meanage53\u00b114).Thebaselineanddemo- graphic characteristics of participants are listed in Table 1. Most participants had positive expectations that Qigong would help their depression (\"not helpful\": 0%, \"maybe\": 64%,\"yes\":29%,and\"definitely\":7%).Ten(71%)participantscompleted the intervention, based on having attended morethan15(62.5%)sessions.NoadverseeventsduetotheQigongintervention were reported. The participants showed a lotof enthusiasm in class. During the 10-minute intermissiontime, they were eager to share learning experience withtheir peer participants and asked the instructor questionsonthetheoriesandtechnicalaspectsofQigong.Participantsreported practicing Qigong on the average four days a weekat home (4.0\u00b12.0)bo tha tw ee k6a n dw ee k1 2a s se s s m e n t s , whichexceededourexpectationofthreedaysaweekofhomepractice.Table1:Baselinecharacteristicsofstudyparticipants( =14).

The response and remission rates after the Qigong intervention were satisfactory even compared to the resultsfromantidepressanttreatmentasreportedfromtheSTAR-Dstudy[30],thelargestclinicaltrialonMDDintheUSA. TheofferingofQigongasaninterventioninahealthcare settingisaninnovativeapproach.DespitethefactthatWag-ner (1998) pointed out the importance of the use of a multi-facetedapproach,includingexercise,relaxationtraining,andself-management for treatment of chronic disease, patientsare generally left on their own to look for these resourcesinthecommunity[ 31].Fortheunderservedminorities,such resourcesarenotreadilyavailabletothem. Inthisstudy,wedemonstratedthefeasibilitywithprelim- inary data on the effectiveness of offering Qigong within acommunityhealthcentertoChineseimmigrantswithMDD.Placing self-management trainings within a health centermakesitmoreconvenientforpatientsandisasteptoincreaseintegration of medical and behavioral treatment. Qigonghas been shown to have beneficial effects for both physicalandpsychologicalconditions[ 32,33].Furtherstudiesshould examine whether such a model would be efficacious as atherapeuticinterventionand/orpreventivemeasurefordep-ressionandotherchronicdiseases.

Conclusions Qigong as a stress reduction intervention in a health caresetting is safe, feasible, and well received. A 12-week Qigongintervention may be effective for improving symptoms andinducingremissioninChineseAmericanswithMDD.Futurestudies with larger sample sizes randomized to the inter-vention and control groups and the inclusion of biologicaloutcomemeasureswillbeneededtoprovidemoredefinitiveoutcomes.
