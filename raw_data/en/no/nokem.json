Specifically, this medication is used to treat the Humira can [interact](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drug-interactions) with certain other drugs. It can also interact with some vaccines. An interaction occurs when one substance causes another substance to have a different effect than expected. Keep reading for details about Humira's interactions, including whether there are drugs you can't take with Humira. For additional information about Humira, including details about its uses, see [this article](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/humira). Before you start treatment with Humira, tell your doctor and pharmacist which prescription, over-the-counter, and other medications you take. By sharing this information with them, you may help prevent possible interactions. If you have questions about drug interactions that may affect you, ask your doctor or pharmacist. They can determine whether there are any things to avoid while you're taking Humira or reasons why you should not take Humira. Here's a chart of drugs that can interact with Humira. Keep in mind that this chart doesn't include all drugs that may interact with Humira. Some of these interactions are described in detail just below in \"Drug interactions in depth.\" |Drug class||Drug effects of Humira, see [this article](/articles/drugs-humira-side-effects). Here's a closer look at certain drug interactions of Humira. Other TNF blockers Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers are drugs that can be used (RA)](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323361), [plaque psoriasis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315502), and [Crohn's disease](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151620). Humira type TNF blocker. Interaction result. Taking Humira with another TNF blocker may increase your risk of infection. Interaction explained. Humira can weaken your immune system. Other TNF blockers can also weaken it. Taking Humira in combination with another TNF blocker could weaken your immune system further. When your immune system is not strong enough to fight infections, your risk of developing them increases. In some cases, the infections can be serious.* It's not usually recommended to take more than one TNF blocker at once. Examples of TNF blockers. Here are some TNF blockers that may interact with Humira: Steps you or your doctor may take. If you take any TNF blockers, tell your doctor before starting Humira treatment. If you're not sure whether any of your medications are TNF blockers, your doctor or pharmacist can help identify them. In most cases, your doctor will recommend taking only one TNF blocker at a time to avoid serious infections. Your doctor can help determine the right treatment option for you. * Humira has a [boxed warning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538521/) [Boxed warnings](/articles/drugs-humira-interactions#)\" at the top of this article. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids may be used for many conditions, including some that Humira works to treat, such as RA and [psoriatic arthritis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/316757). Interaction result. Taking Humira with a corticosteroid may increase your risk of infection. Interaction explained. Humira can weaken your immune system. Corticosteroids can also weaken it. Taking Humira in combination with a corticosteroid could weaken your immune system further. When your immune system is not strong enough to fight infections, your risk of having them increases. In some cases, the infections can be serious.* Examples of corticosteroid drugs. Here are some corticosteroids that may interact with Humira: [prednisone](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/prednisone-oral-tablet)(Rayos) [dexamethasone](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322409)(Hemady) [methylprednisolone](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/methylprednisolone-oral-tablet)(Medrol) Steps you or your doctor may take. Before starting treatment with Humira, tell your doctor if you take any corticosteroids. If you're not sure whether any of your medications are corticosteroids, your doctor or pharmacist can help identify them. If you're taking a corticosteroid, your doctor may monitor you more frequently while you take Humira.

Early treatment may help prevent the infection from becoming serious. * Humira has a [boxed warning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538521/) [Boxed warnings](/articles/drugs-humira-interactions#)\" at the top of this article. Drugs with a narrow range of safety Certain drugs have a narrow range of safety (NRS). This means that small changes in the level of the drug in your system can increase the risk of side effects or cause the drug to not work properly. Sometimes a small change in the dosage of another medication can greatly affect how much of the drug with an NRS is in your body. Interaction result. Taking Humira with a drug that has an NRS can either: - make the NRS drug less effective than usual or - increase your risk of side effects from the NRS drug Interaction explained. It's possible for Humira to change the levels of other medications in your body. If you take Humira with a drug that has an NRS, a small Humira dosage change may affect the level of the other drug. The dosage change could cause the other drug's level to become too low or too high. If the other drug's level becomes too low, the drug could be less effective than it should be. If the other drug's level becomes too high, your risk of side effects from the other drug may increase. Examples of drugs with a narrow range of safety. Here are some drugs with an NRS that may interact with Humira: [warfarin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/261316)(Jantoven) [cyclosporine](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325563)(Gengraf, Neoral) - theophylline (Theo-24) Steps you or your doctor may take. Before starting Humira treatment, tell your doctor and pharmacist about any medications you take. They can help determine if any drugs have an NRS. If you're taking an NRS drug, your doctor may monitor you more frequently during Humira treatment to see whether the NRS drug is working for you. They may order blood tests, especially when you first start taking Humira, if your dose changes, and when they have you stop Humira treatment. In some cases, your doctor may need to increase or decrease the dose of the NRS drug. They can determine the right dose of medication for you. There aren't any known interactions between Humira and alcohol. However, alcohol can worsen the side effects of Humira.* For example, Humira may cause headache or nausea. Drinking alcohol while taking Humira may make these side effects worse. In addition, consuming alcohol may worsen the condition you're taking Humira to treat. For example, symptoms of [Crohn's disease](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151620) and [plaque psoriasis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315502) may worsen if you drink alcohol with Humira. If you drink alcohol, talk with your doctor. They can advise you on how much, if any, alcohol is safe to consume during your treatment with Humira. * For information about the side effects of Humira, see [this article](/articles/drugs-humira-side-effects). Humira may have other interactions, such as with [supplements](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/vitamins-minerals-supplements), foods, vaccines, or even lab tests. You'll find details below. Keep in mind that the following information does not include all other possible interactions with Humira. Humira and supplements It's possible for drugs to interact with supplements such as vitamins and herbs. However, no supplements have been [reported](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/125057s417lbl.pdf) to interact with Humira. Humira and herbs There have been no specific [reports](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/125057s417lbl.pdf) of herbs interacting with Humira. However, it's possible that interactions with herbs could be recognized in the future. Because of this, it's important to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any of these products during Humira treatment. Humira and vitamins No [vitamin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/195878) or other nutrient interactions have been [reported](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/125057s417lbl.pdf) with Humira.

Humira interactions with vaccines You should not get live vaccines while you're taking Humira. Live vaccines contain living parts of the bacterium or virus they're meant to protect you from. The parts have been weakened. These vaccines typically won't cause infection if you have a healthy immune system. Humira may cause your immune system to weaken. When your immune system is not as strong as usual, your body may have a harder time fighting the bacterium or virus in a live vaccine. As a result, you could develop symptoms of the illness the live vaccine defends against. Examples of live vaccines include: - nasal spray form of Humira, it's usually safe to receive non-live vaccines, such as a [pneumonia shot](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/pneumonia-vaccine-how-often) or [flu shot](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312469). Before you start taking Humira, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. They may recommend that you get certain vaccines before starting treatment with Humira. Humira and lab tests There haven't been any [reported](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/125057s417lbl.pdf) interactions between Humira and lab tests. Your doctor can help answer any questions you have about lab tests during your treatment. HUMIRA AND CANNABIS OR CBD [Cannabis](often cannabidiol [CBD]), have not been specifically [reported]to interact with Humira. However, as with any drug or supplement, talk with your doctor before using cannabis in combination with Humira. The impact of cannabis may affect how well you stick to your Humira treatment plan.

Your doctor can help treat your infection before you start taking Humira. Cancer. If you have or have had [cancer](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323648), tell your doctor before starting Humira treatment. This medication can increase your risk of developing certain types of cancer.* If you have cancer or a history of it, taking Humira may worsen your condition or cause it to return. Your doctor may monitor you more often during your treatment with Humira. Sometimes, they may recommend a different treatment option for you. Nervous system conditions. Be sure to tell your doctor about any nervous system conditions you may have, including [multiple sclerosis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/37556) and [Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/167892).
