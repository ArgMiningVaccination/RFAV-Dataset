This means that Maca root's benefits for men, including enhancing stamina, sex drive, and workouts, could help you continue to optimize your well-being.* However, with so many \"miracle male health enhancers'' out there, how do you know if Maca is legit? The best way to uncover the safety and efficacy of any herbal product is to learn about its history and traditional uses and follow the research. From there, you can decide if it's a good fit for you and your health goals. This article explains the top seven science-backed [benefits of Maca ](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/maca-dosage)Root or Maca Powder for men and how to find the best source. What is Maca Root? Also known as Peruvian ginseng, Maca Root, Lepidium meyenii, is native to the Peruvian mountains, where it has been cultivated and used as food, currency, and medicine for approximately 2,000 years.REF#11 In fact, the ancient Incans once considered it more precious than gold and reserved its use for royalty. [Maca](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/maca) belongs to the cruciferous family of vegetables (which also includes produce like broccoli, cauliflower, and radishes). It is rich in life-giving nutrients, including essential fatty acids, fiber, amino acids, iron, calcium, and vitamin C. Maca is an adaptogen, which means it helps your body adapt and better respond to stress.** It's been traditionally used to support fertility and respiratory health, enhance energy and stamina, as an aphrodisiac, for rheumatism, and for anemia.* Due to its reported effects on enhancing fertility, energy, and sexual virility, demand for Maca Root has skyrocketed in the last decade. This has led researchers to start examining the efficacy and mechanisms behind this ancient root's modern and traditional uses. #1. Maca Supports Male Fertility* It is estimated between 1 in 6 and 1 in 8 couples struggle with fertility issues.REF#12 The male partner is either the sole cause or a contributing cause of infertility in approximately 40% of couples, per the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.REF#13 Fertility support is one of Maca's claims to fame. But does it really work? There is evidence Maca can support aspects of male fertility via its effects on sperm count, quality, and motility (the ability of sperm to swim).* Studies suggest Maca's plant-based chemicals, known as polysaccharides, support healthy sperm counts by enhancing antioxidant levels.* Antioxidants offer sperm protection from the effects of free radical damage.REF#14 There is also evidence Maca affects sperm quality by supporting normal levels of luteinizing hormone (LH).*REF#15 In men, LH stimulates the testes to make testosterone, which is essential to sperm production.REF#16 Insofar as sperm motility is concerned, Maca has shown potential benefits to humans and animals.REF#17 REF#18 Although the exact mechanism behind its action remains unclear. #2: Maca Helps the Body Adapt to Stress* Stress is an inevitable part of life. However, it can quickly wear us down if we don't learn to manage it effectively. It's times like these when adaptogenic herbs, like Maca, [American ginseng](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/ginseng-supreme), and [ashwagandha](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/ashwagandha-root), can make all the difference. a brief synopsis of how adaptogens work: - Adaptogens are a class of plants that help the body better adapt to various stressors to maintain equilibrium. - Research shows they work by [supporting the adrenals](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/meet-your-adrenals)to enhance stamina and resilience during physical, mental, or emotional stress.REF#19 - This action is one reason Maca was prized in indigenous cultures. Its adaptogenic properties helped people adapt to the harsher climate and altitudes of the Andes mountains. Adaptogens have been traditionally used in many systems of healing, including traditional Chinese medicine (medicinal mushrooms and eleuthero), Ayurveda (Tulsi), Native American medicine (American ginseng), Russian medicine (Rhodiola rosea), and others. #3: Maca Can Boost Libido In Men* Maca has had a long-standing reputation as an aphrodisiac, but how it affects men's sexual health is still unclear. Here's what we do know: - A 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel trial published in the First International Journal of Andrology's Andrologia found that Maca enhanced sexual desire in men after eight weeks of use. One would think this would be related to a positive impact on testosterone. However, the researchers stated there was no change in testosterone or oestradiol. The mechanism of action remains unclear.REF#20 - Additional research from the journal BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies found that Maca supported sexual desire in men and menopausal women, but how it works is, once again, unclear.REF#21 Researchers and experts hypothesize it could be due to Maca's adaptogenic properties, which support adrenal health, thereby benefiting hormonal levels, mood, stress levels, and more.* Its supportive effects on luteinizing hormone (discussed in point #1), which is involved in libido, could also explain its action.*REF#22 Bottom line: aca can support a healthy sex drive in men, but there here is no official consensus on how it works.* #4: Maca May Enhance Energy and Stamina* Having enough energy to maintain peak performance throughout their day is a top priority for a majority of men. This is one reason Maca Powder has become a popular addition to coffee, energy drinks and pre- and post-workout smoothies. Its adaptogenic, nutritional, and phyto-chemical properties make it effective at helping maintain daily energy and stamina.* According to herbal traditions, the Andean people used Maca extensively for these purposes\u2014both in everyday life and in preparing for battle. The Spanish conquistadors were also said to have used high doses of Maca to prepare themselves for war. In addition to its adaptogenic qualities, research shows Maca can boost exercise performance by supporting mitochondria function (mitochondria are the energy-producing powerhouses of our cells), and its antioxidants protect against the oxidative damage that can occur during intense exercise.REF#23 It's also been shown effective in supporting physical endurance and speed in male athletes.*REF#24 Finally, the nutrients in Maca, such as carbohydrates, protein, fiber, iron, essential amino acids, and vitamin C, can help support sustained energy.* #5: Maca May Support Prostate Health* Few young men pay much attention to the health of their prostates. However, did you know the prostate is essential to sperm production, urinary health, hormone conversion, development of secondary sex characteristics (such as facial hair), and overall sexual and reproductive health? Therefore, it's wise for men of all ages to support their [prostate health](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/collections/prostate-health-supplements). According to animal studies published in Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology and Andrologia, the phytochemicals in red saponins, antioxidants, and cardiotonic glycosides, have been shown effective at supporting normal prostate sizeREF#25 and zinc levels.REF#26 These are important to prostate health. #6: Maca's Nutrients Support Hormonal Balance In Men* Now that we understand Maca's benefits for male fertility and libido, let's answer the next big question: does Maca affect testosterone? In the previous section on how Maca benefits male libido, we mentioned a study that found it supported male sex drive without altering serum testosterone levels.REF#27 However, there is also evidence Maca supports the production of an enzyme related to androgen production, which could help increase androstenedione\u2014a testosterone precursor\u2014resulting in increased testosterone production.REF#28 So, does Maca support general hormonal balance in men? Per the studies previously cited, it can benefit men's hormonal balance.* Does Maca affect testosterone? More research is needed for a definitive answer. #7: Maca Supports Focus and Brain Health* Being at the top of your game requires a sharp mind and the ability to focus. High-performers turn to brain-supportive herbs, like Maca, for this reason.* Per research published in the peer-reviewed Toxicology Mechanisms and Methods, the polysaccharides in Maca (long-chain carbohydrates that boost the body's antioxidant levels) protect the brain by enhancing antioxidant levels, thereby reducing oxidative damage.REF#29 Maca is also rich in nutrients that support brain health and development, including:*: - Iron - Iodine - Essential fatty acids - Amino acids Add to this Maca's adaptogenic properties, which help buffer the brain-draining effects of stress, and you've got yourself a promising cognitive supportive ally.* Start Reaping the Benefits of Maca Today If you're interested in trying out Maca for male fertility, libido, energy, and more, it's important to choose a high-quality product.* Unfortunately, the demand for Maca has led to mass growing operations that involve pesticides, herbicides, and non-native cultivation. Experts believe these forced growing practices can negatively affect Maca's phytochemical composition, which degrades its quality, safety, and potency. The good news is you can still find authentic, Peruvian-grown organic Maca products. Here's how: - Look for organic Maca that's third-party certified, such as USDA Organic Certification. - Look for pure Maca or Maca herbal blends that aren't cut with fillers. - Check the labels to ensure it's grown in its native climate. You want \"Peruvian Maca\" vs. Maca grown in China or India, for example. Gaia Herbs offers several high-quality Maca products for men that meet these quality standards, [Male Libido](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/male-libido), [Maca Root](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/maca-root), [Maca recommend experimenting with Maca in the kitchen. Its sweet and nutty flavor complements hot drinks, oatmeal, energy balls, and more while adding a powerful nutritional boost.
