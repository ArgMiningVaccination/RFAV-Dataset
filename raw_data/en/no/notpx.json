Therefore, we aimed to systematically review the adverse events related to the mRNA vaccines reported in the literature. Method: A systematic literature search was carried out in the databases of Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science. We selected original studies that explored the side effects of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines using a two-phase (title/abstract and full-text) screening process. Results: Cardiac complications were the most commonly reported severe adverse events. It appeared that systemic adverse reactions are more common after the second dose of vaccines. The number of adverse effects reported after the Pfizer vaccine was higher than other vaccines, mostly due to its earlier approval and more widespread use throughout the world. Cardiac adverse events had a higher prevalence but no significant association has been found between COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and cardiac adverse events except for myopericarditis. Conclusion: Vaccines play a crucial role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and decreasing mortalities and the results of the present review acknowledge the fact that the benefits outweigh the adverse events of these vaccines. 1. Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that demands enormous measures in order to be controlled. Mass vaccination of the population is critical for containing it; thus, countries all over the world are attempting to vaccinate their people against this disease (1-4). Vaccines operate by stimulating the body's natural immunological response. Immediately after the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus was uncovered, vaccine manufacturers all around the world jumped into action to develop a vaccine (5). Currently available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are produced using one of the following technologies: mRNA-based vaccines, whole virus or inactivated virus vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, and viral vector-based vaccines (6). Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA1273 are the first and only mRNA-based vaccines approved by the World Health Organization so far and have been used in several countries. These vaccines encode a stable full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain, derived from the Wuhan-Hu-1 genetic sequence (7, 8). They are a novel-nucleic acid type of vaccine that employs genomic information such as messenger RNA (mRNA), a method that introduces a portion of the genetic code into human cells (9, 10). Furthermore, the high level of reactogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines is one of their distinguishing features, provoking both local and systemic reactions observed by the majority of patients in Phase 1-3 trials. Additionally, the levels of systemic reactogenicity associated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have generated concerns about a more serious adverse event profile in patients with underlying immunological dysregulation as these patients, who often consume immunosuppressive and biologic medications for immune-mediated inflammatory illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), were mostly exempted from the vaccine trials. Activation of the innate immune system through pattern-recognition receptor ligation, followed by the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1 is often responsible for the vaccine's reactogenicity (11, 12). Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and medication-related incidents could be fatal, likewise, the side effect of vaccines could be catastrophic. If clinical trials are not powered enough to detect the very rare events, these rare but important adverse events may go undetected. Due to variances in age, race, and underlying conditions, the reported rates of adverse effects have been inconsistent across different studies. Even though their safety has been established, concerns of immune-mediated disease flare-ups or new-onset inflammatory diseases following their administration have recently emerged (13-16). The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), co-developed and maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), serves as a national passive surveillance system for continuous monitoring of vaccine safety once it has been distributed in the market (17). The data from VAERS show that the most commonly reported side effects are injection site pain, fever, headache, neck pain, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, diarrhea, dizziness, enlarged lymph nodes, decreased alcohol tolerance, dyspnea, cough, stuffy nose, fainting, thirst, excessive sweating, sore throat, loss of appetite, insomnia, irritability, stupor, photosensitivity, eye pain, numbness in the extremities, and malaise (18-20). Vaccine safety is important to the success of any vaccination effort, particularly during a pandemic. Hence, with the increase in vaccination rates, it is crucial to monitor their adverse events post-vaccination. Raising awareness of associated adverse events (AEs) is crucial for reducing vaccine hesitancy as well as improving the safety of vaccines if necessary (21). Therefore, in this study, we aimed to systematically review the adverse events related to the mRNA vaccines reported in the literature. The findings could present and enhance scientific literacy across the many stakeholders and provide concise and evidence-based soltutions to the COVID-19 vaccine safety concerns. 2. Methods This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic search of relevant records was carried out in the online databases using selected keywords on September 15th, 2021. 2.1. Data sources We carried out a systematic search using the keyword and search queries in online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science. 2.2. Search strategy Search strategies were constructed by two authors of the research team. Search terms were connected in a highly-sensitive syntax via the Boolean operator OR. The search strategy that has been used to retieve the records in each online database was as follows: ((((((COVID-19[Title]) OR (SARS-CoV-2[Title])) OR (SARS-CoV2[Title])) OR (Vaccinated[Title])) (Immunization[Title]))) AND OR (Side effect*[Title])) OR (Adverse event*[Title])) OR (Adverse effect*[Title])) OR (Adverse reaction*[Title])) 2.3. Eligibility criteria Original English articles that reported the adverse events of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were included, applying the following exclusion criteria: 1) Abstracts/conference abstracts or unavailability of full texts 2) Ongoing clinical trials with unpublished results 3) Non-original studies, including review articles, meta-analyses, protocols, and editorials 4) Studies on other types of vaccines rather than mRNA vaccines, or those only reporting efficacy of mRNA vaccines without reporting their adverse events 5) Protocols of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and other original studies 2.4. Selection of studies and Data Screening The EndNote X9 software was used to organize the retrieved articles. Search results from different databases were combined in a single EndNote library and duplicates were removed. Two authors independently screened the retrieved articles in two steps. First, the title and abstract of the retrieved records were screened and the ineligible articles were removed. The full text of the remaining articles was reviewed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and the eligible studies were included in the final qualitative analysis of the results. 2.5. Data Extraction The following data were independently extracted by four researchers: first author, type of study, country of research, manufacturer of the mRNA vaccine, sample population, age, gender, severe adverse events, time from the injection to the appearance of adverse events, and local and systemic adverse events.These findings were organized into a table and were used for qualitative synthesis. Another author (A.K) reviewed the extracted data and addressed any inconsistencies that existed between authors. 2.6. Quality assessment The Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of included studies. This criteria yields a maximum score of nine for questions regarding selection, comparability, and exposure (22). Studies with poor quality assessment scores of four or less were excluded from this systematic review. 3. Results: Our search yielded a total of 1062 studies, and two more records were identified through manual searching. After removing the 547 duplicates, 515 records remained. A total of 171 records were excluded in the title/abstract screenings, and 346 full-text reports were assessed for eligibility (344 from database search, two via manual searching). Finally, 74 studies were found to be eligible for this systematic review (Figure 1).

RCT: randomized controlled trial The mean NOS quality assessment score of the studies was 6.5. No study had a score of four or less and therefore, no study was excluded from this systematic review due to low quality score. The purpose of this study was to review and describe the findings of articles that reported safety and adverse events related to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. We included articles that investigated the adverse effects of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, BNT, and BNT162b1) in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-phase RCTs, cross-sectional, and cohort studies. Adverse reactions In both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines mild to moderate local and systemic adverse reactions were reported. The findings have shown that the incidence of systemic adverse reactions could increase following the second dose. Also, the prevalence of systemic adverse reactions in younger adults (age group of 18-55) was higher in comparison with older adults. Injection site pain and muscle pain were the most common local adverse reactions reported in studies. Also, headache was the most prevalent systemic adverse reaction, followed by fatigue, myalgia, chills, and fever. Other local adverse reactions include tenderness, redness, urticaria, rash and swelling, neck pain, hand numbness, erythema, induration, itching, local loss of hair, and edema. Some other less common systemic adverse reactions were as follows: body aches, gastrointestinal symptoms, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, vertigo, weakness, and visual symptoms (Table 1). It should be noted that adverse reactions and severe adverse events could affect all healthy, pregnant, and immunocompromised vaccine recipients. Severe adverse events (SAE) In this review, severe adverse events were reported and classified into five categories including cardiac, allergic, neurologic adverse events, and adverse events that may occur in pregnant and immunocompromised patients who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. The time interval between inoculation and onset of severe adverse events varied from one hour to 84 days after the injection of the first or second dose. Severe adverse events are reported as follows: -Cardiac Most of the reported severe adverse events were related to cardiac events. A cross-sectional study among 700 participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech reported severe chest pain (0.4%) and acute hypertension (0.3%) after the first vaccine shot (6). A retrospective study among 113 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, who received Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, reported tachycardia and increased blood pressure (0.8%) (23). In a 3rd phase RCT among 14134 participants who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna), the authors reported one case of cardiopulmonary arrest (0.007%) (24). Another study on 884,828 participants who received Pfizer vaccine reported myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24 and risk difference 2.7 events per 100,000 persons) (25). A cross-sectional study on 8275 participants reported one case of acute myocardial infarction (26). Another cross-sectional study on 432 participants who received the Moderna vaccine reported chest pain (1.85%) and syncope (0.93%) (27). Likewise, in another cross-sectional study on 803 participants who had received Pfizer vaccine, chest pain (1.12%) and Syncope (0.12%) were reported as serious adverse events (20). Another cross-sectional study on 190 patients who had received the Pfizer vaccine reported one case of supraventricular tachycardia (1%) and one case of decompensated heart failure (1%) (28). In a 2nd phase RCT on 43,448 participants, 21720 of whom received BNT162b2 vaccine, one case of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (0.004%) was reported (29). -Pregnancy Among studies included in our review, two studies were conducted on pregnant women who had received mRNA vaccine during their pregnancy, and one study on 35691 pregnant women reported possible serious adverse effects as follows: spontaneous abortion (46 cases; 37 in the first trimester, 2 in the second trimester, and 7 in which the trimester was unknown or not reported), stillbirth, premature rupture of membrane, and vaginal bleeding with 3 reports for each, and no congenital anomalies were documented (30). In another study on pregnant women, the rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes among 133 women who received at least 1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy were similar to that of unvaccinated pregnant women regarding stillbirth (0.0% vs 0.2%), for gestational age (12.0% vs 12.8%), maternal high-dependency unit or intensive care admission (6.0% vs 4.0%), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (5.3% vs 5.0%). In addition, three fetal abnormalities, including spina bifida, ventriculomegaly, and hydronephrosis, were reported. The spina bifida case was diagnosed before the pregnant woman received the first dose of the vaccine. The ventriculomegaly case was diagnosed at 37 weeks gestation and was isolated, with no associated brain abnormalities, as confirmed by fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging. The hydronephrosis was mild, with no associated abnormality at birth (31). -Allergic Some studies reported rare allergic adverse events such as swelling of eyelids, severe allergic reaction of eyelids, anaphylactoid reactions, and Angioedema (9, 24, 27, 32, 33). In a cross-sectional study conducted on 700 participants who received Pfizer vaccine, two cases with swelling and severe allergic reaction of eyelids were reported (1). In a similar cross-sectional study on 432 participants who received Moderna vaccine, swelling in the mouth or throat (0.46), asthma exacerbation (0.46%), swelling of lips (0.23%), and anaphylaxis (0.23%) were observed (27). Also, in the 3rd phase RCT among 14,134 white and black USA residents who received Moderna, hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 1.5% of participants (24, 27). Two cross-sectional studies reported allergic reactions in 2.2% (15 out of 688) of participants and two cases of Angioedema (0.4%) (2 out of 474) within 48 hours of vaccine injection, respectively (34, 35). Between December 14, 2020, and January 18, 2021, based on CDC reports, after vaccination with 9,943,247 Pfizer-BioNTech doses and 7,581,429 Moderna doses in the US (CDC unpublished data, February 2021), the risk of anaphylaxis was 4.7 cases/per-million-dose for Pfizer-BioNTech, and 2.5 cases/per-million-dose for Moderna vaccine. Overall, since late January 2021, CDC reported 66 cases of anaphylaxis, including 47 cases after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 19 cases after the Moderna vaccine. All these 66 persons were treated in health care settings. The median time to event was 6 minutes (range, <1-45 minutes). Almost all cases recovered in the follow-up and no deaths from anaphylaxis after vaccination with either product were reported (36). In another cross-sectional study, the authors investigated the adverse effects of 578,835 doses of the mRNA-based vaccines in the Japanese population, 733 Adverse Event Following Immunization or AEFIs (85 males [12%], 647 females [88%], 1 unknown [< 1%]) were reported. Among these, there were 181 (first dose: 177; second dose: 3; unknown: 1) suspected anaphylaxis reports, resulting in a reporting rate of 31.3/100,000 doses. In 171 of 181 cases, women developed suspected anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid symptoms within 5min or >30 min of injection (33). - Neurologic In total, 10 studies reported adverse neurologic events among healthy patients and patients with prior neurologic diseases. These adverse events were Bell's palsy, herpes zoster, ischemic stroke, new or worsening neurological symptoms (muscle weakness, walking difficulty, gait instability, visual problems, pain, sensory disturbances, and sphincteric problems) among patients with underlying neurological diseases, Guillain-Barre syndrome, seizure, loss of consciousness, fainting, syncope, leg who received Moderna reported three cases of Bell's palsy in both the vaccine group (<0.1%) and placebo group (<0.1%) (24). In addition, one case of Bell's palsy was reported 11 days after the 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine in a cross-sectional study. The unadjusted 15-day rate of adverse events per 100,000 residents following the first dose of vaccine was the same in both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups for Bell's palsy (26). Herpes zoster was observed at the rate of 15.8 events per 100,000 persons among 884,828 who received the Pfizer vaccine (25). Other neurological symptoms were as follows: 73 participants (16.7%) who had a history of rare neuro-immunological disorders reported new or worsening neurological symptoms following Pfizer and Moderna vaccination (37), 36 participants (15.1%) with Multiple Sclerosis who received Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine reported new or worsening neurological symptoms (muscle weakness, walking difficulty, gait instability, visual problems, pain, sensory disturbances and sphincteric problems) (41), Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) was seen in a healthy male 4 days after the second dose of Moderna (39), there was one case of the seizure (0.23%) after receiving Moderna vaccine (27), food intolerance (0.25%), loss of consciousness or fainting (0.25%), seizures (0.12%), and syncope (0.12%) among 803 participants who had received Pfizer (20), and one case of leg paresthesia in a 2nd-phase RCT of Pfizer vaccine (29). In addition, a cohort study on 704,003 participants who received Pfizer vaccine reported 33 (0.005%) serious adverse events, 17 of which (51.5%) were neurologic (2.4/100,000 doses) in the first 30 days after vaccination, however, no death was reported due to the complications. Among those 17 patients, seven cases had seizures (0.99/100,000 doses); four mentioned functional syndromes (0.56/100,000 doses); three had with acute transverse myelitis (0.28/100,000 one case was radiculopathy exacerbation (0.14/100,000 doses) (40). - Immunocompromised patients A retrospective study on 113 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients who received Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine reported one case of axillary lymphadenopathy, one case of increased blood pressure, and tachycardia. In addition, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and eosinophilia were observed in 13.3%, 11.5%, 8.8%, 4.4% of vaccine recipients 20.5, 34, 19.5, and 28 days after vaccination. In addition, they reported new chronic Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (9.7%) or worsening chronic GVHD (3.5%) 3 to 48 days after vaccination. Also, two patients experienced both new and worsening GVHD symptoms. One patient with a previous history of chronic GVHD was hospitalized (23). Another study on 80 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients or CD19-based chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy patients who received Pfizer vaccine reported cytopenia (12% of the patients after the 1st dose and 10% of the patients after the 2nd dose), graft-versus-host disease exacerbation (4.5%), and a single case of impending graft rejection as possible vaccination adverse effects within 1st week of injection (42). One cohort study on 741 solid organ transplant recipients who received Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, reported one case of acute rejection after the 2nd dose, and infection (3% after 1st dose and <0.01% after 2nd dose) within 7 days post-vaccination. Lao, in a cohort study that was conducted on 151 cancer patients and 54 healthy patients who received Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, reported only one case of deranged liver function test 3 weeks after the 1st dose in the control group (43). In a study of 373 cancer patients who received Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, eight patients reported severe adverse events and venous thromboembolism (VTE) (0.3%) within seven days after vaccination (44). 4. Discussion In this review, we synthesized the safety data and side effects of COVID-19 vaccines from 72 published articles. It appeared that the adverse reactions were often mild to moderate with few serious adverse events. At least one case of serious adverse events was reported in 30 articles. Most studies had investigated the adverse events after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, while few studies had studied Moderna (mRNA-1273) or both mRNA vaccines' adverse effects. The number of adverse effects reported after the Pfizer vaccine was higher, but this was mostly due to its earlier approval and more widespread uptake across the world. The reported severe adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines were more frequently related to allergic events, neurological events, and cardiovascular implications including chest pain, myocardial infarction, acute hypertension, tachycardia, myocarditis, syncope, supraventricular tachycardia, decompensated heart failure, and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. The majority of vaccine recipients reported at least one local or systematic side effect after inoculation with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Albeit, all reported side effects were minor and had a short duration. Local and systemic adverse reactions were found to be more prevalent after the second dose. Common adverse reactions were injection site pain, headache, muscle pain, myalgia, chills, and fever. The systemic adverse reactions had moderate intensity in the young age group in comparison with those who were 65 years old or older. The majority of adverse reactions like fatigue, joint pain, muscle pain, and headache were reported by the younger age group (18-55 years) and obviously, less reported by the older adults. These findings are in line with findings of a similar study that assessed 11 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines (45). Ten studies in this review reported possible cardiac adverse effects. In those who received Pfizer vaccine, severe chest pain, acute hypertension, tachycardia, myocarditis, syncope, supraventricular tachycardia, decompensated heart failure, and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia were reported. On the other hand, increased blood pressure, tachycardia, cardiopulmonary arrest, chest pain, and syncope were reported in Moderna receivers. In addition, acute myocardial infarction was documented after mRNA vaccine inoculation. No significant association has been found between COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and cardiac adverse events mentioned above, except for myopericarditis. The findings of a systematic review conducted to investigate the safety and adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines among children and adolescents were in line with our findings; 27 cases of approved myocarditis or pericarditis were found in 7 assessed studies (including one RCT, two case series, and four case reports), all of which occurred after the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine. This systematic study's findings show an incidence rate of 0.008% for myopericarditis in adolescents aged 16 to 17 years old and also 0.01% in adolescents aged 12 through 15 years following the second dose (25, 46). In another study, 16 cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis were reported after injection of both types of mRNA vaccines. These severe cardiac adverse effects occurred after the first vaccine dose in six cases (35%), after the second dose in ten cases (59%), and after both doses in one case (6%). The median time to event was 14 days (range 1-28) after the first vaccination and 3 days (range 1-17) after the second shot (47). Similar findings were reported in a systematic review that investigated the cardiac adverse outcomes after COVID-19 vaccine injection. In total, 42 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 35 myocarditis cases were reported after COVID-19 vaccination and 41 (98%) and 31 (89%) of these cases had been vaccinated by mRNA vaccines, respectively. The majority were men, and myocarditis cases were younger than AMI patients. Myocarditis was observed after an average of 3 days after vaccination, while AMI mostly occurred after an average of 1 day. Thirty-five (83%) myocarditis and six (33%) AMI patients developed symptoms after their second dose. The majority of the myocarditis (83%) and AMI patients (86%) had received the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. The remaining patients with myocarditis received the Moderna (14%) and Janssen vaccine (2%) vaccines, while AMI patients had received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (11%) and Moderna vaccine (3%) (48). These findings were consistent with our study indicating a strong possibility of myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24; [CI95% 1.55 12.44]) after BNT162b vaccination; however, this risk was significantly lower in comparison with myocarditis after SARS-COV-2 infection, which is 18.28 (95% confidence interval [CI95% 3.95-25.12]) (25). In addition, some included studies in our review had reported cases of severe chest pain and acute myocardial infarction. It seems that the rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes is no different between vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women and no association between mRNA vaccines and pregnancy outcomes was found. This finding was consistent with the findings of other systematic reviews, which were conducted on pregnant women who received either of the mRNA vaccines. No increased risk of adverse obstetrical or neonatal outcomes was reported and the proportion of infant outcomes reported, including spontaneous abortions, stillbirth, induced abortion ectopic pregnancy, and spontaneous abortions, were similar to non-vaccinated pregnant women. Also, safety data indicated that pregnant and lactating populations experienced vaccine-related reactions at similar rates to the general population (49, 50). The findings of included studies showed that those who have received the Pfizer vaccine are more likely to have allergic reactions than those who received Moderna vaccine. A systematic review including 26 articles, involving 26,337,421 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine recipients (14,505,399 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and 11,831,488 doses of Moderna) reported similar results. This study reported that vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine resulted in higher rate of anaphylactic reactions compared to Moderna vaccine (9.31/per-million-dose and 3.42/per-million-dose). This study also reports a lower incidence of non-anaphylactic reactions with Pfizer compared to Moderna (75.27/per-million-doses, versus 99.01/per-million-doses administered) (51). In another systematic review and meta-analysis, which investigated the risk of allergic and severe adverse events, the incidence rate of anaphylaxis was reported as 7.91/per-million-cases (among 41,000,000 patients) (52). The post-COVID-19 vaccination neurological adverse events are relatively rare and the causal association between neurological symptoms and vaccination is uncertain. Bell's palsy was reported as one of the neurological adverse events in two assessed studies (26, 53). However, no significant differences in Bell's palsy incidence were reported between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. A review has also acknowledged that most Bell's palsy cases were associated with mRNA vaccines. No difference was found between clinical features of vaccine-associated Bell's palsy and conventional types and the pathogenesis remains unclear (54). In addition, some neurological adverse events including Guillain-Barre syndrome, herpes zoster, seizure, loss of consciousness or fainting, syncope, leg paresthesia, and acute transverse were reported; the causal association of adverse events and vaccination or coincidence of them must be carefully assessed. Most of the COVID-19 vaccine randomized trials have excluded those with immunocompromised conditions, so there is limited data available about adverse events in individuals with autoimmune disease and cancer. However, in transplant recipients, graft-versus-host disease exacerbation, and impeding graft rejection were reported as possible vaccination adverse events. No significant difference was reported between severe complications in cancer patients and healthy patients, as the control group, who received Pfizer or Moderna vaccines (43, 44). The adverse events of vaccination should continuously be monitored to identify any new issues in the safety of vaccines, which require investigations. In other words, while assessing the safety of vaccines, any unexpected or unusual patterns in vaccinated individuals, which have a higher rate than the general population should be considered. In this study, the most commonly reported serious adverse events were cardiac events, additional studies are recommended to investigate the association between vaccination and cardiac complications. Also, in order to collect data on the clinical, cardiological, neurological, and immunological profile of the COVID-19 vaccinated population, cohort studies could further assess the frequency of adverse events in the general population. 5. Conclusion: Some severe adverse events were observed among the recipients of mRNA vaccines, but a direct relationship between the vaccines and adverse events was not yet clearly established for the adverse events, except for myopericarditis. The rate of severe adverse effects was low and obviously, the benefits of receiving vaccines in preventing severe COVID-19 and death outweigh the possible rare adverse events of the COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, the healthcare officials should enlighten the people on the safety of the vaccines, in this case mRNA vaccines, to avoid further hesitations in COVID-19 vaccination, which may endanger the lives of people and pose a huge burden on the healthcare system. 6.
