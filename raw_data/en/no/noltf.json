This liquid vit c tastes so good that its hard to just take the recommend dose. Its also liposomal so your body digests it so much better. I love it! Phylp As an RN working in the pandemic I am so glad to find such a wonderful products! I recently watched a scientific lecture on the benefits of increasing vitamin c. Apparently vitamin c is good for skin benefits, teeth benefits, heart, immunity benefits and iron absorption. I feel MaryRuth's Liposomal vitamin c will not only increase my vitamin c intake but liposomal means vitamin c will be readily absorbed by my body. This makes me feel confident that my vitamin c will be efficiently used by my body and not flushed out, as I remember hearing that vitamin supplements can be discarded and not absorbed properly. I like ordering directly from MaryRuth's. The website is clear and easy to order from. Liposomal vitamin c bottles fit neatly on my refrigerator door shelves. I just grab the bottle out of my fridge, easily squeeze it-as it squirts in my mouth, close the cap and pop it back into my fridge. This company is so wonderful. I contacted them in regards to an expired product bought third party that left a bad taste in my mouth (literally!) and they sent me a replacement. I am happy to announce this is aiding in warding off the back to school germs for both me and my toddler. Cannot recommend this product or company enough! I also use several other of their products and have seen helpful impact both in person and in my blood work. Give them a try! This has a pretty good taste and is super easy to take. I take whenever I feel a cold coming on or if I'm already feeling bad and I swear it helps. I tend to pair it w Earthlys feel better faster and they both work wonders!
