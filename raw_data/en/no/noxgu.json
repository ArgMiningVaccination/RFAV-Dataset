The aim of the study is to improve the length of time that an infusion set can be worn by infusing hyaluronidase directly into the insulin infusion site. Investigator - High Dose Steroid Therapy to Treat Flares in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) This study will examine whether delivery of high dose steroids, directly into the inflamed bowel via its arterial blood supply, will be better for treating uncontrolled flares of inflammatory bowel disease in patients compared to conventional intra-venous or oral administration of this drug. Patients aged 4-25 years of age will be recruited. In this study, we hope to also learn how this directed steroid delivery during an active flare will improve patient symptoms as well as the appearance of inflamed segments of bowel determined by imaging or biopsy (i.e. at the time of endoscopy). Additional data will determine how the blood vessels in the bowel affect, and potentially even drive the mechanisms, of inflammatory bowel disease. Investigator - Identifying Markers of Exercise Training in Heart Failure The heart failure syndrome that occurs when the heart is too sick to properly do its job. One of the main symptoms is difficulty with exercise. One way to improve symptoms is to start patients in a 12 week exercise program called cardiac rehabilitation. Cardiac rehabilitation been shown to improve symptoms for heart failure patients. However, we do not know exactly what exercise does to the molecules that make up the human body. If we could answer this question, we might find a whole new way to treat the symptoms of heart failure. Therefore we want to know what molecules might be responsible for the benefits of exercise. The plan for this study is to measure the levels of thousands of proteins in blood samples which come from people with heart failure and see how those levels change after 12 weeks of cardiac rehabilitation, compared to the protein levels in patients whose cardiac rehabilitation is delayed until after the study period. If we know the proteins that change with exercise, we can then look to see if targeting these proteins with medicines can mimic the benefits of exercise. The long term goal of our work is to identify \"exercise-in-a-pill\" medicines that will help people with heart failure. Investigator - Haploid Allogeneic Transplant Using the CliniMACS System To assess the proportion of patients with donor neutrophil engraftment within 30 days of allogeneic transplant. To assess the incidence of acute GvHD during the first 100 days after transplantation. Investigators - Intranasal Vasopressin Treatment in Children With Autism The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the effectiveness of vasopressin nasal spray for treating symptoms associated with autism. Vasopressin is a hormone that is produced naturally within the body and has been implicated in regulating social behaviors. It has been proposed that administration of the hormone may also help improve social functioning in individuals with autism. Investigators - Long-term Study in US Cystic Fibrosis Patients Receiving Digestive Enzyme Supplements to Assess Narrowing of the Large Intestine Causing Adverse Intestinal Symptoms (Fibrosing Colonopathy) This is a long-term study in cystic fibrosis patients who are participating in the Cystic Fibrosis Patient Registry to assess the occurrence and risk factors for a rare bowel disorder called fibrosing colonopathy (narrowing of the large intestine). Patients will be followed at their regular clinical care visits over a 10-year period and approached if they develop symptoms of fibrosing colonopathy for collection and use of further detailed information. Investigators - Multiomic Signatures of Microbial Metabolites Following Prebiotic Fiber Supplementation The investigators propose a comprehensive, multiomic study that will integrate longitudinal data associating changes in specific gut bacteria and host in response to prebiotic fiber supplementation. These data will guide the development of an integrative biological signature relating bacterial-derived metabolites with biological outcome in the host. The open sharing of data generated by the proposed research represents a significant public resource that will support and accelerate future novel studies. Investigator - GSK1572932A Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic as Adjuvant Therapy in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The purpose of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the benefit of the immunotherapeutic product GSK1572932A when given to patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, after removal of their tumor. A course of 13 injections will be administered over 27 months. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007. Investigator - Lymphedema Prophylaxis in Breast Cancer Survivors Who Show Early Evidence of High-risk Status To compare the effectiveness of usual treatments for lymphedema [massage and elastic compression sleeve, instituted at-risk and before the development of swelling (lymphedema)], compared to the use of a newly-marketed device, the Flexitouch, which electronically simulates the effect of massage upon lymph flow. Investigator - Full Day and Night Closed-Loop With DiAs Platform The overall aim of this proposed research is to determine the safety, feasibility and efficacy of the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) controller in day and night closed-loop control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes over multiple days in a diabetes camp setting. This will be addressed in two parts: 1) An in residence, outpatient study to determine safety and feasibility of the DiAs during 72 continuous hours of day and night glucose control; and 2) Camp studies planned for the summer of 2014 with randomization to either full closed-loop or sensor-augmented pump therapy over the duration of 6-7 day diabetes camps. Investigator - HEAL-IST IDE Trial Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia (IST) is a prevalent and debilitating condition in otherwise healthy younger patients, resulting in significant loss of quality of life, lacking effective treatment options or systematic clinical evidence to support a therapy. The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a hybrid sinus node sparing ablation procedure for the treatment of symptomatic drug refractory or drug intolerant IST. Investigator - HDR Brachytherapy 68-Ga-RM2 PET, 68-Ga-PSMA-11 PET &Multi Parametric MRI in Prostate Cancer This study is being conducted to determine whether the combination of imaging agents 68-Ga RM2 and 68-Ga PMSA11 is better at assessing response to high dose rate (HDR) local therapy than standard imaging or biopsy in patients with known prostate cancer (PC) Investigator - Measured Hypocretin Levels and Recovery After Hip Surgery A specific group of neurons in the brain produces hypocretin, a peptide which has been established as an important regulator of sleep and wakefulness. Activation of these neurons (increased hypocretin) stabilizes wakefulness; impairing or blocking these neurons (decreased hypocretin) promotes sleep. Evidence suggests that these neurons may be involved in the hypnotic properties of several anesthetics, and play a role in the induction and emergence from anesthesia. In humans there is a considerable inter-individual variability in hypocretin levels. This study aims to investigate how hypocretin levels affect the anesthetic care and recovery of patients undergoing elective hip surgery. Investigator - Light Flashes to Treat Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD) Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD) is a sleep disruption that commonly occurs in teens and manifests as a difficulty in waking up in the morning, going to sleep early enough at night, and daytime disturbances such as depression, fatigue, and restlessness. The purpose of this study is to determine if brief flashes of light, that are scheduled to occur during sleep, are effective in treating DSPD. Investigator - Improving the Diagnosis of Common Variable Immune Deficiency This is an observational, case-control study with a single blood draw among two cohorts, patients with antibody deficiency (e.g., CVID) and healthy controls. Samples will be analyzed by mass cytometry (CyTOF) to examine the major signaling pathways of all circulating innate and adaptive immune cell types, as well as whole exome sequencing. The goal is to improve our general understanding of the human immune response to infections and the diagnosis of CVID. - Glycan Mediated Immune Regulation With a Bi-Sialidase Fusion Protein (GLIMMER-01) This is a Phase 1/2, first-in-human, open-label, dose escalation and dose-expansion study of E-602, administered alone and in combination with cemiplimab. Investigator - Feasibility of a Mobile Medication Plan Application in CF Patient Care This is a pilot, multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study to evaluate the feasibility of an innovative medication adherence intervention utilizing a web-based, mobile medication management application [MedActionPlan\u00ae (MAP)] to encourage self-management by reinforcing adherence and education about treatment regimens in Participants with cystic fibrosis (CF) (ages 12 years and older). Outcomes of interest for this study are 1) feasibility of MAP in real-world setting which will be evaluated using patient/caregiver and clinician feedback regarding value, ease of use, and challenges with use, 2) effect of MAP on patient/caregiver knowledge and perception of medication use, 3) effect of MAP on adherence to inhaled and oral medications used in chronic management of CF. Preliminary data regarding outcomes on exacerbations, lung function, and health care system utilization (e.g., emergency department visits, hospitalization) will also be examined as part of this study. Investigators - Harnessing Mobile Technology to Reduce Mental Health Disorders in College Populations The prevalence of mental health problems among college populations has risen steadily in recent decades, with one third of today's students struggling with anxiety, depression, or an eating disorder (ED). Yet, only 20-40% of college students with mental disorders receive treatment. Inadequacies in mental health care delivery result in prolonged illness, disease progression, poorer prognosis, and greater likelihood of relapse, highlighting the need for a new approach for detecting mental health problems and engaging college students in services. The investigators have developed a transdiagnostic, low-cost mobile health targeted prevention and intervention platform that uses population-level screening for engaging college students in tailored services that address common mental health problems. This care delivery system represents an ideal model given its use of evidence-based mobile programs, a transdiagnostic approach that addresses comorbid mental health issues, and personalized screening and intervention to increase service uptake, enhance engagement, and improve outcomes. Further, this service delivery model harnesses the expertise of an interdisciplinary team of behavioral scientists, college student mental health scholars, technology researchers, and health economists. This work bridges the study team's collective leadership over the past 25 years in successfully implementing a population-based screening program in more than 160 colleges and demonstrating the effectiveness of Internet-based programs for targeted prevention and intervention for anxiety, depression, and EDs. Through this study, Investigators will test the impact of this mobile mental health platform for service delivery in a large-scale trial across a diverse range of U.S. colleges. Students who screen positive or at high-risk for clinical anxiety, depression, or EDs (excluding anorexia nervosa, for which more intensive medical monitoring is warranted) and who are not currently engaged in mental health services will be randomly assigned to: 1) intervention via the mobile mental health platform; or 2) referral to usual care (i.e., campus health or counseling center). Participants in the study will be enrolled for 2 years and asked to complete surveys at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years. Investigator - Genetic and Demographic Factors That Influence the Pain and Progress of Labor The purpose of this study is to try to understand why the experience of labor differs among women. The investigators want to understand why some women have longer or shorter labors and why the amount of pain women experience is different. The investigators hope to be able to consider women more individually in terms of their pain and progress of labor. Investigators - Gut Decontamination In Pediatric Allogeneic Hematopoietic This research study is for participants who are undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and are at risk for developing acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a complication of HSCT in which immune cells from the donor cause inflammation and injury to tissues and organs of the HSCT recipient. Vancomycin-polymyxin B (commonly called \"vancopoly\") is an oral antibiotic that is given to people undergoing allogeneic HSCT as a preventive measure for acute GVHD. This research study is studying the effects of vancopoly on the microorganisms living in the intestine during and after stem cell transplantation. "}
