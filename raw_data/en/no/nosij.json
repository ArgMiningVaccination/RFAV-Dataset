These are vaccinations administered up to the end of October 2012 since the beginning of the programme, 1st September 2012. The data are broken down by England, Strategic Health Authority (SHA) and P rimary Care Trust (PCT). This information is supplied by each PCT and is submitted monthly using the Department of Heal th's ImmForm website. These data are subject to change; data from the monthly vaccine uptake collections should be considered provisiona l. The denominators for Cohort 10 are based on school roll data supplied by the Department for Education. Therefore, the vaccine uptake rates should be regarded as indicative. Annual coverage data will be collected in September 2013. It is the annual surv ey that will provide the formal uptake figures and will be subsequently published as final data. "}
