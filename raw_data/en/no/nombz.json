Greetings! On behalf of the Kinesiology Department Graduate P rogram , I welcome you! This Handbook will give you, a graduate student in the Kines. Dept., some information to facilitate your graduate study. This Handbook highlights info from general University sources , but it also addresses some Kinesiology specifics . We hope you will skim it early in your studies and will continue to refer to it throughout your degree program. We do not intent for you to feel \"weighed down\" by it, though. If you are looking for an answer but do not conveniently finding it here, please ask somebody . The Handbook also cannot - and we do n ot intend for it - to replace thoughtful individual planning and continuous personal communication about your specific circumstances. We intend the Handbook as a summary . It is a primer, not a primary source. On its own, the Handbook creates no policy . It will no t supersede policy statements in most other sources. Conflicts would likely be resolved in favor of those other sources. At any time, if you are uncertain about something after checking the Handbook, especially if that uncertainty appeared to be a policy conflict, please feel free to consult a Kinesiology Graduate Program member directly . Whom can you consult? If you are a research -based graduate student (thesis/ dissertation), then your graduate faculty advisor will always be an excellent resource for any questions or concerns related to your graduate studies . Please actively seek and maintain frequent and open interaction with your advisor. It is primarily up to you and your advisor, working together closely, to design a sequence of courses to satisf y all degree requirements of the Department and The Graduate School. Some specializations (tracks) in Kinesiology prescribe much of their curriculum, but even those tracks will require electives &/or research that must be carefully and individually planned. If you are a non- thesis master's student , then I am yo ur faculty advisor, and you may direct your academic questions to me or direct your procedural questions to the graduate secretary . Our contact information follows in this Handbook. If you are an OT student (Occupational Therapy), then this Handbook is not your best resource. We refer you instead to https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/ot/academics/msot/ , and click the OT handbook, or consult the OT Program Office (contacts listed on next page). We are pleased you have chosen the University of Wisconsin for graduate education . We are especially pleased that you ha ve made the Kinesiology Department your graduate study home. We want to make your experience with us a rewarding one. Let us know if we can help! Andrea H. Mason Professor (Motor Control & Behavior ) Chair of the Kinesiology Graduate Studies Committee https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/staff/mason -ph-d-andrea/ Page | 17 Section 2, How to Contact Department Representatives The \"people\" page of the Kinesiology web site, https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/people/ , has Dept. contact -info & pictures.

Some Kinesiology -specific What -to-Do's follow to supplement the general UW checklist just linked. Use this Handbook judiciously, recall that policies can change, and links can \"die.\" The UW -Madison and Kinesiology Department homepages, like many web sites, are works -in-progress, subject to continuous improvement. This Handbook relies heavily on web links to transmit information. We try to keep links up -to-date, but if a link is \"dead,\" you might need to word- search it. You are always free to consult a grad program representative. Orientation - academic & personal The Kines . Dept . offer s a brief , general grad orientation late in the summer prior to a new academic year. Newly admitted grad students are notified by e-mail of the time and place of the orientation . We will communicate info on other orientation options (School of Education, Grad School) as received. The Kines. Dept. orientation is optional. An informal social gathering for grad faculty and grad students has become a Department tradition, and it is a buffet dinner at a faculty member's home . We hold it the second or third (or fourth) Friday of the Fall semester . Details go out each year (an \"evite\") . While also optional , we hope the dinner is a chance to form or expand relationships with your fellow students and with current or potential professors . These groups likely have share d interest s with you. Often the best way to orient yourself to a task is to interact with others who do or recently did that task, so we sincerely encourage you to get to know your fellow grad students, both at and away from Department sponsored opportunities. Kinesiology Cohesion Committee A great way to get to know fellow students is in the Kinesiology Cohesion Committee. In the mid-2000's, several Kines grad students thought up the idea for informal social student networking. Their Cohesion Committee gave an identity to the idea. Past activities have included sledding, Frisbee, soccer, and outings at local eateries. The Committee usually communicates via e-mail beginning early in the Fall semester . If you do not get a Cohesion e-mail, ask an experienced student about joining, or contact the Kines grad secretary. Activate Your Net ID UW handles much o f its administrative communication via \"the web\" (internet). To effectively access the web, you will need your NetID and password so you can use the \"My-UW\" portal at my.wisc.edu. For detail and step-by-step instructions on how to activate your NetID , click the \"checklist\" link, top of this page. The NetID you create and password you enter are keys to your access to the MyUW portal, so make a record of them and keep them private. If you are unsure about your NetID and password, contact the DoIT Help Desk at (608) 264-HELP (4357). Or try online at the Knowledge Base, http://kb.wisc.edu , or http://helpdesk.wisc.edu . (DoIT is the Division of Information Technology - - the computer experts (& so much more) - - at UW-Madison.) Enroll For Classes Research grad students: Consult your faculty advisor to be sure you both fully agree about each semester's class choices, especially any electives that aren't specified on the curriculum web page s for your specialization, https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/academics/grad -program/ Non -thesis grad students: Consult the Grad Studies chair &/or the Kines. web site The web site is here, https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/academics/grad -program/ , for your required Non-thesis curriculum. Within the framework we provide, you should \"build -your-own\" MS degree to serve your personal goals. The Grad Studies Committee chair is Prof. Andrea Mason, https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/staff/mason -ph-d-andrea/ Non -thesis electives are your choice . Use them in your long- term best interest. If you have already taken any of the non-thesis MS curriculum requirements or their equivalent , and if you document that, then you will not need to re -take the course. There might be a \"substitution\" process, and that might involve an approach to the Graduate Studies Committee. See section 5 of this Handbook on \"substitutions.\" Be aware , also, that a graduate degree requires minimum credits , click https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/ and scroll to \"minimum.\" If you will depart from the prescribe d curriculum, or if you have doubts or questions about your curriculum , consult a grad program representative. Page | 20 Brief graduate course descriptions are in the Graduate Guide , formerly the Graduate School Catalog . This is available on-line at: http://guide.wisc.edu/graduate/ The UW homepage, like many web sites, is a work -in-progress, subject to continuous improvement , so you might need to word -search the Graduate Guide at http://www.wisc.edu/ . A possible need to search for revised/ updated links probably pertains to many of the links in this Handbook. You are also always free to ask a grad program representative. The \"Guide ,\" including the \"Course Guide,\" has UW's online listing of classes available . As of August 2017, the UW Office of the Registrar and others are consolidating online information to serve student needs better. See e.g. http://guide.wisc.edu/ . You will likely find a use for many of the Guide comp onents. For your initial enrollment, particularly for any elective you may have to or wish to select, the Course Guide might be especially important. S ee https://registrar.wisc.edu/course_guide.ht m - or - http://registrar.wisc.edu/schedule_of_classes.htm - or - https://public.my.wisc.edu/portal/f/u124l1s4/p/CourseGuide -Browse - Courses.u124l1n31/max/render.uP?pCp Pay Your Tuition/ Fees All students should expect to face some study charges . These usually have payment deadlines. With limited exceptions, even if you are a Department -supported student (on an \"assistantship\" or a \"fellowship\" with tuition remission) , you are likely to remain personally responsible for paying \"segregated fees,\" usually known as \"seg fees,\" compare e.g. https://registrar.wisc.edu/segregated_fees_information.htm Be sure to pay on time for anything you owe , including \" Seg Fees\" (& any other charges you may owe). If you miss a timely payment , monetary penalties or academic/ administra tive holds may result. The exact distribution of payment responsibility (between student, Department, and institution) is a subject of \"statute\" (State Legislative involvement ), UW-Madison rules , and (sometimes) contract negotiation. Check your Student Center for what you owe , once bills have been posted. The billing office(s) should e-mail you a notice of billing. Students can make a tuition ePayment using an Electronic Check or a credit card. Click the [View eBill/Make ePayment] link on your Student Center Finances, and then click the yellow button that links to the Tuition eBill/ ePayment Site. See, e.g. http://www.bussvc.wisc.edu/bursar/tuiteck.html Caveat Emptor: Buyer Beware! This Handbook mention s bills, charges, costs, or \"seg fees\" with the goal of calling your attention to the need to be aware . The Department Payroll representative or HR/ Personnel representative should be able to clarify if you are unsure from your Student Center about what you need to pay. Otherwise, check with the UW Bursar's Office, http://www.bussvc.wisc.edu/bursar/bursar.html , or ask a grad program representative. Locate / Notate/ Use Your WiscM ail E-Mail Account UW will assign you a student e-mail account. It will likely be some version of your name plus an \"extension\" of \"wisc.edu\". This account (or address) is your \"WiscMail, \" so-called, and it is important because: UW offic es will ex pect you to check it regularly . This likely includes the Grad School, the Bursar, and the Registrar , all of them \"major players\" in your study career . The Kinesiology Dept. definitely uses e -mail frequently to announce Seminars, preview fire drills, share course or training announcements, and the like. If you don't check your WiscMail, or if you forward it to a private account (gmail, hotmail, yahoo, etc.) and if that \"third party\" drops, spam -filters, or otherwise diverts your UW \"wiscmail\" message(s), you would still be accountable for the message content , e.g. fees due with penalty charges if late. It seems as if \"everybody must\" use e-mail nowadays, but if you are not already in the habit of checking e-mail regularly, it makes sense to develop that habit with your @wisc.edu account. It is a major communication tool within the Kines grad program and beyond. Verify Your Mailing Address & Phone Number; Update as Appropriate Please check your MyUW portal online and verify that your contact information is correct. Update the information if it changes, e.g. local mailing address if you move . This is where many UW offices will get your contact information , e.g. mailing address, if they ever need it. Although there seem s to be a trend away from traditional U.S. Postal Service mail, some items still go out that way. Page | 21 Section 4, General Information for Kinesiology Graduate Students Organizational Overview The University of Wisconsin -Madison is part of the UW System, a (partially) state-supported \"land grant\" institution. UW-Madison includes multiple schools or colleges , for e xample , the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the School of Medicine and Public Health. The Kinesiology Department is within the UW School of Education. For grad students, the Graduate School, which is also a part of the administrative structure at UW-Madison, exerts a strong influence on how we manage grad study and grant grad degrees. When Kinesiology admitted you, the admission was to the Graduate School, with Graduate School review and approval. The Grad School will continue to exercise review and approval of various \"milestones\" during your grad studies. At the very least, it will b e involved in the \"conferral\" (granting, awarding) of your degree. This Handbook details those milestones. Within the Kines Dept . are several programs, among them Undergrad, Occupational Therapy, and Graduate. The Graduate Program include s several special izations or tracks, among them Biomechanics (including an element of Athletic Training) , Exercise Physiology, Exercise Psychology, Motor Control & Behavior, Physical Activity Epidemiology, and Occupational Science (formerly Therapeutic Science) . Faculty feel t his is consistent with the structure of peer institutions, but despite \"specialization ,\" there is strong interest in unifying the parts into a cohesive whole . Interdisciplinary research, within the Department and between or among outside departments (or other schools, colleges or institutions) , is of growing interest. If you see an opportunity for interdisciplinary pursuit, please do yourself and everyone else a favor, and bring it to the attention of your advisor or the Graduate Studies Committee. Normally the details of UW-Madison's \"inner workings\" will be largely \"invisible \" to an individual grad student (routine and virtually \"automatic\" in the student 's study career ). General Rules A large, complex , diverse campus like UW-Madison historically develops many rules, and these evolve continuously. It would be difficult to do justice to all potentially relevant policies in a handbook of reasonable length, and this Handbook does not purport to tell you everything. The hope is that most students will have little need to become expressly familiar with most rules most of the time. We try to offer a reasonable \"most of the people, most of the time\" summary in this Handbook. In combination with advisor input, and with strategic questioning by the student, we expect a satisfactory outcome. Please \"keep us honest.\" Contact us if you need us. Kinesiology Graduate Studies Committee (GSC) Many aspects of a grad student's career are routine and proceed along generally or traditionally accepted paths and stages. Where there is doubt, departure from routine, or somebody needs to use discretion for a one- time decision, then the faculty advisor is usually the first and sometimes the only decision maker. If grad students or advisors want to seek formal input from several graduate faculty members, or if grad policies call for that input to be sought, the Kinesiology Department has a standing committee, the Graduate Studies Committee. It consists of five graduate faculty members appointed by the Department Chair. Usually each Committee member , and certainly the chair individually , will have several years of experience in grad program administration, and in combination they have several decades of experience at the UW and in the Department. The Com mittee historically include d a student member, although that did not hold in 2016- 17. The chair dismisses any student member(s) for student personnel matters ; student members would not hear or vote on them . You may contact the Committee via your advisor, the graduate secretary, or the Grad Studies chair. As of the Spring 2017 semester, the faculty members of the Grad Studies Committee were: Andrea Mason (chair); Karla Ausderau, William Schrage. Ask a Kines grad representative about possible updates to the GSC roster . Page | 22 Advisor Every graduate student must have an advisor as per Graduate School require ment s, see e.g. https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=advisor . ADVISOR FOR KINESIOLOGY GRAD STUDENTS In the Department of Kinesiology , tenure -track faculty may be an academic advisor (major professor) for MS or PhD. students. Tenure -track means full, associate, or assistant professor s. Affiliate faculty in Kinesiology may also be advisors . These are professors whose \"home\" department is at UW -Madison but outside Kinesiology . In Kines graduate specializations that requir e a thesis or dissertation , the Department will not admit an individual applicant unless a professor has agree d to serve as the individual's advisor. Non -thesis MS students ' advis ing is by chair of Grad Studies Committee . The current Grad Studies chair is Prof. Andrea Mason, https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/staff/mason -ph-d-andrea/ . Committee advising pertains because Non-thesis students normally do not conduct specific research requiring conti nuous or frequent faculty supervision. For t he Non-thesis MS degree's prescribed curriculum , see the Kinesiology web site, https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/academics/grad -program/ . Non- thesis MS students enroll in classes according to this curriculum. Beyond the specifically listed course s, i.e. for electives, the intention is for Non-thesis students to have wide latitude in self-directing their grad career s toward their personal interests and goals. Non-thesis students who want personal advising may contact the Grad Studies Chair or another grad program representative. Referral may follow , if appropriate . An example of a likely referral might be for practicums or supervised academic experiences , on campus or off, that an individual student may envision and arrange . CHANGE OF ADVISOR . The advisor/ student relationship is by mutual agreement . Either party may terminate it. When a student is admitted based on a grad faculty member volunteering to be the grad advisor , then the student normally remains with that advisor through degree completion. Sometimes, however, the student may want to change advisors (or the advisor may recommend a change, e.g. due to pending retirement or other) . If you wish to change your advisor, first consult the prospective future advisor for consent. As a courtesy , please seriously consider also informing your current advisor. To change advisors, complete a Change of Graduate Advisor Form , available from the Graduate Secretary . It needs signatures by the previous advisor, the new advisor , and the student. Give the signed change -form to the Grad Secretary , who will file it and will adjust your advisor in UW's online student information system , which is important so that your new advisor can effectively monitor your progress in his or her online \"faculty center. \" Your Department Grad Office (Kines. Grad Secretary) * A nomenclature note on grad \"coordinator\" vs. grad \"secretary.\" In UW-wide parlance, the \"department graduate coordinator \" is the Kines grad secretary, available in the Kines Grad Program Office (Rm. 1013 Nat). Within the Kinesiology Dept. , however, if faculty and staff mention the \"grad coordinator, \" they probably mean the chair of the Grad Studies Committee , who heads the grad program, and who is listed under \"Department Representatives\" in this Handbook (section 2) . If the meaning is not clear from context, ask the person who used the term, or ask the grad secretary. We encourage you to seek short meeting s to acquaint yourself with both the grad secretary and the grad studies chair (although you will meet them if you participate in the Kines. Dept. new-student orientation mentioned in Section 3 of this Handbook ). Important Dates Each semester, you can see a copy of the Academic Calendar, as well as selected important deadlines on UW internet web pages. Often the Kines grad program office (or others) will try to e-mail grad students during a semester to remind them of special deadlines, but as a student, it is your responsibility to become aware of and meet all deadlines that pertain to you .

These aim at emphasiz ing each semester's important dates for most students or \"the average student .\" Page | 23 Forms Relatively few forms are required to complete the grad degree process. A form usually mark s a transition point; often it \"warrants\" (provides somebody with a record) that a student has actually completed some required step toward the degree. The Kines grad secretary will provide needed forms based on timely notice from the student (or advisor) that a transition will be made. As a very general \"benchmark\" for \"timely,\" consider notifying the Grad Office one month (or more) in advance of your need. Examples of required forms (depending on goal and progress) include: Rubric for MS proposal (research tracks only; inapplicable to Non-thesis MS) MS proposal approval form Rubric for MS defense (research tracks only; inapplicable to Non-thesis MS) Warrant for completion of MS degree Rubric s for PhD Preliminary Exam (or Exam s = overall exam consists of multiple parts ) Rubric - Preliminary Exam -Written ; and Rubric - Preliminary Exam -Oral Warrant for PhD Preliminary Exam , and their associated: General Field Requirement completion (PhD only) Minor completion (PhD only, and optional ) Rubric for PhD proposal PhD Proposal approval form Rubric for PhD defense Warrant for Final Oral Exam Committee approval (PhD defense). Optional forms, depending on choices for grad study, may include: Change of Advisor Change of Major Forms Appendix in this Handbook has samples of many forms . If you have doubt (or even if you don't) about how to approach any goal, phase or task within the grad study process, feel free to consult your advisor or a Kines grad program rep . In the context of forms, t he Kines Grad Office has or will create a Form to meet your need. Many forms appear as samples in Section 15 of this Handbook , the Forms Appendix . You are welcome to save yourself the trouble of \"revising\" a sample -form to meet your personal need. The Grad Secretary will be glad to do personalize a form f or you and your advisor, committee, and study event ( assuming you provide adequate notice and detail ). You are certainly welcome to \"go self- service\" with a sample form if you enjoy working with print or graphics. Be sure you provide the final product to the relevant interested parties, normally including the Kines Grad Office for documentation in your Kines file. Occupational Therapy / Occupational Science One research specialization within the Kinesiology Department is Occupational Science. This specialization verifies evidence for and researches advances in the theory of Occupational Therapy (OT) clinical/ professional services to patients/ clients. The clinical/ professional MS in OT is also a degree track available through the Department of Kinesiology. For a current (or prospective) OT student, this Handbook isn't your best resource. OT students, see the OT handbook on the OT web site . Here is a link : https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/ot/academics/msot/ , or consult the OT Program Office (listed in Section 2 of the Handbook you are currently reading) . Occupational Science students ( Kines research track) may need both this Handbook & OT Handbook. Seek clarification from your advisor, or ask a Kines grad program rep , as your study- career proceeds . Page | 24 Section 5, Enrollment Credit Requirements , including Full- Time Student Status Grad School sets various credit- loads for \"full-time \" study , depending on circumstances of the individual graduate student . Grad students who want (or need ) \"full-time student \" classification will carry, absent other circumstances, at least eight (8) credits during the fall and spring semesters. Many exceptions pertain to \"standard\" eight credits , for example: Grad students pursuing the PhD who attain dissertator status must register for exactly 3 credits per semester, with summer registration often optional, unless the dissertator will be doing certain things (see next se ction/ link) ; Grad students with \"appointments \" may, depending on \"percentage of appointment, \" be considered in full-time status with 6 or 4 credits per semester (an appointment, in this case, is employment, e.g. as a teaching assistant, research assistant, etc.); More than 15 credits may be taken as an overload, but this requires express prior permission from the Grad School (with deadlines), so plan carefully if you ever perceive that you may need (and be able to perform satisfactorily with) an overload. In summer session, enrollment requirements vary . For example , RAs and any student who will defend during the summer must register / enroll. Compare https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=enrollmentrequirements . Be aware & get more input if unsur e of enrollment or credit- load requirements to maintain your intended status . Retention of official full-time student status may be especially important for international students because it can affect their visa (U.S. residence permission). Enrollment is mandatory in the semester of degree conferral (or \"graduat ion,\" loosely speaking* ). In every semester, there is a degree deadline, set by Grad School. The degree- deadline determines effective date of degree \"conferral.\" There is a grace period, called a \"window,\" after each degree deadline. Degree conferral will, however, be delayed if the defense or any required degree- completion step is done within the \"window\" established by Grad School. Compare e.g. http://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/degreedeadlines/ * Nomenclature Note: \"graduation.\" The term \"graduation\" sometimes applies to the ceremonial event(s) surrounding degree attainment. UW-Madison calls its ceremonies \"Commencement.\" Formal, official degree attainment (on record/ in transcript), and the associated academic activities for that, are what require \"enrollment\" as used in this section . Further information regarding \"enrollment requirements\" can be found online in the Grad School guidelines , https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=enrollmentrequirements , or here, https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/ , or consult your advisor or a Kines grad program representative. Enrollment is also a substantia l factor in \"satisfactory progress ,\" discussed further in the following topic heading and at subsequent relevant points in this Handbook . Satisfactory Progress & Enrollment Graduate students must make satisfactory progress tow ard their degree , each semester, and overall. One major tenet of satisfactory progress is enrollment, i.e. taking and passing a sufficient number of courses each semester to complete a degree in a reasonable time. In addition to \"passing\" courses, students in \"grad\" status must remain above the minimum required grade point average (3.00 GPA), must move ahead on the non-course degree requirements, and (in research specializations ) must meet the advisor's expectations in researching, proposing, writing and defending a thesis or dissertation. Your advisor and the Graduate Studies Committee are jointly responsible for determining satisfactory progress. Unsatisfactory progress might cause you to lose a TA, RA or Fellowship appointment, and possibly your status as a graduate student. Frequent, open consultation with your advisor (research -based students) or adherence to the prescribed curriculum (non-thesis students) minimizes the chances that anybody would develop a view that your progress is unsatisfactory. Page | 25 CRITERIA FOR SATISFACTORY PROGRESS All grad students must maintain at least a 3.0 GPA (Grade -Point Average) during the first and each subsequent semester of graduate course work. Traditionally, for a Kinesiology graduate student, a full graduate load is 8-12 credits. The student should select courses f or any semester only upon approv al by the major professor. Students who have an assistantship (teaching, project , research , other) at one-third to one-half of full -time normally may remain \"full-time\" by carry ing a 4 or 6 credit load respectively until dissertator status is achieved. Occasion ally, if the major professor consents, a student may carry a load of more than 12 upon UW Graduate School approval. [The Graduate School \"ceiling\" is 15, see e.g. https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=enrollmentrequirements . If you want to exceed twelve credits in a semester, consult your advisor.] A student who does not achieve at least a 3.0 GPA in graduate course work during one semester will be on probation in the following semester. If the student achieves less than a 3.0 GPA in the following semester, the student will not be eligible to continue as a graduate student without approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. The Graduate School does not deem it satisfactory for the student to have one or more grades of Incomplete (\"I\") in a semester. It is felt that an \"incomplete\" indicates that the student might have some difficulty completing a degree program in a reasonable time. An \"incomplete\" that is not removed by the end of the next semester of enroll ment is unsatisfactory. The Graduate School may serve t he student with notice of a \" drop\" or \"probation, \" or it may ask the department to justify the student 's conti nuation of study . For a full-time student in a M.S. program that requires a thesis, the Department consider s satisfactory progress to be completion of required course work and a thesis proposal within two years of matriculation. For a full-time student in the Ph.D. program, the Department consider s satisfactory progress to be completion of required course work and passing preliminary examinations within three years of starting the PhD program. When a student does not make satisfactory progress, the Graduate Studies Committee will notify the major professor. The major professor will then have the option of requesting an extension if extenuating circumstances exist. The Department regards s atisfactory progress as a prerequisite for financial support from the Department. Kinesiology evaluates s atisfactory progress for part-time students on a case-by-case basis. This evaluation process is the responsibility of the student's advisor. Probation and Registration Hold The Kines Grad Program rarely does, but it may, admit a student on probation. Most Kinesiology students are admitted with \"fu ll standing\", even if they may be required to make up \"deficiencies\" (missing prerequisites) before graduation/ degree conferral. To remove a probation, the student must satisfy the conditions that the advisor imposed at the time of admission. If an admission is probation ary, your invitation letter will expressly specif y that; if it expressed no standing , then your admi ssion was with full standing. Once their studies have begun, students must make satisfactory progress toward their degree and remain in good academic standing with the Graduate School. The Graduate School regularly reviews grad students' records for grades of BC, C, D, F, or I (incomplete) in graduate -level courses (300 or above), or grades of U (unsatisfactory) in research and thesis courses . Courses with these grades might or might not be valid under Grad School guidelines on Probation, and Minimum Credit Requirement, see https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/ (scroll to \"probation\" or \"minimum\"). Those grades will contribute to academic probation if they take the grade point average (GPA) below 3.0. If Grad School places a student on academic probation, then it likely will also place a \"hold\" on future enrollment . It can program the hold into its online registration system to prevent enrollment. The probationary student may face suspension from graduate studies if grade performance remains below Grad School requirements. Notice of probation or a hold would be one of the administrative matters communicated to the student via the WiscMail account or via the student's contact information, as listed online. Keep your informatio n current! Monitor your account! Compare section 3, above in this Handbook. The Graduate School may also put students on probation for \"incompletes\" (reported grade of \"I\") that are not cleared within one term (semester) . Page | 26 Required Courses in Kinesiology Kinesiology 991 All graduate students in the Department of Kinesiology must complete KINES 991 (Research in Physical Activity: Theory and Design) . Kinesiology 900 The Department policy is that all Kines graduate students doing research degrees must enroll in Kines 900, Department Seminar, for one credit every semester they are registered students at the UW -Madison . Because the Seminar is research oriented, it is not required o f Non-thesis MS students, although they are welcome to register if they wish, and are welcome and encouraged to attend individual presentations of personal interest w ithout enroll ment in the course. Presentations are typically \"public events,\" announced weekly within the Department. The Dept. seminar participation requirement includes dissertators. Dissertators must enroll for exactly three credits in each fall and spring semester (and sometimes in the summer, depending on circumstances, https://kb.wisc.edu/gradsch/page.php?id=30324 ). Kines dissertators typically enroll for two credits of 990 (\"research\") and one credit of 900 (Dept. seminar). In semesters when a dissertator's specialization seminar is offered, dissertator s who takes their specialization seminer are exempt from the Dept. Seminar, Kines 900, or they may choose to take one credit each of \"research,\" special ization seminar, and Dept. seminar (three credits total). Kines 900 credits are included in the required graduate credit count but not in GPA (because grading is Credit/ No Credit). R esearch students whose educa tional or personal circumstances restrict their availability for Seminar attendance may request exemption from Kines 900 with an advisor -supported petition to the Kines Grad Studies Committee. Submit a petition via the Grad Studies chair or the Grad Secret ary. The Grad Studies Committee considers exemptions case -by-case based on circumstances described in the petition, so a petition should contain sufficient detail to permit analysis of the educational impact. Elective \"Research\" &/or \"Independent Study / Reading\" courses e.g. 699, 999, & esp. 990 Grading Kinesiology Independent Study/ Independent Reading credits (699 or 999) are graded with a letter grade (A-F) and count toward the student's GPA. Credits in \"Research or Thesis\" (Kines. 990) can only be graded as P (Progress), S (Satisfactory), or U (Unsatisfactory) . They do not count in GPA but they do count in the minimum credits required for a graduate degree, see e.g. https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=gradingsystem &/or https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=minimumgraduateresidencecreditrequirement . Enrollment in 699, 999, or 990 always requires instructor consent , because no curriculum is pre-set, so the student and instructor must define it by individual arrangement. Occasional exceptions pertain , usually for courses where a pre-determined curriculum is under development (not yet final/ approved) . A student must be enrolled in 990 (Research or Thesis) during the academic term in which the student proposes a research project . A proposal , presented in writing and defended orally, is required for graduate students in specializations that require a thesis or dissertation. Officially it is the instructor -of-record who consents (or not) to a student's registration in any instructor -consent course. Instructor consent requires data- entry of a \"permission\" in the registration computer on behalf of the instructor. Typically, for grad courses, the Kines. grad secretary does the data-entry of the enrollment permission. If the grad secretary is absent , other Dept. reps are authoriz ed to access the registration computer and data-enter enrollment permissions. The undergrad assistant is authorized (Rm. 1001 Nat, phone 608-262-0259) . If you ask the undergrad assistant to enter a permission , please give your UW ID number in your request for enrollment autho rization. The student , after entry of permission, must go online and register for an instructor -consent course. For Kines 990, Research or Thesis, the instructor -of-record is normally the grad student's faculty advisor. Communication and consent for enrollment permission. Traditionally, the Kines grad program prefere nce was for a request for enrollment \"permission\" to originate with the instructor . This assur es actual consent. For Kines. grad student s previously enrolled in 990, however, the grad secretary will presume an \"implied consent \" to re-register for 990, as is normal in conducting on- going research. T he student may request \"permission\" directly from the Page | 27 grad secretary. Inherent in the presum ption of re-enrollment is the student 's active, actual , continuing communicat ion with the advisor to plan each semester's research goals and agree on how to monitor and assess goal achievement. Most \"consent\" courses are \"variable\" credits , so the student must specify the actual credit -load each semester during the online registr ation . The credit -load also must derive from close, express consultation with the advisor (or instructor -of-record). Minimum Credits for a degree Graduate School sets minimums of degree credits at UW -Madison . For a UW master's degree, the minimum is 30 credits, and for the PhD the minimum is 51 credits . See: Grad School Policy & Procedures under \"Minimum Credit Requirement\" , click https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/ , then scroll to \"minimum.\" Most Kinesiology degree recipients will end up with a greater number of credits. Kinesiology specializations mandate credit minimums , in most cases. The total number of credits, mandatory curriculum, and courses options vary with specialization. Research specializations (anything other than the non -thesis MS) require several credits of Kines 990, Research or Thesis, while the student is conducting research, consolidating and analyzing data, and producing a written report of publis hable quality (thesis or dissertation). By the time of admission, most students will already be quite familiar with \"their\" specialization, but to check yours, or to see others, consult the Kinesiology web site for the relevant specialization under Gradua te Program Areas, https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/academics/grad -program/ (scroll to \"graduate program areas\"). Course -guide designation as \"grad credit\" needed on half the work. Grad students at UW -Madison must satisfy a Grad School requirement that at least half the student's c ourses be at a \"grad\" level. A \"graduate course designation \" is automatic for all courses numbered 700- 999. Courses numbered 300- 699 m eet the \"50% graduate minimum\" if they are marked in the Course Guide with a \"Graduate Course Attribute \" (Grad50%). See https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy= minimumgradcourseworkrequirement . The image below shows a course in the 300 -699 range (Kines 521) that has the Graduate50% attribute. If it did not have the attribute, a grad student could still take it for credit if the student's graduating course list also included more than half of all courses either \"above\" 700 or with the Grad50%. Page | 28 Work previously done (outside UW \"grad\" status ). Graduate level courses taken as a special student (or in any student -status other than \" grad\" status at UW -Madison ) normally do not count toward the Graduate School's minimum requirements, although rare appeals might be granted, see https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy =universityspecialstudentcreditconversion . Credits not taken in \"grad status\" can , however, be allowed to \"substitute for\" (count as part of) the Kinesiology Department's requirements beyond the Grad School's minimum. If you (and your grad advisor) would like to include such credits, direct a request to the Graduate Studies Committee (GSC) for consideration on a case- by-case basis. Research students may petition the committee via their advisor; others should contact the Kines Grad Secretary or the GSC chai r. COURSE SUBSTITUTIONS (for graduate course work taken at another institution) A graduate student may use credits earned at another institution to meet graduate course requirements at UW-Madison . The student' s advisor makes a request in writing to the Graduate Studies Committee . The request should include a course description and syllabus for each course from the other institution . The advisor should name t he UW-Madison course requirement(s) that the advisor believes the substitution(s) will meet. The Graduate Studies Committee will review the advisor's request and substitution recommendation (s), and the Committee chair may request a written recommendation from UW-Madison faculty member(s) with te aching experience in the required course (s) consider ed fo r substitution . The Committee has authority to approve or deny the substitution request . Graduate School does not need to approv e a substitution. Credits earned at another institution will not appear on the UW-Madison record , and they will not be a factor in the UW-Madison GPA or in Minimum Graduate Residence Credit s, https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=minimumgraduateresidencecreditrequirement COURSE SUBSTITUTIONS (for graduate course work taken on the UW -Madison campus) A student's advisor may request that alternative graduate courses taken on the UW-Madison campus apply toward meet ing graduate course requirements as listed in Kinesiology specialization curriculums . The request, made in writing to the Graduate Studies Committee, will include a course description and syllabus for both the required course and the requested substitute. The Graduate Studies Committee reviews t he advisor's reque st. The Committee h as authority to approve or deny the request . Graduate School approval is unnecessary. Page | 29 Section 6, Grad Degrees Generally Degrees Generally A Kines MS can be either Non -thesis or \"research.\" A Non-thesis MS overview is three pages below in this Handbook (section 7) . A \"research\" MS is often a precursor to PhD study . A student either continues in the UW-Madison Kinesiology Dept. or gains admi ssion somewhere else. The research MS also can be a student's final academic goal; the end -point of grad study. Students starting in the Non -thesis MS occasionally switch to research , possibly including continuation for a PhD, but this is rare. If it interests you, seek individual advice from a grad program representative &/or from a potential future research advisor. In UW -Madison Kinesiology, a specific grad faculty advisor is required for every student doing a research degree, including students who switch from Non -thesis study. HOW M.S. CANDIDATES APPLY for ADMISSION to the PH.D. PROGRAM By the end of the second year of study , a student should request permission to pursue the Ph.D. degree. The student , or the student's advisor, should forward a request to the Graduate Coordinator for consideration by the Graduate Studies Committee. This request should include: 1. A letter from the student describing graduate study plans; 2. Two letters of recommendation, one from the student's advisor and one from another faculty member; and 3. An updated transcript of graduate study (internal/ unofficial transcript is sufficient) PhD study starts with didactic courses , primarily. Some of these classroom courses are likely to be in the required curriculum of the Kinesiology specialization that the student is pursuing. See https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/academics/grad - program/ . The advisor may recommend or consent to research activity beginning while the student is still doing classroom study. During PhD study, a student must take and pass a Preliminary Exam (\"prelims\") , sometimes called a comprehensive exam (\"comps\"). For an in- depth discussion, see section 9, following in this Handbook, on \"Preliminary Exam.\" PhD study includes a General Field Requirement. This \"GFR\" didactic study assures that a PhD student acquires bread th in Kinesiology knowledge , i.e. outside the focus or expertise of the student's PhD specialization. PhD study may, but need not, include a Minor. Historically , a PhD did require a minor . Effective September 2015, Kinesiology PhD students are exempt from the Minor as a requirement because disciplines within Kinesiology span the study of cells (e.g. physiology, neuroscience) to behavior (motor control, biomechanics, and exercise psychology) to populations (exercise epidemiology). As such, students experience broad areas of inquiry and achieve further breadth via the General Field Requirement, described above. PhD students who choos e to minor must adhere to Graduate School requirements. https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=minors The PhD minor can be single -department or \"distributed \" among multiple departments . For a detailed discussion of the PhD Minor, see the \"PhD Minor\" discussion in \"Preliminary Exam,\" section 9, following in this Handbook. Committees : MS Thesis; & Preliminary Exam; & PhD Dissertation MS and PhD students in research specializations (those who write a thesis or dissertation) will need to co nvene a faculty review committee at various stages. For both the MS thesis and the PhD dissertation, the student must present a research proposal, i n writing and orally, to a faculty committee for consideration, comment and approval. PhD students must pass a Preliminary Exam (\"prelims\" sometimes called \"comps\" or \"comprehensive\" exams) on the student's specialization . A committee develop s the \"prelims\" questions and evaluate the results. MS and PhD students in research specializations will also, eventually, defend the thesis or dissertation they proposed. Typically, the proposal and defense are heard by the same committee, i.e. same committee membership for both event s). Page | 30 Details follow in this Handbook for committees, for the preliminary exam, MS and PhD proposals, and MS and PhD defenses. The composition (membership) of proposal committees and prelimi nary exam committees is not monitored by the UW Grad School. The Grad School will, however, take a strong interest in defense committees . In fact, the Grad School exercises review -&- approval authority over the defense committees ' membership. Members' credentials must comply with Grad School policy . Since past defense committee have had a high probability of including proposal or preliminary exam committee members , it seem s important that the student at least consider selecting them to comply with Grad School committee guidelines. See Grad School Academic Policies & Procedures, under \"Committees\", https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=committees . Departments may set stricter standards for committee membership , so generally, if you meet Department policy , you will meet Grad School policy. KINESIOLOGY COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP for the MS or PhD For Kinesiology students, the M.S. thesis committee consists of three faculty members. The Chairperson must be from the Department of Kinesiology. All committee members must be tenure -track faculty holding professorial rank (full, associate, or assistant) in any department with graduate program authority. For doctoral candidates, the final oral examination committee consists of five members, at least one of whom must be from outside the Department of Kinesiology. The Chairperson must be from the Department of Kinesiology. All committee members must be tenure -track faculty (full, associate, or assistant) holding professorial rank in any department with graduate program authority. [NOTE : The Kines Grad Studies Committee, in May 2017, voted to accept the following PhD committee structure: Four committee members must be tenure- track faculty (full, associate, or assistant) holding professorial rank in any department with graduate program authority. The fifth committee member is not required to be tenure -track faculty, but must have completed doctoral training or the equivalent . The GSC expects the new structure to gain approval by all Department faculty in approximately Septe mber 2017. Consult a Kines grad program representative for details after that time.] Non-thesis MS students neither propose nor defend a thesis, so they will not need committees. Assessment Rubric s required for research- MS & for PhD students MS and PhD students in research specializations (those who write a thesis or dissertation) will need to use learning assessment rubrics at multiple \"milestones\" in their study career. The milestones that requir e rubric usage are as follows : MS thesis proposal, MS thesis defense, PhD preliminary exams, PhD dissertation Proposal, and PhD dissertation defense. There are R ubric \"Forms \" for all these milestone event s. The rubrics requirement went into force in Kinesiology in February 2017. Following is t he text of a February 2017 explanatory e-mail by the Kinesiology Grad Studies Committee chair. Dear faculty and graduate students, We have been asked by the Graduate School to begin implementing assessment rubrics for our graduate thesis/ dissertation proposals and defenses and preliminary exams. We have developed and will distribute rubrics forms We will begin using them immediately. It is our hope that these will become a valuable tool for both students and committee members. They will also be used by the graduate studies committee to complete a formal assessment of our program at the end of each year. All assessment rubrics for a given year will be collected and used by the graduate studies committee to write our report to the graduate school. When students are ready to propose, defend or complete their preliminary exams, it is their responsibility to ensure that each of their committee members has a print or electronic version of the appropriate assessment rubric. These can be obtained from the graduate secretary prior to the event. We ask that committee members take no more than 1-week after the proposal/ defense/ prelim to complete the form and return it to the student and to the graduate secretary. It is important to note that the pass/ fail decision for the proposal/ defense/ prelim is not based on any single element from the rubrics. The pass/ fail decisions will continue to be made by the committee as a whole, based on closed -session discussions. We look forward to receiving your feedback on the assessments as you begin to use them. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions. Andrea Mason, PhD Professor and Chair of Graduate Studies Rubric forms are in the Forms Appendix of this Handbook . There are four variants of the assessment rubric form. All are similar in format, but they differ slightly in content for proposals, defenses, and prelim inary exam s. For \"prelims ,\" there are separate rubric forms for the written exam and the oral exam. If you use a Rubric F orm from the Appendix, please select your form Page | 31 carefully, according to its intended use. The Kines grad secretary also can supply the appropriate form. If you are unsure, consult a grad program rep. Assessment rubrics support two outc omes that experts a ppear to view as desirable: Rubrics are a learning tool for the student; Rubrics give a department a way to assess its teaching. These two outcomes imply a 2 -part documentation need: student s should get rubrics from t heir committee s; and the Dept. must accumulate all rubrics and annually report on them to the Grad School. Distribution of rubric forms can be either \"print\" or electronic or both . It might be easy to assume, i n the digital age, that committees would prefer an \"e-Rubric, \" but early experience suggest s that Paper is more popular . Both the format & the transmittal means for rubrics are at the personal/ tech preference of the individual committee member. S tudents presumably protect their interests by \"accommodat ing\" all indiv idual preferences (assuming the student can clearly identify them - if not, both paper and e-format might be advisable ). Rubric return is to the student and to the Dept. Grad Ofc. Rubrics are supposed to be returned to the student (t o learn from ) and by the student to the Kines grad secretary (to file for \"statistical report s\" that the Dept. does annually on all rubrics). From an initial assumption of \"digital\" rubrics, it followed that committees would return their rubrics electronically, i.e. e -mail them, to the student . The student , in turn, could easily provide copies to the graduate office for filing/ reporting. Initial experience suggests, however, about a n even split on committee members delivering their \"file\" rubric directly to the Kines. Grad Office, rather than via the student, and delivery was primarily in paper format . This is permissible . Students may contact the grad secretary for a rubric copy if a committee member does not provide t he completed rubric directly to the student . Rubrics Timing / Turn -around is, ideally, 1 week . The 2017 Rubric Announcement e -mail suggested 1 week for completion of rubrics . Rubric s policy development suggest s that this timing : 1) primarily aim s at facilitating learning by fresh feedback wh en a student's mind is most receptive; and 2) only secondarily aim s at procrastination being the progenitor of problems in appropriate reporting = obtain a rubric \"right away\" (essentially contemporaneously wit h the \"event\") or it is hard to obtain. Initial indications are that rubric completion timing is highly variable, sometimes substantially exceeding one week. One does what one can. Rubrics Process Refinements . At least one interested observer suggest s that efficiency would rise by combining the r ubric requirement with the warrant -signing requirement. The logic seem s to be that a committee must reach consensus on whether to sign a warrant. This implies that a prior committee consensus on \"assessment\" necessarily also must have been reached. As such, it is reasonable to expect committee members to articulate their consensus reasoning on the ir rubric -form s in conjunction with their decision on warrant -signature . If committees feel that excess paperwork and redundant assessments are obstacles, an advisor may wish to suggest a \"joint\" rubric (all or multiple committee members on a single form). Academic hierarchy implies that a student may want to avoid trying to prescribe a rubric process for faculty , or avoid trying to enforce it, even for improved efficiency. Thus, the student likely ought to consult the advisor and enlist the advisor's help in \"implementing\" a rubric . An advisor probably has the \"surest way\" to \"figure out rubrics\" - if they need \"figuring\" - the advisor can have a face -to-face interaction with the persons in control of the \" rubric requirement\" and ultimately answerable to the Grad School on \"reporting ,\" i.e. with the Grad Studies Committee. One faculty member raised the question of a possible \"artificiality\" in separate Written and Oral Rubrics for a \"continuous p rocess\" of a PhD Preliminary Exam, but that is the prescribed format of Rubrics as of August 2017. (The Grad Studies Committee, which implemented Rubrics at Grad School request, likely would be open to faculty or student suggestions for Rubric process changes .) If you do have concerns or questions about using rubrics, please consult your advisor , or the Grad Studies chair (or the grad secretary). Commencement (Graduation Ceremony) . As you near degree completion (graduation), you may wish to celebrate your achievement in a public way with fellow students, U W officials, and your invited guests. The term \"graduation\" can be ambiguous . Sometimes it refer s to degree attainment; s ometimes to the ceremonial event(s) surrounding degree attainment. UW -Madison names its ceremony \"Commencement.\" Your official degree attainment, its formal e ntry in student record s, e.g. transcript, a nd any academic activities to earn a degree are in other section s of this Handbook. This section addresses the ceremonial aspects . For a related discussion, see section 11, following in this Handbook. Commencement (graduation ceremony ) is optional . Your at tendance at a Commencement ceremony does nothing for your academic status or degree attainment. You can attain a degree without any ceremony , assuming you meet all academic requirements, e.g. complet e all required courses with passing grades and an acceptable grade- point average, complet e required research (if any), writ e up your research in a thesis or dissertation (if applicable) , and successfully defend it . UW -Madison offers a Commencement ceremony because it is a tradition and hundreds of degree recipients do choose to celebrate in the traditional way. Page | 32 Participate before or after degree -conferral, if you prefer . Because Commencement in ceremonial, students may pa rticipate at their convenience. Many attend in conjunction with actual degree attainment, but some may wish to celebrate earlier or later, perhaps because that is easier for their family's travel plans. (There does not need to be \"a reason.\") Students who \"graduate\" in summer must \"commence\" before or after the summer semester. Comm encement in May or December only - none after summer semester. Kines grad students fairly commonly finish a degree during the summer semester. This might be an advantageous time because the student's own teaching -assistant responsibilities dimi nish then, leaving more time for research and writing. The point here is that UW - Madison does not offer a Summer Commencement ceremony . If you become a summer degree recipient and you want to celebrate in a traditional ceremony, the n your only choice is to go to Commencement before or after actual degree attainment. Please note, however, that e ven if you will go to Commencement \"simultaneously\" with your degree receipt, you will still need t o \"plan ahead.\" Plan \"several months\" pre -event to sign up/ fully participate, https://commencement.wisc.edu/ If you wish to participate \"fully\" in Commencement , you must take steps several months prior to the Ceremony's date. 1) You will need to \"get your name on a list,\" presumably so UW has time t o send the list to commercial printer f or design, production and delivery thousands of Commencement programs. 2) You also will need to \"rent attire.\" You can participate in C ommencement only if you are \"proper ly dress ed.\" In other words , you must wear the attire or \"regalia\" (cap & gown) traditional to graduation ceremonies (at least in the U.S.). Since most students d o not own their own mortar -board c ap and f lowing gown in University color s, they will have to rent attire , and you must complete your rental agreement with a designated supplier well before the date that you intend to wear the regalia . 3) If you are a PhD recipient, then you will need to a rrange a \"faculty escort\" for Commencement, so this means you will be \"planning for two,\" and avoiding \"schedule conflicts\" i s easier if two can agree to the date \"way ahead.\" The faculty escort, by the way, must also wear proper attire, although faculty have latitude to wear their alma mater's colors, and many faculty do own their own attire. In 2014, UW changed the office that is responsible for Commencement management. The Chancellor's office took over then, and it continued to manage Commencement until the Spring Semester 2017, the last ceremony before publication of this Handbook. A s of this writing, nothing indicates that management will change again soon. Between 2014 an d 2017, the re was fluctuation in the specific staff members who handled Commencement for the Chancellor's office , but the basic notice process was stable. The process involved a notice by e-mail to students whose record -status suggested there were ready to \"graduate.\" These students could then sign up for Commencement (in their \"MyUW\") . The Chancellor's staff also sen d notice to departmental graduate offices, s o those offices could remind selected students of Commencement (if the grad office was aware that students were nearing degree completion). A sample of the departmental grad office notice appears below. Please NOTE that the dates in the sample notice are likely to change from year to year, so you should view them as showing only the approxi mate timing involved. Please wait for an actual notice in the semester(s) when C ommencement pertains to you, or seek specific dates for your semester on the Commencement web site, https://commencement.wisc.edu/ When the Chancellor's office took over Commencement management, it revised the festivities and location . In a return to older tradition, the Spring \"exercise\" is now held \"open air,\" in Camp Randall stadium. The Winter event remained at the Kohl Cente r (an indoor sports venue). This could influence a student's choice of when to go to Commencement. Sample Commencement Notice E-Mail - sam ple on ly, all dates approximate From: Carrie Olson [ mailto:carrie.olson@wisc.edu ] Sent: Tuesday, [gradcoords] Spring 2017 Commencement Information and Graduate List Dear Graduate Program Coordinators and Administrators: Hello, you are receiving this email because you a re a master's or doctoral degree program coordinator for your respective graduate program for degrees issued by the Graduate School. I'm writing with an update on important informat ion o n spring commencement. 2017 Spring Commencement Ceremonies: Doctoral, MFA, Medical Professional degree candidates [SAMPLE] Friday, May 12, 5:30 p.m. [SAMPLE] at the Kohl Center List of degrees conferred at this ceremony Bachelor's, Master's and Law degree candidates [SAMPLE] Saturday, May 13, noon [SAMPLE] at Camp Randall Stadium List of degrees conferred at this ceremony Page | 33 Important Information: For degree candidates who plan to attend one of the commencement ceremonies, the firm deadline to have their name appear in the commencement program is [SAMPLE] Friday, March 31 [SAMPLE] . Name s will appe ar in the program only for students who complete the \"Apply to Graduate\" (ATG) process in their MyUW Student Center (see https://registrar.wisc.edu/apply_to_graduate.htm ). A short demo is available, as well as a step by step guide . A student does not need a degree- warrant requested in order to attend commencement ; however, a warrant is required to have a degree actually, officially awarded . o If student s either are not currently enrolled and/or if their degree has already been posted to their record, they can still complete the Apply to Graduate (ATG) process as long as they are active (not discontinued status) in SIS , the online Student Information System . Student s who have discontinued will need to contact me via email at carrie.olson@wisc.edu to complete a form to have their name included in the program. I have attached a list [REMOVED FOR KINES HANDBOOK PURPOSES] of all graduate and professional students that meet one of two statuses . One, they indicated they intend t o participate in the spring ceremony but completed their degree requirements in Fall 2016. Two , they are completing their degree requirements this Spring 2017, and may/or may not be attending a Spring 2017 ceremony. This list is from [SAMPLE] March 13, 2017 [SAMPLE] . Note that some names on this list may be degree candidates who chose to be in a ceremony this past fall, but will complete their degree requirements this semester, and do not intend to participate in a ceremony again. If you are seeking that information, please contact the student directly. Please treat this list [REMOVED HERE] as a confidential educational record and do not distribute it. This is your opportunity to review the list ahead of the deadline, identify any students who you think may be planning to graduate and/or choosing to attend commencement, but are not yet on the list, and remind them to complete the ATG process by [SAMPLE] Friday, March 31 [SAMPLE] . o We strongly encourage all PhD students to indicate a Faculty Escort, who will attend the ceremony and proce ed across the stage with them. A student should indicate the name and email of their Faculty Escort as part of the appli cation process. Escorts will be contacted with more information regarding regalia rentals and purchase and details about the ceremony and the escort process after the [SAMPLE] March 31 deadline [SAMPLE] . Students who wish to check their status can be dire cted to the \"view my graduation status\" link, which appears under the \"apply to graduate\" link in their MyUW Student Center. They will be able to view the term in which they plan to complete their degree and the term in which they plan to participate in co mmencement (if they so desire). If a student needs to update either of these, they can simply complete the ATG process again which will update their preferences. For students planning to attend a future commencement (beyond [SAMPLE] Spring 2017 [SAMPLE] ), please encourage them to complete the ATG process while they are still enrolled at UW -Madison . NOTE: Students who plan to deposit their dissertation in a \"window \" period will go into discontinued status if not enrolled in the next term, and they lose acce ss to the online portion of the application to graduate. YES! Student s can apply to complete their degree and attend commencement in different terms. Student s can indicate they plan to complete their degree in the current term and two future terms, and students can indicate the y will attend the current term's commencement ceremony and a future commencement ceremony. This short demo goes over options . Questions? Please direct students with general commencement questions including cap and gown rental, accessibility questions, and parking and shuttle needs to http://www.commencement.wisc.edu or Campus and Visitor Relations (608- 263-2400). Commencement Ceremony: Carrie Olson (608 -890-1238 or carrie.olson @wisc.edu ) I look forward to congratulating all of our graduates at the upcoming ceremonies. On, Wisconsin! Carrie Olson , Campus Events and Special Projects Coordinator Office of the Chancellor , University of Wisconsin - Madison 97 Bascom Hall, 34 Section 7, Non- Thesis MS Degree Course and Grade Requirements The Kinesiology web site has a prescribed curriculum, which includes electives that the student choose s. The site lists some suggested electives . https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/academics/grad -program/ ( warrant to document completion) . Kines Grad Program representatives will monitor your progress and will request a degree -warrant in the semester when you near complet ion of the prescribed curriculum (in the fourth semester , if you adhere to the curriculum ). Typically, we will notify you and ask you to confirm your intention to finish the degree. The Kines Grad Program will review your courses for sufficient credits and adequate grades. For a discussion of minimum credits, satisfactory progress, and related requirements , review section 5 of this Handbook. Degree Conferral. Assuming your curriculum is complete and your performance is acceptable, the Kines. grad secretary will ask Grad School to produce an MS \"warrant \" for you. The warrant is paperwork that the Dept. uses to verify to Grad School that a student has reached an academic milestone, e.g. degree completion. The Grad Studies Committee chair will sign your degree warrant, and the Dept. will transmit it to the UW Graduate School as documentation of your degree eligibility. Normal degree processing takes several weeks to several months, see e.g. https://registrar.wisc.edu/graduation_commencement. htm For documentation of a degree before formal degree- conferral and entry- of-degree on official records/ transcript, UW Registrar, https://registrar.wisc.edu/degree_completion_letters.htm , or consult a Kines grad program representative. Commencement (graduation ceremony = optional) - for details see \"commencement\" in section 6 of this Handbook o You may participate ( or not ) in \"cap -&-gown\" ceremonies. Held in May or December only - none after summer semester Participate before or after degree- conferral, as convenient. Plan \"several months\" pre -event to sign up/ fully participate, https://co mmencement.wisc.edu/ Page | 35 Section 8, MS Degree: Research- Based with Thesis (an overview) Your MS stud y typically begins with classroom work , primarily, although some research may begin and you may earn some \"research credits \" (Kines 990) early in your grad study career . Select your didactic (classroom) courses in consultation with your advisor , based on the requirements of your specialization curriculum, as further discussed in sections 5 and 6 of this Handbook. Classroom transitions to or overlap s with Research . When you have taken sufficient didactic courses to gain basic knowledge , and when you have done sufficient research to hypothesize an experimental design , and when your advisor agrees , then you will need to \"lock in\" your further research - your MS -thesis research - in a presentation to a team of subject -matter experts. You d efine y our individual research project with a research Proposal . Your proposal describes your research plan to a committee of experts . Your advisor works within the committee to set the parameters of your proposal . It usually has written and oral form s. Your advisor chairs the proposal committee (and chairs all committees associated with your degree completion). You c omplete your research, you reach & record results in a thesis & you justify i t to experts. After you execute your research plan, you will evaluate whether your hypothesis had empirical validity, or if not, why not. You may rea ch conclusions about \" what else\" your results show ed, cons istent with or contrary to your hypothesis, and you may suggest further hypothes es or ideas for further scientific testing. You will describe this in writing in a scientific treatise of publishable quality, your MS thesis. You will give the thesis to a tea m of subject -matter experts, typically the same team that formed your proposal committee, now constituting a defense committee . They will evaluate your written work and ask you to defend your method and conclusions to them orally. If you satisfy their concerns, they will approve you for a master's degree.

Page | 36 M.S. Thesis Proposal in Detail Proposal and defense are closely related. Even at the proposal stage, you might wish to \"read ahead \" about defense (in this Handbook) . Things are always changing in the information age, so you might protect your interests by not rely ing exclusively on this \"point -in-time\" Handbook . Think critically. Ask questions. As always, involve your advisor as an academic resource and to keep communication up- to-date. Proposal steps are: Assemble/ determine a proposal committee. Your advisor will chair it. Consult your advisor on how to determine which faculty are most academically appropriate to serve as your committee members. Probably you want faculty that work in your area and that y ou know (or who know you). The exact personnel choices are beyond the scope of this Handbook. There are some administrative controls on committee membership, as below. Grad School Committee Review Grad School will not review the membership of your proposal committee , but you will need to ask Grad School for a warrant to document your defense . At the defense stage, t he Grad School will review your defense warrant request to be sure it lists committee members that comply with Grad School policy, see https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=committees The grad secretary would inform you if Grad School raised objections to your committee. Objections should be minimal -to-none if you adhere to Kinesiology committee requirements. A KINESIOLOGY M.S. THESIS COMMITTEE CONSISTS OF THREE FACULTY MEMBERS. The Chairperson must be from the Department of Kinesiology. All committee members must be tenure -track faculty (full, associate, or assistant professor) in any department with graduate program authority. The M.S. candidate must make an oral presentation o f thesis research to the thesis committee. Schedule the Proposal Date, Time, Place In proposing, probably the main procedural task for you, working with your advisor , is to schedule the proposal at a time when your entire committee is available. You wi ll need to \"book\" a physical space to accommodate a group of at least 4 persons, probably more (depending on the size of your \"audience\" of friends and colleagues at the \"public\" portion of the proposal, see below in this Handbook, in the section called \"announcements at least 1+ week ahead\"). For many years, the \"most usual place \" for a Kines proposal was Room 2007 Natatorium, a conference room. Recently, several students, esp. those with interdisciplinary interests and \"many\" colleagues, have opted for Room 2055, a classroom, and a much larger space than Rm. 2007. Other options are possible . The room -choice is \"anything you want, if you can get it.\" Room 2007 comfortably accommodates about a dozen persons, maybe up to twenty, shoulder -to-shoulder. Curren t reservation procedures call for you to reserve Rm. 2007, or any \"Nat\" space, in an online calendar . Most Kines staff, including the grad secretary , can access the calendar . The \"expert\" and \"controlling party\" for online room reservations calendar is the Kines undergrad assistant (Rm. 1001 Nat, phone: 262-1690). The undergrad assistant is the only person who can immediately confirm (or reject) your reservation. The grad secretar y (or others) may enter your date -&-time for a particular room, subject to its availability at the time(s) you specify, but confirmation may take several business days. You are free to choose any room you want, in the Nat - or in another building - if available. In the Nat, room reservations are \"first come, first served ,\" with \"requester rank\" or \"event priority\" potentially entering in . This suggest s that, even in \"low demand\" times (summer), you \" self-protect \" by booking \"right away\" (as soon as you can). If you are booking a room outside the Nat, you will need to inquir e about and follow that building's reservation process. If you d ecide not to book your defense -room through the grad secretary, then do please still notify the grad secretary of your proposal's firm date, time & place, once you have booked them. This will allow correct and timely announcements. See following in this Handbook, under the section for \"announcements at least 1+ week ahead.\" Page | 37 Announce Proposal 1+ Week Ahead Notify the grad secretary , 1+ week ahead, of your propos al specifics . This includes the \"room booking\" info, above , plus the committee member name s and affiliations (if outside of Kines) plus the \"working title\" of your proposed thesis . You are free to revise the title later, several times if you wish . The specific reservation info allows the grad secretary to put up the required announcements (posters). RESEARCH PROPOSALS FOR M.S. STUDENTS In Kines grad uate program areas (specializations) that require a thesis, a graduate student must do an oral and a written proposal. The student must be enrolled in 990 (\"Research or Thesis\") when proposing. The major professor (or the student) must communicate the proposal time, date, location, and subject/ \"working title\" of thesis to the Graduate Secretary, who announces the proposal to faculty and gr aduate students at least one week prior to the proposal. The purpose of the proposal is to get input and approval from the thesis committee prior to a final decision on the research approach for the thesis project. The student must provide a written proposal to the members of the committee at least seven days prior to the oral proposal. The major professor/ advisor, with the approval of the other members of the committee, determines the format of the oral presentation and of the written proposal. The tradition for \"announcements\" takes the form of the grad secretary putting up \"posters\" (plain black print on 8- 1/2 x 11 paper) in the Nat. Under recent practice, one copy went up on the Grad bulletin board opposite Rm. 1013, one by the Dept. mailboxes n ear Rm. 1043, one near Rm. 2007, and a couple others on various boards in \"the Nat back hall ways\". The Kines practice of \"announcing\" a proposal reflects that it is an academic event of potential wider interest. Th is is because the student is describing i nnovative research that will c ontribut e new knowledge to the field. Thus, a proposal is \"announced\" and it is (partly) open to \"the public.\" Generally, that \"public\" is mostly \"insiders\", and when your committee offers its critiques/ e dits/ evaluations of your work, it will likely excuse/ exclude any \"audience\". Posters in the \"Nat\" are very likely not truly effective in \"advertising\" to those that you may wish to have attend your proposal and support you. So feel free advertise on your own, if you wish. Probably the \"true, best way\" to assure a supportive audience (if you want one) for the \"public\" portion of the proposal, is personally to notify your family, friends, fellow students, or colla borators. Thesis Proposal Preview Copies to Committee Are Required. RESEARCH PROPOSALS FOR M.S. STUDENTS A proposal (written and oral ) is required for graduate students in areas requir ing a thesis . The student shall enroll in 742 -990 (Research or Thesis) during the academic term in which the student proposes. The student shall provide a written proposal to members of the committee at least seven days prior to the oral proposal. T he major professor/ advisor , with the approval of the other members of the committee , determines t he format of the written proposal and the oral presentation. Do Proposal and Get Signatures on Kines -Internal Thesis -Proposal Approval- Form . After you successfully propose, you will need to get your committee to sign your proposal approval form . The grad secretary can prepare the approval -form to your specifications, using the details from your posters (preceding section of this Handbook). There is also a sample proposal -approval form in Forms Appendix, below in this Handbook , if you wish to create your own form (or find you must ). Please return the signed form to the grad secretary for permanent documentation in your Dept. file. The thesis proposal approval form is internal to Kinesiology. It remains in the Dept. file and neither Grad School nor any other \"outsider\" reviews it. If you have any committee member(s) who do \"remote participation\" in the proposal, you may gather thos e signature(s) either by \"proxy\" = sign- off by your advisor \"on behalf of\" the remote member or by waiting until the remote member is available to sign. Take Approval Form with you to Proposal P lace (Expedites Signing) If a student \"housed\" in the \"Nat\" u ses a proposal -approval -form, the Grad Secretary usually keeps it on -file until the day of the exam. The student then can conveniently pick it up from the Kines Grad Office. If students work mainly in the MSC, the WIMR, or anywhere outside the \"Nat,\" they will likely prefer to get their approval -forms before the date- of-use and keep th e form in their personal files . This pre sumes that it will not be convenient to pick up the form from the Grad Secretary on the day of the exam (physical distance between \"Nat\" & the other location). The grad secretary will transfer the proposal -approval -form to you by any reasonable means you may suggest. If you wish , you may create the form yourself using the sample in the Forms Appendix of this Handbook. Print it, or download it, fill it in, use that \"for real.\" You may also use a ny reasonable facsimile form in a different format Page | 38 but preserving the content. If you choose to \"deliver\" the completed (signed) form, and if the grad secretary is not available in -person, then you may leave the signed form in the mail slot in \"the copy room\", Rm. 2023 Nat. There is no Graduate School review of committee membership at the proposal stage. You may change c ommittee members after your proposal. (NOTE that when you DEFEND, the Grad School will check \"credentials\" of committee members . That gives potential on- going importance to your selection of Proposal Committee membership , because n ormally the proposal members also hear the defense. UW grad faculty are \"sure things\" to \"pass\" their Grad School review , see http://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/#committees . The Kinesiology Department prescribes Graduate Faculty status for committee members. THESIS COMMITTEE CREDENTIALS A Kinesiology M.S. thesis committee consists of three faculty members. The Chairperson must be from the Department of Kinesiology. All committee members must be tenure -track faculty holding professorial rank (full, associate, or assistant) in any department with graduate program authority. M.S. candidates must oral ly present their research to a thesis committee Learning Assessment Rubric Required An assessment rubric is required for the MS Defense. Read more about rubrics in Section 6 of this Handbook, \"Degrees Generally,\" under sub -heading -MS and PhD Note! There are four variants of the as sessment rubric form. Although all are similar in format, they differ slightly in content. All four forms are in the Forms Appendix of this Handbook. If you use a form from the Appendix, please select your form carefully, acc ording to its intended use. The Kines grad secretary also can supply the appropriate form. Your committee members' preferences for rubrics will control much of your communication about rubrics . If the member want s a rubric via e -mail, then you should e -mail it. If the member want s the a paper rubric , then you should provide paper. Ideally, your committee members will give you their completed rubric s promptly (so you can learn from t hem while the presentation is fresh in your mind). You might wish to remind committee members who do not respond promptly. If that makes y ou uncomfortable, your advisor or the Kines grad secy might be able to facilitate . There is a \"reporting\" component of rubrics: The UW Grad School will monitor the Kines Dept. and its rubric implementation. This means that a copy of all completed rubrics needs to be filed in the Kines grad office. That copy may go to the Kines grad secretary via either the student or the proposal committee member(s). Plan Ahead, Remain Alert, Think Critically After successfully proposing your thesis project , you can defend the final thesis , basically, in whatever semester you choose (subject to completion of \"didactic\" courses & your thesis research). At the time of proposal, the grad secretary may do an initial review of your transcript compared to your specialization's curricular requirements &/or Grad School minimums (see e.g. \"Minimum Credits for a Degree,\" above, Section 5 of this Handbook) . You may need a semester or two (or more) beyond your proposal to do research on and write the thesis , as well as to take any remaining required didactic courses. The grad secretary will do a final curricular review close to the time you defend. You and your advisor , ideally, should remain constantly aware of and be taking steps toward completion of the required curriculum. If you are in doubt, you may wish to request a curricular review by the grad secretary . It is non-binding - i.e. subject to review by advisor &/or Grad Studies Committee - but potentially useful. Page | 39 Section 8.b., Research MS Defense (\"end\" of \" process\" to get research MS) When you and your advisor agree that you have completed (or are on-track to complete) all required didactic courses (and desired elective s) for the MS, and when you agree that your research hypothesi s has been adequately tested experimentally, then you need to \"lock in\" your publishable -quality research -report as a thesis to be review ed by a committee of experts . Normally this committee has the same members to whom you proposed the thesis project . As with the proposal , your advisor chairs the defense committee, and your advisor sets the parameters of your thesis, which takes written form, and its defense, which take oral form , primarily . The Graduate School was not activ ely involved in the proposal but will be actively interested in the defense as an indicator of the MS degree. Grad School sets thesis format and committee membership requirements , https://grad.wisc.edu/curre ntstudents/mastersthesis/ . Note that the PhD recently went from \"all paper\" to \"all electronic \" in only a couple years - a rather short time by institutional standards. The MS could do the same someday - so this \"Handbook review ,\" even if revised annually - could lose pace with actual developments of the defense process . Thus please consider \"checking the links\" for \"currently current\" info on MS defense/ deposit, and always be skeptical, and feel free to ask, especially if you ever see or hear \"competing\" info. MS Defense Checklist (Hi -Lites) - compare \" MS defense in D etail,\" next section in this Handbook Assure defense committee of three faculty members - normally same as Proposal Committee - advisor is chair o Agree on defense timing - consult committee - date & clock -time when all c an attend (possibly \"remotely\") \"Warrant\" need ed for defense = Paper work from Grad School o Request warrant via Kines grad secretary at least three (3) weeks ahead (per Grad School procedures). o Online warrant -request needs 4 info -items, i.e. your : committee member names, minimum 3 planned defense -date thesis title (tentative) intention (or not) to continue in same program for PhD o Grad Secretary will notify you when Grad School approves warrant .

As always, turn to your advisor to keep communication up-to-date and as an academic resource. \"Caveat\": The PhD \"finish -up\" process has gone largely electronic over the past two or three years - a rather short time by institutional standards. One would expect the MS to do the same someda y - so this \"preview\" of the defense process could \"fall behind developments.\" Every effort will be made to keep the Handbook up-to-date, but always be skeptical, and feel free to ask, especially if you ever see or hear \"competing\" info. Defense Planning You can defend your MS , basically, in whatever semester you choose . This is subject to completion of \"didactic\" courses , especially your required curriculum, and the satisfactory progress of your thesis research. As to curricular requirements, t he grad secretary (who, officially, is a \"student status examiner\") is tasked to review your transcript at the appropriate time(s), e.g. at the MS proposal, or definitely by the MS defense. You (and your advisor) may (and should) also conduct on-going assessment s of whether you are \"done,\" didactically. Curricular requirements for Kinesiology specializations are on the web site. See: https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/academics/grad -program/ There could be departures from the web site curriculum list. Revisions or updates occasionally happen . Typically, Kines would allow a student to adhere to the curriculum in-place at the time of matricula tion (assuming continuous enroll ment/ satisfactory progress ), but this might necessitate documentation of a curriculum no longer posted on the web site. If you believe this pertains to you, consider checking with your advisor, the grad secretary, or the Grad Studies Committee chair. Page | 41 Degree Deadline; planning to meet it A major timing guidepost for the MS degree -conferral process is the \"degree deadline\". The Graduate School s ets a degree deadline each semester. The exact date varies with the annual calendar, but usually it closely follows \"exam week.\" See http://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/degree/ (link called degree deadlines, http://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/degreedeadlines/ ) If you complete all requirements for the degree, including defense and thesis deposit, by the deadline, then UW will confer your degree effective that same semester . For scheduled conferral dates, see https://registrar.wisc.edu/gradua tion_commencement.htm . Usually the conferral date is near the end of the month that a semester ends (Late May, late August, lat e December). The planning \"trick\" s eems to be to know when you are \" close \" to being ready to defend . Check with your advisor, but for this discussion, assume you are \"close to ready\" when you are three to six months from having your thesis done . Ideally, you will know you are ready by early in a semester, or even prior to the expected defense -semester. Then you can identify your specific degree- deadline (at the link, above) and \"work back\" from th e deadline to form a plan for how far in advance of the deadline you need to begin completing your defense steps (as outlined in this Handbook, and in consultat ion with your advisor). For planning purposes, the exact conferral date is less important to note than the \"concept\" that you should plan in advance, because: A Mis sed Degree Deadline D elay s your D egree- Conferral Date. Missing a degree deadline will delay your degree -conferral -date until at least the following \"term\" (semester). This could impact you if, e.g., you had a job (or funding) lined up that required a formally conferred master's degree. UW does provide procedures for documenting a degree that is complete but not yet officially awarded , see e.g. http://registrar.wisc.edu/posting_of_degrees.htm . The Grad School allows a \"window\" (time extension/ grace- period) beyond the degree deadline. If you complete the required degree steps in the \"window\" (exact dates in following link), then UW will confer your degree in the next semester , but you would not need to register in that semester. If your conferral date (date of record for your degree) is not of particular concern to you, and if you think you might need the \"window\" to complete the degree process, then please either study and understand the Grad School web page, http://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/degreedeadlines/ , or consult a Kines grad program representative. A missed degree deadline could add to your tuition expense. Potentially the most \"painful\" aspect to be aware of in your defense timing is that, if your completion of all requirements extends beyond the window , then you become obligated to register for a minimum of two credits in the subsequent semester when you actually complete your degree requirements . Unless you have and retain \"tuition remission\" or \"tuition deferral\", then you would face tuition payments for your minimum two credits = several thousand dollars - there is the \"pain.\" At the MS level, it is quite possible that you will continue for the PhD, and quite likely that you will enroll for classes with tuition remission, and if that is your situ ation, then the degree deadline and window are essentially irrelevant to you, except as possible \"motivators\" to \"get done\" (with t he MS) and \"move on\" (to the PhD). One other \"window\" detail is that, sometimes, it is almost \"not worth it.\" For example, the \"fall window\" (following the \"summer\" semester) adds only a few days to your \"time to finish .\" Of course, those days could be just the days you need, so: Know thyself. Convene a defense committee Consult your advisor on how to determine which faculty are most academically appropriate to serve as your committee members. Probably you want facu lty that work in your area and that you know (or who know you). The exact personnel choices are beyond the scope of this Handbook. There are some administrative controls on committee member ship, as below. Grad School Committee Review You will need a warrant f rom Grad School to document your defense. For procedures, see below in this Handbook under \"Request the Warrant 3+ weeks ahead .\" The Grad School will review your defense warrant request to be sure its listed committee members comply with Grad School polic y, see https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=committees The grad secretary would inform you if Grad School raised objections to your committee. Grad School objections should be minimal -to-none if you adhere to Kinesiology committee requirements. A KINESIOLOGY M.S. THESIS COMMITTEE CONSISTS OF THREE FACULTY MEMBERS. The Chairperson must be from the Department of Kinesiology. All committee members must be tenure -track faculty (full, associate, or assistant professor) in Page | 42 any department with graduate program authority. The M.S. candidate must make an oral presentation o f thesis research to the thesis committee. Schedul e the Defense In \"defending ,\" probably the main procedural task for you, working with your advisor is to schedule the defense at a time when your entire committee is available. You will also benefit from knowing and planning for the degree deadline, as described in the Handbook under the section called \"Degree Deadline.\" This is largely the same process that you probably followed with the thesis proposal. You will need a physical space to accommodate a group of at least 4 persons, probably more (depending on the size of your \"audience\" of friends and colleagues at the \"public\" portion of the defense , see this Handbook, under the section called \"announcements at least 1+ we ek ahead\"). For many years, the \"most usual\" place for a Kines defense was Room 2007 Natatorium , a conference room . Recently, several students, esp. those with interdisciplinary interests and \"many\" colleagues, have opted for Room 2055, a classroom, and a much larger space than 2007. Other options are possible; room -choice is \"anything you want, if you can get it.\" Room 2007 comfortably accommodates about a dozen persons, maybe up to twenty, shoulder -to-shoulder. Current reservation procedures call for you to reserve Rm. 2007, or any \"Nat\" space, in an online calendar accessible to most Kines. staff, including the grad secretary . The \"expert\" and \"controlling party\" for online room reservations calendar is the Kines. undergrad assistant (Rm. 1001 Nat, phone: 262-1690). The undergrad assistant is the only person who can immediately confirm (or reject) your reservation. The grad secretary (or others) may enter your date-&-time for a particular room, subject to its availability at the time(s) you specify , but confirmation may take several business days. You are free to choose any room you want - if available - in the Nat - or not. Room reservations in the Nat are first -come, first -served , with \"requester rank\" or even in \"low demand\" times, booking \"right away\" (as soon as you can) is good protection of your own interests. Assuming \"conferral date\" of your degree does concern you and you do want to meet the degree deadline, you should set your final defense- date consistent with the degree- deadline and other procedures of this Handbook and the Bound Copy Thesis Deposit instructions memo in the Forms Appendix and the memo's embedde d links . A facsimile of the same memo concludes this section 8 of the Handbook, below. If you d ecide not to book your defense -room through the grad secretary, then do please still notify the grad secretary of your final date, time & place, once you have booked them. This will allow correct and timely announcements. See below in this Handbook, under the section for \"announcements required at least 1+ week ahead.\" Request the Warrant 3+ Weeks Ahead The MS defense involves a timing -related task, primarily for the grad secretary (working with you). The grad secretary must request your \"warrant\" from the Grad School. A warrant is paperwork that a UW department uses to communicate to the Grad School that a student has met all academic requirements, in this case for the MS degree. When Grad School approves the request, it sends a link to the Grad Secretary, who then prints the warrant and holds it in your Kines. Dept. file for you to use. (You can arrange to hold it yourself, if you wish). When a student \"housed\" in the \"Nat\" gets a warrant, the Grad Secretary usually keep s the warrant on- file until the day of the exam . The presumption is that the student conveniently can and will prefer to pick up the warrant from the Kines Grad Office . If students work mainly in the MSC, the WIMR, or anywhere outside the \"Nat,\" then th ose students will likely prefer to keep their own warrant s in their own files, because it probably is not convenient for them to pick up the warrant from the Grad Secretary on the day of the defense (physical distance between \"Nat\" & the student's defense location ). Grad School says that it likes a warrant to request to arrive at least 3 weeks prior to the date of intended use , i.e. 3 weeks before the defense date. Grad School uses the 3-week period to check and approve the credentials of Defense Committee members. The actual warrant turn- around times have - in general - gone down drastically since Grad School moved to online warrant requests . At times of peak workload at Grad School , however , e.g. at the end of a semester, it can in fact take several weeks to get a warrant approved. \"Play it safe\" and plan for at least \"3 week notice \" (or more) all-year-round. Your warrant -request planning might be easier if you know that you do not need a final, firm defense -date to request a warrant. An approximate defense -date is fine on the request . You can \"update\" t he defense -date from your request as necessary when you fill in the actual warrant - no penalty for estimating wrong. The thesis title may also be tentative for the warrant -request. Page | 43 Only the committee members' names must be final on the defense warran t reques t, since the committee credentials are what Grad School will be checking and \"approving\". To avoid delays/ disappointment, consider acting in reasonable anticipation of what you want to happen, i.e. request the warrant with an \"estimated\" defense date as soon as you can. Then you can \"lock in\" a specific day with your committee after you (we) request the warrant. If, however, you end up decid ing that you can't or won't hold to the planned semester defense after we request the warrant, then please inform the grad secretary, who can stay current in the record -keeping and notify Grad School as a courtesy , pending a new/ replace ment warrant -request at a future date. Announcements Required A t Least 1 Week Ahead A timing -related MS defense task is to post announcements (8.5x11 \"posters\") of your defense at least a week before you do it. The grad secretary will do this for you. You are free to \"supplement\" on your own with posters, e -mails, or personal contacts. RESEARCH PROPOSALS FOR M.S. STUDENTS In programs that require a thesis, a graduate student must do an oral and a written proposal. The student must be enrolled in 990 (\"Research or Thesis\") when proposing. The major professor (or the student) must communicate the proposal ti me, date, location, and subject/ \"working title\" of thesis to the Graduate Secretary, who announces the proposal to faculty and graduat e students at least one week prior to the proposal. The Kines practice of \"announcing\" a defense stems from it being an academic event of wider interest. This is because the student is describing new research that will contribut e to the field. Thus , a defense is \"announce d,\" and it is (partly) open to \"the public. \" Generally , that \"public\" is mostly \"insiders\", and when your committee offers its critiques/ edits/ evaluations of your work, it will likely excuse/ exclude any \"audience\". If you want the support of an audience of collaborators, fellow students, family or friends for the \"public\" portion of the defense, then the most effective way to get them there is personally to inform them. The grad secretary's past practice was to \"re -cycle\" the thesis proposal poster for the thesis defense (if committee & thesis title haven't changed - if they change, that is easily acc ommodated, but be sure that you notify the grad secretary). Thesis Preview Copies to Committee Are Required. FORMAT AND PREVIEW DISTRIBUTION OF THE THES IS. The major professor/ advisor determines , with the approval of the other members of the thesis committee , the format of the examination . The student must give a written copy of the thesis to the thesis committee member s at least seven days prior to the scheduled oral defense. Progression/ Continuation from MS to Ph D - (or Not) The MS warrant has an important ancillary communication aspect . That i s its \"check -box\" with which the student indicates to Grad School whether the student will (or will not) continue for the PhD. If you will continue, then be sure to check the box on the final, signed w arrant before you return it to Grad School. \"Continuation\" from Grad School's perspective . For purposes of \"the warrant,\" in other words, for purposes of communi cating to Grad School, a \"continuation \" to the PhD means \"continuing continuously,\" i.e. with uninterrupted enrollment, i.e. no \"break\" in grad study. This so-called \"continuous registration \" mandat es enrollment in fall & spring, but is optional in summer , unless the student is in certain statuses or doing certain activities , see e.g. https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=enrollmentrequirements \"Continuation \" from the Kines Dept. perspective . Kines does not require that you continue uninterrupted from the MS to the PhD. A \"break\" in grad status , i.e. not being \"continuously\" enrolled, i.e. any Fall or a Spring semester without enrollment, would entail a \"re-entry\" application . If you do break continuous \"grad\" status, then you must request re-entry to \"grad\" status via Grad School Admissions. A re-entry application was \"free\" (fee waived) until about 2015, but Grad School now handle s it the same as any new applicant; the re-entry application fee is $75 (as of August 2017) . Summer enrollment is generally not required to remain \"continuous\" in your enrollment, but see e.g. https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=enrollmentrequirements . Probably the more important aspect of \"breaking\" grad study - assuming you plan to continue for the PhD eventually - is to assure yourself that your advisor supports your choice. The handlin g of a \"re-entry\" by the Kines. Dept. is, or can be, \"pro forma,\" i.e. as long as the advisor is open to resumption of advis ing, then your \"re-entry\" application to Grad School does not need to re-submit a statement, references, GRE scores, etc. You would only need to fill in the \"mandatory minimum\" fields of the Grad School online application for (re-)admission, submit the Page | 44 application , and pay the \"fee.\" Then the grad secretary would check with the advisor (to confirm consent to resume advising) and would \"code\" you for re-admission. This would likely take a week or two (after the online application arrives). Use the Continuation Check -Box on the warrant to tell Grad School how to \"code\" you in their computer . The coding affects their future communications with you and, e.g. their \"release\" of your continued authorization for grad registration (course enrollment). If you are not continuing, then Grad School will not \"release\" your continued enrollment. Thus the indication of PhD- continuation (or not), ideally , should accurately reflect your actual current plans. The \"check -box\" on the warrant for \"continuing in the PhD\" can remain blank until the last minute , i.e. until submittal of the signed warrant. So you have several months to \"make decisions \" (within the context of planning for progression to the PhD). Continuation (from MS to PhD in Kines) - a \"How -To\" (\"Must Do\") As regards continuing for the PhD for Department's purposes, the Kines approach to doing this is as follows: M.S. CANDIDATES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF KINESIOLOGY AT UW -MADISON APPLYING FOR ADMISSION TO THE PH.D. PROGRAM A student should request permission to pursue the Ph.D. degree by the end of the second year of study. Forward a request to the Graduate Coordinator for consideration b y the Graduate Studies Committee. The request should include: 1. A letter from the student describing graduate study plans; 2. Two letters of recommendation, one from the student's advisor and one from another faculty member; and 3. An updated transcript of graduate study (unofficial/ internal copy suffices). You can approach the Kines Grad Studies Committee via your advisor and provide brief documentation describing your PhD goals and reflecting faculty support for them. This does not necessarily \"need to precede\" your \"progression\" to the PhD, but if you finish the MS and begin doing PhD work, e.g. course work, without a firm commitment from the Grad Studies Committee, then you do assume a certain risk that your approach for continuation could be rejected (and your interim work end up being for naught). Learning Assessment Rubric Required An assessment rubric is required for the MS Defense. Read more about rubrics in Section 6 of this Handbook, \"Degree Generally ,\" under the sub -heading of \" Assessment Rubrics Required for Research -MS and PhD Students.\" Note! There are four variants of the assessment rubric form. Although all are similar in format, they differ slightly in cont ent. All four forms are in the Forms Appendix of this Handbook. If you choose to use a form from the Appendix, please select the form carefully, according to its intended use. The Kines grad secretary also can supply the appropriate form. Committee Signing of the Warrant & Rubric When your blank MS warrant arrives back from Grad School (via a \"link\"), the Kines grad secretary will print it and notify you. Typically , the grad secretary then holds the printed warrant for the student to pick up on the defense date (or whenever convenient before then). While the warrant is in the Kines grad office, the grad secretary will (or can) fill in the detail on final defense date. (You may also fill it in yourself, if you prefer.) Past practice was to wait for \"fill -in\" of date(s) until \"the day of,\" in case the student or committee had to change plans to meet unexpected last minute developments. If you work outside \"the Nat,\" and particularly if you hold your defense in a building other than the Nat, then it will proba bly be inconvenient for you to pick up your warrant from the Grad Secretary on the defense -date. You may make any other reasonable arrangements for \"storage\" of the warrant so that i t is conveniently available to you at your defense. You will need your committee members to sign the warrant. You can probably do this most efficiently if you do it as soon as you successfully defend, right in the defense room, before the committee members depart (and potentially scatter for breaks, conference travel, or otherwise become less accessible than they will be when they assemble t o hear your defense) . \"Forcing\" warrant signing \"in the defense room\" is only a procedural suggestion, subject to your discretion . It is absolutely acceptable to wait and gather signatures after the defense if you want to, and if you have time to, and if you feel that you can reliably gain access to each Committee member. It is possible that one (or several) of your Committee members might decline to immediately sign, e.g. if they insist that yo u first complete an y recommended \"edits.\" I f that happens, then of course you will need to accommodate i t. Please provide the K ines grad office with a photocopy of the signed thesis warrant for your permanent Department file, or bring the original warrant by the office and let the grad secretary make a copy of it. (This is strictly a procedural suggestion with no official policy behind it , but it is helpful for \"institutional memory\"/ long -term administration of the grad program to document major milestones; to show \"on record\" that what we thought would happen actually did happen in the grad careers of students in the Department.) Page | 45 Return Warrant to Grad School Your signed original MS defense warrant will need to get to UW Grad School's Office of Academic Services in Room 217 Bascom Hall. By their signatures, your committee \"warrants\" to the Grad School that you have qualified for the master's degree, and Grad School will then organize it with the Registrar & other UW administrators so that your degree can be \"conferred\" and recorded. Although the grad secretary can transmit your signed warrant via campus mail (\"inter -Department \"), you may wish to consider personally \"walk ing it through\" (to Grad School). The warrant has high significance to your study career. Also, Grad School, in Bascom Hall, is \"on the way\" to the Memorial Library . As of Au gust 2017, that is where thesis -based/ research -MS students must go anyway to deposit their thesis . See thesis -deposit sample -memo in the Forms Appendix , following in this Handbook, or see a facsimilie deposit -memo, below, the last item in this Section 8 of the Handbook. If you find you cannot make the time to do a personal delivery of your signed warrant to Bascom Hall, please inform the grad secretary , who may wa nt to consider \"walking it through\" for you - to protect the investment, as it were. You may also elect a \"proxy \" from among your lab-mates, or others. This is another procedural suggestion for your potential benefit; there is no policy requiring personal delivery of a warrant to the Grad School . Thesis Deposit upon Advisor Approval The UW Memorial Library will not accept your final thesis deposit unless it includes a signed thesis -advisor approval -page. The Library will tell its bindery providers to bind the approval -page into the Library's archival thesis copy. A draft thesis approval -page is in the F orms Appendix of this Handbook. You may insert your \"particulars\" in this form yourself and print it on paper to match the rest of your thesis pages, if you wish, or you can stop by the Kines grad office and have the grad secretary print the approval -page on standard \"copier paper\". If you dislike the font, layout or wording of the advisor -approval -page, you may change its format, preserving the intent (of documenting advisor approval). Your advisor signs the approval -form upon becoming satisfied that you have taken care of any edits that your defense committee might have demanded to finalize your thesis as archive -ready. Edits appear to be a \"standard\" aspect of a defense committee's review. Your advisor can offer a first-hand perspective on how much time you should build into your planning so you have time for edits . Please provide the K ines grad office with a photocopy of the signed thesis deposit approval form ; the reason is the same as above , regarding the signed warrant copy : It helps document your progress for future review after \"memory\" may have faded . Grad https://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/mastersproc/ might be a useful alternate presentation of the complexit ies of degree attainment. It might have supplemental information beyond what is in this Handbook. If the Handbook is not helpful, consider the Grad Schoo link, but please do not feel that you must turn to online help. Feel free to contact a Kines grad program representative for personal assistance. Commencement (Graduation Ceremony) if you wish . For details , see \"C ommencement\" in section 6 of this Handbook . Thesis Copies for Department For further important information (& probably some redundancy) about bound thesis copies for the Dept., and about their deposit, timing, etc., please see the bound- thesis -copies memo in the Forms Appendix . A facsimile/ sample memo also follows immediately . Date: Feb. 30, 2018 TO: M. S. Student Page | 46 FROM: Kinesiology Grad Program Office, Room 1013 Natatorium Phone 262-8730, kinesgrad@education.wisc.edu RE: Bound copies of your master's thesis Kinesiology grad students are required to prepare at least three copies of their final master's thesis. You will likely benefit from reading the formatting and procedural requirements at the Graduate School web site, \"Completing Your Degree\", http://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/degree/ . Some of its \"embedded links\" might not pertain to you. I would, however, especially call to your attention the ones for \"degree deadlines\" . You can always seek my input for clarification of any web information gaps or overload. Your three required MS thesis copies will have distribution as follows. 1) An original, unbound copy must be deposi ted at the UW Memorial Library. You (or somebody you trust, or \"inter -D mail,\" if you trust that) must deliver this unbound thesis, including signed advisor approval page, to the Bindery Preparations Department, B137 Memorial Library (phone 262-3294). The Library will bind this copy and permanently retain it. The cost of binding this copy is included in student fees. There is no additional cost. The Graduate School will not officially grant your master's degree until the Library confirms thesis deposit. If you do not deposit by or before your targeted degree deadline (see web sites above), then a missed deadline would delay the official date-of-record for conferral of your degree. Remaining copies required by the Kinesiology Graduate Program Policies & Procedures Manual are: 2) A bound thesis copy shall be delivered to the Major Advisor. 3) A bound thesis copy shall be delivered to the Kinesiology Grad Program Office, Room 1013 Natatorium - Gym Unit II. This copy will be retained in the Department Library. The student is responsible for the costs of binding the 2nd and 3rd copies, and you may choose your submittal timing (unless your advisor sets a deadline). Reasonable promptness is appreciated. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Thank you. Copy to: Prof. U. R. de Fiutsher, Major Advisor Possible Thesis Binding providers Two local sources for thesis binding are Bob's Copy Shop, http://www.bobscopyshop1.com/ , or \"base\" cost at Grimm's wa s $52 per thesis bound if you supply \"clean copy\" of your own printed pages for each thesis that you ask the provider to bind. Grimm will work from a PDF but it adds costs for printing. Binding p roduction time at Grimm is one week . Consult the provider that you choose for details or updates . This paragraph is not an endorsement of either \"local provider .\" There are certainly others (in Madison, in -state, online; check with your fellow students), and you are free to choose any bindery source you wish. The recent \"norm\" for binding in Kines h as been book -bound hard cover, and you can see exam ples in the Department Library, Room 2007 Nat. Some students choose to use less expensive binding options, and some of those examples are in the Library , too. If you wish to consider them, please seek your advisor's consent.

During PhD study, a student must take and pass a Preliminary Exam (\"prelims\") , sometimes called a comprehensive exam (\"comps\"). The prelims assure the advisor and other faculty reviewers that the student has gained sufficient didactic knowledge to conduct independent research successfully and produce a dissertation of publishable quality . As with any academic matter, al ways be sure to keep your advisor involved in and informed of your progress toward prelims . Prelim inary Exams Policy at Grad School Here is Grad School's \"prelims\" link: https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=preliminaryexaminations - or - if the prior link fails, try clicking https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/ , and then scroll to \"preliminary.\" Successful prelims completion, documente d by return to Grad School of a signed prelims warrant, signals the student's entry into dissertator status. For purposes of the immediate topic, dissertator status means that Grad School will prohibit the student from doing further didactic/ classroom study. Compare: Dissertator Status FAQ, https://kb.wisc.edu/gradsch/page.php?id=30324 . For further discussion, continue reading this Handbook. The Kines Dept. describes \"preli ms\" as follows: PRELIMINARY EXAMINATIONS FOR KINESIOLOGY PH.D. STUDENTS Preliminary examinations (\"prelims\") are taken at or near the completion of the PhD course work. A WARRANT (\"FORM\" FOR SIGNATURES) IS NEEDED for prelims. The Department Graduate Office request s the warrant (\"e-Request\") from the Graduate School . Upon receiving the request, the Graduate School checks the student records for incomplete grade s (\"I\"). If grades are in order , the Grad School will issue a warrant to the Dept. Grad Office. GENERAL FIELD REQUIREMENT When beginning to consider Prelims, the student (or the advisor) should tell the Kines Grad Secretary which G eneral Field Requirement (GFR) courses the student took so a form can be prepared, signed by the advisor, and fi led in the Department . Page | 48 THE PRELIMS COMMITTEE consists of the student's major professor/advisor and two other graduate faculty members , one of whom must be a Kinesiology graduate faculty member. THE PRELIMS CONSIST OF A WRITTEN EXAM FOLLOWED BY AN ORAL EXAM. The written portion will consist of four 4-hour sessions taking place over two consecutive days. The oral portion must occur within two weeks following completion of the written portion, with no time limit. The Graduate Studies Committee must approve exceptions to the format of either portion, written or oral. IF THE EXAMINATION IS NOT SATISFACTORY, THE STUDENT MAY REPEAT IT ONCE . Regardless of the outcome of the preliminary examination , i.e., whether the student passes or fails, the student (or the advisor) must : RETURN THE WARRANT TO THE KINES. DEPT. GRAD OFFICE . The Grad Office will return the fully signed warrant form (upon successful completion of both written and oral portions of prelims ) to the Graduate School . The Grad School puts the student into dissertator status at the beginning of the immediately following semester (provided all other requirements were satisfied ). Some times a student who enters dissertator status is informally said to have been \"admitted to candidacy \" for the Ph.D. Compare, e.g. https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=certificateofdoctoralcandidacy Prelims Warrant - Info Needed to Request You will need a \"warrant\" for prelims. The warrant is documentation for the Graduate School that didactic study is concluding and that the student is ready to enter dissertator status, do research, and complete a dissertation. The grad secretary must \"e-Request\" the prelims warrant from the Grad School, using info you provide , namely: Your proposed exam date , minimum 3 weeks ahead. The warrant -request can list an \"estimated \" exam date, and this allows you to request a warrant as soon as you set a \"likely target date\" with your committee - there is no penalty if it turns out \"wrong\" - you aren't required to use a warrant after receiving it for a particular semester; it can be revised/ re- requested in a future semester . Grad School wants at least 3 weeks to \"process\" any request. To assure yourself of timely warrant delivery, consider requesting your warrant as soon as your committee can agree to a date. Names of your minimum three prelims commit tee members . The Kines Dept. describes a prelims committee as having three members, see above at \"The Prelims Committee,\" under \"Preliminary Examinations for Kinesiology Ph.D. Students .\" It would be rare for a prelims committee to have more than three members. T he Graduate School does not monitor prelims committees. Grad School will closely monitor the dissertation committee, and that has rather \"particular\" requirements, see e.g. https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/#committees . Prelims committee members often become PhD committee member s. This implies that you should \"think about\" prelims committee members in consultation with your advisor, who will chair all your committees. NOTE that departmen ts may set STRICTER committee requirements than Grad School's for the dissertation committee. This means that you probably ought to \"start\" within the Kines. Dept. in selecting a committee and decid ing, if needed, whether to request a \"waiver\" (from the Kines. Grad Studies Committee) for any \"non -qualifying\" member = any Non-graduate -faculty member of your future dissertation committee. KINESIOLOGY PhD COMMITTEES HAVE FIVE TENURE -TRACK FACULTY. At least one committee member must be from outside the Department of Kinesiology. The Chairperson must be from the Department of Kinesiology. All committee members must be full, associate, or assistant professor s in any department with graduate program au thority. [NOTE: The Kines. Graduate Studies Committee, in May 2017, voted to accept the following committee structure: Four committee members must be tenure -track faculty (full, associate, or assistant) holding professorial rank in any department with graduate program authority. The fifth committee member is not required to be tenure -track faculty, but must have completed doctoral training or the equivalent . The GSC expects the new structure to gain approval by all Department faculty in approximately Septem ber 2017. Consult a Kines grad program representative for details after that time.] Completion date(s) - & area(s) - of your minor(s) - if any. Kines PhD students , as of September 2015, are no longer required to have a minor, but they may choose to have a minor (or multiple minor s). Student s officially communicate minor(s), if any, to the Graduate School on the Prelims warrant, and the warrant -request must list any minor(s), with completion date(s). The minors will need to be complete (or on-track for completion) in the semester that the warrant will be signed , because didactic study is impermissible in dissertator status, which is attained in the semester immediately following turn-in of the prelims warrant . Page | 49 PhD Minor The Kines Dept. worked with Grad School and, effective September 2015, Kines PhD students are exempt from a required minor . Kines PhD students are exempt from a Minor based on the following principles: Disciplines within Kinesiology span the study of cells (e.g. physiology, neuroscience) to behavior (motor control, biomechanics, and exercise psychology) to populations (exercise epidemiology) . As such, graduate study in our department exposes s tudents to broad areas of inquiry. Further b readth in Kinesiology derives from the General Field Requirement. If you will have no minor, indic ate that when you request your p relims warrant . The Graduate School 's \"historical standard\" called for a PhD student to get a minor. Thus the Grad School's routine review of warrants, e.g. for statistical summaries, might \"red flag\" a prelims warrant that is silent on a minor. The Kines grad secretary may \"infer\" no -minor from an absence of stated mino r, but fuller and more efficient communication would result from the student's express indication. Kines PhD students may choose to pursue a minor . PhD students , in consultation with their advisor , may elect one minor or multiple minors. The Grad School Minor policy is here, http://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/ , for students interested in the Minor (s). A minimum nine credits of coursework are required for a minor. The Graduate School policy includes two variants of the minor , one including two or more departments (a \"distributed\" minor) , and the other a minor within a single department. NOTE that some departments have quite specific procedures for the content of their minor. If you pursue a single -department minor, seek specific guidance in advance from the minor -granting department about how to meet any requirements it may have for its minor. Most PhD students who elect a minor will have one minor, but they may elect multiple minors. For a single- department minor , that department must sign the Preliminary Exam warrant to certify to the Grad School that the student attained the \"external\" ( single -department ) minor. At least one Kines student tried for a minor in a department that decline d to sign for its minor when it determined that the student did not follow prescribed minor procedures . This was d espite substantial course work by the student in th at minor department and despite , arguably, rather esoteric m inor procedures. Work closely in advance with the Minor -granting Department to meet its minor requirements, including that Department's Minor form, if any. This is the safe way to avoid disappointment in attaining the minor that you wish to have a nd getting what you wish to appear on your UW records/ transcripts. The minor department may assign a specific representative to handle its minors, and if so, you should familiarize yourself with that representative in advance . Use the Kinesiology -internal Minor form if you are a student who choose s to minor - a sample form is in the Forms Appendix of this Handbook. Please do not confuse the Kinesiology form with an outside department's form. They are not interchangeable. An outside department may - or may not - use a form. You always need the Kinesiology minor form if you have a minor. This includes a \"distributed\" minor, where no single outside department produces its own minor form. For a \"distributed\" minor, the Kinesiology Dept. chair must sign the Prelims warrant. Any m inor (s) must be complete by time of the Preliminary Exam warrant , because completion of the \"Prelims\" triggers entry into \"dissertator\" status. Dissertators are in a special fee status, which, among other things, prevents the s tudent from pursuing didactic courses. (A pen alty pertains if a student violates dissertator status.) Thus, any minor(s) must be complete by the time the student enters into dissertator status. Didactic courses may be in -progress in the semester that a student takes Prelims, but those courses and all didactic course s need to be on -track for completion before the subsequent semester, when dissertator stat us begin s. Further discussion of dissertator status follow s in this Handbook , e.g. section on \"Dissertator Status Attained After Prelims Passed .\" Prelims Logistics The preliminary exam has two \"main\" parts: one written; one oral. For a detailed description of t he \"format ,\" see above , under \"Preliminary Examinations for Kinesiology Ph.D. Students .\" Advisor discretion is substantial, but format departures must seek and obtain Grad Studies Committee approval . Place(s) for both written & oral portions of prelims . You will need some \"place(s)\" to do the two parts of the exam, written and oral. You will need to consider your \"production\" preferences (& your committee's) . If you wish to hand -write answers, then almost any \"place \" can work. If you prefer a keyboard for drafting your answers, then you may need to find a computer/ printer , possibly including one without \"connectivity,\" depending on your committee's allowance of internet access &/or their acceptance of an \"honor system\" for not accessing it. Most academic computers nowadays \"automatically\" have \"connectivity.\" Historically a \"writing room\" was available in the Nat, although as of July Page | 50 2017, access to that writing room , a formerly vacant office, became restricted with the assignment of the room to an occupant. Leave time to \"figure it out\" if you need to rely on \"shared resources\" for your writing room. If you are primarily an \"MSC\" or a \"WIMR\" person, then you or your advisor will need to use your MSC / WIMR experience to \"book a room\" according to procedures there. You will need a physical space to accommodate a group of four at the oral portion (\"defense\") of the prelims. Historically , the \"defense room\" that was \"most used\" i n the Nat was Room 2007, a conference room accommodating up to about twenty persons. You may reserve Rm. 2007, or another Nat room . Current reservation procedures call for you to reserve Rm. 2007, or a ny \"Nat\" space, in an online calendar accessible to most Kines. staff, including the grad secretary . The \"expert\" and \"controlling party\" for the online room reservations calendar is the Kines. undergrad assistant (Rm. 1001 Nat, phone: 262- 1690). The under grad assistant is the only person who can immediately confirm (or reject) your reservation. The grad secretary (or others) may enter your date- &-time for a particular room, subject to its availability at the time(s) you specify, but confirmation may take o ne to two business days. Your advisor may wish to use a \"proctor\" for the written prelims, depending on how you arrange to distribute the questions and answers . The grad secretary can sometimes \"proctor\" a written prelim exam , but the grad secretary is \"geographically restricted,\" i.e. if you write in the MSC, it's not realistic for the Nat-based grad secretary to hand out or pick up your questions from four sessions over two days. Often the task of \"proctoring\" falls to the major professor/ advisor (or designe e). Electronic distribution of questions and return of answers can relieve \"personal proctoring\" issues, but if the student is \"keying\" answers, and if the computer chosen for the written exam has no \"connectivity,\" then \"distribution issues\" remain . As mundane as it may seem, you should \"think through\" the process you will use and leave time to meet your needs. The grad secretary can assist as available. Get \"hands on\" Prelims warrant , tim e it per student's geographic location & preferences When Grad School approves your \"prelims\" warrant , they send a link to the Grad Secretary (the person who made the e-Request) . The Grad Secretary print s the warrant from the link. When a student \"housed\" in the \"Nat\" gets a warrant, the Grad Secretary usually keep s the warrant on-file until the day of the exam . The presumption is that the student conveniently can and will prefer to pick up the warrant from the Kines Grad Office . If students work mainly in the MSC, the WIMR, or anywhere outside the \"Nat,\" then those students will likely prefer to keep their warrant s in their personal files, because it probably isn't convenient to pick up the warrant from the Grad Secretary on the day of the exam (physical distance between \"Nat\" & the other location ). Plan for & get signature(s) for PhD Minor (s), if any PhD Minor (s) became optional in Kinesiology in 2015. If you have any minor(s), the Prelims warrant must detail that. The student uses the Prelims warrant officially to communicate minor(s), if any, to the UW administrative offices, via the Graduate School. You must obtain s ignature(s) on the warrant to verify minor completion. The signature provider varies with type of minor. For any \"single -department minor(s)\" the associated minor department's assigned representative must sign the Prelims Warrant. The Kinesiology Dept. chair signs your Prelims warrant for a \"distributed\" minor. Typically, the Kines. Dept. chair will be available to sign a prelims warrant essentially simultaneously to signing by the prelim s committee. There might be some exceptions to chair availability, e.g. illness, sabbatical, travel , vacation . While there is typically an \"acting chair\" available , if you face time constraints, e.g. if your oral exam date is near the beginning of the semester in which you want to enter dissertator status, then you may wish to gather the distributed -minor signature ahead of your oral exam. How & when you gather an \"outside\" signature for a single -department minor will depend on what that Minor Dept. demands - you must do what they want. Especially if you face time constraints to turn in your Prelims warrant , you may decide to obtain the Prelims warrant several days (or several weeks) ahead of your Prelims oral exam so you can gather any Minor signature before your Prelims committee signs . You may wish to consult the minor department in advance to assure yourself that that department's representative will be willing to sign your warrant before the Prelims committee signs. Given that the minor department and the prelims committee are \"signing for different purposes\"/ verifying different achievements, it seems unlikely that they would perceive a \"signing priority\" or \"sequence,\" but administrative discretion can be sub stantial. If it's no problem for you to \"get to\" your minor department, or if you want to \"take your chances\" on someone signing, then there is no \"rule\" about checking ahead. You may get your warrant whenever and however you wish (after Grad School approve s your warrant and the Kines Grad secretary has print ed and filed it). Just inform the Grad Secretary of what you want to do. Your minor (s) must be complete (or on-track for completion) in the semester that the warrant will be signed , because passing Prelims signals entry into dissertator status, when no further \"didactic\" study is permitted. Page | 51 Warrant on -hand at Prelim Exam expedites signing, timely entry to Dissertator status The \"main goal\" (procedurally) of handling a Prelims warrant is to be sure the warrant \"in the room\" at the oral exam . That makes it \"easy\" for your committee to put signatures on it as soon as you pass the exam. Even though your committee members might all be easy to \"find later\" for signatures, it is probably still easier if they can sign \"right away.\" Of course , that is your choice (and theirs). Getting signatures \"quickly & conveniently\" can be of small concern if the date of oral exam is early in a semester. Then you will have \"the whole semester\" to return your warrant to Grad School and go into dissertator status at the beginning of the next semester . Here is a link that explains the timing (& other matters) related to \"dissertator\" status, which is the result of passing Prelims . https://kb.wisc.edu/gradsch/page.php?id=30324 The reverse implication is that \"timing\" can become a big concern if you take Prelims near the end of a semester (or shortly before the start of the semester in which you wish to attain dissertator status ). That is when you may truly need to pre-plan for your committee to sign \"on the spot\" at your oral exam. All activities associated with completin g prelims must be final before the first class day of the semester when the student wants dissertator status to begin. If the student completes all prelims activities before the first day of classes in the dissertator semester, but the student cannot turn in the warrant until after the semester begins, then the Grad School will normally allow the dissertator status, effective with that semester. See e.g. https://kb.wisc.edu/gradsch/page.php?id=30324 Prelims warrant to Grad School After you pass the oral exam, your committee signs your warrant and you return it to Grad School. The grad secretary can return the warrant via inter-departmental mail. Consider protecting your interests by personally delivering the document that has high significance to your academic advancement. Kines Grad Office copy of Prelims warrant, please The Kines. Grad Office strongly hopes to receive from you a photocopy of the signed Prelims warrant . This goes into your Kines file to \"document\" a major academic milestone . This can be especially important in case of staffing changes or mishandling/ misrouting of paperwork. The Kines file copy , however, is optional. Dissertator Status Attained After Prelims Passed = No More \"Classroom C ourses\" & No \"Breaks\" Successful submittal to Grad School of your signed prelims warrant gets you \"dissertator\" status at the start of the semester following submittal. Once in dissertator status, you must: remain continuously enrolled (fall & spring, summer \"depends\") or face a penalty; enroll for exactly three credits each Fall and Spring semester - Summer enrollment optional in most cases , see https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=preliminaryexaminations ; take no \"didactic\" courses - or \"seminar\" - in dissertators \"normally\" 0 \"research\" + 1 Cr \"seminar,\" either K.900 Dept. Seminar OR your \"specialization\" seminar, when offered . Grad School has a \"prelims\" policy , https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=preliminaryexaminations , which further discusses t he privileges and restrictions of dissertator status , including in some \"embedded links .\" Grad School has a Dissertator -Status FAQ page , https://kb.wisc.edu/gradsch/page.php?id=30324 You may wish to glance through the Grad School's policy and FAQ (see prior two link s) to as sure yourself that you are comfortable with them before you enter dissertator status. Also, feel free to ask a Kines grad program rep . Summer Registration (Enrollment) Enrollment in summer is \"normally\" not required, with certain exceptions. See e.g. https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/#enrollmentrequirements . Doing Prelims likely would be viewed as \"using university facilities, including faculty and staff time,\" and thus would require enrollment (for a minimum of 2 credits). It can be surpris ing which student activities in the summer do NOT require enrollment. If you want to do academic activity in summer but would prefer not to register, and if the Grad School policy link does not specifically address that activity, then you may wish to seek personal input from the Grad School, or ask the grad secretary to seek clarifying input. Must Have All Courses \"Done\" By Prelims Semester, also t he Kines \"GFR\" It is impermissible for dissertators to do \"didactic\" courses, so you must be sure that you will complete all your required courses, https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/academics/grad -program/ , by the end of the semester in which you submit your prelims warrant. Dissertator status begins with the start of the semester following prelims -warrant submittal. Page | 52 The \"required courses\" for any Kinesiology PhD include satisfaction of the General Field Requirement (GFR). GENERAL FIELD REQUIREMENT FOR THE PH.D. All doctoral students in the Department of Kinesiology must satisfy the General Field Requirement by completing at least two graduate level Kinesiology courses of at least 2 credits each (4-6 credits total) at UW-Madison and outside of the major specialization/ track/ area of concentration. A student should notify the Department Graduate Office of which courses fulfill the GFR. The Grad Office then creates a form to keep in the Kines file. The advisor signs the form, which the student (or advisor) must return to the Kines Grad Office by the time the Prelim s are completed. The student must have completed the GFR courses on the UW-Madison campus and must not have used them to fulfill an undergraduate deficiency or the requirements of the master's degree. Learning Assessment Rubrics - two forms for prelims Two assessment rubric s are required for Prelims. T he written exam and oral exam have separate rubric forms. Read more o n rubrics in Section 6 of this Handbook, \"Degree Generally,\" in the sub -heading \"Assessment Rubrics Required MS & PhD Students.\" Note! There are four variants of the assessment rubric form. Although all are similar in format, they differ slightly in cont ent. All four forms are in the Forms Appendix of this Handbook. If you use a form from the Appendix, please select your form carefully, according to its intended use. The Kines grad secretary also can supply the appropriate form. Assessment Rubric Required for Prelims A learning assessment \"rubric\" requirement for prelims (and other grad -study events) began in February 2017. Kines. Grad Studies Committee chair Prof. Mason e-mailed about it as follows (for your reference, or your committee's , when using the Rubric form). A prelims rubric form is in the Forms Appendix of this Handbook . Note that rubric forms differ slightly for proposals, defenses, and prelims , and prelims have separate rubric forms for the written exam and the oral exam . Be sure you select the correct form for the academic event you are doing. If you are unsure, consult a grad program rep. Distribution of rubric forms can be either \"print\" or electronic or both . Early indications are that committee members seem ed to prefer using a printed Rubric , but an electronic response certainly is possible. One faculty member raised the question of a possible \"artificiality\" in separate Written and Oral Rubrics for a \"continuous process\" of Prelims, but that is the prescribed format of Rubrics for now. (The Grad Studies Committee, which implemented Rubrics at Grad School request, likely would be open to faculty or student suggestions for Rubric process changes .) Rubric return is to the student and to the Dept. Grad Ofc. Rubrics are to be returned to the student (to learn from ) and by the student to the Kines grad secretary (to file for \"statistical report s\" the Dept. does annually on rubrics overall ). Early indications were that some faculty members prefer to turn in Rubrics directly to the Kines. Grad Secretary , and this is permissible . A February 2017 E xplanatory E-mail on Rubrics is as follows. Dear faculty and graduate students, We were asked by the Graduate School to implement assessment rubrics for our graduate thesis/ dissertation proposals and defenses and preliminary exams. We developed and distribute d rubrics forms We will begin using them immediately. It is our hope that these will become a valuable tool for both students and committee members. They will also be used by the graduate studies committee to complete a formal assessment of our program at the end of each year. All assessment rubrics for a given year will be collected and used by the graduate studies committee to write our report to the graduate school. When students are ready to propose, defend or complete their preliminary exams, it is their responsibility to ensure that each of their committee members has a print or electronic version of the appropriate assessment rubric. These can be obtained from the graduate secretary prior to the event. We ask that committee members take no more than 1-week after the proposal/ defense/ prelim to complete the form and return it to the student and to the graduate secretary. It is important to note that the pass/ fail decision for the proposal/ defense/ prelim is not based on any single element from the rubrics. The pass/ fail decisions will continue to be made by the committee as a whole, based on closed -session discussions. We look forward to receiving your feedback on the assessments as you begin to use them. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions. Andrea Mason, PhD Professor and Chair of Graduate Studies Page | 53 Section 10, Proposing & Defending your PhD dissertation As always, please be sure that you consult and inform your advisor . While y ou do research, you generate work and paperwork that suppor t your ultimate a ttainment of a PhD. That work is beyond the scope of this Handbook . If you make satisfactory progress, then at some point, you and your advisor will agree that you are on -track to generate a publishable -quality book -length report of your PhD work . This report will be your \"dissertation.\" Near that time, with advisor support, you must formally \"propose\" the planned dissertation to a committee of subject -matter experts. Your advisor chairs this proposal committee. If the proposal committee appr oves your propos ed dissertation project , then you continue with your research plan until you actually have the dissertation (or are close to having it) . You will need to defend the dissertation by making a presentation and answering questions from a defens e committee, also composed of subject -matter experts. The defense committee generally has the same membership as the proposal committee had. You must give dissertation draft copies to the defense committee members. Then you \"defend\" the dissertation draft, i.e. you make a presentation and answer questions related to the dissertation at a time and place that the committee agrees to . If the majority of your committee members find that your defense is acceptable, then the members will sign a \"warrant\" document . By their signatures, t hey warrant to UW -Madison administrators that you qualify for a PhD. You return the warrant -document to the Graduate School on a schedule that i t sets each semester. Grad School confers your PhD (puts it into UW -Madison records) wit h an effective -date based on the deadlines in its schedule. The following sections of this Handbook address this PhD award process , first with summaries/ checklists, followed by details/ discussion/ explanation . Think about your defense \"early ,\" i.e. as you plan your proposal due to committee overlap. Proposal and defense tend to have features in common. One significant feature- in-common is that the proposal committee members tend to remain and serve as the defense committee members. The Graduate School wi ll carefully review committee membership at the defense stage. Grad School will not review proposal membership, but your choice of members for your proposal should address the likelihood of Grad School ultimately review ing members at the defense stage.

Page | 54 Section 10. b., PhD Proposal Detail/ Discussion/ Explanation You must propose your dissertation project to a committee. RESEARCH PROPOSALS FOR PH.D. STUDENTS An oral and a written proposal are required for a dissertation. The student must enroll in 742 -990 (Research or Thesis) during the semester of the p ropos al. The major professor provide s information on the proposal time, date, location, and subject matter (working -title of dissertation) to the Graduate Secretary , who announce s the proposal to faculty and graduate students at least one week before the proposal. The purpose of the proposal is to get input and approval from the dissertation committee for making a final decis ion about the research approach taken for the dissertation project. The student will provide the members of the committee with a copy of the written proposal at least seven days prior to the oral proposal. The format of the oral presentation and written proposal will be as determined by the major professor/advisor with the approval of the other members of the committee. Committee membership. You are not required to use your Preliminary Exam committee for your PhD proposal, but most students (or their advisors) do choose to start with the Prelims committee and expand it when developing the Proposal committee. You are not required to have five committee members for your proposal, but most students do have five, i.e. the same five to whom they expe ct to defend the completed dissertation . The Graduate School will not review your proposal committee. There is no \"proposal warrant\" or other Grad School paperwork for a proposal. The Kines Dept. will not even communicate your proposal committee to the Grad School. The Grad School will check your committee members in reviewing a required defense warrant . For your defense, your committee will be required to meet Grad School policy, see https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=committees . When you defend, your defense committee will require at least five members . Your grad faculty advisor always chairs all your committee s. Choosing five committee members for your proposal is consistent w ith the purpose of the proposal , i.e. \"to get input and approval... about the research approach.\" You probably increase the likelihood of acceptance for your final dissertation work if you consult all of its likely evaluators , and if you info rm them of what you plan to do, and if you seek their suggestions about how you can best do it. Committees tend to be stable over th e time a student need s to co mplete research and write a dissertation , but sometimes you may confront a retirement, job change, death, or other inability for a committee member to continue serving. You may change your committee members up to the point of request ing your defense warrant from the Graduate School. (You can even change your committee after request ing the defense warrant , if needed , although we would then ne ed to re -submit the warrant -request.) Your selection of Proposal Committee membership is important, because normally the proposal committee members also hear the defense and must then be policy compliant. THE KINESIOLOGY DISSERTATION DEFENSE COMMITTEE HA S FIVE MEMBERS , at least one of whom must be from outside the Department of Kinesiology. The Chairperson must be from the Department of Kinesiology. All committee members must be tenure -track faculty (full, associate, or assistant) holding professorial rank in any department with graduate program authority. [NOTE : The Kines. Graduate Studies Committee, in May 2017, voted to accept the following committee structure: Four committee members must be tenure -track faculty (full, associate, or assistant) holding professorial rank in any department with graduate program authority. The fifth committee member is not required to be tenure -track faculty, but must have completed doctoral training or the equivalent . The GSC expects this structure to gain approval by all Department faculty in September 2017. Consult a grad program representative for details after that time.] PhD Proposal Requires Preview Copies to Committee. FORMAT AND PREVIEW DISTRIBUTION OF THE DISSERTATION . The major professor/ advisor determines , with the approval of the other members of the dissertation committee , the format of the examination. The student must give a written copy of the dissertation to proposal committee member s at least seven days prior to the proposal's scheduled oral defense. The major professor provide s information on the defense time, date, location, and subject matter to the Graduate Secretary who will distribute an announcement to faculty and graduate students at least one week prior to the defense. Your \"procedural\" steps in a PhD Propos al are: Select a space for your proposal, and book a time. The \"most usual\" room in the Kines. Dept. for a proposal is Rm. 2007 Natatorium. It seems to be of appropriate size for the group likely to attend a proposal's \"public\" portion . You aren't required to use that room, and you may choose any space that works for you and your committee . If your grad work occurs mainly in a space other than the Natatorium, it is probably practical to convene your committee in the space most familiar to you/ them. This may i nclude any space available in the MSC or WIMR. Page | 55 You may book Rm. 2007 (or any other Nat room) via the grad secretary , who will need your specific time-request(s) for entry into an online reservation system. Reservations via the Grad Secretary are tentative until approved by the reservation system manager. If you prefer , you can do your booking \"directly\" and \"interactively\" with the reservation system manager, the Kines assistant, ugkines@education.wisc.edu , phone 262-1690, room 1001 Natatorium . If you do not book your room through the grad secretary , i.e. if you use the undergrad assistan t, then please be sure to inform the grad secretary of what you decide (for purposes of your posters). In booking for MSC , for WIMR , or for any room anywhere other than the Natatorium - you are on your own there - you will need to determine and follow established procedures of those other facilities . Tell grad secretary proposed title & committee members, at least 1 week ahead. Grad Secretary must announce the proposal . A proposal is an academic event of wider interest. Th is is because the student will be describing innovative research t hat may contribut e new knowledge to the field. Thus, a proposal is \"announced\" and it is (partly) open to \"the public.\" Generally, that \"public\" is mostly \"insiders\", and when your committee offers its critiques/ e dits/ evaluations of your work, it will likely excuse/ exclude any \"audience\". Proposal a nnouncement s, in practice, are \"poster\" copies (plain black print, 8 -1/2 x 11 paper) placed on bulletin boards in the Nat. Traditionally, one copy goes on the Grad bulletin board opposite Rm. 1013 , one by the Dept. mailboxes near Rm. 1043, one near Rm. 2007, and a couple others on various boards in \"the back halls\". Posters in the \"Nat\" are NOT likely to give \"actual notice\" to your collaborators or mentors, so feel free to put up your own posters, if you wish , in your Lab or work space. Probably the \"true, best way\" to assure a supportive audience, if you want one, is personally to notify your friends, fellow students, or collaborators. Announcements require Who, What, When, Where . The grad secretary will create your announcement/ posters using your input. This requires: Who = your committee members *. What = the working- title of your dissertation project. When = date and clock -time for the proposal. Where = Building name and room number. * For a committee member from outside Kinesiology, please provide a departmental or institutional \"affiliation.\" This helps the grad secretary \"look up credentials,\" primarily involving degree(s), e.g. M D, PhD, DrPH, and status, i.e. graduate faculty. Announce it yourself to those whose presence you value . While required, the announcements/ posters described in the prior section are probably not effective in reaching persons whose support you may find benefi cial at the \"public portion\" of your proposal. Feel free to \"advertise\" on your own, as you wish. Probably the \"true, best way\" to encourage a supportive audience (if you want one for the \"public\" portion of the proposal ) is personally to notify your family, friends, fellow students, or collaborators. Do Your P ropos al, Pass, Get Signatures \" in the room \" from all committee members on the proposal -approval form. Normally , the grad secretary will prepare a proposal approval form using committee member names that the student provides. Often, the grad secretary holds the blank proposal approval form in the student 's file in the Nat , and the student picks it up for use on the proposal date. If you will propose somewhere other than \"the Nat\" (e.g. in MSC, in the WIMR ), then it probably is NOT convenient for you t o leave you approval form with the grad secretary . Students may certainly keep the approval form in their own files. The \"pending\" form can \"live\" anywhere the student finds most use ful. The student may ask the grad secretary to transmit the form by normal business methods . Have the approval -form with you at the proposal. Regardless of who \" holds \" the approval form, or where, the g oal should be for the student to have the approval form available for signing immediately after completion of the proposa l. This will \"make it easy \" for the committee members to sign as soon as they approve the proposal. This saves \"run -around\" later to find the committee members and gather signatures. This is just a suggestion. A sample proposal -approval form is in Forms Appendix of this Handbook . If the grad secretary is unavailable to create the form, or if students simply prefer to make their own form, students are free to use the sample, or any reasonable facsimile, to create an actual approval form. Return the signed proposal approval form to the grad secretary for your Kines. Dept. file. Upon signing by all proposal committee members, the proposal approval form goe s into Kines Dept . archives. It is a Departmental form, and the Graduate School never sees it. If you choose to \"deliver\" the completed (signed) approval form, and should the grad secretary be unavailable in- person, then you may leave the signed form in the grad secretary mail slot in \"the Nat copy room\", Rm. 2023 Nat. There is a supply of empty \"inter -D\" (inter -department) envelopes inside the credenza under the mail slots. Consider using one of the envelopes to protect Page | 56 your approval form and your privacy . If you write \"Grad Office, Rm. 1013 Nat\" on the outside of the envelope, that will help ensure that it reaches its destination. Envelope use is at your discretion; it seems unlikely that others would take much interest in wha t is in the mail slot, but there is a lot a \"traffic\" through the copy room. Learning Assessment Rubric Required An assessment rub ric is required for the PhD Proposal. If you are not familiar with rubrics, you can read more about them in Section 6 of this Handbook, \"Degree s Generally,\" under the sub -heading of Required for Research -MS & PhD Students.\" Note! There are four variants of the assessment rubric form. Although all are similar in format, they differ slightly in content. All fou r forms are in the Forms Appendix of this Handbook. If you use a form from the Appendix, please select your form carefully, acc ording to its intended use. The Kines grad secretary also can supply the appropriate form. Section 10 , continued , Final Dissertation Development After receivig committee approval of your proposed dissertation project, y ou will continue to r esearch and write the dissertation. Eventually you w ill be near to complet ing your dissertation to your advisor's satisfaction , and then you can plan to re-convene your dissertation committee for a final review, typically called a \"defense.\" Sometimes you will see ref erence to a \"final oral exam committee,\" which means the \"defense committee.\" It is possible, although rare, for a defense to follow closely (a few weeks or months) after the proposal. This can depend on , e.g. the student's experimental design, progress, or work habits and choice of administrative / planning approach. When you feel, and your advisor agrees, that you are ready to defend your dissertation, then you will need to \"set it up.\" The set- up steps for the defense are similar to those you did for th e PhD proposal (described, above) . As with the proposal, you (or your advisor) must notify the grad secretary when you are ready to propose. In the case of the PhD defense, unlike the proposal, the Graduate School will exercise committee review, will issue \"blank\" paperwork - a \"warrant\" - and will receive back the completely signed warrant as evide nce that Grad School may grant your PhD. The grad secretary is the job -position in Kinesiology with authorization to request your PhD warrant via an online Grad School process . Grad School asks for at least 3 weeks to \"vet\" your warrant's committee members = review & approve them - or reject them , as Grad School has done on rare occasions. We normally receive the approved \"blank\" warrant (or questions about disapproval) in fewer than 3 weeks, but if you are able to give more than 3-week notice for the warrant request to Grad School , that is the \"safe\" way to preserve your options and prevent disappointment . You will also need to arrange a room to defend in, and policy requires an announcment of the defense (so others can attend it). After committee approval of the defense and signing of the warrant, you provide documentation to the Grad School, which begins a pr ocess for y our PhD degree conferral. Then you are a doctor.

Held in May or December only - none after summer semester Participate before or after deg ree-conferral, if more convenient Plan \"several months\" pre -event to sign up/ fully participate, https://commencement.wisc.edu/ Page | 58 Section 10. d., PhD Defense Detail Explanation = Process to defend PhD (& get it conferred) Grad School offers full -service web site, https://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/doctoralguide/ Defense Scheduling ; Committee Availability ; Room Reservation When your dissertation nears completion, you can plan for its defense. Consult your advisor on when this specific planning should begin. It is p robably early in the semester that you hope to defend. It might even be in the semester prior to your \"defense semester.\" This probably means that you begin to plan for the defense about three to six months before the date that you want to meet with your defense committee. Y ou &/or you r advisor must schedule the defense at a time when your entire committee is available. Availability may include \" remote\" attendance via teleconferencing or online video -chat, e.g. Skype. Ordinarily the PhD Defense committee has the same members as the PhD P roposal committee had, but sometimes membership mus t change due to a member's death or some lesser non-availability . Scheduling a defense committee will probably involve steps very similar to those you took to schedul e your proposal. The \"most usual\" place for a Kines PhD defense is room 2007 Nat. You can reserve Rm. 2007 (or any room in the Natatorium) the same as you may have done for your proposal , i.e. by contacting the grad secretary or by contacting the online reservation system's manager, the Kines undergrad assistant (phone 262- 0259, Rm. 1001 Nat) . Almost any UW room , including Rm. 2007 Nat, is a \"shared resource, \" so any authorized requester s can reserve it \"subject to availability\" (& maybe somewhat subject to \"rank of requestor\" &/or \"importance of event\"). If you have a strong preference for a specific \"place,\" then you maximize your chances of getting that place by booking as early as you can reasonably \"plan.\" You are free to choose any room for your defense , including in the MSC/ UWHC/ WIMR, subject to availability . You should set your final defense date to be consistent with the degree deadline s and other procedures and links below in this Handbook . Request a PhD Warrant 3+ Weeks Ahead The PhD d efense has a timing -related aspect , primarily for the grad secretary (working with you). The grad secretary must request your \"warrant\" from the Grad School. A warrant is paperwork that a UW department uses to communicate to the Grad School that a student has met all requirements for a specific academic designation, in this case, eligibility for the PhD . The grad secretary can request your warrant when you are able to s tate your final Committee and your intended defense semester. When Grad School approves the request, it sends a link to the Grad Secretary, who then prints the warrant for later use. When a student \"housed\" in the \"Nat\" gets a warrant, the Grad Secretary usually keep s the warrant on- file until the day of the exam . The presumption is that the student conveniently can and will prefer to pick up the warrant from the Kines Grad Office . If students work mainly in the MSC, the WIMR, or anywhere outside the \"Nat,\" then th ose students will likely prefer to keep their warrant s in their personal files, because it probably is not convenient for them to pick up the warrant from the Grad Secretary on the day of the exam (physical distance between \"Nat\" & the other location ). You can arrange to hold t he warrant yourself, if you wish, or make any other reasonable arrangements. Grad School says that it likes a warrant to request to arrive at least 3 weeks prior to the date of intended use , i.e. 3 weeks before the defense date. Grad School uses the 3 -week period to check and approve the credentials of your Committee members. The actual turn - around time s have - in general - gone down drastically with the start, a few years ago, of online warrant requests. At times of peak workload at Grad School, however, e.g. at the end of a semester, it can in fact take several weeks to get a warrant approved. \"Play it safe\" and stick with \"3 -week notice \" (or more) all -year-round. Only the committee members' names must be final on the defense warrant request , since the committee credentials are what Grad School wil l be checking and \"approving\". You do not need a firm, final defense- date to request a warrant. An approximate defense -date is fine on the request . The thesis title may also be tentative for the warrant- request. To avoid delays/ disappointment, consider acting in reasonable anticipation of what you want to happen . You may estimate your actual defense date on the warrant -request . Then you can \"lock in\" your com mittee to a specific day after the warrant has been requested. You may (must) f ill in the actual date(s) on the warrant a fter its receipt from Grad School . Requesting a defense warrant does not obligate you to defend. You can even decide to move the defense to a different semester, if necessary - no penalty - if you decide you cannot or will not defend as planned when we request ed the warrant. If, however, you do decide to postpone your defense after requesting the warrant, then please inform the grad secretary, who can stay current ( and notify Grad School as a record -keeping courtesy in anticipation of re -requesting a future warrant when you are ready ). Page | 59 Your defense- date ordinarily should be set to occur well before the \"Degree Deadline\" for the seme ster involved. For explanation of Deadlines , see the \"degree deadline\" section, following in this Handbook. Announcements a Week Ahead Another timing -related task is for the student, normally via the grad secretary , is to post announcements of the PhD defense at least a week before it happen s. In the Kinesiology Dept., this task must occur. DISSERTATION DEFENSE The format of the dissertation is as determined by the major professor/advisor, with the approval of the other members of the dissertation commi ttee. A written copy of the dissertation reach dissertation committee members for review at least seven days prior to the scheduled oral defense. The major professor (or the student) shall provide information regarding the defense time, date, location, and subject matter to the Graduate Secretary who will distribute an announcement to faculty and graduate students at least one week prior to the defense. If you do not go through the grad secretary to book a room , then please notify the grad office of your final date, time & place once you have set them. The defense, like the proposal, is deemed to be an academic event of wider interest because it makes a contribution of new research in your field. As with your proposal, if you want to have a supportive audience of collaborators, fellow students, or friends for the public portion of the defense, then the most effective way to get them there is personally to inform them. When you request your defense -warrant, if you already know the exact date, clock -time and room of your defense, then please tell the grad secretary . Otherwise , the grad secretary will ask you to update that information when \"announcements\" are ready. Your warrant request will definitely need to list your committee and (at least a tentative) dissertation title, because Grad School will \"vet\" your committee members, and the Grad School warrant request form has a blank for the dissertation title (although you may update that subsequent to the warrant request). Grad School Committee Review You will need a warrant from Grad School to document your PhD defense. For procedures, s ee above in this Handbook under section called \"Request a PhD Warrant 3+ Weeks A head .\" The Grad School will review your defense warrant request to be sure its listed committee members comply with Grad School policy, see https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=committees The grad secretary would inform you if Grad School raised objections to your committee. Objections should be minimal -to-none if you adhere to Kinesiology committee requirements. KINESIOLOGY PhD COMMITTEES HAVE FIVE TENURE -TRACK FACULTY. At least one committee member must be from outside the Department of Kinesiology. The Chai rperson must be from the Department of Kinesiology. All committee members must be full, associate, or assistant professor s in any department with graduate program authority. [NOTE : The Kines. Graduate Studies Committee, in May 2017, voted to accept the fol lowing committee structure: Four committee members must be tenure -track faculty (full, associate, or assistant) holding professorial rank in any department with graduate program authority. The fifth committee member is not required to be tenure -track facul ty but must have completed doctoral training or the equivalent . The GSC expects the new structure to gain approval by all Department faculty in approximately September 2017. Consult a Kines grad program representative for details after that time.] Degree Deadline The Graduate School sets Degree Deadlines each Fall, Spring, and Summer semester. The deadline reflects the date by which a student must complete all activities associated with an academic event, e.g. PhD defense, so that the event will \"go on record\" effective with the associated semester. You can find future degree deadlines here, https://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/degreedeadlines/ . Depending on how far in the future you want to search/ plan , you may need to \"extrapolate\" (if a specific deadline has not yet been uploaded). You can extrapolate by knowing that past degree deadline fell around the end of final exams for the associated semester. For Spring '17 the degree deadline was May 12, 2017. (This is just \"for example.\" ) If you complete all requirements for the PhD degree, including dissertation deposit, by the deadline, then UW will confer your degree effective with that semester. Conferral dates (\"official graduation dates\") vary with semester but usually follow within a week (or so) Page | 60 of \"commencement.\" A Registrar web site lists future conferral dates, see https://registrar.wisc.edu/gradu ation_commencement.htm . This Handbook section is not trying to identify any specific conferral date. The point is that a missed degree deadline risks delay of your conferral date and can necessitate further registration (enrollment) , which can add tuition expense. The Grad School allows a \"window\" (\"grace period,\" time extension) beyond the degree deadline so students may complete required degree steps. If you complete required PhD steps in a \"window\" (exact dates in \"deadlines\" link, above ), then your degree will be conferred in the following semester but you will not need to register in that following semester. The \"window\" thus extend s your effective \"production run.\" The exten ded time can be almost a month ; it depend s on the semester. Warning: In the \"fall\" semester's window , i.e. following the \"summer\" semester , the \"extension\" gained from the \"window\" is only a few days. Please NOTE that using any \"window\" always delays your official \"co nferral\" dat e, usually by s everal month s (one semester's duration). If your conferral date (date of record for your degree) is of no particular concern to you, and if you think you might use a \"window\" to complete your degree process, then please study and understand the Grad School web page, https://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/degreedeadlines/ , or else consult a grad program representative. If you were to complet e all requirements after a \"window\" expired, then you would become obligated, under the continuous -registration requirement for dissertators, to register for the usual dissertator -minimum three credits in the semester in which you actually completed all degree requirements . Your required enrollment would include tuition, so if you had no \"third party\" to cover tuition for those credits, i.e. unless you retained some basis for \"remission\" or \"deferral\" of tuition, then you would need to pay tuition yourself . It would likely be a \" hard sell\" to qualify for tuition -remission in a semester after you did your PhD defense, although you are free to consult your advisor &/or the Kines Business Office. The Dept. did confront this situation in 2017, and the Grad uate School did not - said it could not - make an ex ception for the enrollment/ registration requirement, even for \"just a week\" in the semester following a \"window.\" If you do have reasons for wanting to \"prove\" attainment of the PhD, and if you must use a \"window,\" UW does provide procedures for documenting a completed but not-yet-awarded degree, see e.g. https://registrar.wisc.edu/degree_completion_letters.htm . This could impact you if, e.g., you have a job lined up that require s a formally conferred doctorate, e.g. a \"post -doc.\" Warrant Delivery (From Grad School) & Committee Signing When the Grad School reviews our warrant request and approves your committee, they will e-mail the Kines grad secretary with a Link to your warrant -form, which the grad secretary can print. Until a few years ago, Grad School sent a \"final packet\" of 15 or 20 pages, including a description of ancillary steps such as copyrighting the dissertation, and completing a \"survey of earned doctorates\". The \"paper packet\" is \"gone\" now, but many of the \"acti vities \" remain. In conjunction with \"electronic deposit\" of the UW-copy of the dissertation, Grad School has moved away from a \"paper packet\" of instructions . Now th e instructions are electronic, too, but they have likely retained the complexity of their former \"20 pages of paper .\" A Kines grad program representative can try to help you inte rpret the instructions, bu t you are welcome to seek input from the Graduate School directly, beca use Grad School staff will be the representatives who apply (enforce) their requirements. Their contact information is in the following link. Grad School online instructions for PhD completion are here, https://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/doctoralguide/ . This online PhD \"Doctoral Guide\" link, above, describes how you make Electronic dissertation deposit. Electronic dissertation deposit is theoretically \"optional,\" with paper -deposit remaining available, but a student has to \"work hard\" to deposit on paper with Grad School nowadays. This finds its basis in the reality, as Grad School staff report , that an overwhelming majority of students voluntarily chose electronic deposit over paper as soon as electronic deposit became available. Grad School attributes this to e -Deposit being easier, quicker, and \"feeling more natural\" in the internet era. Grad School has recently moved to electronic return of completed warrants, see \"step 1\" under \"When you are ready to defend and deposit...\" at the doctoral -guide link, https://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/doctoralguide/ . Assuming that you do not need to or want to make changes to your PhD warrant after its request -&-approval, then normally the Kines grad secretary will hold the printed (paper) warrant in the student's Kines file. If you would be more comfortable holding the original warrant yourself, of course feel free to tell the grad secretary . You may make other arrangements, too, e.g. have your advisor hold the warrant, subject to mutual agreement . The main goal of warrant processing on our end is to let you have something to place in front of your committee members, right in your defense room, so they can sign immediately upon your successful defense. That helps ensure that you can move ahead on the substantial remaining required activities without having to \"track down\" the committee members again for their signatures. This can be especially important if you end up defending near a deadline &/or if your committee members have busy work -&-travel schedules, sabbaticals, visiting professorships, etc. Page | 61 Learning Assessment Rubric Required An assessment rubric is required for the PhD Proposal. If you are not familiar with rubrics, you can read more about them in Section 6 of this Handbook, \"Degree Generally,\" under the sub -heading of \"Assessment Rubrics Required fo r MS and PhD Students.\" Note! There are four variants of the assessment rubric form. Although all are similar in format, they differ slightly in cont ent. All four forms are in the Forms Appendix of this Handbook. If you use a form from the Appendix, please select your form carefully, according to its intended use. The Kines grad secretary also can supply the appropriate form. Return of Warrant to Grad School ; and Deposit of Dissertation To get the PhD degree, you will be required to \"deposit\" your dissertation and deliver the signed warrant to UW Grad School's Office of Academic Services in Room 217 Bascom Hall. The \"deposit\" was once a physical action, but now it is \"e-Deposit.\" The exact procedures for doing this are in the \"doctoral guide\" link, https://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/doctoralguide/ . By their signatures, your committee will \"warrant\" to the Grad School that you qualify for the PhD. You must return the warrant to Grad School (plus deposit the dissertation & related materials), and then Grad School will organize with the Registrar & other UW administrative offices so that your degree can be officially recorded by UW and \"conferred\" on you. This warrant \"return\" was once \"walk to Grad School & hand it in,\" but now that \"action\" has also become electronic. You may scan your warrant for Grad School. Reliable sources say that a smartphone picture also adequately documents the warrant for Grad School. This author is unfamiliar with that technology. Consult Grad School if you need \"tech tips.\" The warrant, however, remains \"physical\" (paper) . You or the grad secretary will need to fill it in with your actual dissertation defense date. The grad secretary historically chose to leave that until the day of the defense (in case there was a last minute change, e.g. illness). The exact date-of-defense is not vital, as long as it is before the \"degree deadline\" for the semester involved . Using the \"actual\" date is just as easy as \"a close date,\" so for record integrity, the grad secretary strives to use an actual date. Continuity within the Kines grad office benefits from a file record of important academic events. That is why the Kines grad office requests that students please PROVIDE A PHOTOCOPY of the SIGNED WARRANT for your permanent Department file, or bring the original warrant to the Kines grad office and it will make the copy. This is not an official policy, but it is an administrative help in documenting (or \"proving\" in extreme cases) what has actually happened with the grad careers of students in the Department. If you are \"e-Returning\" your warrant and wish to \"e-Copy\" (e-mail) it to the grad office, that is fine. If you scan the warrant for return to Grad School, and if you have no inter est in retaining the original warrant, e.g. as a souvenir , then feel free to give the original to the Kines grad secretary instead of a photocopy. The original warrant certainly serves t he Kines grad office's administrative interest. Edits You can defend (or edit) your dissertation - theoretically - up until the \"degree deadline\" (or until the close of a \"window ,\" if you us e one). Waiting until the deadline can cause problem s, e.g. in getting an appointment for the Grad School's optional final dissertatio n review . More significantly, the Grad School holds strictly to deadline s, so you could risk your degree timing if you wait until near the deadline . One risk might be that your committee demand s edits , possibly so many that you do not have time to do them, get them approved, and submit them by the deadline. Consult your adviser on the \"chances\" of a committee want ing edits at a defense. Commencement (Graduat ion Ceremony) if you wish . For details , see \"C ommencement\" in section 6 of this Handbook . Dept. Dissertation Copies . Please NOTE that, despite the Grad School's transition to electronic dissertation deposit, the Kines Dept. still requires \"print\" dissertation copies. Some \"version\" of electronic deposit within the Department level was an agenda item at a Grad Studies Committee meeting in 2014, but the committee \"tabled\" action and has not taken it up again since then. There is nothing specific at the time of this Handbook (August 2017) to suggest a departure from the Department's long-standing \"paper\" tradition for dissertation copies . Possible Dissertation Binding providers Two local sources for dissertation binding are Bob's Copy Shop, http://www.bobscopyshop1.com/ , cost at Grimm's wa s $52 per dissertation bound if you supply \"clean copy\" of your own printed pages for each dissertation that you ask the provider to bind. Grimm will work from a PDF but it adds costs for printing. Binding p roduction time at Grimm is one week . Consult the provider that you choose for details or updates . This paragraph is not an endorsement of either \"local provider .\" There are certainly others (in Madison, in -state, online; check with your fellow students), and you are free to choose any bindery source you wish. The recent \"norm\" for binding in Kines has been book - bound hard cover, and you can see examples in the Depart ment Library, Room 2007 Nat. Some students choose to use less expensive binding options, and some of those examples are in the Library , too. If you wish to consider them, please seek your advisor's consent. Page | 62 Kines. Department dissertation \"deposit\" requirements memo Please see the Forms Appendix for a memo on Dissertation deposit. The same memo follow s immediately. Date: August 31, 2017 TO: kinesgrad@education.wisc.edu RE: Bound copies of your PhD dissertation After you state that you are ready, the Kines. Graduate Office can ask Graduate School for your PhD \"warrant\" (Final Oral Com mittee Approv al Form). Grad School sets deadlines for completion of your PhD degree. Missed deadlines can delay the date that UW puts on-record for your degree. Other PhD completion instructions also pertain. The Grad School information is now online (\"paperless\"). See http://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/degree/ , a link that consolidates degree information and tries to simplify the process for the student. Grad School prefers electronic dissertation deposit. While \"e -Deposit\" is theoretically optional, the link just given emphasizes \"online\" over \"paper,\" so this memo presumes you will deposit electronically at Grad School . With questions about Grad School procedures for depositing, the see points -of-contact in the Grad School link. Consider consulting them; they are \"insiders\" (experts in their own procedures). Feel free, however, also to contact the Kines grad office. Grad School still uses a paper PhD \"warrant\". When you pass your final committee oral exa m (defense), you must have your Dissertation Committee members sign your paper PhD Warrant. You do have an electronic deposit option but, as of this writing, the interim step of actual signatures remains a \"paper process.\" Voluntary but helpful in long -term record -keeping: Please give the Kinesiology Grad Office a photocopy of the signed Warrant for your Department file if you return the original warrant to the Graduate School. If you scan the original for e -Submittal and no longer need it, the \"original\" signed warrant is fine for the Kines. files. Past Kinesiology tradition required PhD students to make three print copies of their final dissertation. Assuming, though, th at you \"e - deposit\" at Grad School, then the required \"print\" copies drop to two. Distribution follows. A) In the past, if you elected to deposit a print dissertation, then an original, unbound copy went to the Grad School for processing, with that copy eventually placed in the permanent collection of the UW Library. Consult Grad School if you really want to dep osit a print copy. Always be sure to deposit by or before yo ur targeted degree deadline (or \"window\" period, whichever applies) as detailed in the link (look under \"degree deadlines\"). B) Regardless of the dissertation format you use with Grad School, the Kinesiology Department's Grad Program Policy & Procedure Manual (section 2) still requires bound, printed dissertation copies as follows: 1) A bound copy for the Major Adviser , deliver it to the adviser or to the Kines. Grad Office (unless the adviser instructs otherwise or expressly waives the adviser -copy); 2) A bound copy for the Kinesiology Department library (currently Room 2007 Nat), deliver it to the Kines. Grad Office. The student is responsible for the costs of binding the Adviser -copy and Department -copy. We impose no deadline for delivery of bound copies to Kinesiology, but we respectfully encourage reasonable promptness. If you desire information on binding services, or if you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Grad Office. Thank you. Copy to: Professor P . Dantry , Adviser Page | 63 PhD Degree Final Checklist . (One. Last. Time.) At least three weeks before the scheduled date of the final committee examination (defense), students must provide relevant data to the Kines Grad Program office so it can request the PhD Final Oral Committee Approval Form (warrant) from Grad School. Relevant data includes the working title of the dissertation, committee member names and affiliation/ rank, and expected defense date. Students must submit the final-draft copy of their dissertation to the examination committee at least one week before the exam. A PhD defense requires announcement. At least one week , but preferably several weeks , before the scheduled date for the defense, candidates must notify the Kines grad program office of the time, and place of the dissertation defense. The Kines grad secretary will create and post announcement s of the defense . The dissertator is free to personally announce the defense by other means. Pick up your warrant from the Kines Grad Program office when it e-mails you that it is available. After the final exam (defense) , return a Copy of completed , signed warrant to the Kines Grad Program office for your student file in the Dept . Adhere to information on Deadlines, Defending, and Depositing at http://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/degree/ . Please refer to Check -Out Procedure, below. IT IS THE STUDENT 'S RESPONSIBILITY TO VERIFY THAT ALL GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MET . We will help you in any way(s) we can, but for that to happen YOU MUST TIMELY COMMUNICATE, and YOU MUST BE SELF -AWARE of requirements at various stages of your grad career so you can ask for the right help at the right time . Section 11, Degree Completion Commencement Graduate students may choose to participate in the UW's graduation (\"commencement\") ceremony . It is optional. A fully valid degree can issue without any participation in Commencement. Consider think ing of your degree- completion and participation -in-the- commencement -ceremony as two distinct events. In fact, since Commencement is only ceremonial, students may participate in it whenever they wish , based on e.g. personal or family convenience. The University does not prohibit Commencement participation by student s for whom it has no pending request for a degree. Your grad faculty advisor or the Kines grad secretary might be confused by your Commencement interest if you do not have an imminent (or recent ) degree, but you can explain away their confusion o r ignore i t. For those who wish to participate, Commencement ceremonies are held in December and May only. Summer grads may participate in the Fall or Spring ceremony , because there is no ceremony offered during the summer . Each Fall and Spring semester, the Kines grad secretary will distribute specific information , normally at least 8 weeks before the ceremony. In lieu of that, you may consult the Commencement website , http://www.commencement.wisc.edu/ , or compare http://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/degree/ . You can wait to decide to participate in the ceremony right up until the day UW holds it, but if you did not mak e timely notice , then your name would not be in the printed commencement program. Also, proper attire (\"regalia\"/ cap-&-gown ) will be required (nominally enforced by \"marshals\" at the ceremony, although many students find ways to individualize their attire with decorations, sashes, scarves, signs, sorority symbols, etc.). The basic traditional \"cap and gown\" (as well as designated honors or other insignias) can be ordered through various outlets (online and \"bricks -&-mortar\"), and attire rental providers recommended by UW will impose deadlines substantially in advance of the ceremony date. If you have some private source of a cap-&-gown, then you might be able to \"sneak\" in at the last minute, but... think about it... If you're honor ing a tradition , then why not honor the tradition al process ? Traditionally, PhD students have a Commencement \"escort, \" normally their faculty advisor. PhD students should discuss their commencement plans with their advisor several months in advance to help assure escort availability on the needed date. If the advisor Page | 64 is unavailable, or if the student has strong reasons for wishing to use an alternate (or additional) escort, then other persons may serve as an escort. If in doubt, describe your circumstances to the Kines. Grad Office , and any necessary inquiries will be made. For additional discussion of Commenccment, see Section 6, above in this Handbook. Degree Completion Letter The Office of the Registrar can provide a Degree Completion Letter documenting degree completion until your degree is posted and your diploma arrives. Please email degreeaudit@em.wisc.edu with your name, campus ID number, and address. Kinesiology Check- Out Procedure - - or, all good things must end, pleasantly, we hope If you have a ny UW keys, then you must return them b efore you leave. Return them to the Kines Lab Manager , https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/staff/contreras -lorenzo/ . Upon key return, the Lab Manager will authorize you to receive your key deposit(s) back. You may face delay in your degree if you do not follow this requirement , which helps ensure that we safeguard department facilities and equipment . It costs almost unbelievable amounts to \"re-key\" a door, should that become necessary . Please do not risk making that necessary. Please do not leave your key check -in until the last minute. Staff absences in the one- to two-week range are common for vacation, illness or business travel. Consider a courtesy check -in with the Lab Manager, even if you ddid not have any keys. He is responsible for Kines Dept . \"space\" in general, and he may want to assure himself that you are not \"leaving behind\" anything that he will need to \"deal with.\" If you have a job \"appointment \" (PA, TA, RA or other \"assistantship job\") in your last semester, please check with the Department Administrator / Personnel / HR representative before you leave campus so that we can identify any potential \"holds ,\" pursue communications , and make necessary adjustments so your final payout will be accurate and your records can be efficiently closed. For Domestic students, UW will send your diploma to your mailing address. For International students, your diploma will go to your diploma address. Please log into your \"MyUW\" online student center to check this address and update it to your current circumstances (or those that will be in force at the time of mailing) . UW sends diplomas several weeks after graduation to the mailing address (or diploma address ). Your UW e-mail account (wisc.edu) will remain active a few months after graduation. You will receive an e-mail notifying you when your account is set for deactivat ion. Once students have graduated, they can apply for an alumni e-mail on the Wisconsin Alumni Association (WAA) website , https://www.uwalumni.com/benefits -services/email/ . Feel free to contact the Kines Grad Program Office if you have any questions or concerns in the future, and please keep in touch! Feel free to visit, write, e-mail, or call. Page | 65 Section 12, Tech & Facilities Services Computer Usage - \"appropriate use policy\" There used to be a Computer Lab, but the Dept. discontinued it circa 2012. Informal surveys suggest that most students now have personal laptops or other wireless devices, and the Nat and many campus buildings are equipped with Wi-Fi or a similar \"network\" for wireless internet access. Public desktop computers are located at \"kiosks\" across the campus, including in the Nat main hallway . If you are a research grad student, you might have assigned work space with access to a UW computer. All UW equipment and networks are subject to \"appropriate use.\" For a policy statement by the UW Division of Information Technology about that, key \"Appropriate Use Policy\" (or \"Responsible Use Policy\") into the search window of the UW internet home page. As a very general and abbreviated summary of appropriate / responsible use: It must be consistent with the University's mission and be for University- related activities ; commercial, political and non-university activities are prohibited ; de minimis incidental personal use is tolerated in the interest of making information technology a natural part of learning and work. If in doubt, consult your advisor or a Kines grad representative. Photocopying Kines. Dept. copy machines policy prohibits photocopying for personal purposes . This includ es copying for courses a student is taking. If photocopying is required for your research project, see your major professor. Copying consistent with your teaching (TA) role is permissible. Telephones - VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol ) In August 2017, Kinesiology implement ed\"VOIP\" phone service (Voice Over Internet Protocol) . Please plan to consult your advisor, the Kinesiology Business Office, the grad secretary , or the UW -Madison home page, e.g. https://kb.wisc.edu/vs/ - or VOIP KB (KnowledgeBase): https://kb.wisc.edu/helpdesk/page.php?id=72125 - for VOIP procedures. The \"basics\" of VOIP appear (to this writer) to be: To reach a campus phone, use 7 digit number, e.g. 262 -8730 = Kines gra d office. To reach a \"local\" phone off campus, use 1 + 7 digits, e.g. 1 -221-4443 = Grimm's Book Bindery To reach a \"toll free\" number, use 1 + 1 + 800 -486-5643 = general questions on Ameican College of Sports Medicine certification To reach a \"long distanc e\" number, consult your advisor first to be sure it fits your job duties. There will be no more long distance per se, it is all covered under the cost of the VOIP line, but \"advisor consent\" is the watchword of grad study (in this writer's opinion). The Department will face charge s on international calls, although most VOIP lines initially will not be set up to call internationally. The international option will be added to individual lines on a case by case basis. Mailboxes - check it if you have it - u rge senders to use \"full address\" Department m ailbox space is limited. Dept. mailboxes in the Nat are to the right of the first-floor stairwell as you pass Rm. 1043 on your left. These mailboxes are typically assigned to grad students with TA duties , so boxes may assist students who are in that TA's class (es) with dropping off class assignments (or other class -related paperwork ). Although communications formerly made on paper increasingly are e-mailed, grad students with assigned mailboxes remain responsible for regularly checking and emptying them. Department staff will NOT distribute student mail to individually assigned student desks (if any). Because of demands on mailbox space and staff time, your Kines mail team asks that you please set up your strictly personal mail (bills, greeting cards, non-academic/ general -interest periodicals, etc.) for delivery to a personal address outside the Department. Please NOTE that mail distribution is a \"rotating\" duty handled by various staff who may or may not recognize the name/ affiliation of all graduate students . This means you can do a favor for the mail handlers (and for yourself, for prompt delivery) by giving your full campus address to those who send you mail. A \"full campus address\" should include: Your personal name; Your \"Lab\" name, by specialization &/or by grad-faculty name , e.g. Ex Psych Lab - Prof Cook ; The room number and building name , e.g. Rm. 1150 Natatorium (\"1150 Nat\") ; If mail comes from off -campus, i.e. U.S. Mail, then ALSO use the street address, city, state & zip code (2000 Observatory Dr., Madison, WI 53706) If you are a grad student located primarily in the MSC (Medical Sciences Center, 1300 University Av.), ask your advisor about mail management options or see the support staff in Rm. 2120 MSC. Page | 66 Desk Assignment, Keys, & Building Access In addition to offices and labs for Kinesiology, the Natatorium houses recreational facilities (cardio and circuit training equipment, gyms, locker rooms, pools, weight room) for which membership is required (free with valid, current student ID; fee charged to UW faculty and staff). The Recreational Sports Division manages these facilities , and Rec Sports checks the \"membership\" of everybody who enters the building at the main entrance (on Observatory Drive). This ID check covers hundreds of UW students , including many who are just attending classes in the Nat and who will not actually use any Rec Sports facilities while in the building. The main entrance is the only entrance that is unlocked during the scheduled hours of operation of recreational facilities. Outside the Nat's normal hours of operation, or at entrances other than the main entrance, building access will require a key or a card. Some workspaces may also be within labs or other areas that typically remain locked. Be kind to your fellow students (Nat ID checkers) . As a grad student registered for credits , you automatically get ID-card authorization to get in the Nat main entrance during the building's open hours. Traditionally, Rec Sports staff will also let grad students enter without showing ID if you tell the ID checker that you are \"a Kinesiology grad student who work s in the building\". Please be mindful , however, that Rec Sports ID checkers are part-time student -hourly employees with frequent turnover, especially at the start of a semester when new class schedules mean new student -work schedules. It is unfair to expect ID checkers to \"know you on sight, \" even if you enter the building frequently . They are likely under instruction from Rec Sports to apply the ID policy as part of their jobs, so if you enter the Nat without ID at the main entrance, please respect the ID checkers who are trying to do their jobs. This will help the Kines Dept . stay on good terms with Rec Sports , i.e. should help grad students keep their ID-free access privilege s. If you are a program assistant (PA), research assistant (RA) or teaching assistant (TA), you may request a desk/ workspace placement via your advisor. Most advisors will want to locate you within their laboratories so they have easy access to you and you have easy access to research materials. Your advisor will sign the key-request -form (see following) for the room(s) you might need to unlock to gain entry to your workspace, including outside door(s) if your work duties require your presence when the building is otherwise closed. You then take the form to the Kines. Dept. Lab Manager, Rm. 1149B Natatorium, for processing. Lose your (Nat) keys = Lose your (own) money . If you need keys for offices or laboratories in the Natatorium , you must fill in a key-request -form . It is available from the Lab Manager , https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/staff/contreras -lorenzo/ . The Lab Manager will explain the responsibilities associated with being a key holder . Further detail is available here, https://businessoffice.education.wisc.edu/bo/building obtain the key(s), key holder must make a monetary d eposit . Students must turn in their keys at the end of their grad study career in Kinesiology. When you return a key, UW will refund your d eposit. A LOST KEY CAUSE S FORFEITURE of the deposit . To preview the seriousness with which administrators take the key holding process, see the \"Key Issue\" form in the Forms Appendix, following in this Handbook. Grad students without an individual faculty research advisor may request a desk/ workspace placement via the Lab Manager, who will assign space as available and determine associated key authorization requirements. In general, grad students who do not report to a grad faculty advisor will be presumed not to need keyed access to the building or locked spaces within it. Space for study or relaxation is available in the student study room (1168 Nat), or the Kines . Dept. meeting room (1120 Nat). All students are eligible to rent a gym locker in the Nat. Lockers are available from Recreational Sports (in the office by the front door, wher they check ID cards). Rec Sports posts its fee schedule each semester (or academic year). Availability may be limited &/or first-come -first-served. Some Kinesiology grad students, ordinarily those pursuing the Occupational Science specialization, work with a faculty advisor housed in the Medical Sciences Center (MSC). Those students should consult their advisors on workspace and building access, or, absent advisor availability, consult the Occupational Therapy Program Office, Rm. 2120 MSC. Parking Permits Graduate students in employment status (\"appointed to an \"assistantship\" or holding a \"fellowship\") may apply to purchase university employee parking permits through the Department under policies set by UW Transportation Services, which you can access via the UW internet home page. Each academic year the Department submits an employee parking priority list to Transportation Services via the School of Education. Contact the Kines. Dept. Mgr. for addition to the priority list. Students with no Department employment should apply directly to the Transportation Services Department and comply with permit policy for students. The trend or philosophy on parking seems to be demand management by encouraging access to campus by transportation means other than single passenger motor vehicles, although substantial numbers of employees and students do drive to and park on campus. In view of the restricted parking options on campus and the current availability of a free student bus pass, https://www.asm.wisc.edu/resources/buspass/ , students who do not reside within walking or biking dista nce may wish to park off campus near a bus stop and ride the bus to campus. Page | 67 Section 13, Financial Support (assistantships), Benefits (tuition, health, leave), Grievance Procedure Graduate students may be appointed (employed under a contract -like agreement) by this department (or, occasionally, by another department ) as a project assistant (PA), research assistant (RA), or teaching assistant (TA) appointment. Increasingly the term \"GA,\" graduate assistant, crops up. Typically this seems to apply to those with a job in \"athletics\" e.g. as a student athletic trainer. You should \"ask around\" about the connotations associated with being a \"GA.\" Student assistants earn a monthly stipend for their work. Depending on percentage of appointment (compared to a \"full-time equivalent\"), an assistant may qualify for tuition coverage (\"remission\") . In addition, there are various competitive fellowships and scholarships for which graduate students may apply. Sometimes s tudent hourly work is available in the Dept., which announces it, normally via e -mail. For other non -Kinesiology job opportunities, if you are interested and qualifi ed, see e.g. http://jobcenter.wisc.edu/ . Research Assistantships The Dept. chair makes RA appointments in consultation with the Dept. business office and with individual professors according to their needs and the availability of funds for their research projects. Often , RA funds are from a professor's grant (external/ extra - mura l/ non-state funding). The level of funding varies among faculty, and new projects may start anytime of the year. This suggests that prospective students should inquire about RA support to the professor (s) whose research is related to the students' interests. Research Assistants and Stipends Before your start-date, you must check with the Kines. Business Office , room 2015 Nat, about submitting appropriate payroll documents . They are largely available online , e.g. at https://www.ohr.wisc.edu/benefits/new -emp/ but please consult a business office expert to protect your finances! You will be paid (get you r stipend ) on or before the first day of the month followin g your appointment's start-date, and each month thereafter for the agreed duration. UW sends y our stipend check(s) directly to your bank; a direct -deposit form is required. You may arra nge for \"leave \" through your major professor (check first to see \"what you have,\" student contracts may not include \"paid leave,\" so time off might be unpaid or subject to coverage available) . Students who have RA status in the summer must register for course credit, see Grad School Policy & Procedu re guidelines under \"Enrollment Requirements\" , https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/?policy=enrollmentrequirements , representative . Teaching Assistantships The Kines Dept. chair makes TA appointments in consultation with professors who have classes to teach. Teaching assistant positions usually go primarily to research -based graduate students . Most often , professors will nominate their own research students to fill TA slots. If you wish to \"apply\" for a TA position, start by contacting individual faculty members in the area(s) of your greatest competency. The professors may refer you to the Kines Business Office or the grad secretary. You can make an indication of subject areas that you would be interested in and qualified to teach and you may describe any prior teaching experience. History suggests that your indication would be held for future reference (is unlikely to get immediate response). Sometimes the Dept. announces TA openings to a wider audience (Dept. -wide, or UW -wide). These infrequent openings tend to be for a limited du ration of \"appointment\" (one semester, an academic year). Former ly, TAs had an official bargaining unit (union), the Teaching Assistants' Association (TAA). A TAA contract defined, largely, the relationship between teaching assistants and the university, subject to collective re-bargaining in accordance with State law. State legislation , circa 2010, decertified state employee unions , including for TAs . At that time, the UW seemed to express interest in preserving the prior bargained relationship, but you s hould seek further input elsewhere if you are concerned. Contact the TAA (https://win.wisc.edu/organization/taa ) or consult your advisor on bargaining rights, contract coverage, etc. Department faculty members who get assigned TAs will give guidelines and instructions to TAs for the class(es) they teach. The Department will circulate information , as received, about optional (or mandatory ) training workshops organized by the School of Education, the Office of Equity and Diversity Services, or other UW sponsors for TA's. Page | 68 Fellowships Fellowships are awarded to grad students by the university and/or department from funds controlled by The Graduate School, the School of Education, the Department, or other sources. Departmental fellowships are typically awarded early in the spring semester for the subsequent academic year, and an announcement is normally e-mailed to all eligible current grad students (and admitte d applicants. Grad students may also consult their advisor about fellowship opportunities. Some grad fellowships are also awarded by organizations outside the university. Check with your advisor and on the UW internet home page, e.g. under the Grad School funding resources page, http://grad.wisc.edu/studentfunding/currentstudents . Tuition Remission Students must have an \"appointment\" (employment), typically as a PA, RA or TA, or combination , which totals at least one-third of a full-time equivalent for the duration of the Fall or Spring term (semester) to be eligible for full tuition remission for that term. Note that students who receive tuition remission normally still are required to pay segregated fees by the tuition due-date. If the student has had an appointment in the spring semester that qualifies for tuition remission , that automatically carries over for the summer session. Health Insurance Health care is available at the University Health Service (UHS) for all UW-Madison students. (See www.uhs.wisc.edu for details on the coverage offered .) UHS benefits don't include hospitalization and emergency room services, for which students are encouraged to carefully consider their possible need for separate health insurance. Information concerning group health insurance, which is available to those students with at least a one-third full-time appointment as an assistant, or who are Fellow s, is available from the Kines. Personnel & Benefits Coordinator, Rm. 2015 Nat. Grad students without \"assistantship\" or \"fellowship\" status are not eligible for State employee group health insurance but may obtain private coverage or may contact the Wisconsin Student Association for UW health insurance info. Also see the UW internet home page and search for University Health Services or SHIP (Student Health Insurance Program), http://www.uhs.wisc.edu/ship/ . Family Leave, Leave -of-Absence, Compassionate Leave Brief, unplanned absences (up to about two weeks) would generally be handled by student communication with the advisor and with other instructors from whom the student is taking courses. If a grad student is employed, provisions for sick leave, coverage of absences, and pay would be addressed in contracts &/or by statutory or administrative rules for the employment process. Specific circumstances are beyond the scope of this Handbook ; discuss the facts of an individual case with your faculty advisor, the grad studies chair, the grad secretary, the Department administrator, or another Dept. representative, as appropriate. The UW Graduate School Academic Policies and Procedures have specific statements on Compassionate Tuition Adjustment, Family Leave, and Leave of Absence, but these statements largely allow for broad discretion . Depending on the length of absence, particularly dissertators could be affected by \"non -continuous \" enrollment . Any admitted grad student who does not register for a semester (or longer) must apply for Readmission to Graduate School (also in a Grad School Policy statement ). The Kinesiology Dept. does not currently have a \"local policy \" on student leave . Students who anticipate needing extended leave are urged to check in advance with their advisor. Grievances (Student Complaint Procedures) A student should initially direct concerns/ complaints to the course instructor (if applicable / course related ). If the instructor offers no remedies, or if the student is not satisfied with the offer, then the student may direct concerns/ complaints to the faculty advisor (if applicable) or to another Kinesiology faculty member in whom the student feels confidence, and then to the chair of the Kines Grad Studies Committee. If the student feels uncomfortable directing an issue to a faculty member or to the Grad Studies chair, then the student may be report a grievance to the chair of the Kinesiology Department ; or to another appropriate university office that the student selects . The UW Graduate School Academic Policies and Procedures Guidelines offer further input about how students who feel aggrieved or unfairly treated may seek intervention and resolution . See http://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/ and scroll to Grievances and Appeals . Sexual Harassment or Violence Grievance Process See https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/prevention/violence -prevention/grad -students/ - .edu/polproced/CPPP/cppp_chapter18- 01.pdf The following excerpt is from UW's employee online sexual violence & harassment prevention training, July 2017. Grievances /Appeals Page | 69 Contact your personnel representative to find out who is authorized to conduct grievance meetings. Employees may file grievances through the grievance process outlined in Classified Personnel Policies and Procedures Chapter 17 (reference Wisconsin Administrative Code ER 46 and HR Handbook Chapter 430). This is a four-step process. The first step is in the employing unit. The second step is Classified Human Resources. The third step is at the Office of State Employment Relations. The final step is at the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission. Common Errors Some common reasons for losing on appeal are as follows: Lack of documented evidence of misconduct. Failure to be specific in describing reasons for the disciplinary action. o Sometimes in an attempt to make the discipline more palatable, an employer will gloss over the specific reasons or indicate only a portion or a representative sample of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance. Failure to indicate supporting facts to substantiate the action. o If the disciplinary action results from a culmination of a number of incidents and attempts have been made to counsel the employee, or if the employee has been disciplined previously for similar behavior and this action results from the employee's failure to improve, say so in the disciplinary letter. Unless supporting evidence is mentioned in the letter, it may not be admitted at a hearing later. Because disciplinary actions are extremely important, we request that you initially contact your personnel manager or Classified Human Resources for assistance when you anticipate taking disciplinary action.

Page | 81 Thesis Deposit & Dept. copies memo Date: August 31, 2017 TO: of your master's thesis Kinesiology grad students are required to prepare at least three copies of their final master's thesis. You will likely benefit from reading the formatting and procedural requirements at the Graduate School web site, \"Completing Your Degree\", http://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/degree/ . Some of its \"embedded links\" might not pertain to you. I would, however, especially call to your attention the ones for \"degree deadlines\" and \"Expecting Your Master's Degree\", http://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/degreedeadlines/ and http://grad.wisc.edu/currentstudents/mastersproc . You can always seek my input for clarification of any web information gaps or overload. Your three required MS thesis copies will have distribution as follows. 1) An original, unbound copy must be deposited at the UW Memorial Library. You (or somebody you trust, or \"inter -D mail,\" if you trust that) must deliver this unbound thesis, including signed advisor approval page, to the Bindery Preparations Department, B137 Memorial Library (phone 262- 3294). The Library will bind this copy and permanently retain it. The cost of binding this copy is included in student fees. There is no additional cost. The Graduate School will not officially grant your master's degree until the Library confirms thesis deposit. If you do not deposit by or before your targeted degree deadline (see web sites above), then a missed deadline would delay the official date-of-record for conferral of your degree. Remaining copies required by the Kinesiology Graduate Program Policies & Procedures Manual are: 2) A bound thesis copy shall be delivered to the Major Advisor. 3) A bound thesis copy shall be delivered to the Kinesiology Grad Program Office, Room 1013 Natatorium - Gym Unit II. This copy will be retained in the Department Library. The student is responsible for the costs of binding the 2nd and 3rd copies, and you may choose your submittal timing (unless your advisor sets a deadline). Reasonable promptness is appreciated. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Thank you. Copy to: Prof. I. M. Saportiv, Major Advisor Page | 82 Dissertation Deposit & Dept. copies memo Date: August 31, 201 7 e -mail: kinesgrad@education.wisc.edu RE: Bound copies of your PhD dissertation After you state that you are ready, the Kines. Graduate Office can ask Graduate School for your PhD \"warrant\" (Final Oral Com mittee Approval Form). Grad School sets deadlines for completion of your PhD degree. Missed deadlines can de lay the date that UW puts on-record for your degree. Other PhD completion instructions also pertain. The Grad School information is now online (\"paperless\"). See http://grad.wisc.edu/currentstud ents/degree/ , a link that consolidates degree information and tries to simplify the process for the student. Grad School prefers electronic dissertation deposit. While \"e -Deposit\" is theoretically optional, the link just given emphasizes \"online\" over \"pa per,\" so this memo presumes you will deposit electronically at Grad School . With questions about Grad School procedures for depositing, the see points -of-contact in the Grad School link. Consider consult ing them; they are \"insiders\" (experts in their own procedures). Feel free, however, also to contact the Kines grad office. Grad School still uses a paper PhD \"warrant\". When you pass your final committee oral exam (defense), you must have your Dissertation Committee members sign your paper PhD Warrant. You do have an electronic deposit option but, as of this writing, the interim step of actual signatures remains a \"paper process.\" Voluntary but helpful in long -term record -keeping: Please give the Kinesiology Grad Office a photocopy of the signed Warrant for your Department file if you return the original warrant to the Graduate School. If you scan the original for e -Submittal and no longer need it, the \"original\" signed warrant is fine for the Kines. files. Past Kinesiology tradition required PhD students to make three print copies of their final dissertation. Assuming, though, th at you \"e - deposit\" at Grad School, then the required \"print\" copies drop to two. Distribution follows. A) In the past, if you elected to deposit a print dissertation, then an original, unbound copy went to the Grad School for processing, with that copy eventually placed in the permanent collection of the U W Library. Consult Grad School if you really want to deposit a print copy. Always be sure to deposit by or before your targeted degree deadline (or \"window\" period, whichever applies) as detailed in the link (look under \"degree deadlines\"). B) Regardless of the dissertation format you use with Grad School, the Kinesiology Department's Grad Program Policy & Procedure Manual (section 2) still requires bound, printed dissertation copies as follows: 1) A bound copy for the Major Adviser , deliverable to the a dviser or to the Kines . Grad Office (unless the adviser instructs otherwise or expressly waives the adviser copy); 2) A bound copy for the Kinesiology Department library (currently in Room 2007 Nat), deliverable to the Kines . Grad Office. The student is responsible for the costs of binding the Adviser -copy and Department -copy. We impose no deadline for delivery of bound copies to Kinesiology, but we respectfully encourage reasonable promptness. If you desire information on binding services, or if you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Grad Office. Thank you. Copy to: Professor P.
