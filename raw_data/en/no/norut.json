Our innovation consists of 4 main steps: - Ethical sourcing: we take inspiration from nature to find effective raw materials that we source while respecting regulations and local populations. - Differentiating deciphering: we identify molecules of interest and their mechanism of action to develop the best-in-class ingredients. - Efficient processing: we are a leader in plant extraction, and we keep improving our industrial processes in order to increase efficiency and reduce our impact on the environment. - Smart positioning: We understand the needs and trends of today and strive to develop ingredients that will provide unique benefits to our customers. Seqens Cosmetics Natural Ingredients offer Natural Active Ingredients The development of our active ingredients is based on 3 innovation platforms. Exposome: adapting skin to environmental factors For years, SEQENS Cosmetics has been passionate about the different factors that affect our skin on a daily basis: the Exposome. With an urban lifestyle, people are facing daily aggressions such as pollution, tobacco smoke and UV rays, which can have a negative impact on our skin, the primary interface with our environment. We searched for natural solutions to fight against the effects of the exposome and developed botanical active ingredients to protect the skin from external aggressions. Star active Cell'intact: inspired by the phytoremediation power of the buckwheat seed. This active ingredient is the new solution to adapt the skin microbiota to the urban environment. This is the birth of the Expo'biota scientific concept: \"Expo\" for mysteries SEQENS Cosmetics seeks to unlock well-aging mysteries. Our investigations focus on blue zones: regions recognized by scientists for the high proportion of healthy centenarians. Star active Celebr'age Getto: inspired by the blue zones ethnobotanical surveys, the getto leaf from Okinawa Island has been identified as a botanical solution for well-aging. The active developed from this plant acts as a slow-aging enhancer, a cell connection booster and skin platform: deciphering the structure of mega-sugars (exopolysaccharides) to predict their biological activities. Star active Glycuron 2.78: iInspired by the microbiota of the Magnificent Sea Anemone (Heteractis magnifica), the giant exopolysaccharide synthesized by bacteria from this marine animal plays a role on our skin and our emotions. The active ingredient developed from this XXL sugar interacts with skin receptors by improving skin moisturization, skin complexion but also by enhancing emotional perception. Etho-phytology: exploring animal's behavior to develop cosmetic solutions Star active Phyt'anim Grains of Paradise: Inspired by observations of animal behavior able to select plants to heal themselves, the Grains of Paradise seeds are identified as beneficial for the protection of gorilla myocardium thanks to their strong anti-inflammatory properties. The active ingredient developed from this plant acts in the same way at the skin level by helping it to emerge from chronic inflammation, resulting in a clinical reduction in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and redness. Botanical extracts Collection of botanical extracts inspired by art The diversity of nature is a continuous source of inspiration for both science and art. Just as an artist creates, we develop our natural cosmetic ingredients by combining strong technical expertise with fertile imagination. Our French roots are deeply anchored in history and art; we were naturally inspired by famous artworks to create natural ingredient collections illustrating masterpieces. The Mont Collection: Sainte-Victoire vue de Montbriand\" by Paul C\u00e9zanne, a French painter. This special masterpiece takes you for a stroll around Provence, a region in the South of France, to discover our natural plant extracts, traditionally grown in Provence. Sleeping Beauty Collection: a timeless fairytale, written by French author Charles Perrault, that we are all familiar with. Through this collection, SEQENS invites you to a reinterpretation/ rereading of the tale to discover our extracts incorporated in the story as it goes on. The range \"Terroir en Beaut\u00e9\" : organic extracts from France Terroir en Beaut\u00e9 is an invitation to discover French regions and visit our organic farmers where we source our ingredients. This initiative was taken since the birth of the company to support our local economy and to get high quality of natural ingredients in line with our CSR strategy. Indeed, Terroir en Beaut\u00e9 guarantees ingredients with a certified source, traceable from the plant to the finished extract.
