Exciting new services coming in 2023!", "sitename": "Kaizo Health", "date": "2022-12-29", "cleaned_text": "New Services Coming in 2023! The news is out and we are so excited to be bring new medical service to Kaizo Health in 2023! Our goal is to always provide our patients with the best and most up-to-date care. By integrating medical services into our practice, we will be able to enhance our ability to help patients heal and get them out of pain. No more having to be referred to multiple clinics. Let's find out how combining chiropractic care with medical integration takes it to the next level. Starting in 2023, Kaizo Health will begin offering joint injections, platelet-rich plasma injections (PRP), trigger point injections and intravenous nutrition therapy (IV Nutrition). What are the benefit of these services? By combining chiropractic care with medical integration we can provide a convenient way for patients to receive more of the care they need. It will help patients achieve optimal wellness all in one place. Medical, chiropractic and rehabilitative care will be coordinated by professionals that are part of the same team. They will create a cohesive plan to help patients reach their goals faster and get back to doing what they love. Comprehensive holistic care provides patients with all the treatments they need under one location without having to be referred out to multiple offices and bouncing between locations. Chiropractic care is all about using the body's own natural ability to heal itself. The services we will be incorporating all focus on a natural-focused healing type of care. Our goal is to provide advanced pain-relieving methods so patients are still able to avoid surgery and opioid pain relievers. So let's learn about each new service coming to Kaizo Health in 2023: New Service: Joint Injections Joint injections are typically used in the knee with Hyaluronic acid. The injection temporarily relieves pain or swelling in the joint. This allows you to comfortably move through rehab therapy to help heal the joint. What is Hyaluronic Acid? Hyaluronic acid is similar to the naturally occurring substance in the body that lubricates joints. Sometimes joints will lose the ability to lubricate themselves and bone friction occurs. This can cause serious pain and limit mobility. How Do I Keep My Joints Lubricated Naturally? Joint lubrication takes place when you routinely exercise, drink water, and consume healthy fats. However, overuse or injury can prevent natural lubrication. If exercise becomes too difficult with joint pain, joint injections can remedy the pain during your rehab therapy. This helps improve the production of lubrication naturally in the body. The injection sort of helps give the body a head start in the healing process. The goal is to help the body heal so that is can naturally supplement the joints on its own. New Service: Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP Injections) PRP injections use the patient's own blood to stimulate and encourage the body's natural healing process. This process increases specific hormones to the injured cartilage or tissue within the joints. What is Platelet-Rich Plasma? Platelet-rich plasma is simply blood that contains more platelets than normal. It is produced by spinning your own blood in a centrifuge so that it separates. What is PRP Treatment Used For? PRP injections may be able to treat a range of musculoskeletal injuries and conditions. PRP injections are also widely used for post-operation recovery. Adding PRP shots to a treatment regimen can help to stimulate the healing process, decrease pain and enable a return to activities sooner. New Service: Trigger Point Injections A trigger point injection involves a local anesthetic with a corticosteroid that can [help](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17582-trigger-point-injection) soothe myofascial pain, especially in your neck, shoulder, arms, legs and lower back. A trigger point is a painful \"knot\" in your muscle that often forms after an injury, workout or repetitive micro-traumas. It causes the muscle fibers to be stuck in a contracted state. Areas That Can Be Treated: - Jaw - Neck Muscles - Hips and Glutes - Lower Back - Shoulders - Facial Muscles - and More! Who Needs this Treatment? We recommend this treatment ONLY when your trigger point pain has NOT improved with other treatments, including manual therapy, heat therapy, myofascial release and rehab therapy. IV Nutrition Treatments (IVNT) [IV Nutrition Therapy](https://www.kaizo-health.com/chiropractic-health-and-wellness-blog/what-is-iv-nutritional-therapy/) is a form of IV treatment that supplies the body with necessary vitamins and minerals to replenish deficiencies or aid in healing. The IV drip delivers nutrients directly to the bloodstream. This process bypasses digestion to provide quicker delivery to the cells that need it. What is IVNT used for? INVT is designed to help with healing or enhancing levels of insufficient vitamins and minerals in your body. IVNT is a great alternative when you're unable to get the right nutrients through your diet or your body has a difficult time absorbing vitamins and minerals.

Combining Chiropractic Care with Medical Integration We are continually improving and enhancing our holistic approach to keeping our patients out of pain for the long-term. By combining chiropractic care combined with medical integration we will help relieve chronic pain, improve well-being, and increase the benefits of chiropractic care and rehab. If you are experiencing pain in one of these areas, we recommend you make an appointment with a doctor of chiropractic first. The chiropractor will do a thorough evaluation and review your complete medical history. Then they will create an individualized treatment plan customized to your needs. This can include treatments such as manual adjustments, dry needling, cupping, soft tissue work, rehabilitative exercises and more. If you are unable to reduce pain in musculoskeletal areas with traditional chiropractic services one of our advanced medical services might be recommended to aid in the healing process.
