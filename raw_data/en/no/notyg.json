Our mission is to be a leading advocate for the use of mind-body medicine and a reputable resource for its practitioners; to promote awareness and provide information about the mind-body connection in health and healing to the public; and to offer information and resources to practitioners and patients alike who are interested in evidence-based practices, treatments and therapies that facilitate psychological and physical wellness from a mind-body perspective. The vision of the American Association of Mind-Body Medicine is a mind-body oriented health care system in the U.S. - one that puts the care back into health care by treating the whole person. In concert with AAMBM efforts, mind-body medicine is increasingly being used in hospitals, medical schools, private practices, and as a part of community health and trauma relief programs. Researchers representing an array of disciplines are exploring the ways in which psychological factors can have a powerful impact on physical health, and several US medical schools and centers now have departments devoted to mind-body research - including Harvard, Columbia, and UCLA. These investigations into mind-body phenomena have yielded considerable evidence that mind-body interventions can produce measurable changes in physiology: preventing illness, alleviating pain, and curing disease. By advocating for mind-body health care practitioners and raising public awareness about this exciting field, the American Association of Mind-Body Medicine is at the forefront of education, protocols and policies pertaining to mind-body medicine.
