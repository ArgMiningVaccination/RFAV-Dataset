Keywords homeopathy antimicrobial resistance upper respiratory tract infections clinical studies combination remediesAbstract Background Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and their complications are the most frequent cause of antibiotic prescribing in primary care. With multi-resistant organisms proliferating, appropri ate alternative treatments to these condi- tions are urgently required. Homeopathy presents one solution; however, there aremany methods of homeopathic prescribing. This review of the literature considersrstly whether homeopathy offers a viable al ternative therapeutic solution for acute URTIs and their complications, and seco ndly how such homeopathic intervention might take place. Method Critical review of post 1994 clinical st udies featuring homeopathic treat- ment of acute URTIs and their complications. Study design, treatment intervention,cohort group, measurement and outcome wer e considered. Discussion focused on the extent to which homeopathy is used to treat URTIs, rate of improvement andtolerability of the treatment, complications of URTIs, prophylactic and long-termeffects, and the use of combination versus single homeopathic remedies.Results Multiple peer-reviewed studies were found in which homeopathy had been used to treat URTIs and associated symptoms (cough, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, otitis media, acute sinusitis, etc.). Nine randomised (RCTs) and 8 observa- tional/cohort studies were analysed, 7 of which were paediatric studies. Seven RCTsused combination remedies with multipl e constituents. Results for homeopathy treatment were positive overall, with faste r resolution, reduced use of antibiotics and possible prophylactic and longer-term bene ts. Conclusions Variations in size, location, cohort and outcome measures make com- parisons and generalisations concerning ho meopathic clinical tri als for URTIs proble- matic. Nevertheless, study ndings suggest at least equivalence between homeopathy and conventional treatment for uncomplicated URTI cases, with fewer adverse events and potentially broader therapeutic outco mes. The use of non-individualised homeo- pathic compounds tailored for the paediatric population merits further investigation,including through cohort studies. In the light of antimicrobial resistance, homeopathyoffers alternative strategies for minor infe ctions and possible prevention of recurring URTIs. received August 16, 2017accepted after revision December 8, 2017 published online February 5, 2018Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Faculty of HomeopathyDOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0037-1621745.ISSN 1475-4916.Review Article 99 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Introduction With the emergence and proliferation of multi-resistant organisms, the prospect of an 'antimicrobial perfect storm '1 in the approaching decades has become an urgent public health concern.1The excessive and indiscriminate use of these drugs in both human and veterinary practices has led to the emergence and dissemination of resistant organismsthat endanger their ef cacy. 2-4Each year in the United States, at least 2 million people become infected with bac- teria that are resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000people die as a direct result of these infections. 5Warning of an approaching era in which antibiotics will no longer be effective, the World Health Organization (WHO) and otheragencies 6,7suggest alternative approaches, including the development of novel therapies to treat both mild and serious infections.7,8With a growing body of clinical evi- dence, a strong safety record and evidence of cost-effective- ness,9-11homeopathy represents one potential therapeutic solution that could lead to a reduction in the use of anti-biotics. Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) account for 60% of antibiotic prescribing in primary care, 12 yet they provide little bene t for the large proportion of respiratory tract infections which are viral in origin. This review of the literature asks, rstly, whether the peer- reviewed literature on this topic is suf ciently robust for homeopathy to be seriously considered as an alternative to antibiotics for URTIs and their complications and, secondly, how this homeopathic intervention might take place, forexample through more widespread use of particular homeo- pathic preparations. Literature Search Strategy The literature review focuses on peer-reviewed clinical studiesfeaturing homeopathic treatment of URTIs published after 1994. Due to the close association between URTIs and acuterhinopharyngitis and tonsillitis and their frequent treatment with antibiotics, several peer-reviewed studies in which homeopathy was used to treat these conditions were alsoreviewed. Although not rigorously following the format of a systematic review, the PRISMA guidelines (http://www. prisma-statement.org) and recommendations of PRISMA-Pchecklist (http://www.prisma-statement.org/documents/ PRISMA-P-checklist.pdf) were utilised for the reporting of data in Tables 1 and 2. Searches were conducted in two phases. In phase one, the following electronic databases were searched: AMED, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scien- ceDirect, Elsevier Health periodicals and CORE-Hom database.In phase two, additional searches were performed through Google Scholar, Mendeley literature search and the author 's university library. Citation chaining was also utilised; how-ever, studies for which the full article or key study details could not be later established were excluded from the nal systematic analysis. Searches, although wide, were limited topublished, peer-reviewed human trials reported in English. Key search terms were homeopathy, upper respiratory tract infections, rhinopharyngitis and mild viral infections. Studieswhich included related conditions, such as bronchitis, 13influ- enza,14otitis media and tonsillitis,15were considered only if URTI or viral infection involving the upper respiratory tract (URT) was mentioned in the title or aims, and where relevant to the study questions. Further exclusion criteria includedstudies deemed to be of poor quality, published before 1994 and where more than one complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy was used. Case reports of homeo-pathic treatments for URTIs from books and journals were also not considered. To ensure that a broad body of evidence was considered, peer-reviewed published studies, whetherrandomised, controlled or cohort, were reviewed, but were considered separately in terms of study aims and design (see Table 1 ). Analysis of all studies focused on the following elements: trial design; treatment intervention, with particu- lar reference to single/complex homeopathic medicaments (seeTable 2 ); cohort group (paediatric/adult/both); mea- surement criteria, and outcome, with particular reference to reduction in antibiotic use. URTIs and Antibiotics The upper respiratory tract (URT) consists of the nose, mouth, throat, larynx and trachea. URTI is the most common infectious illness in most populations and the primary reason people miss work or school.16Although generally short lived, symptoms of URTIs, such as fever, sore throat, headache and cough, are sources of distress for both adults and children and are costly in terms of time off work17,18and school.18The acute cough following a URTI can continue for several weeks.13Children are especially susceptible and may have as many as eight or even more episodes each year. Most URTIs are caused by a self-limiting viral illness (such as in fluenza and rhinoviruses) with symptoms lasting 7 to 10 days; however, complications such as otitis media, 19pharyngitis,20tonsillitis21and sinusitis22are frequently treated with antibiotics.23-27In the United States, 23% of paediatric medical visits from 2004 to 2008 resulted inprescriptions for antibiotics 9with otitis media, the most com- mon reason for prescribing antibiotics in children. Other phar- macological treatments include antipyretics, anti-in flammatory drugs, expectorants, decongestants, and cough suppressants, either alone or in combination.28Respiratory complaints are also the most frequent reason for over-the-counter (OTC) pur-chases of homeopathic medicines, 29suggesting a demand for alternatives to pharmaceutical OTC products. Public health and medical stewardship programmes aim to alter patients 'perceptions and doctors 'prescribing beha- viour.1Yet in many clinical contexts, antibiotic prescribing continues to elude best practice,1including in the treatment of URTIs and URTI-related conditions.23,30,31According to a recent US clinical report, up to 10 million antibiotic pre- scriptions per year directed towards respiratory conditionswere unlikely to provide any bene t. 32Fewer than 10% of sore throats are caused by bacterial infections, yet in around 60% of cases, antibiotics were prescribed for them.33In recent Cochrane reviews, the short-term effects of acute otitis media (AOM)34and URTIs35were mod- erate or negligible when compared with their potential risks. Homeopathy Vol. 107 No. 2/2018Homeopathy in the Age of Antimicrobial Resistance Fixsen 100 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. One Cochrane study found antibiotics to be 'not very useful ' in the treatment of AOM, only marginally decreasing thenumber of children with pain at 24 hours (when most children were better), only slightly reducing those with pain in the rst few days following infection and having no effect on reducing the number of children with subsequent hearing loss. 34In some patients with acute bronchitis, anti- biotics had a modest bene cial effect; however, these ben- ets must be considered in the broader context of side effects, the self-limiting nature of the condition, the costs of antibiotic treatment and the increased resistance torespiratory pathogens. 35Only in the case of pneumonia in the elderly were the bene ts of antibiotics seen as signi - cant;36however, the authors of this study concluded that the use of antibiotics for prophylaxis was still not justi able. Another US study estimated the number of annual antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory conditions (includingsinusitis, otitis media, and pharyngitis) as 221 per 1,000 people, yet only half of these prescriptions were considered appropriate for these conditions. 37Understanding differen- tial diagnosis is also important, as is ruling out more serious illness. For instance, while most cases of acute pharyngitis in children have a viral origin, are benign and self-limiting(and for which antibiotics are often unnecessarily pre- scribed), untreated streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis can result in serious complications, such as rheumatic feverand related cardiovascular disorders or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. 38,39 In addition to ef cacy, the immunological effects and safety of antibiotics are a concern. Studies con rm that pervasive changes occur within the human microbiome after antibiotic treatment and that resistant strains ofbacteria can persist for years. 40Individuals prescribed antibiotics in primary care for a respiratory infection develop bacterial resistance to that antibiotic, which not only increases the population carriage of organisms resis- tant to rst-line antibiotics, but also leads to increased use of second-line antibiotics in the community.41According to one meta-analysis, the risk of acquiring methicillin-resis- tant Staphylococcus aureus increased by 1.8-fold in patients who had taken antibiotics.42Nevertheless, public aware- ness concerning the appropriate use and safety of antibio- tics still appears to be lacking. In one Australian consumerstudy, over one-third of the 252 participants thought that taking antibiotics when suffering from a cold or fluw o u l d lead to more rapid recovery, while nearly one- fth consid- ered antibiotics as a cure for viral infections. 43Links have been established between antibiotic use and paediatric asthma44,45and eczema46and less common but grave physical and psychoactive side effects associated with par- ticular antibiotics. The class of antibiotics fluoroquinolones is known to cause tendonitis, central nervous neuropathy, 47and juvenile fluoroquino- lone-induced joint/cartilage of spectrum antibiotic clarithromycin includeliver and renal failure 49,50and psycho-neurological effects including hallucinations, depersonalisation, depression, insomnia and psychosis.51The Homeopathic Approach As a CAM therapy, homeopathy has been subject to criticismfor its use of in nitesimal doses to treat different aliments, with insuf cient proof that such doses can have an effect. 52 Yet, despite a long history of scienti c controversy, homeop- athy has proved resilient, is geographically widespread,53 and is an accepted part of the medical system in countriessuch as India, 54France55and Switzerland.56Advantages of homeopathy include ease of application and safety, with few contraindications existing in the treatment of the very young9and old, beside the careful selection of remedy and dosage. Whereas using antibiotics and OTC medications does little to improve the body 's future response to infection, homeopathy purports to do so. When dealing with complex systems, a holistic medical approach, such as is frequently used in homeopathy, can offer therapeutic advantages over non-individualised reductionistmethods. 57,58In part, it is the person-focused approach of traditional homeopathy that distinguishes it from conven- tional approaches59and contributes to its appeal to certain population groups.60-62Unlike mainstream medicine, where treatment is based on the clinical diagnosis and the idiosyn- cratic symptoms of the patient are given less importance, inthe 'classical 'homeopathic tradition the prescription of a homeopathic medication or 'remedy 'is based on the totality of symptoms and signs exhibited or expressed by an indivi-dual patient. 63Thus, in homeopathic case-taking, the assess- ment of the medical situation may not be the principal reason for the choice of remedy,56and a spectrum of remedies based on different criteria may be considered. There are, however, many variations to the homeopathic method of prescribing, especially in the treatment of chronicconditions. A particular distinction lies between individua- lised and clinically based homeopathic treatment protocols, the former being based on a 'total system approach 'as described above and the latter on a more generic method, in which 'combination 'or'complex 'homeopathic medicines may be prescribed for a particular condition or disease. 64Another method, 'isopathy ', refers to the use of diseased by-products or tissues, known as 'nosodes ', and healthyanimal tissue, referred to as sarcodes,65which may be prescribed individually or to a population group for preventative purposes.66,67All these methodologies have been employed in clinical studies, includ-ing for the treatment of URTIs. From the homeopathic per- spective, patients with chronic conditions may require 'constitutional 'remedies, emphasising the suitability of the in-depth individualised approach. Seeking a 'totality 'of symp- toms in a holistic sense 68is resource and time consuming however, as it requires a detailed chronological history of thepatient and their condition so that a single remedy can be prescribed to treat a range of symptoms. In acute conditions, the symptom picture is less complicated and the need toprescribe more urgent, strengthening the case for non-indi- vidualised prescribing. Homeopathy and Research With an empirical tradition going back more than 200 years and homeopathic physicians trained in the scienti c Homeopathy Vol. 107 No. 2/2018Homeopathy in the Age of Antimicrobial Resistance Fixsen 101 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. method, research has always been the backbone of homeop- athy. Homeopathic literature includes a vast number ofpublished drug \"provings ', case studies and practice reports; however, substantial areas of practice have remained uncharted. For instance, the treatment of large-scale epi-demics has never been systematically and scienti cally researched. 56The problems of measuring the effects of homeopathic treatment through randomised controlledtrials (RCTs) and other reductionist methods are consider- able. A number of systematic reviews of the homeopathy RCT literature by Mathie et al 64,69,70found signi cant inadequa- cies, with the majority of studies demonstrating uncertain or high risk of bias. Some studies were not properly rando- mised, with most studies addressing a different aspect ofhomeopathic care. 71Practical problems of RCTs include selecting patients for participation, the insecurities caused by blinding and variations in the level of training of indivi-dual homeopathic physicians. Whereas conventional medi- cine examines the speci c effect of a pharmaceutical substance, the effects of a homeopathic substance arisefrom its complex individual interaction with the organism and this limits the external validity and generalisability of placebo-controlled, blinded homeopathy studies. 56As with all clinical trials, there are variations in size and outcome measures, with the limited number of homeopathic studies making these types of anomalies more signi cant. The absence of positive or any RCT results does not necessarily mean that a treatment is ineffective, and a danger lies in eliminating treatments on the basis of no RCT proof oftheir ef cacy. 56Non-RCTs and patient reported surveys are considered by some to be inferior forms of research evidence, but are important adjuncts to RCTs that can measure keymarkers such as patient satisfaction, quality of life and functional health. Observational studies such as clinical outcome studies and case reports, monitoring the effects of homeopathy in real-life clinical settings, are a helpful adjunct to RCTs 72and more closely re flect real-life experi- ences of patients and physicians than RCTs,73and are there- fore considered in this study. Results Searches of online libraries and bibliographical references found multiple peer-reviewed studies (in English and non- English) published between 1994 and 2017, in which homeopathy had been used to treat URTIs and associatedsymptoms (cough, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, otitis media, acute sinusitis, etc.). Both RCTs and observational/cohort studies were searched and screened to ensure that as many studiesas possible were included in the review and its discussion. Non-English language studies, and those for which key study details could not be established, were later excluded from thenal review, as were those that did not directly refer to URTIs in the title or content. For the nal review, nine RCTs and eight observational/cohort studies were analysed, of whichsix of the RCTs and one observational/cohort trial were paediatric studies. Seven RCTs used combination remedies with multiple constituents. One of the RCTs in these tables isfeatured twice as it measured treatment effects on two different cohorts. The rst article 74reports the effects and safety of standard treatment (ST) plus a homeopathic com- pound (In flucid [IFC]), or ST only, on a mixed age cohort with a URTI. The later article28reports the effects of ST plus IFC or ST only, on a paediatric cohort. Both articles have been included in the analysis. The two studies reported by Zanasi 's team (RCT13and observational75) bear similarities in that the same homeopathic complex was used on both paediatric arms; however, in the observational study one arm received antibiotics in addition to the homeopathic cough medicine. Full details of randomised and observational studies, including trial design, mode of homeopathic treatment (e.g. complex, individualised), cohort, outcome assessment,results and conclusions, are given in Table 1 .Table 2 focuses on studies using complex homeopathic remedies, and a breakdown of the homeopathic constituents wherethis information was available. The article 's discussion focuses on the following areas of concern: extent to which homeopathy is used for URTIs,tolerability and rate of improvement of homeopathic treat- ment, complications of URTIs, prophylactic and long-term effects, and the use of combination versus single homeo-pathic remedies. As a literature review, rather than a sys- tematic review, no attempt has been made to extract new data from the primary articles, or to assess the intrinsicquality of each study, including risk of bias. Use of Homeopathy for URTIs Respiratory infections are a common reason for seekinghomeopathic care. 76,77For example, out of 551 paediatric patients treated at a homeopathic clinic in Rossi et al 's observational study, 337 (61%) presented with respiratory infections, making this the most frequently observed disease in this population group.78Of the various clinical trials featuring the use of homeopathy for a speci c condition, those concerning infectious diseases of the URT,13,28,79,80 and complications such as AOM (ear infections)9,81contain some of the most positive evidence of the effectiveness ofhomeopathic interventions. 56The evaluation of 27 studies for a Health Technology Assessment report on effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and appropriateness of homeopathy onURTIs and allergic reactions showed a positive overall result in favour of homeopathy, with six out of seven controlled studies showing at least equivalence to conventional medicalinterventions. 56 Tolerability In the treatment of self-limiting acute conditions such URTIs and mild infections, both treatment tolerability and the rate of improvement with a medical intervention are important,and several studies suggest that homeopathic treatment can full both these prerequisites. Many participants in homeo- pathic studies are children 9,14,79,81 -84so it is signi cant that the safety and tolerability of homeopathic treatment in the trials reviewed was very good.28,74,79,85A good rate of improvement in the acute symptoms of URTIs in those Homeopathy Vol. 107 No. 2/2018Homeopathy in the Age of Antimicrobial Resistance Fixsen 102 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

While cough scores decreased over time in each group, cough severity wassignicantly lower in the homeopathic group than in the placebo group after 4 and 7 days ( p<0.001 and p\u00bc0.023, respectively). A controlled multinational clinical trial con-ducted by Thinesse-Mallwitz et al 74in Germany and the Ukraine compared the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of IFC as an add-on treatment, with standard care (SC) alone,in the prevention of recurrent acute URTIs. The IFC group (265 patients) that was given homeopathy experienced signicantly faster improvement than those who had received conventional treatment alone. 74 Another study by Jong et al79measured the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of a homeopathic medicinal complex inthe prevention of recurrent acute URTIs in children. The trial, which took place in four outpatient paediatric clinics, involved children under six, with a known susceptibility to acute URTIs.Children were randomly divided into two groups, one group receiving the homeopathic combination remedy CalSuli-4 -02 and the other (the control group) receiving another homeo-pathic product, for 3 weeks. The main outcome measure was frequency of acute URTIs occurring within 3 and 6 months following treatment. Another outcome measure was a reduc- tion in antibiotic use. Both 'appetite disorder 'and 'child 's activities 'improved in both arms of the trial, but more signicantly in the CalSuli-4 -02 group. While results of the above studies are disadvantaged by limited cohort size, others such as the large-scale interna-tional comparative outcome study by Haidvogl et al 87of 1,577 adults and children from eight different countries are less disputable. In this study, individualised homeopathy andSC were compared in the treatment of acute respiratory and ear complaints. Treatment with homeopathy was associated with signi cantly faster onset of improvement in the rst week, while adverse drug reactions occurred more fre- quently only in the adult group receiving conventional treatment. Results at 14 days were similar in both groups.The authors concluded that homeopathy was not inferior to conventional treatment in ear and acute respiratory infections. Complications of URTIs Complications of URTIs are not the primary focus of thisarticle; however, in clinical practice they remain the most common causes of antibiotic prescriptions 21,37,88and as such warrant some attention in this review. Searchesrevealed a good number of studies in which homeopathy had been used for the URTI-related disorders with promisingoutcomes, including AOM (ear infections), 9,81,83,89rhino- pharyngitis,90,91sinusitis,92-95and tonsillitis.15,96In a study by Trichard et al comparing homeopathic and antibiotictreatment strategies for rhinopharyngitis in children, homeopathy yielded signi cantly better results than anti- biotics in terms of both medical effectiveness (reducednumber of episodes and number of complications) and improved quality of life with signi cantly less time taken off work for parents. 90A double-blind study by Friese and and toler- ability of a homeopathic combination remedy for the treat- ment of acute rhinosinusitis. One hundred and forty-fourpatients with acute rhinosinusitis were treated either with a homeopathic remedy ( n\u00bc72) or placebo ( n\u00bc72). In the treatment group, the average sum score dropped frominitially 12.1 /C61.6 to 5.9 /C62.0 points after 7 days. In the placebo group, it decreased from 11.7 /C61.6 to 11.0 /C62.9 points ( p<0.001). After 21 days, 90.3% of the homeopathic treatment group was free from complaints, whereas in 88.9% of the placebo group the complaints remained unchanged or became worse. The authors concluded that the homeopathicproduct allowed an effective and tolerable treatment of acute rhinosinusitis. There have been several studies indicating the effectiveness of homeopathy for both acute and chronic tonsillopharyngitis. Friese et al 97performed a The studygroup received Tonsilotren hourly until onset of improvement, then three times a day, while the control group received placebo.Typical tonsillitis symptoms included swallowing dif culties, throat pain and redness, salivation and fever. By day 4, the study group showed a signi cantly higher rate of decrease in symptoms than the placebo group. By day 6, 92.4% of study patients showed full recovery or moderate improvement,compared with the 43.1% in the control group, with a dete- rioration rate of 3.8% in the study group against 22.8% in the control group. A more recent, international, RCT of the homeopathic combination remedy SilAtro-5 -90 (brand name: Tonsilot- ren) was performed in multiple settings by Palm et al. 96Two hundred and fty-six patients aged 6 to 60 years with moderate recurrent tonsillitis (RT) were given either the homeopathic preparation in addition to standard sympto-matic treatment or ST alone. The test group received Tonsi- lotren for three treatment periods of 8 weeks, each treatment period being followed by an 8- to 12-week periodwithout the homeopathic preparation. The primary outcome measure was the estimated rate of diagnosed acute throat infections per year, with other outcome measures beingseverity of RT symptoms and the antibiotics required due to acute throat infections. Occurrence of RT symptoms was seen in a signi cantly lower percentage of patients in the test group compared with the control group. There was also a reduction in antibiotics used due to acute throat infections. The authors conclude that an integrative treatment Homeopathy Vol. 107 No. 2/2018Homeopathy in the Age of Antimicrobial Resistance Fixsen 109 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. approach, in which SilAtro-5 -90 or Tonsilotren is given alongside mainstream symptomatic treatment, could be oftherapeutic bene t to patients with a history of RT. Both small- and large-scale studies suggest that homeop- athy may reduce the prescribing of antibiotics for acute URTIsand their sequelae. 28,83,98,99As part of an EPI3 nationwide survey of primary care practice in France, the progress of 518 adults and children with URTIs (79.3% with rhinopharyngi-tis) treated by either general practitioners (GPs) certi ed to use homeopathy (GP-Hom) or GPs who used conventional medicine only (GP-CM) was compared. Patients in the GP-Hom group showed signi cantly lower consumption of antibiotics similar outcomes. 91 Prophylactic and Long-Term Effects CAM therapies that are proven safe can be used to strengthen the self-healing capacities of the organism (preventive and curative health promotion).100Several studies examined for this review suggest prophylactic, as well as short-term, potential for the products or remedies under review. In Siqueira et al 's14trial, 600 children aged 1 to 5 years were randomly distributed to three groups and prescribed either a homeopathic complex, placebo or In fluBio. The number of flu and acute respiratory infections in each group in a year(2009 -2010) was then recorded. While the number of epi- sodes overall was small, 30.5% of the placebo group devel- oped three or more acute infections in the post-interventionyear, whereas there were no recorded episodes in those receiving the homeopathic complex and only one episode in the group receiving In fluBio. A 2016 observational study by Beghi and Morselli-Labate, 72conducted over a 10-year period in Italy, suggested that the regular use of the homeo- pathic medicine Oscillococcinum during the winter months could play a role in the prevention of respiratory tract infections. In comparison with the control group, patientswho took Oscillococcinum once a week for 8 months per year had a greater reduction in the average infectious episodes during the study compared with the year before inclusion,independent of age and class. An observational study from 1998 to 2008 by Rossi et al 78 assessed the outcome of homeopathic treatment in 551 children under 14 years of age. Respiratory infections (337 cases, 61%) were the most frequently observed diseases. The Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital Outcome Score (GHHOS)was used to assess outcome. After homeopathic treatment, 68% of children with respiratory disease showed a strong improvement or attained a resolution of their problems. Theauthors concluded that improvement or resolution of symp- toms is more likely in patients with problems in the URT than other categories (e.g. dermatological, digestive, psychologi-cal) and in patients followed up for at least 12 months. Another observational study, by Witt et al, 95showed long- term improvements in patients seeking homeopathic treat-ment for sinusitis. The treatment group (a sub-group of a large multi-centred observational study) included 134 adults treated by 62 physicians. All patients had sufferedfrom chronic sinusitis (CS) for over 9 years, almost all (97.0%) of whom had previously been treated with conventionalmedicine. Self-reported scores showed both physical and mental improvements persisting for 8 years. The authors point to the need for more explanatory studies to establishthe extent to which these effects could be due to lifestyle regulation, placebo, or context effects associated with the treatment. Also of interest is a multi-centre observationalstudy, performed in India by Nayak et al, 93which sought to test the therapeutic usefulness of homeopathic medicine in the management of CS in 550 patients. The chronic sinusitisassessment score (CSAS) was used to assess symptom sever- ity. The authors of this study found statistically signi cant reductions in CSAS after 3 and 6 months of treatment, alongwith improved radiological appearance. No complications were observed during treatment. Their conclusion is that homeopathic treatment could be effective for patients withCS but controlled trials were required for further validation. Combination versus Single Homeopathic Remedies The studies featured in this review adopt a range of approaches to prescribing, both from the perspective of control and selection of single or combination remedieswith varying constituents (see Table 2 ). Of the seven RCTs in this review using combination remedies, four were placebo-controlled. The active controls used in the other twostudies varied: Thinesse-Mallwitz et al 's team 28,74compared treatment with the homeopathic medication IFC with ST, while Jong et al79compared CalSuli with another complex homeopathic product. Siqueira et al14used placebo, but also compared the product In fluBio (puri ed in fluenza virus /C230c) and inactivated in fluenza virus /C230c. The constituents contained in the homeopathic complexes (most of them brand-named products) cover a wide range of remedies. Many of these remedies are derived from plant sources, and their propensity to alleviate or resolve the symp-toms of URTIs and their complications have been discussed at length in the homeopathic clinical literature. Homeopathic compounds and syrups contained up to nine different consti-tuents, generally in low potencies. 13,14,74,79,101Despite wide variations in the remedies chosen, some clear 'favourites ' emerged, the most commonly used remedies being Bryonia (6 studies), Phosphorus (4 studies), Ipecacuanha (4 studies) and Sulfur (3 studies). Thendings from this review suggest at least equivalence between complex homeopathy and conventional treatment for uncomplicated cases of URTIs. In all but one study, the homeopathic products under evaluation yielded favourableresults by way of milder symptoms and shorter duration of acute illness, and several had led to reduced use of anti- biotics. Given the ease and convenience of this type ofprescribing, the distress associated with acute URTIs, 97the need to reduce reliance on antibiotics and the known side effects of pharmaceutical OTC products, there is a case forusing tried and tested combination remedies to treat uncom- plicated cases of URTIs. On the other hand, the quality of the body of evidence on non-individualised homeopathic Homeopathy Vol. 107 No. 2/2018Homeopathy in the Age of Antimicrobial Resistance Fixsen 110 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. treatment is low, and the risk of bias in existing RCTs is high.64The variable constituents of each product (some of which contained eight or more homeopathic ingredients) call into question the speci c action of these products on URTIs, especially given the short-lived nature of this condi-tion in otherwise healthy children and adults. In addition, some products such as Engystol have been tested in several studies with different results. 64,85,102It is important that combination remedies continue to be subject to rigorous trials, which test the ef cacy and safety of such com- pounds.28,74,79Dose frequency and duration of use also need to be considered to eliminate accidental provings or 'remedy exhaustion '.aAcute illnesses produce different symptoms in patients, and more research is required toestablish which products suit particular scenarios and at which stage of illness they are most effective. Mathie et al 's recently published article suggests that the model validity of placebo-controlled trials of non-individua- lised homeopathic treatment is lower than that of indivi- dualised treatment. 103In a follow-up article, the authors conclude that better designed and more rigorous RCTs are needed to develop an evidence base that can decisively provide reliable effect estimates of non-individualisedhomeopathic treatment; 64however, neither individualised nor non-individualised RCTs featuring homeopathy score well in terms of model validity or risk of bias. Conclusion With the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), respiratory infections have become more dif cult to treat. Inappropriate use of antibiotics and other antimicrobialsleads to the growth and spread of resistant bacteria, which colonise the airways and can affect the entire community. 88 The push to limit AMR requires a consolidated, concertedeffort by multiple stakeholders. 104Effective strategies are needed to restrict the use of antibiotics without harmingthose who truly need these medications. While lifestyle and nutrition play a signi cant part in their control, homeopathy presents a low cost, holistic adjunct or alternative for manycommon infections. The clinical trials examined in this article showed variations in size, location, cohort types, type of intervention and outcome measures, which makecomparisons and generalisations problematic. Nevertheless, combined evidence from these and other studies suggests that homeopathic treatment can exert biological effects withfewer adverse events and broader therapeutic opportunities than conventional medicine in the treatment of URTIs. 56,105 Given the cost implications of treating URTIs and their complications in children, and the relative absence of effec- tive alternatives without potential side effects, the use of non-individualised homeopathic compounds tailored for thepaediatric population merits further investigation, including through large-scale cohort studies.The quantity of peer-reviewed homeopathic research is small when compared with conventional medicinalresearch. There are many gaps in evidence, but recent studies support the view that homeopathy could be at least as effective as an ST, with effects that can be differ-entiated from placebo 106,107and can ll existing effective- ness gaps in the conventional medical treatment of URTIs and their complications.9Importantly for global health, studies such as those presented in this article suggest that patients given homeopathic treatment and who follow sensible disease avoidance measures may avoid infectionso rm a yb ea b l et or e d u c er e l i a n c eo nc o n v e n t i o n a lm e d i c a - tion, including antibiotics. 9,91I nt h em e a n t i m e ,t h em o s t important evidence still arises from practical clinicalexperience and from the successful treatment of millions of patients.

Furtherresearch is required to establish the best means of achiev- ing this; however, prioritising studies of paediatric and elderly populations would seem a path forward for thereduction in antibiotic use and the on-going risk of resistance.
