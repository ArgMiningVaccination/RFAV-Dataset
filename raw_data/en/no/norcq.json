Introduction This Supplemental Assay Method (SAM) is a titration method for assaying live chicken -embryo - potency . The method uses embryonated chicken eggs as the indicator host system . This assay is used to demonstrate the presence of live chlamydia and to determine the titer of a vaccine serial by the chicken embryo death pattern 10 days after inoculation. 2.

Preparation for the Test 3.1 Personnel qualifications/training Personnel shall have experience in the propagation and maintenance of chlamyd ophila agents and inoculation techniques of embryonated chicken eggs . Personnel shall be proficient with chlamyd ophila titration techniques using embryonated chicken eggs. 3.2 Preparation of equipment/instrumentation On the day of test initiation, set a water bath at 36 \u00b0\u00b1 2\u00b0C. 3.3 Preparation of reagents/control procedures 3.3.1 Preparation of eggs 1. On the day of test initiation, using an egg -candling light, check each egg for viability, proper embryo growth, and integrity of the egg shell . Appropriately dispose of eggs which do not meet these criteria. 2. Label each egg by writing a number with a pencil just below the base line of the air sac . Numbered eggs are placed in double layer cardboard flats. Center for Veterinary Biologics SAM 320.0 4 Testing Protocol Page 6 of 11 Supplemental Assay Method for Titration of Chlamydophila felis (formerly Feline Chlamydia ) in Embryonated Chicken Eggs UNCONTROLLED COPY 3. Disinfect the air sac end by swabbing with 2% Tincture of Iodine . Allow to air dry. 4. Drill a small hole through the disinfected egg shell using an electric etcher/engraver or egg drill . 5. Retain 5 uninoculated viable embryonated chicken eggs to serve as controls and to monitor nonspecific embryo death. 3.3.2 Preparation of C. felis Positive Control 1. On the day of test initiation, rapidly thaw a vial of Chlamyd ophila Positive Control in a 36\u00b0\u00b1 2\u00b0C water bath. 2. With a 10 -mL pipette, dispense 4.5 m L Chlamyd ophila Diluent into each of an appropriate number of 17 x 100 -mm polystyrene tubes . Label each tube, bracketing the expected Chlamyd ophila Positive Control endpoint titer specified in the C enter for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) Reagent Data S heet (e.g., label 7 tubes from 10-1 through 10-7, respectively). 3. With a micropipettor, transfer 500 \u00b5 L of the Chlamyd ophila Positive Control to the tube labeled 10-1; mix by vortexing. 4. Using a new pipette tip, transfer 500 \u00b5 L from the 10-1-labeled tube (Section 3.3.2 [3]) to the 10-2 tube; mix by vortexing. 5. Repeat Section 3.3.2 (4) for each of the subsequent dilutions until the tenfold dilution series is completed. 3.4 Preparation of the sample 3.4.1 The initial test of a Test Vaccine will be with a single vial (a single sample from 1 vial) . On the day of inoculation, using a sterile 1.0 -mL syringe and an 18-gauge x 1 1/2-inch needle, rehydrate a vial of the Test Vaccine with the provided diluent b y transferring 1.0 m L for a 1 -mL-dose vaccine, 0.5 m L for a 1/2-mL-dose vaccine, etc., into the vial containing the lyophilized Test Vaccine ; mix by vortexing . Incubate for 15 \u00b1 5 min utes at room temperature . 3.4.2 Multifraction Test Vaccine s containing feline rhinotracheitis feline calicivirus (FCV), or feline panleukopenia virus are prepared the same as chlamyd ophila single -fraction Test Vaccine s. (FRV, FCV, and FPV do not replicate in embryonated chicken eggs.) Center for Veterinary Biologics SAM 320.0 4 Testing Protocol Page 7 of 11 Supplemental Assay Method for Titration of Chlamydophila felis (formerly Feline ) in Embryonated Chicken Eggs UNCONTROLLED COPY 3.4.3 Using the same method described for diluting the Chlamyd ophila Positive Control in Section 3.3.2 (2) through Section 3.3.2 (5), prepare an appropriate number of tenfold serial dilutions of the reconstituted Test Vaccine to bracket its expected endpoint titer specified in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) filed Outline of Production. 4. Performance of the Test 4.1 Mix the dilution tubes by vortexing, and aspirate 0.5 m L of the highest (most dilute) tenfold dilution of the Test Vaccine with a 1 -mL syringe and 22 -gauge x 1 1/2- inch needle . Holding the syringe vertically, insert the needle to a depth of 1.25 \u00b1 0.25 inch. Inoculate 100 \u00b5 L of the Test Vaccine into the yolk sac of each of 5 eggs/dilution. 4.2 With the same syringe, aspirate an equal volume of the vortexed next lower Test Vaccine dilution and inoculate the yolk sacs of 5 more 4.3 Inoculate the remaining dilutions . Separate syringes are not necessary between dilutions in a dilution series when dispensing from the most dilute to the most concentrated within that series but are required between series. 4.4 In a similar manner, inoculate 5 eggs/dilution of the Chlamyd 10-4, Section 3.3.2 (2)). 4.5 Seal the inoculation hole of all eggs with Duco cement and allow to air dry 5 \u00b1 2 minutes. 4.6 Return all inoculated embryonated chicken eggs to the egg incubator . (At this time, inoculated eggs can be incubated in egg flats for the required 11 \u00b1 1 days time interval . Use double egg flats to prevent a ccidental egg rupture during candling/handling.) 4.7 On the second day postinoculation, candle the inoculated and uninoculated control eggs . Identify, record day of death, and appropriately discard dead embryonated chicken eggs . Deaths occurring prior to 3 days postinoculation are regarded as nonspecific deaths. 4.8 Candle the embryonated chicken eggs daily through 11 \u00b1 1 days postinoculation . Identify, record day of death, and appropriately discard dead embryonated chicken eggs . Deaths occurring on 3 days postinoculation through 11 \u00b1 1 days postinoculation are regarded as specific and are used to calculate the titer of the Test Vaccine . Center for Veterinary Biologics SAM 320.0 4 Testing Protocol Page 8 of 11 Supplemental Assay Method for Titration of Chlamydophila felis (formerly Feline Chlamydia psittaci ) in Embryonated Chicken Eggs UNCONTROLLED COPY 4.9 Calculate the C. felis endpoints of the Test Vaccine and the Chlamyd ophila Positive Control using the Spearman -K\u00e4rber method as commonly modified . The titers are expressed as log 10 50% chicken embryo lethal dose (CE LD50) per m L. Example: 10-4 dilution of Test Vaccine = 5/5 embryos dead 10-5 dilution of Test Vaccine = 5/5 embryos dead 10-6 dilution of Test Vaccine = 2/5 embryos dead 10-7 dilution of Test Vaccine = 0/5 embryos dead Test Vaccine titer = (X - d/2 + [d s] where: X = reciprocal log 10 of highest dilution with all chicken embryos dead due to chlamydophila infection (5) d = log 10 of tenfold dilution factor (1) s = sum of proportion s of infected dead chick embryos for all dilutions tested starting at X: (5+2+0) = 7 = 1.4 5 5 Test Vaccine titer = ( 5 - 1/2 + [1 1.4]) = 5.9 Adjust the titer to the recommended Test Vaccine dose as follows : A. Divide the Test Vaccine Dose by the Inoculation Dose where: Test Vaccine Dose = manufacturer's recommended vaccination dose (for this Chlamydophila Test Vaccine, the recommended dose is 1 mL). Inoculation Dose = amount of diluted Test Vaccine with wh ich each chicken embryo is inoculated (for this Chlamydophila Test Vaccine, the inoculation dose is 0.1 mL) 1 mL dose = 10 0.1 mL inoculum B. Calculate the log 10 of value in A and add it to the Test Vaccine titer as illustrated below: Log of 10 = 1 Test Vaccine titer 5.9 + 1 = 6.9 Therefore, the Test Vaccine Titer = 106.9 CELD50/mL.

Interpretation of the Test Results 5.1 For a valid assay 5.1.1 All 5 of the uninoculated embryonated chicken eggs must be viable at the end of the test. 5.1.2 At least 4 eggs/dilution must be viable 3 days postinoculation for each Test Vaccine and the Chlamyd ophila Positive Control. 5.1.3 The calculated CE LD50 titer of the Chlamyd ophila Positive Control must fall within plus or minus 2 standard deviations (\u00b1 2 SD) of its mean titer, as established by a minimum of 10 previous titrations. 5.1.4 If the validity requirements are not met, then the assay is considered a NO TEST and can be retested without prejudice. 5.2 In a valid tes t, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is equal to or greater than the titer specified in an APHIS filed Outline of Production, the Test Vaccine is considered SATISFACTORY . 5.3 In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is lower than the titer speci fied in an APHIS filed Outline of Production, the Test Vaccine shall be retested in accordance with 9 CFR 113.8(b). 6. Report of Test Results Report results as CE LD50 per dose. 7.
