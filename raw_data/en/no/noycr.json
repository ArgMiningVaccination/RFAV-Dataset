The festivities begin almost a month prior to the start of Chinese New Year (8 February) - the lights and auspicious decorations are up island-wide, festive tunes are heard in the malls, special reunion menus are available at restaurants, and shops everywhere get ready for the crowds with extra stock. Be in the thick of the action at Chinatown, where you'll get to experience the spectacular Street Light-Up from 16 January to 8 March. A common sight during Chinese New Y ear is the Lion Dance, an elaborate ritual that is believed to start the year off (or a new business) on an auspicious note. Boisterous beats performed with traditional drums, cymbal, and gongs set the tone for this spirited and highly animated dance, which mimics a lion's movements. Don't January is a crazy busy (but fun!) month for art lovers in Singapore, as the city greets the New Y ear with a slew of exhibitions, blockbuster fairs and curatorial tours under the massive Singapore Art Week (www.artweek.sg), happening from 16 to 24 January. A good place to start is the PPC | : A Public Living Room (15 to 30 January, Level 5 Carpark, People's Park Complex) exhibition, which attempts to blur the distinctions between the public and private. Love pop culture? Be sure to make time for Andy Warhol: Social Circus (16 to 29 January, #01-26 Gillman Barracks, 47 Malan Road), where a rare collection of the artist's private polaroids of famous people in the '70s and '80s will be on display for the first time in Asia. be taken aback by all the noise; it's meant to drive off bad luck! Y ou can catch a glimpse of the lively act at the International Lion Dance Competition (23 to 24 January, Chinatown), Chingay Parade (19 to 20 February, F1 Pit Building), River Hong Bao (6 to 14 February, The Float@Marina Bay) and at shopping malls around the city in the month of February. More traditions are observed at home, like spring cleaning the house before the holidays, exchanging oranges, and giving out ang bao (red packets with money) to children and younger relatives - all of which convey blessings of good fortune for the year ahead. Then, there's the all-important reunion dinner, where friends and families gather round for a precious annual feast. Another popular practice in Singapore as part of the traditional get-together meal is the yusheng toss. Carried out at home or when Art enclave Gillman Barracks is also hosting Art After Dark (22 January, 9 Lock Road), an outdoor party with various arts-based activities, shows as well as foodie pop-ups. For a dose of Singapore's street culture, head down to the cool Bugis district for an evening of good sounds, street art, skateboarding and dance performances at Aliwal Urban Arts Festival (16 January, Aliwal Arts Centre). Guided tours are a great way to explore the city, and there is a handful that you can join during the Singapore Art Week. Discover the past, present and future of the Singapore Story as you admire the works along the Jubilee Walk with Public Art Walking Tour, and don't forget to pop into the new National Gallery Singapore while you're in the area! dining out at restaurants, yusheng is a raw fish salad that comes with an array of ingredients including shredded vegetables, crushed peanuts, fried flour crisps, pomelo, and more, each of which symbolises a blessing. The idea is to get everyone around the table to toss the ingredients up in the air using chopsticks while reciting auspicious phrases for luck and success. The higher you toss, the better. But be warned: it's a messy affair! More deliciousness ensues in the form of iconic Chinese New Y ear goodies like bak kwa (barbecued meat) and pineapple tarts - items you'll constantly see on offer at the festive street bazaar and flower market in Chinatown (15 January to 7 February), as well as in shops around Singapore during the festive period. Often, these treats symbolise good things like wealth and prosperity, so do give these seasonal specials a try when you're in the Lion City! Otherwise, hop onboard the Concrete Island (23 January), an intriguing bus tour that will take you from Changi Airport to Tuas Checkpoint to experience a moving image of Singapore. Architect and university professor Dr Lai Chee Kien will be on hand to address the city's urban history, its movement and the design of expressways. Better yet, these events are just the tip of the iceberg. Southeast Asia's flagship art fair Art Stage Singapore 2016 (21 to 24 January, Sands Expo & Convention Centre) and the Prudential Eye Awards and Finalists' Exhibition 2016 (16 to 27 March) are making a comeback this year. Plus there is a whole bunch of exciting exhibitions and activities to look forward to all across the island. Pop into www.artweek.sg for a complete overview!

WE SPEAK TO THE ACCLAIMED DIRECTOR ABOUT SINGAPORE'S ART SCENE, THE NEW NATIONAL GALLERY SINGAPORE, AND HIS FAVE ISLAND HAUNTS. ACTION! the relationship between domestic caregivers and the elderly they look after, while the latters' respective adult children are out at work or totally absent in the household. This phenomenon challenges the concept of filial piety that is cherished in many Asian communities. My latest work, Bila Larut Malam (In The Still Of The Night)... is a short film commissioned by the National Gallery Singapore that premiered during the museum's grand opening. It has a rather formalistic, linear approach. The camera and lighting adopt a stylised mise-en-sc\u00e8ne . This film is about three women who find strength in their loss, and features classic Malay songs \"Nak Dara Rindu\" by P Ramlee and \"Semoga Bahagia\" by Zubir Said. My top five attractions in Singapore are... 1) Bukit Timah Nature Reserve - I believe this reserve is the oldest primarily rainforest in the city. 2) Little India - if you want to be transported into a different time capsule and culture. 3) Bukit Chandu War Memorial - this was the first Malay Regiment's last stand against the Japanese invasion during WWII. 4) Bukit Brown Cemetary - lots of Singapore's pioneers are buried here. And 5) Changi Point - because my National Service barracks are still there and it's close to Pulau Ubin. I always eat and drink at... Simpang Bedok - which has lots of good restaurants and stalls serving Malay and Halal food. Compared to 50 years ago... I am seeing a greater breathing space at the moment for the artist to both exhibit and express his/her respective art. Of course, the support of the local community is essential for local arts to grow in Singapore. Having a world-class institution like the National Gallery Singapore gives... Singaporeans a platform to showcase world-class artworks. It's not just about putting Singapore on the world arts map, but also providing a platform for the child growing up in the inner heartlands to be Singapore's answer to Rembrandt, Van Gogh or Dali. The National Museum and Rex Cinema are other good places to see art and film in Singapore. I see filmmaking as... a cathartic exercise to return to my filmmaking roots and approaching the visual narrative cinematically. I find inspiration from my childhood, the neighbours I meet everyday, and random stories of Singaporeans I hear about. I have touched on... religion, inter-personal relationships and even a musical. My work on mainstream, commercial television production has also allowed me to have a grasp on commercial and artistic aspects of storytelling, without alienating my audience. Sayang Disayang is about... a housekeeper who searches for the elusive ingredient to cook the best sambal goreng, a traditional Malay spicy vegetable dish.

Her son Roland Lim, of eponymous establishment Roland Restaurant (#06-750, 89 Marine Parade Central), continues to serve the original version, which is sweeter and doesn't contain egg or sambal (chilli paste). The chilli crab that's most commonly served today was, in fact, a modification by the owner of Dragon Phoenix restaurant (#06-00 Novotel Clarke Quay, 177A River Valley Road).

Singapore's dining scene is... vibrant, cosmopolitan and diverse in terms of concepts, cuisines, and price points. It's almost a sin not to eat well here, the city has everything from tasty and affordable hawker food to world-class fine dining - all of which are within short proximity.

There is a saga tree... next to Corner House, and you can pick its crimson-coloured seeds, also known as 'love seeds' from the ground. These trees were more common in Singapore, but I see less of them these days, so it's both nostalgic and precious to me. If friends from out of town are here for a visit... I'll take them to Balestier in the morning to have local old-school cookies, including the famous tau sar piah (flaky pastry filled with mung bean paste), and local coffee for breakfast. Our next stop will be Sentosa or, more specifically, Universal Studios Singapore if they're up for it. In the late afternoon, just before dinner, we'll have a quick spot of shopping along the world-famous Orchard Road.

Food stylist and content creator Bella Koh could possibly navigate Tiong Bahru with her eyes closed, having lived in the area for more than a decade. We ask her to show us around Singapore's oldest and hippest neighbourhood. What I love most about my neighbourhood... is its strong sense of community. Tiong Bahru is like a small village in the middle of the bustling city where local seniors, young families and expats happily live side by side. Its unique charm... comes from Art Deco architecture, which is a stark contrast with Singapore's many high-rise buildings. The layouts inside every unit are also different. Not many know this but... Tiong Bahru was known as \"Mei Ren Wu\", which means \"den of beauties\" in Chinese, as it housed many rich men's mistresses. The perfect day in Tiong Bahru... starts with an early morning visit to the wet market, followed by breakfast at Tiong Bahru Hawker Centre (83 Seng Poh Road). Take a leisurely stroll along Eng Hoon Street to experience the local community. If you're feeling hungry for homegrown delights, head to Loo's Hainanese Curry Rice (71 Seng Poh Road) and then walk off your lunch by shopping at Strangelets and Books Actually along Y ong Siak Street. For dinner, drop by famous local eatery Por Kee (69 Seng Poh Lane) and grab a beer at The Tiong Bahru Club (88 Eng Hoon Street). Finally, end the day with a relaxing massage at Nimble/Knead (66 Eng Watt Street). Since becoming a mum... I've been taking the little one on a stroll around the neighbourhood, meeting neighbours and shop owners. The chilled-out ambience of the coffeehouses in the village are also great for families who like caf\u00e9-hopping. Don't leave Tiong Bahru... without trying the delicious tarts at Drips (82 Tiong Poh Road). Oh, try to catch Bob, the famous neighbourhood cat, on Eng Hoon Street! 23 22 HAD A GOOD TIME?
