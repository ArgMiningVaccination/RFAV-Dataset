Keywords Religion and medicine \u00b7 Metaphysics \u00b7 Spiritual therapies Introduction Healing has been described as an intensely personal, subjective experience that involves reconciling an individual's understanding of distressing events (including ontologies of illness) with a perception of wholeness in personhood (including spiritual aspects) (Egnew 2005 ). Based on expert interviews, Egnew has proposed that healing 'may be operationally dened as the personal experience of the 2005 ). 550 Regency Drive, Glendale Heights, IL 60139, USA 2The Initiative on Islam and Medicine, Program on Medicine and Religion, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA 3Section of Emergency Medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA 123Journal of Religion and Health https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-018-0666-3attempting to further understand and account for these personal experiences, the prominent bioethicist and medical philosopher, Dr. Daniel Sulmasy has proposed expanding thebiopsychosocial model of patient care to a biopsychosocial- spiritual model arguing that holistic care must incorporate the understanding that persons are beings-in-relationshipwith the question of transcendence (Sulmasy 2002 ). Healthcare practitioners are in the 'business' of healing, and as such are increasingly aware that patients, based on spiritual and/or religious understandings of their relationship with tran-scendence, may actively utilize faith-based healing practices in conjunction with or in place of conventional medicine. Padela and colleagues explored the types of traditional healing practices used by American Muslims in southeast Michigan through key informant interviews (Alrawiet al. 2011 ). These religious, healthcare and community leaders described three domains of traditional healing practices (Islamic religious text-based practices, Islamic worship practices,and folk healing practices) that included therap ies such as spiritual healing, medicinal herbs, mind-body therapy and dietary prescriptions (Alrawi et al. 2011 ). Therapies from each of these domains were reported to be variably utilized by th e Muslim community. Participants shared that religion-based treatments were often utilized as a primary source of healing, particularly when access to allopathic healthcare practitioners was lacking, as a secondary choice of care whenconventional medicine fails to work, but were commonly used in an integrative fashion withconventional allopathic medicines. In addition to access and efcacy-related factors that informed the usage of religion-based healing modalities, focus group data from Muslim patients in the same Michigan communities revealed that perceived trust of allopathic medicine andnotions about the ontology of illness, i.e., which part of the human body, psyche, or spirit, wasailing, informed utilizatio n of remedies (Padela et al. 2017 ). Consequently, elucidating differing ontological understandings of patients utilizing religious traditions on one hand, and of clinicians utilizing contemporary medicine on theother (Cherry 2000 ) may clarify why patients and clinicians have differing understandings of 'who' heals and 'what' are means for healing. The purpose of this paper is to describe anIslamic ontological schema, based on a reading of Islamic theological and metaphysicalframeworks, which can be easily utilized as a basis for understanding causes and means ofhealing for members of this community. Such an ontological schema can service a more holistic model of healthcare by integrating the overlapping worlds of religion and medi- cine, and can support clinicians seeking to further understand and assess patient responsesand attitudes toward illness and healing. Description of an Islamic Ontological Schema There are numerous formulations and overlapping terminologies used to describe Islamicontology. The following description of an Islamic ontological schema 1(Table 1) is derived from the understanding Ibn al-'Arabi (A.D. 1165-1240),2Shah Waliyullah 1The ontological schema described here focuses on realms of existence that map to causes and means of healing accessible to a human being during their worldly life. There are additional realms of existence described by Islamic theologians that are not included here such as the barzakh that is the world of the graves that a human being can access only during the period after worldly death and before resurrection. 2Muhyi al-Din Ibn al-'Arabi, known as \"the greatest master\", was born in twelfth century Spain and spent the second half of his life in the Eastern Islamic world. He authored 251 titles that contributed signicantly to every aspect of Su thought including metaphysics and is viewed as an essential link between the Islamic spirituality of the West and East. For a detailed introduction to his life and works, please refer to the introduction of Ralph Austin's translation of Ibn al-'Arabi's The Bezels of Wisdom (1980, Ramsey NJ: Paulist Press). 123Journal of Religion and Healthof Delhi (A.D. 1702-1763)3and adopted by scholars from the Deobandi lineage of Islamic theologians. Muslims believe that human beings have three sequential stages of life: a primordial existence (spirit only, without a physical body), a worldly life (spirit enters a physical bodyat birth and is inseparable until 'death' when the spirit is removed from the physical body),and an eternal afterlife in which the physical body is resurrected and reunited with the spirit. A human being's capability to access and experience each realm of existence changes as a human being moves through each sequential stage of life. Realms of existenceand their accessibility are described herein from the perspective of a human being duringtheir worldly life to facilitate connecting the proposed Islamic ontological schema tocauses and means of healing. The 'highest' realm of existence in this ontological schema, known as the laht(Divine existence), is the realm of absolute and eternal divine existence in which Allah (God), the creator and master of all things, exists outside of creation. The lahtis the realm of existence from which all created things, including healing, issue forth. As the Qur'anstates, God, ontologically, is the origin of all healing, 'And when I (Abraham) become ill,(then He Allah ) is the One who restores me to health (Surah Al-Shu'ara, 26/80). 4' Accordingly, from an Islamic ontological perspective in which God is the healer, the primary focus of individuals with illness is to attract divine attention so as to bring aboutrelief from the suffering of illness, or healing. The next three realms of existence are the malak t(world of spirits), mith l(world of forms and similitudes), and the ajsm(world of corporeal bodies). These realms of exis- tence are created by God and every created thing exists in these realms. The malak tis the realm of existence known as the world of spirits ( arw) and other celestial beings (e.g., angels). Angels are beings created from 'light' and understood byMuslims as beings that serve as God's messengers to humans delivering revelation and alsoserve as God's agents performing a variety of actions (e.g., recording human actions;delivering human supplications to God). During their worldly life, direct access to theTable 1 Islamic ontology: realms of existence Realm of existenceDescription Accessibility to human beings Laht Absolute and eternal divine existence Not accessible Malak t World of spirits ( arw) and other celestial beingsTheoretically possible, but typically reserved for prophets Mith l World of forms and similitudes Through dreams that are interpreted based on prophetic knowledge Ajsm World of corporeal bodies Through physical senses 3Qutb al-Din ibn 'Abdur-Rahim, known as Shah Waliyullah, was born in a small village named Pulth in Upper Pradesh province of India in the eighteenth century and is recognized as a leading Islamic scholar from the Indian subcontinent in both exoteric and esoteric sciences including metaphysics. His intellectual and spiritual status is well recognized throughout the Islamic world. For an introductory summary of his teachings in English, please refer to G.N. Jalbani's The Teachings of Shah Waliyullah of Delhi (1979, Lahore Pakistan: Ashraf Printing Press). 4English translation of the Qu'ran taken from Muhammad Asad's translation, 'The message of the Qu 'ran ' (1984, reprinted 1993, Melksham, Great Britain: Redwood Press Limited). 123Journal of Religion and Healthmalak tby human beings is theoretically possible, but requires a spiritual status typically reserved for prophets and those very close to them. However, angels, and therefore themalak t, can be considered to be involved in the healing process as they serve as mes- sengers who convey human supplications for cure to God. The mith lis the realm of existence known as the world of forms and similitudes. During their worldly life, human beings interact with the mith lprimarily through dreams. In the mith l, the physical laws of the ajsmdo not apply as one may observe actions that would not typically exist in the physical world, e.g., walking on the ceiling. Therefore, events, similitudes, and symbols observed in dreams require external interpretation by specialists trained according to prophetic teachings. One way in which the mith lmight be involved in healing is through dreams conveying messages about impending illnesses, theircauses, and/or modalities of healing. The ajsmis the realm of corporeal bodies and encompasses the entire universe including human beings, the earth, the sun, the moon, and the heavens. A human beingexists in the ajsmas a spirit inseparable from a physical body and experiences this realm of existence primarily through the physical senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch),intellect, and emotions. Means of healing such as medications and counseling exist in theajsmand are accessible to human beings during their worldly life. Causes and Potential Means of Healing Based on an Islamic Ontological Schema Based on an Islamic ontological schema outlined above, God is the one who sends forth healing from the laht(realm of Divine existence). The theological basis for dening God as the One who heals is described in the aforementioned Qur'anic verse (26:80) andaccording to the Islamic tradition, one of God's names is al-Sha (the Healer). Therefore, for a Muslim suffering from an illness, a primary focus is to understand 'how' one attractsdivine attention so as to bring about relief for their illness. For Muslims, prophets serve as ideal human role models for demonstrating how to attract such divine attention for healing. The following Prophetic statement ( Hadith ) has inspired generations of Muslims to seek sources of healing: Abu Hurairah reported that theProphet of Allah (Muhammad) said: 'There is no disease that God has created, except that He also has created its cure.' [Sahih al-Bukhari 5678, Book 76, Hadith 1]. Utilizing prophetic advices and examples, Muslims seek divine attention for healing through avariety of means that include conventional medicine (e.g., medications, surgery, coun-seling), religion-based alternative and complementary means (e.g., supplication, charity,prescribed incantations/amulets), and active adoption of Islamic virtues (e.g., reliance onGod [ tawakkul ] and patience [ sabr]). Clinicians' appreciation of these potential means of healing may be enhanced by utilizing an Islamic ontology schema that incorporates realmsof existence such as the laht,malak t, and mith l. For example, making supplication seeking God's healing from one's illness is a means for attracting divine attention that may lead to healing. The following Prophetic suppli-cation provides an example of how a Muslim may utilize supplication as a potential means of healing: 'O Allah (God), Lord of mankind! Remove our suffering. Heal us as you are the healer ( al-Sha ), and none can heal but you; a healing that leaves behind no ailment.' [Sahih Al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 5675; Sahih Muslim, Hadith No. 2191]. From an Islamicontological perspective, human beings make such supplications with the hope of attractingdivine healing, while they exist in the ajsm. Angels exist in the malak twhile serving as 123Journal of Religion and Healththe messengers for delivering these supplications to God,5who exists in the laht(realm of Divine existence). In response to these supplications, God may instruct angels to deliverhealing to human beings who then experience the effects of that healing in the ajsm. Another example of a potential means of attracting divine attention for healing based on Prophetic advice is giving charity ( sadaq h) on behalf of an ill person. The following Prophetic saying ( Hadith ) encourages treating illness through charity: Abu Umamah reported that the Prophet of Allah (Muhammad) said: 'Treat your sick by giving charity (sadaq h).' [Sahih al-Jamia' No. 3358]. While charity is easily understood as directly beneting other human beings who receive the charity, an understanding of how charity given to others can serve as a means of healing for an ill person is enhanced by utilizing anIslamic ontological perspective for in accordance with the Prophetic advise an ill personmight give charity with the intention of attracting divine healing. This action is recorded byangels who exist in the malak t. In response to the charity given with an intention to attract divine healing, God may instruct angels to deliver healing to the human beings who thenexperience the benecial effects of that healing in the ajsm. Muslims may use other potential means of healing such as incantations and/or amulets prescribed by traditional Muslim healers to attract divine attention. Traditional healersutilize prophetic advices and examples as the primary basis for the content of these pre-scriptions and supplement that knowledge with insights from dreams, interpreted based on prophetic knowledge, reported by the ill person or those close to the ill person. The incantations and amulets may facilitate healing by using Qur'anic verses and prophetictraditions to attract divine attention, but do not facilitate healing as ornaments or preciousstones themselves. From an Islamic ontological perspective, human beings existing in theajsmapproach traditional healers with the intention of utilizing prescribed incantations and/or amulets as a means to attract divine attention for healing. Traditional healers thenmight provide prescriptions based on insights from the mith land in response God (in the laht) may instruct angels (existing in the malak t) to deliver healing to the human beings who then experience the effects of that healing in the ajsm. Additionally, a Muslim facing an illness is encouraged to adorn himself with virtues such as tawakkul (a rm belief and reliance and trust in God) and sabr (patience) that might also attract divine attention for healing. Tawakkul 6was dened by Ibn al-Arabi as com- pletely relying and trusting God, without panicking, when there are no conventional meansof healing available (Arabi). He further explains that Muslims are encouraged to seek anduse means of healing available to them in the world but must actively rely on God as thesource of healing. The following Qur'anic verse describes this concept, 'If God succours (helps) you, none can ever overcome you; but if He (God) should forsake you, who could succour (help) you 5From the perspective of a human being who exists in the realm of creation, the angels in the malak t provide a means to deliver supplications to God through their role as messengers. However, from theperspective of Islamic beliefs, God is not dependent in any way on creation and therefore, His knowledge of human supplications does not depend on delivery by angels. 6There has been a lively debate among jurists and theologians regarding whether adoption of tawakkul involves leaving off of worldly means, and whether or not it involves a desire for a specic outcome. In the context of healing the debate can be rephrased as to whether tawakkul demands leaving off actions to facilitate healing and simply \"resigning\" the outcome to God. Accordingly there are various well-reasoned stances on the matter. For some insights into how the debate is a reflection into the different schools of Sunni law the reader is directed to the paper by Qureshi and Padela (2016). When Must A Patient Seek Healthcare?Bringing the Perspectives of Islamic Jurists and Clinicians into Dialogue. Zygon 51:3. 123Journal of Religion and Healththereafter? In God, then, let the believers place their trust.' ( Surah l 'Imr n, 3/160) (see footnote 4). Active reliance and trust in God as the Healer does not preclude using conventional or other means to seek healing, but it does preclude relying on these means as the source of healing as this would be against the concept of tawakkul (Akhtar 2015 ). A Muslim who practices active reliance and trust in God when means of healing are available may be morecapable of relying on God without panicking when conventional means of healing are notfound. Sabr in times of misfortune has been (A.D. 1058-1111) jaz ') and a 'violent outburst of grief' ( hala '). The Qu'ran describes that God is with those with sabr and Muslims are encouraged to develop and exemplify this characteristic when seeking God's help, 'O youwho have attained to faith! Seek aid with steadfast patience ( sabr) and prayer: for, behold, God is with those who are patient in adversity (those with sabr).' (Surah Al -Baqarah, 2/153 ) (see Prophetic saying ( Hadith Qudsi ) specically encourages the practicing of tawakkul andsabr in the context of illness: Prophet Muhammad said 'God, Almighty and Glorious, said, \"If I put my servant to the test with a trial [of illness], and he endures it (has sabr) and does not express distrust of Me (has tawakkul ) before those who come to visit him, I shall give him flesh better than his flesh, and blood better than his blood. If I grant him health, he[rises] without sin; and if I decree his death, it is to My mercy [he returns].\"' (Al-Ghazali 2010 ). 8 From an Islamic ontological perspective, developing and practicing of tawakkul and sabr by a Muslim in the ajsmis intended to actively attract divine attention (from the laht) for healing in this worldly life and mercy and forgiveness in the eternal afterlife. While practicing tawakkul andsabr do not preclude the use of conventional or other means of healing, describing these practices using an Islamic ontological schema may provideinsights into how to assess patient responses and attitudes toward illness and healing. Conclusion Healthcare practitioners are becoming increasingly aware that patients may choose to utilize faith-based healing practices in place of, or in conjunction with, conventional medicine based on spiritual and/or religious understandings. Elucidating foundationalontological understandings based on religious traditions may clarify why patients andclinicians have differing understandings of 'who' heals and 'what' are means for healing. 7Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, known as al-Ghazali, is noteworthy as one of the great theologians, mystics, and jurists of the twelfth century. He is referred to as Hujjat-al-Islam (the 'authority' or 'proof' of Islam) based on the breadth of his scholarship and spirituality. For an introduction to his life and works, please refer to H.Littlejohn's translation of Book 32 of the Revival of the Religious Sciences ( 2010 , reprinted 2013, Cam- bridge: The Islamic Texts Society). 8This hadith qudsi is quoted here as provided by al-Ghazali. There is a slightly different transmission in al- Mustadrak of al-Ha\u00afkim (Ab Abd Alla \u00afh Muhammad b. Abd Alla \u00afh) that translates as, \"If I test my believing servant and he does not complain about me to his visitors, I release him from his sickness and then I give him flesh better than his flesh and blood better than his blood. Then his deeds will restart [as his sins Ha\u00afkim states that the hadith is sound according to the criteria of al-Bukha \u00afr\u00af and Muslim although they did not transmit it. 123Journal of Religion and HealthThis paper describes an Islamic ontological schema, based on a reading of Islamic theological and metaphysical frameworks, that includes the following realms: laht (Divine existence), malak t(world of spirits), mith l(world of forms and similitudes), and ajsm(world of corporeal bodies). Based on the proposed schema, God is the one who sends forth healing from the laht(realm of divine existence) and therefore, a primary focus for healing is to understand 'how' one attracts divine attention so as to bring aboutrelief for their illness. This viewpoint can be contrasted with conventional medicine inwhich healing is often attributed to the medicine, surgery, or other treatment modality utilized. Islamic ontological schema-based means of healing include conventional medi- cine, but conventional medicine would not be viewed as the cause of healing. Furthermore, religion-based means (e.g., supplication, charity, prescribed incantations/amulets), andactive adoption of Islamic virtues (e.g., reliance on God [ tawakkul ] and patience [ sabr]) may be utilized by patients who view these additional actions as means for attractingdivine attention to their illness. An ontological schema-based description of causes and means of healing can service a more holistic model of healthcare by integrating the overlapping worlds of religion andmedicine and can support clinicians seeking to further understand and assess patientresponses and attitudes toward illness and healing.
