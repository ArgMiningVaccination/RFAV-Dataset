Many people shuffle into their kitchens and pour themselves extra-large cups of coffee right after they wake up, but it turns out that lemon water might give you more energy - in addition to other impressive health benefits. Skip the Ice While coffee might not offer the most healthful morning beverage solution, you don't have to sacrifice the warmth you get from a steaming cup of joe. According to a medically reviewed article by Jennifer Anderson, the human body doesn't always get along well with [ice-cold foods and beverages](http://www.everydayhealth.com/digestive-health/your-digestion-could-be-a-matter-of-degree.aspx). You probably don't like to step out of bed and plant your feet on a frigid floor. Similarly, your stomach doesn't enjoy the shock it gets when you swallow something cold. Instead of focusing on digestion, the stomach uses energy to maintain your body's ideal core temperature. If you drink your lemon water warm (or at least lukewarm), you'll help your digestive system function like a well-oiled machine. Get Things Moving Occasional constipation doesn't necessarily indicate a serious illness, but it can make you uncomfortable and irritable. Fortunately, lemon water helps keep things moving. Whether you're experiencing a blockage due to emotional or psychological stress or to a physical malady, warm lemon water stimulates your bowels and keeps you nice and regular. Sometimes constipation occurs psychosomatically. Your body might be telling you to let go of things that are holding you back, whether it's a toxic relationship or a closet full of material possessions. If you're suffering from constipation, sip lemon water while you meditate on objects or emotions that you might want to release. Aid Your Metabolism Metabolism is as much spiritual and emotional as it is physical. You might feel tempted to boost your mood with high-calorie foods or caffeine-rich beverages, but lemon water stimulates your metabolism naturally. Not only does it keep you hydrated, but it's also rich in antioxidants. While it battles free radicals, it protects your immune system so your body can fight illness on its own. A stronger immune system insulates you from pesky colds, infections and other bugs that keep you from functioning at your best. Take Your Vitamins Vitamins are most effective when they come [from your diet](/article/top-10-cleansing-foods-for-natural-detox). Before you fix a delicious Spanish omelette or blend a juicy smoothie, snag some vitamin C and other vitamins and nutrients from lemon water.

Ease Heartburn If you wake up in the morning with a mild case of heartburn, the acid in lemon water can actually dispel your discomfort. Stomach issues like heartburn can indicate a spiritual discomfort. Maybe some aspect of your life has fallen out of whack and you're hoping to nudge things back in line. While lemon water eases your discomfort, you can focus on getting back in tune with your true self. Listen to your intuition and allow [your spirit guides](/video/guides) to help you get back into alignment. Maybe it's time to break a bad habit or to practice more positive self-talk. Nourish the Skin If you've noticed a few extra wrinkles around your eyes or if your skin has become dry or irritated, lemon water will help you get back that healthy glow. In addition to fighting wrinkles, lemon water also helps rid the body of the free radicals and toxins that contribute to acne. Youth is very much a state of mind, so don't rely exclusively on lemon water to come to grips with aging. Fine lines and wrinkles serve as signs of your experience and wisdom, so embrace them. However, lemon water can stop wrinkles from forming prematurely and support your skin's natural balance. Encourage Weight Loss If you're carrying a few extra pounds, lemon water will help you shed them without fad diets or unhealthy supplements. Although lemons contain lots of acid, they metabolize to alkalinity. An alkaline environment in your digestive system promotes weight loss and suppresses hunger. Consider drinking your glass of lemon water about half an hour before you eat breakfast. You won't feel tempted to overindulge because the lemon will have taken the edge off your appetite. The water itself also eases hunger pains because the liquid fills your stomach. Battle Morning Breath Lemon water creates a hostile environment for bacteria in your mouth. The initial hit of citric acid in your mouth can tackle the bacteria that causes bad breath, but then the water still keeps everything moist in there so that bacteria won't come back and make your breath smell rough once again. This is particularly welcome if you share your bed with a special someone. You'll remove self-consciousness and feel free to get close emotionally as well as physically, even if you've just woken up.

Your kidneys are responsible for [cleansing your body of toxins](https://www.gaia.com/article/10-tips-planning-your-most-effective-cleanse-yet) as fluids make their way through your digestive system. If you're holding on to spiritual or emotional toxins, now is the time to let them go. Purify your thoughts as well as your body so negativity doesn't drag you down. Remove Joint and Muscle Pain [Yesterday's workout](/video/pre-run-practice) might leave you stiff and sore today, but lemon water helps. It counteracts uric acid, which means it will remove the discomfort you experience after you push yourself a little too hard at the gym. Not only does this benefit you physically, but it also helps remove any barriers the pain might create next time you work out. If you're sore without physical activity, you might consider other causes. For instance, joint pain might manifest if you're too critical of yourself. Maybe you're practicing negative self-talk or putting yourself down in front of others. To ease your emotional and physical discomfort, practice treating yourself with compassion and empathy. Get the Most from Lemon Water While lemons offer plenty of healthy benefits, you definitely don't want to drink the juice without diluting it. The straight acid can dissolve the enamel on your teeth and irritate your esophagus. Instead, draw an 8-ounce glass of water. You can drink the water at room temperature or warm it slightly on the stove, depending on how you're feeling that morning. Squeeze juice from [half a lemon](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/03/17/lemon-water-benefits_n_4980265.html) (if you're under 150 pounds) or a whole lemon and add it to the water.

Lemon water offers far more health benefits, but you'll still feel great and enjoy tremendous energy.
