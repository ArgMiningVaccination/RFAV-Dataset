(Oral contraceptives are an example of drugs that affect the function of the body rather than a disease.) This comprehensive definition of a drug, although important for legal purposes, is rather complex for everyday use. A simpler but workable definition of a drug is any chemical or biologic substance that affects the body and its processes. Some people incorrectly use the word drug to mean only a substance that produces a pleasurable sensation. The excessive and persistent use of mind-altering substances without medical need has accompanied the appropriate medical use of drugs throughout recorded history. Some of the drugs that fall into this category have legitimate medical purposes, and others do not (see [Overview of Substance-Related Disorders](/home/mental-health-disorders/substance-related-disorders/overview-of-substance-related-disorders) [ Overview of Substance-Related Disorders Medications and other substances, whether used for legitimate medical purposes, as a habit (for example, caffeine), or recreationally, are an integral part of everyday life for many people ... read more ](/home/mental-health-disorders/substance-related-disorders/overview-of-substance-related-disorders) ). Prescription drugs or nonprescription drugs By law, drugs are divided into two categories: prescription drugs and nonprescription drugs. Prescription drugs\u2014those considered safe for use only under medical supervision\u2014may be dispensed only with a prescription from a licensed professional with governmental privileges to prescribe (for example, a doctor, dentist, podiatrist, nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, or veterinarian). Nonprescription drugs\u2014those considered safe for use without medical supervision (such as aspirin)\u2014are [sold over the counter](/home/drugs/over-the-counter-drugs/overview-of-over-the-counter-drugs#v716774) [ Overview of Over-the-Counter Drugs ](/home/drugs/over-the-counter-drugs/overview-of-over-the-counter-drugs#v716774) . In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the government agency that decides which drugs require a prescription and which may be sold over the counter. [Dietary supplements](/home/special-subjects/dietary-supplements-and-vitamins/overview-of-dietary-supplements) [ Overview of Dietary Supplements Dietary supplements are used by about 75% of Americans. They are the most common therapies included among integrative medicine and health (IMH) and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)... read more ](/home/special-subjects/dietary-supplements-and-vitamins/overview-of-dietary-supplements) (for example, medicinal herbs and nutraceuticals) are products intended to supplement the diet. These products may contain vitamins, amino acids, minerals, and herbs or other plant-derived material (botanicals). Because dietary supplements are not classified as drugs, they do not require FDA approval before marketing and do not have to meet the same standards as drugs for [safety and efficacy](/home/drugs/drug-dynamics/drug-action#v715839) [ Potency, Efficacy, and Effectiveness Drugs affect only the rate at which existing biologic functions proceed. (See also Definition of Drug Dynamics.) Drugs do not change the basic nature of these functions or create new functions... read more ](/home/drugs/drug-dynamics/drug-action#v715839) . Because these products do not have to meet FDA standards for safety and efficacy, the manufacturer may not claim the product treats specific medical conditions. Dietary supplements may cause health problems if not used correctly or if taken in large amounts. Drug names Some knowledge of drug names can help in understanding drug product labels. Every drug has at least three names\u2014a chemical name, a generic (nonproprietary or official) name, and a brand (proprietary or trademark) name (see sidebar [What's In a Name?](/home/drugs/brand-name-and-generic-drugs/overview-of-generic-drugs-and-drug-naming#v716523) [ What's In a Name? ](/home/drugs/brand-name-and-generic-drugs/overview-of-generic-drugs-and-drug-naming#v716523) ). The chemical name describes the atomic or molecular structure of the drug. This name is usually too complex and cumbersome for general use. So an official body assigns a generic name to a drug. The generic names for drugs of a particular type (class) usually have the same ending. For example, the names of all beta-blockers, which are used to treat such disorders as high blood pressure, end in \"lol\" (such as metoprolol and propranolol). The brand name is chosen by the pharmaceutical company that manufactures or distributes the drug. Patented drugs are usually sold under a brand name. Generic versions of brand-name drugs\u2014manufactured after expiration of the pharmaceutical company's patent\u2014may be sold under the generic name (for example, ibuprofen) or under the manufacturer's own brand name (for example, Addaparin). Drug groups Understanding what group a drug belongs to is also useful. Broadly, drugs are classified by therapeutic group\u2014that is, by what disorder or symptom they are used to treat. For example, drugs used to treat high blood pressure are called antihypertensives (hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure), and drugs used to treat nausea are called antiemetics (emesis is the medical term for vomiting). Within each therapeutic group, drugs are categorized by classes. Some classes are based on how the drugs work in the body to produce their effect. For example, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are all classes of antihypertensives that work differently.
