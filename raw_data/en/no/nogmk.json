Due to global warming, we need more than ever to be cautious and take care of our skin and our eyes. Therefore, we suggest a variety of sun protection products and describe the latest trends in sunglasses that will protect your eyes, as well as make a fashion statement. Another hot trend this summer is crocheted fashion that was popular in the 1960s and '70s.

She is a senior gynecologist at Ichilov Hospital, owner of clinics in Tel Aviv and Holon, and expert in gynecology, midwifery, and fertility treatments. For over five years, Almog has headed the Bringing Life to the World organization on behalf of Ichilov Hospital. Through the organization, delegations of doctors from all fields are sent to developing countries where the mortality and morbidity rates are among the highest in the world. The destinations are selected in cooperation with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. How did it all begin? I always knew I wanted to volunteer in developing countries. Something about the simplicity and human warmth in these places attracted me. About five years ago, I met a female doctor who was part of a humanitarian expedition to Burma, and our conversation led me to the realization of my dream. I knew that in the basement of Ichilov there was medical equipment that was not in use. More importantly, I knew what advanced knowledge was available at our hospital and that Israel is a world leader in the medical field. I contacted the hospital management, which expressed support for the establishment of the Bringing Life to the World organization, whose goal is to reduce maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity in developing countries. The activity first started for mothers and women, but we soon realized that the mother also comes with her partner and other family members, so the activity was expanded to provide a solution for the whole family and a variety of medical problems. The delegations include a multi-system team that includes ophthalmologists, intensive care/internal medicine, breast examinations, gynecology, pediatrics, and more. The composition of the team of doctors varies according to the specific needs of the destination. It is important to note that all doctors come fully voluntarily; they leave their jobs at the hospital and clinics where they work. The doctors are ambassadors of goodwill on behalf of the State of Israel and change the lives of people who cannot obtain a medical solution. Some of them have never even seen a doctor before. How does it work in tHe field? In most places, the team set up an impromptu health camp, usually in schools. Women from the villages of the area come with children and other family members. Our medics work with the local doctors so that while examining the patients, we also enrich the doctors with knowledge. And we leave them the equipment we brought with us from Israel so that they can continue to treat patients after our delegation leaves. wHat countries Have you been to? India, Burma, Guatemala, Nepal, and Brazil, where we received support from the Israeli Embassy. We sailed with a medical boat to the foot of the Amazon and built health centers there. wHat are tHe plans for tHe coming year? This month we are going to Guatemala. This is the first time that our delegation will be part of a joint activity with the Warriors Without Borders organization. In the expedition, 30 soldiers, members of Matan's unit, will join the doctors' activities. In addition, the parents of Matan Gottlieb, a Magellan fighter who was killed in Operation Protective Edge, will join the activities. During the medical activity, the soldiers will renovate schools, teach the children, and play with them. How Has tHis impacted you? I learned that the key to true happiness is the ability to give to others. In Burma, I met a doctor named Dr. Tut, who treats the population that comes from 138 villages, and he does everything by himself. He taught me that a smile is the best medicine. We treat people whose language we don't know; their look and smile warm our hearts. In the remote villages I met warm and grateful people. Without the need for words or a common language, a smile or a look is enough to understand how grateful they are. How does your family accept your long absences? It is impossible without a supportive family. My children see and know that the goal is important and learn that the culture of giving is important. It teaches them to be better people.

Branding herself as the beauty priestess and guru of celebs, she built a reputation as a magician with golden hands who works wonders for a variety of skin problems. However, behind the radiant appearance, Blick went through upheavals in her personal life. Blick married Morris, a businessman from Milan. Within a short time, the couple had three children - Emanuel, Johnathan, and Michael . They lived a peaceful, comfortable life in Italy until Johnathan was diagnosed with autism and Michael with Hirschsprung disease. Difficulty and pain became the challenges that led Blick to her destiny How did you deal witH two small cHildren wHo eacH Had a complex problem? My mother and my younger sister came to help me. In Italy, they suggested that Michael have a conservative treatment of regular antibiotics and routine enemas. In Israel, they suggested the surgical option, which seemed more logical to me. I consulted with Rabbi Firer, who recommended Dr. Hagit Nagar, a pediatric surgeon. Children from all over the world come to be operated on by her. We waited for Michael to get better. We flew to Israel with the three boys for a short visit. I didn't tell Morris that I had made an appointment for a check-up until the time of the surgery. Morris had to return to Milan. I reassured him that everything was fine. The surgery was successful but required a year of treatments and recovery. I decided to take advantage of the time I was in Israel to find out why Johnathan didn't speak, even though he had a hearing aid. An examination under anesthesia revealed that he wasn't deaf. Following neurological surgery on his ears, he started to speak, but he shouted.wHen did you find out tHat JonatHan was on tHe autistic spectrum? When Johnathan was three years old, he went to kindergarten, and the children said something was wrong with him. During a medical examination, they found that he could not hear in both ears. But my intuition as a mother said it was something else. The hearing aids bothered him. I saw that he was getting crazy with the devices, and he calmed down when I took them off. He was even happy and danced. My husband asked me how I could take off a device that was supposed to help him, but something in me told me that something else was wrong. On re-examination, they discovered that my son had an infection in the facial cavities. If the infection were to extend to his brain, his life would be in danger. We were living in Milan at the time, so I decided to return to Israel, where Johnathan was diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum. wHat did you do? From the moment I discovered that Johnathan was on the spectrum and Michael had Hirschsprung ,-a severe intestinal disease that results from a lack of nerve cells in the muscles of the large intestine and weakens the body's immune system, my first impulse was to collapse. But I have a positive attitude toward life, and I said how lucky it is that Michael saved Johnathan. I cried once, and then I told myself that this was the last time I would cry. I started working like a volcano that erupted. I knew I needed tools to take care of my children to help them and make their lives easier. I delved into the subject, gained knowledge and understanding about naturopathy and Chinese medicine. I also added cosmetology and aesthetics studies to them. wHat advice can you give parents wHo discover tHat tHeir cHild Has special needs? After the stage where the truth is digested, stand on two strong legs and embark on a journey with a lot of good compared to the difficulty. It's all a matter of perception. We need to look at the positive things, even when everything seems dark, and wrap it with love and sensitivity. How do you keep looking so young and radiant? I believe in combinations; our inside and outside are one. It is important to maintain proper nutrition and to be physically active. That combination creates the whole package. Keep that balance. Everyone can find what works for him. And, of course, maintain a combination of facial treatments and a regimen of morning and evening skincare products. And drink a lot of water. do you plan to open brancHes in israel and around tHe world? Definitely. We are already there. In a few months, we will open the first branch in Madrid, and I am very excited. The branch is the result of many customers from all over Europe. I am working on several more locations in Europe and the US. magic woman By RoNiT MAThi AS Pola Blick | Photo by PR 6 WoMeN septeMbeR 2023 The JeRuSAleM PoSTGottex has long been not only a leading international swimwear powerhouse, but the brand is also a fashion company that has established a successful online site.Gottex was founded in Tel Aviv in 1956 by Lea Gottlieb and her husband, Armin.

One of the leading businesswomen in Israel, she is a pioneer in many fields. The Stier Group was founded by Israela and her former husband, Y osef (\"Dubi\"). Their son Gil Stier is CEO of the company. wHy did your parents name you israela? I was born in November 1948, the same year as the State of Israel. My parents were Zionists and named me after the State of Israel. This name is definitely binding. I love our country so much, and I am very worried about what's going on. How did your career begin? In 2016, when I serving as vice president of the Federation of the Israeli Chambers of Commerce, the minister of commerce of Italy and the mayor of Milan held a conference of female entrepreneurs from the Middle East. They invited me and five other women from the Israel and 500 from Arab countries -- Bahrain, Oman, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. They chose me to talk about entrepreneurship and how I came to found my company. I told them that when Y om Kippur War started, we had an advertising agency with a lot of clients. We built a campaign for one of the clients whose company was involved in travel. Then the Y om Kippur War broke out and everyone was drafted, and the checks bounced. At the end of the war, we ran out of money. Dubi said we should sell our apartment in Ramat Gan and start a new business. We sold our apartment and paid our debts. Dubi thought we should open a media company and host exhibitions. We went to Germany and learned how to run exhibitions. When we returned to Israel, the hotels were empty. We rented the old Sheraton Hotel and opened our offices there. When I told my story in Italy, there was silence in the hall. Then I received thunderous applause. The Arab women came up to me and asked if they could hug me. They said they didn't know that I suffered too and asked to take a picture together and interview me on Italian TV . did you and dubi stay in toucH? We remained partners and good friends. Our son Gil inherited his posiion because he had always worked in the company. He has been the CEO of the group for 20 years. wHat does tHe stier group do? The Stier Group, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, specializes in the initiation, marketing, production and management of professional exhibitions and conferences. The company began operations in the 1970s and was one of the pioneers of the industry in Israel. Over the years, it has developed and become a brand of success and power. Today it is a central factor in the exhibition and conference industry. The company's exhibitions are leaders in their field and are an annual meeting point for key people and decision makers in the field. wHat do you focus on? We focus mainly on the B2B market; therefore, those exhibitions are open to the professional audience only. But some exhibitions also address the end user, and those are open to the general public. We have a wealth of experience in working and collaborating with government ministries, authorities, unions, the Institute for Export and Regional Cooperation, the Manufacturers Association of Israel, and the Federation of Chambers of Commerce. The exhibitions are accompanied by professional conferences, workshops, and related events that aim to contribute to the enrichment of knowledge and the deepening of personal relationships in every field and industry in which we engage. We provide all services to our customers. The various departments provide a complete solution for every exhibition, conference, and event. wHat is your dream? If Uriel Lynn, president of the Federation of the Israeli Chambers of Commerce, decides to retire, I would be happy to apply for the position. But as long as he continues, I will be glad to be his deputy. The Chamber of Commerce is a male-dominated body. Uriel has brought in women. It would be a breath of fresh air to be the president because there has never been a woman in that position in Israel or in the world. There are women who have succeeded in places where only men have succeeded. I'm sure that I would do a good job for the benefit of the members of the chamber and the chamber's interests. leading by example By RoNiT MAThi AS Israela Stier-Einstein | Photo by Rani Zanger 8 WoMeN septeMbeR 2023 The JeRuSAleM PoSTMany people suffer from hormonal acne, not only during puberty. Acne can arise at different stages of life because it is related to hormonal activity. At all ages, there is the potential for hormonal changes, so hormonal acne can occur at any stage of life for men or women. wHat is Hormonal acne? Hormonal acne is a condition in which where there is an increase in the production of hormones in the body that increase the activity of the sebaceous glands, which leads to acne breakouts. The hormones that are mainly affected are the androgens, which are male hormones. The sebaceous glands produce sebum to moisturize the skin, but an excess of sebum can lead to acne. Women are especially sensitive to hormonal acne. As a result of the hormonal mechanism of fertility, most of their changes revolve around it. causes of Hormonal acne The various factors that can lead to hormonal acne include hormonal changes that occur especially around the menstrual cycle; pregnancy; or after stopping to take pills. Medical conditions such as polycystic ovaries (PCOS) can also cause breakouts. Factors such as stress, taking certain medications (such as steroids), and genetics can also affect hormonal activity. symptoms of Hormonal acne Hormonal acne is characterized by comedones, pimples, and inflamed sores mainly in the area of the cheeks, chin, and neck. Most often, the sores erupt before or during the menstrual cycle; after stopping to take pills; during pregnancy; or during menopause. tHe common ages for Hormonal acne Hormonal acne mainly breaks out during one's late 20s and 30s, but it can occur at any age when there are significant hormonal changes. tHerapeutic innovation The Rivka Zaide Center for the Treatment of Acne Using the Rivka Zaide Method offers a series of treatments that implements exclusive advanced Israeli-developed phototherapy equipment.

Popping pimples can cause damage and increase inflammation. Try to avoid touching your face in general and the sores in particular. 2. Do not ignore it. Acne is a condition that requires treatment before it gets out of control. 3. Do not begin treatment on your own by ingesting nutritional supplements without medical supervision. Consult with qualified professionals before starting treatment. 4. Do not use substances that are not intended for the face. Such products can harm the skin and increase acne. Be wary of recommendations you see online.5. Try to avoid anxiety and stressful situations. They can affect your hormones and increase acne. Try to stay calm and take relaxing breaths. 6.

Crocheted garments are mainly identified with the resort collections that designers launch with the arrival of summer. Crochet is sophisticated, cool and always fashionable. It's done using a crochet hook made of metal, wood, bamboo or plastic, which come in a number of sizes. With a crochet hook, you can knit lace, sweaters, scarves, blankets, fabrics, bags, dolls and works of art. In stores, you can see the crochet technique in items such as clothing, handbags, and even shoes.It is important to know how to wear a crocheted garment. Because it is perforated, it is recommended to wear a skin-colored or colored bodysuit or tank top underneath. Crocheting combines the old and the new. Historical documentation of the technique is found in western Italy.

In the Roman Catholic church, embroideries, lace and coil lace were often used in priestly garments, the altar, and covers for sacred objects. In her book Crochet History & Technique, researcher Lis Paludan says that she searched extensively in church museums and archives but found only a few examples of crocheted works, and none of them dated back earlier than the 19th century.In 1840, a mold disease devastated the potato crops in Ireland, the country's mainstay, thus incurring the great potato famine. Many of the Irish immigrated to England and America. Queen Victoria began to purchase crocheted items from the Irish women. Under her influence, the ladies of the nobility, high society and the middle class emulated the queen. They wore many fashionable crocheted items and lined their wardrobes with lace strips, thus providing a little livelihood for the Irish women. In the early the 20th century, crocheting was very common. Girls learned from their mothers, aunts and grandmothers how to create useful or decorative objects for the home. There was a flourishing of women's weekly magazines that gave instructions for what they called the \"feminine arts. \" Books were published with patterns of crochet work, such as The Home Art Crochet Book, published in 1912, presenting a variety of new examples of crocheting. As a testament to the popularity of the technique over the decades, the book was reprinted in 1990. To this day, crocheted items appear every season in the collections of international designers. scoop (photo by amiram ben yishai) taMnoon (photo by amir y ahel)LonGchaMp (photo by pR) factoRy 54 (photo by pR)bRownIe (photo by pR) (photo by pR) h&M (photo by hennes & Mauritz) sacks (photo by shay yehezkel & Irad nezer) 11 WoMeN septeMbeR 2023 The JeRuSAleM PoSTDrorit Nitzani is the spirit behind The Lone Soldier Center in Memory of Michael Levin (LSC). It is named in honor of Michael Levin, who made the ultimate sacrifice for his faith and the State of Israel. He used to say, \"Y ou can't succeed unless you dare to risk it all.\" Nitzani is married to musician Y air Nitzani. They are the parents of daughters Einav, 30; Inbal, 27; Ella, 19; and adoptive parents of son Eli Soffer, a lone soldier. wHen did you Join tHe lsc? In 2014, I was a fashion designer during the Tzuk Eitan [Protective Edge] period. Omer Chai, a soldier in Magellan who studied with one of my daughters, was killed. During the shiva , Omer's friends were looking for a home for a lone soldier from their unit who was wounded in the war and was about to be released from rehabilitation. I knew that a lone soldier was someone who came from abroad to serve in the army, and I decided to help him. But I was surprised to find out that Eli was born and raised in Jerusalem. He came from an ultra-Orthodox family and had 12 siblings. At age 13, he left home for the street due to neglect. He was never educated at any institution and was barely literate. At 17, he joined Steph Wertheimer's project at a pre-military training school. He decided that he wanted to join the army and be a soldier. He served in Magellan and discovered his abilities as an outstanding athlete. He succeeded and became a soldier in the unit. During the Tzuk Eitan operation, in preparation for his release from the army, he sustained a moderate leg injury and was recognized as disabled by the IDF. When he was released from the hospital, he came ro live with us. It wasn't easy to adopt a 22-year-old-boy in a house with three girls and integrate him into the family unit. When I realized that there were other children like Eli, I wanted to help the LSC. At that point, Tsiki Aud was the only one taking care of the Israeli guys within an organization that looked after lone soldiers who came from around the world. I left the field of fashion, joined the LSC, and we established a program to take care of Israeli soldiers who have no family ties. How is eli doing today? He lives in an apartment in Tel Aviv and is still an integral part of our family. With the help of Tsiki, we enrolled Eli to complete 12 years of schooling. It wasn't easy for him to learn. He couldn't read or write and didn't know basic arithmetic. And he hadn't been exposed to cultural events, and the songs and stories we grew up with. We mobilized our community. Friends from the neighborhood helped to teach him math, English, literature, and history, as well as swimming and driving. Eli graduated with honors. wHo was micHael levin? In 2011, Michael left his home in Philadelphia, immigrated to Israel, and joined the IDF. Four years later, when he went to visit his family, the Second Lebanon War broke out, so he immediately returned to join his unit, the Paratroopers Battalion 890. Within 24 hours of returning to Israel, Michael fell in battle in Lebanon. He was buried at the Mount Herzl Military Cemetery in Jerusalem. wHo founded tHe lone soldier center? It was founded by a group of former lone soldiers, along with Tziki Aud -- Michael's adoptive father in Israel -- to support those serving today. They were inspired by Michael's dream of building a center in Israel to address the needs of lone soldiers. In 2014, after Tzuk Eitan, I established a program for Israeli soldiers who have no family support. My personal story of adopting a lone soldier contributed to the effort and support for this segment of the soldier population. Today, we are making Michael's dream a reality.wHat does tHe lsc do? In our centers in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Beersheba, we focus on three core activities: housing, social support, and individual counseling. The LSC provides lone soldiers with meals, support, advice, housing, family, and the community they lack through a myriad of interactions. We provide private tutors, enrichment classes, psychological therapy, social activities, trips, lectures, fun days, Shabbat and holiday meals, equipment, and assistance with furniture. The organization provides veterans with guidance and counseling three months prior to their discharge from the army, scholarships for professional studies, and guidance on finding employment. wHere do tHe lone soldiers come from? Of the approximately 7,000 lone soldiers, about half come from over 40 countries. Most become Israeli citizens; some serve as volunteers without the expectation of remaining in Israel after their service. The other half were born in Israel and either are defined as youth at-risk or left the haredi world, in which case their families are not in touch with them. wHat does tHe organiZation consist of? The entire system operates through the help of dozens of volunteers and is financed by donations. lone soldiers: lone but not alone By RoNiT MAThi AS Drorit Nitzani | Photo by Yael ElkayamiSRAeli PRi De 12 WoMeN septeMbeR 2023 The JeRuSAleM PoSTDr. Lehavit Akerman is a dermatology specialist who runs three clinics in Israel.

The clinic has a comfortable reception desk and a waiting room overlooking the sea, where clients can wait before and after their treatment.

I make sure to introduce innovations in the field of aesthetics throughout the year. It is important for me to provide my clients with a high- level professional experience. wHat is tHe latest innovation in tHe field? I introduced the Sofwave device, designed to lift facial and neck skin and improve the appearance of the skin. It is a non-invasive procedure that is accomplished in just one treatment and does not require any recovery time. This is a breakthrough. We have seen it work with every type of patient. The treatment ends in a shorterperiod of time, and there are good results. It's a winning technology. wHat is tHe approacH today in facial treatments? The approach has changed a lot in recent years. In the past, wrinkles were filled, and treatments started at a relatively advanced age. Today, the market has undergone a real revolution. We understand the importance of combined treatment and preventive treatment. The recommendation is to start preventive treatment at a relatively young age, before spots, wrinkles and sagging appear. Today, many treatments are done with innovative equipment and technologies, not just injections of fillers and Botox. Today we understand the importance of starting collagen production from within the skin itself. The advantage of combined treatments is that they allow you to look good, together with a nonaggressive treatment, which means fewer side effects. at wHat age is it recommended to start? As soon as there are even the slightest signs of skin aging. Around the age of 30, it is recommended to start gently with treatments that stimulate collagen production; as the years progress, one can to get stronger treatments. Of course, it's not just a matter of age. Some women at 50 look great. and there are those at 35 who will need more significant treatment. can facial treatments delay facelift surgery? Not in all cases. It depends on many factors, such as genetics, facial structure, lifestyle, and preservation treatments. We know today that treatments can prevent surgeries or postpone them. Y ou have to remember that when you do surgery with well-maintained skin, the results will last longer. It's the same as after the surgery --technological treatments can extend the effects of the surgical result. dr. leHavit akerman By leA WeiSS DR.

Lehavit Akerman | Photo by PR 14 WoMeN septeMbeR 2023 The JeRuSAleM PoSTAs we age, our skin naturally loses elasticity and collagen, leading to the formation of wrinkles, fine lines, and sagging skin. While there are many cosmetic procedures available to address these concerns, many people are hesitant to undergo surgery. Recently, an Israeli company, called Sofwave, launched its innovative treatment which works with SUPERB technology. Based on ultrasound waves, the award-winning technique is designed to reduce wrinkles and lift the facial and neck skin in a single treatment. We spoke to Dr. Shimon Eckhouse, the co-founder and chairman of the board of Sofwave Medical Ltd. wHat makes tHis device unique? Sofwave is FDA-cleared for lifting the eyebrows, the neck, and the submental (under the chin) while reducing fine lines and wrinkles. Recently, Sofwave also received approval to improve the appearance of cellulite*. It's a non-invasive, quick, and effective procedure. One treatment stimulates the production of collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. The unique patents for the technology and the method of heat transfer in the form of cylinders, in addition to cooling the upper layer of the skin, make the treatment very effective and safe compared to competitors. Patients can return to their routine immediately after the treatment.The device has garnered prestigious international awards from magazines such as Cosmopolitan, Elle, NewBeauty, and Shape. How does tHe device work? The device uses ultrasound waves that penetrate in a controlled and uniform depth with a controlled intensity to the mid-dermis. This stimulates the production of collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid, which we begin to lose starting in our 20's. The device passes through the upper layer of the skin - the epidermis - heating the center of the dermis, the second layer of the skin, to a temperature of 60-65 degrees, at a depth of 1.5 mm. There is no damage to fatty tissue, nerves, or muscle because of the controlled penetration into the dermis. Furthermore, the cooling mechanism, called Sofcool, protects the upper layer of the skin for optimal epidermal protection and comfort for the patient. wHat is tHe guaranteed result? The final result is the lifting of the facial skin, and a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Sofwave also works to improve the appearance of cellulite. is tHe device safe to use? The SUPERB (Synchronous Ultrasound Parallel Beam) technology is based on ultrasound waves and is FDA-cleared. During the treatment, the Sofcool mechanism actively cools, and the real-time skin temperature monitoring mechanism protects the outer layer of the skin, ensuring a high level of safety for the patient. wHat is tHe innovation? The innovative treatment optimizes the field of aesthetic medicine and comes with over 31 unique patents in diffident stages, offering a simple, quick, and non-invasive treatment done in one or two sessions. The effectiveness of the treatment and its safety does not depend on skin color, skin type, or the seasons. It provides an effective and natural, long-lasting result of skin lifting, with minimal to no downtime after the procedure. wHat does tHe sofwave company do? The Israeli company manufactures and develops medical devices to revitalize the skin through innovative stimulation of the production of new collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. Sofwave is non-invasive, quick, and effective. The company has developed groundbreaking technology in the world of aesthetic medicine. Sofwave was first launched in the U.S. in December 2019. Since then, it has been sold worldwide and has earned the recommendation of opinion leaders and expert doctors in the field around the world.Dr. Suzanne Kilmer, a specialist in dermatology and owner of a medical center for laser treatments and skin surgery in northern California, has been using the method for over a year. She says, \"Sofwave has become our recommended treatment, and we have seen it work with every type of patient. \" The treatment was recently introduced to the clinic of Dr. Lehavit Akerman, the president of the Israel Society of dermatologic surgery. Lehavit says, \"Sofwave has become a breakthrough. The treatment is completed in a shorter period of time, and patients have very good results. It's a winning technology. \" *Short-term improvement in the appearance of cellulite firmer skin witHout surgery By leA WeiSS Sofwave | Photo by PR Before After 15 WoMeN septeMbeR 2023 The JeRuSAleM PoSTSonia Nastase, CEO of Nespresso Israel, started to lead the Israeli market of the global brand Nespresso in May 2021.

The coffee market is indeed very dynamic. We witness innovations and developments in this area all the time, and it is a blessing. Innovation is essential for the sector, and predicting new trends and addressing consumers' existing and changing needs enable continuous improvements in the coffee sector. At Nespresso, the brand that changed the nature of coffee consumption worldwide, innovation continues to be one of our success factors. It is implemented in all aspects - in the coffee blends, in our machines for both home and out of home consumption, and in our service. Another innovation is our sustainability strategy. We are pioneers in sustainable products, such as our paper-based compostable coffee capsules. How are israelis' consumption Habits different from europeans'? Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world. It plays an important role in daily life, starting with the morning cup of coffee, continuing with the coffee breaks at work, and often serving as a springboard for social get-togethers. In Israel, coffee is consumed by 93% of the population (18-65 years old) and is very similar to the Israeli energy level and way of life. Israelis love strong coffee with dominant flavors. Some 88% like to add milk, and 75% of Israelis like to drink their coffee in a large cup. Our Vertuo machine was designed to address the latter. Coffee drinkers can enjoy a smooth Gran Lungo or a sizable mug of coffee. Israelis are open to explore new coffee experiences. Many Israelis know a lot about the fine art of coffee. As a global brand with a vast variety and playful coffee formats, we cater to this eagerness to explore and experience new ways of drinking coffee. in wHicH direction is tHe coffee world going? over tHe years, coffee Has become mucH more sopHisticated. Well-being continues to be a significant factor in choosing today's cup of coffee. With their increasingly busy lives, coffee lovers look for moments of enjoyment that allow them a pause, a moment for themselves. Their time is valuable, and they require premium solutions that seamlessly integrate into their active lives. Nespresso addresses this demand. We recently launched the cold brew coffee capsule, as well as a filter style capsule, thus offering a wider variety of premium coffee that is easy to prepare. This trend is also aligned with the awareness about a more sustainable way of living. Consumers expect to have products that are in sync with their values and daily habits, and that includes their cup of coffee. Nespresso's sustainability strategy starts from the source of the coffee. Today, we work with more than 140,000 farmers in 18 countries through the AAA Sustainable Quality Program. It was created to ensure the delivery of high-quality coffee, while enhancing the livelihoods of our partner farmers and protecting the environment. Another trend is the increase in the variety of exotic flavors. We can see this particularly in Israel, as Israelis travel a lot worldwide. Coffee lovers seek special and exotic ingredients; they like to explore more complex varieties. They value unique coffee sources that enable them to experience new and exciting special blends and flavors. wHat are nespresso's next steps? Every cup of coffee reflects our commitment to high-quality, sustainable, and innovative products. We focus on all aspects of the customer experience. From assuring the unforgettable taste of sustainable coffee, through innovation in both B2C and B2B coffee machines, and offering our customers high-level service in all spheres. We regard Israel as an exciting market, and I am personally energized by the innovative and creative spirit of our Israeli employees. coffee break witH sonia By RoNiT MAThi AS Sonia Nastase | Photo by Shlomi Yosef 16 WoMeN septeMbeR 2023 The JeRuSAleM PoSTWhy choose cunard? our fleet Cunard's fleet comprises four wonderful ships: Queen Mary 2, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Victoria, and Queen Anne.

A look at this summer's collections proves that many trends have become classics. It is difficult to point to one outstanding trend, so you can choose a rectangular, sporty, cat or classic frame and still be in style. These are some of the leading trends: narroW rectangular frames Narrow rectangular frames have undergone many design interpretations over the years, but the look is always elegant and sophisticated. sports frames The professional sports frames have become a leading trend in recent years. Maybe it's due to the sportswear that has taken over the wardrobe or perhaps the futuristic look of the glasses, whose lenses have high-level sun filters.

They are also starring this season and have become a favorite among celebs. cat frames The once trendy cat frames are a classic that have a new interpretation every season. oversize frames The 1970s inspired oversize frames from the popular trends that fit almost all of them. Gloria Babay, trendologist and collection manager at Opticana, notes the following trends: The sustainability trend: Fashion houses are becoming aware that it is possible to be fashionable and eco-friendly at the same time. The jewelry trend: With a swing toward bling, these sunglasses are studded with colorful stones, crystals, and pearls. The clear lens trend: This season, the prominent colors that stand out in this trend are light blue, pink, yellow and orange. The mask trend: Top designers discovered a fashionable potential in athletes' need to wear large sunglasses during sports activities. Among the design houses are Versace; Lanvin; Salvador Ferragamo; Karl Lagerfeld; and Burberry. The minimalist trend: This is a very common trend in many industries. In the world of glasses, the Japanese brands that make sunglasses from light materials such as titanium are currently leading the market. Dana Schneider is the collection manager at Erroca by the Super-Pharm chain. She says. \"This summer, the cat eye frames are back in a softer version, with rounded edges in a design that complements most face shapes. At the same time, the classic sharp cat eye design is here to stay. Other notable trends are '90s-looking sunglasses with geometric metal frames for an effortless retro look; and bright colored lenses and oversize \"statement\" glasses inspired by the 1970s. We will continue to see the trends of the mask frames that get a more sporty twist. And, of course, the thin oval and rectangular frames that have conquered the girls of Israel.\" Elinor Bor Ben-Zvi, marketing director for Luxotica, offers advice on how to choose the right frame. She says that one of the most important factors to consider when choosing sunglasses is to select a frame that fits the structure of your face. While still being fashionable, the frame should suit your personality. The frame should sit firmly on your nose but not be too tight. There are four types of facial structure: For a long and narrow face, a rectangular or oval frame is very suitable. But the frame shoild not exceed the width of the face. For those blessed with an oval face, almost any shape is suitable. However, the width of the frame is still important. For a facial structure that is square, a round or cat frame will balance the square structure and be very flattering. And for a facial structure that is full and round, a frame that is square or rectangular will fill the bill. caRoLIna LeMke beRLIn (photo by y ossi Michaeli) sunskI foR weshoes (photo by pR) 19 WoMeN septeMbeR 2023 The JeRuSAleM PoSTheAl Th let tHe sun sHine When the temperature rises, many of us want to go out and get a nice, healthy-looking tan. So this is just the time to shine the spotlight on sun protection. There is a wide variety of products for the face and body that are suitable for adults and children.According to the American Cancer Society, over 90% of the signs of aging are caused by the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation. So as much as we love to bask in the sun, the fact is that exposure to the sun's rays accelerates the appearance of wrinkles, spots, pigmentation, and signs of aging. To prevent such damage, it is important to use sun protection. In ancient cultures, the need for protection from the sun was described mainly as a measure designed to prevent the skin from tanning, as fair skin was considered to be a symbol of beauty and high status. In the literature and art of ancient Egypt and Greece, there are many references to the use of plant extracts to protect the skin from the sun. People wore hats and protected their skin with clothing, stayed in the shade, and used olive oil to protect their skin. In Southeast Asia, a mixture of rice, seaweed extract, and spices is still used to protect the skin from the sun's harmful rays. At the beginning of the 19th century, the first research was done on the damage caused by radiation and was concerned with the study of the mechanism that causes burns due to exposure to the sun. In 1936, L'Oreal marketed sunscreen for the first time. In 1946, Austrian chemist Franz Greiter developed a sunscreen that contained paba, an organic substance that was used to absorb the sun's rays. A year later, he adopted an index created by Rudolf Schulz which described additional protection for the skin through the use of a sunscreen. He published it as the sun protection factor - SPF. That index became the standard in the world for the degree of protection of the use of protective products. In 1977, water- resistant sunscreens were created. Awareness about the damage of solar radiation increases in the summer, so people generally apply sunscreen only during the summer when they go to the beach, the pool, or spend time outdoors. However, the damage from radiation exists all year round, even on cloudy days or on rainy days when we think that we are being protected under an umbrella.The use of sunscreen products does not guarantee 100% protection, so it is not safe to stay in the sun for too many hours at a time. Most dermatologists and health authorities suggest using a sun protection factor of 30 SPF or higher. helpful hints - Choose a sunscreen texture that you like, such as lotion, cream, mousse, oil, or spray. Apply a thick layer to provide protection according to the product's SPF.By iRiT MAThi AS by k eith Glassmanphoto by pR 22 WoMeN septeMbeR 2023 The JeRuSAleM PoSTheAl Th - It is recommended to apply the preparation 15 to 30 minutes before exposure to the sun. - Apply 2 mg. of sunscreen to 1 square meter of skin and reapply every two hours. - Perspiration and/or gong into the water reduces the effectiveness of the preparation, so it is important to dry your skin and reapply the sunscreen. - Don't forget to protect your lips. Use a lip balm designed to prevent dryness and cracks. - Don't wear perfume when you are exposed to the sun. Forewarned is forearmed. So now, go out and have fun in the sun. photo by pRphoto by pR photo by sasha d ubinskyphoto by pRphoto by pR photo by y ael hahnphoto by udi dagan & pR 23 WoMeN septeMbeR 2023 The JeRuSAleM PoSTHello, barbie By RoNiT MAThi AS With the recent release of Barbie, the hottest movie of the summer, we take a look at the iconic doll and the history of the brand.The Barbie doll was \"born\" after a trip to Switzerland that Ruth Handler took with her daughter, Barbara. They purchased a shapely doll called a Bild Lilli, a West German line of fashion doll. It was the inspiration for Barbie, the doll that Handler created and named after her daughter. In 1945, Ruth and her husband, Elliot, founded Mattel, which became one of the world's leading toy companies. In 1959, Barbie made her debut at a toy fair in New Y ork and over the years became part of popular culture. The doll has a very narrow waist, long legs, a perfect face, and long blond hair. The advertising campaign was directed at young girls, not their parents. Barbie became the darling of international fashion houses, and their designs were worn by Hollywood stars. In 1961, the Ken doll was created as Barbie's boyfriend, named after the Handlers' son.Barbie has received multiple awards and in 2014 was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated . Over the years, she has represented a variety of cultures, from Africa to Japan. In 2003, a Muslim Barbie was created. The doll is still sold today, outfitted with traditional Arab garments, including hijabs.Barbie's detractors contend that she symbolizes a negative aspect of consumer culture and has an unrealistic female figure. But Handler, who created the fashionable doll that has a big dream house, a well-kept garden, and a red Corvette, wonders what's wrong with a small plastic figure that comes in all skin colors, has a myriad of professions, and gives hope to every girl in the world that there is no limit to what she can achieve if she wants to. Handler's philosophy advocated that through Barbie, it's possible to convey the message that every little girl can be anything she wants. And she emphasized the fact that women have the right to choose their occupation, even in times when going to work was not popular. Thus Mattel's slogan was \"Y ou can be whatever you want.\"Over the years, Barbie dolls have represented a wide variety of professions, such as a happy housewife; a sharp-tongued journalist; a talented fashion editor; a veterinarian; a doctor; a beauty queen; a businesswoman; and a global fashion icon. She always represented the modern woman and feminine power, while dressed in the latest fashion.When there was a decline in the sale of Barbie dolls, Mattel took a survey among its design team, asking them what they would do if they were given a free hand to design their own Barbie. The answer was an increase in skin color diversity, hair color, and body structure. This led to a secret project that Mattel led for a year and a half and gave birth to in 2016. The new line of Barbie dolls included a curvaceous, a petite, and a tall Barbie. There was a wide range of eye color, hair color, hairstyles, and facial structures so that every girl could find a doll with which she identified. The new dolls received enthusiastic reactions on social networks and high praise that there were finally dolls that one could identify with. Barbie is sold in more than 150 countries. Every year, some 59 million Barbie dolls are sold, garnering billions of dollars. In 2020, the American market research company The NPD Group awarded Barbie the title of Leading Toy Property in the World. Barbie continues her journey to represent global diversity with a variety of dolls of all types and colors, which includes over 175 dolls of every skin tone, eye color, hair color, and body structure.

Means: Ultrasound-guided Sclerotherapy Varicose veins in the legs: This problem affects many after pregnancies, or after periods of prolonged standing. It is important to know that the need to treat varicose veins in the legs is not only aesthetic. After the stage of visible changes in the skin, ulcers may appear in the ankles that may grow and even become infected. How does it work? For the last 15 years, a new, safe, and convenient method for treating varicose veins has been introduced: ultrasound-guided venous sclerosis, which has clear advantages: no need for surgery, no scars, and no downtime. The treatment is carried out in the clinic and is based on the foam injection of Polidocanol solution into the varicose vein for 15 minutes.The substance causes chemical inflammation of the intima - the inner vein wall, and to its blockage and disappearance within a few weeks. After the procedure, an elastic bandage is worn for two days. In most cases, an additional 2-3 sessions are required, until the total closure of the treated vein. can tHere be side effects? It has been found to be safe and effective, with less than 1% experiencing severe complications. Mild side effects include tingling, local sensitivity in the vein that hardens and softens within 3-4 months, and occasionally, pigmentation along the vein for a few months. How effective is it? do varicose veins return? The efficency of this treatment is 87% with 5%-8% recurrence within five years. If it recurs, another one or two sessions of injections will be sufficient wHat Happens after treatment? The treatment enables patients to remain at work with minimal side effects and little risk. Occasionally, pain medication or medicines such as Voltaren are needed for a few days. ii. prevention of stroke preliminary signs of stroke: Impaired speech, numbness, weakness, or paralysis of the arm/leg for a few minutes to 24 hours can indicate a clot that has detached to the brain. In most cases, the source of clots is from the division of the carotid arteries, in which a turbulent flow is created, and a plug of cholesterol and calcium is formed, narrowing the artery. If the clot is soft, it can move to a specific area of the brain and cause an obstruction, with signs of weakness or disruption in speech. Occasionally, vision disturbance is like a curtain that goes down and disappears after minutes or hours. tHe test tHat will prevent a stroke Duplex Carotid examination - an ultrasound examination that examines the structure of the carotid arteries and measures a disturbance in the flow. If the stenosis is above 70% and the flow is significantly disrupted, a CT angiography should be performed and treated with catheterization or surgery to prevent a complete cerebral event.This invasive treatment involves a risk of up to 2% compared to conservative aspirin treatment, which can cause a stroke within two years with a frequency of 22%. iii. treatment of leg arterial disease Complaints of intermittent claudication that interferes with walking at distances of less than 100 meters, with calf and foot pain, requiring stopping and resting before resuming walking. These complaints indicate peripheral artery disease and plaque formation in the leg arteries, consisting of cholesterol and calcium deposits. A Doppler ultrasound of the leg arteries should be performed, with blood pressure measurements in the legs, compared to the blood pressure in the arms. If a non-healing wound appears on the foot/toes within 2-4 weeks, a leg artery angiography should be performed. Decision regarding further treatment either by angioplasty or vascular surgery should be made in a consultation with a vascular surgeon.

I lectured there and also supervised interns. about my treatment metHod I have been a chiropractor for 25 years, with experience treating tens of thousands of people who have been suffering - both sick and healthy people. Many of my patients have received outstanding results and have continued with me for years. Quite a few patients began to bring family and loved ones to me. I realized that those who continue care become stronger and do not experience new functional problems. i developed a program to strengtHen spinal motion, because in many cases, surgery can be prevented witH cHiropractic care Most people come for care because they are in pain or have a bothersome medical problem. For most, a concentrated and customized series of treatments lasting 3-6 months is sufficient. The accumulation of stress and pressure interferes with brain-body communication, which weakens the body, and interferes with the motion of the vertebrae and the spine. The longer the accumulation of stress remains in the body, the weaker the body becomes and begins to break down. Motion is impaired, and symptoms and diseases begin to form.The spinal cord is the \"electrical cabinet\" of the body. The sub-displacement of a vertebra (vertebral subluxation) is similar to a circuit breaker that drops and interferes with the electrical current. The chiropractic adjustment is brief and precise, returning the vertebrae and the flow of operating instructions from the brain to the body. The program of care lasts six months, with chiropractic care (adjustment/activation) of the back and health. In the first four to six weeks, chiropractic care is administered three times a week, and later at least once a week, for six months. After the initial examination and diagnosis, I prepare a personal explanatory booklet for each patient, in which I mark and show them how their problem is related to their nervous system and spine and recommend a special care plan for each patient's case.Chiropractic adjustment restores motion to the vertebrae and spinal cord and improves communication between the brain and body through the spine, restoring the transmission of operating instructions from the brain to the body, and activating and strengthening health. wHen sHould one start cHiropractic spinal care and maintain spinal motion and flexibility? Patients know their bodies best, and occasionally there are ups and downs during the care period. A decade ago, I initiated membership plans - similar to gym memberships - so that members would get more for their money. Those who commit to care over a period of time can come during the membership period up to three times a week at no additional charge! I have seen that sometimes there is a need to care for more than one family member, so I built a family membership plan (for wife, husband, and children up to age 18) in which all family members can receive up to 3 adjustments a week during clinic hours, without making an appointment in advance. my son Has autism and didn't speak until He was 9. I learned that there is a postdoctoral specialization in chiropractic for autism and brain injuries. I did this internship, I adjusted my son, and he started talking. good to know Have you noticed that you are taller at the beginning of the day and shorter at the end of the day? What's going on? As the day progresses, stress and pressure accumulate in the spine, and fluid comes out of the discs, so we lose height. At night, when we sleep, there is a mechanism for returning fluid to the discs, so we gain height. The better, and longer we sleep, the taller we can be. Over the years, the mechanism of returning fluid to the discs becomes damaged, and eventually, we lose height. However, chiropractic care relieves pressure from the discs and improves and restores the mechanism of fluid returning to the discs. Therefore, it is important to check the accumulated pressure in the spine at least once a week. If pressure has accumulated in the spine and discs, it is recommended to release them by chiropractic care that relieves pressure from the spine and restores height.The earlier you start regular treatment, the more height you can maintain. The process even helps growth in children and adolescents, and in adults, the process reduces height loss.

I am a graduate of architecture and interior design, with a master's degree in urban planning from the Faculty of Architecture at the Technion. I am consultant on the Planning and Construction Committee of the Tel Aviv Municipality. wHat is your motto? I believe in creating architecture that excites you every time you encounter it anew. wHat makes your work unique? I have developed a work process that allows me to refine the planning and design elements for my clients, rendering distinctly styled homes that are customized to their worldview. wHat tips on planning and design always remain relevant? I believe in the correct combination of styles -- modern, classic, rustic, eclectic and Nordic - and the proportionate use of their various features. Balancing a dominant color palette in combination with neutral background colors will enliven a space and fill it with energy. Choosing local natural materials such as stone and glass, which are suitable for our climate, will render a design that will endure in a more qualitative and aesthetic way. Choosing a limited number of materials or using uniform and unique materials will allow you to create a clean, precise look. Then select accessories that will fit in with the design.Don't give in to trends. What is considered relevant and hot today may not be appropriate for your new home. How do you turn an ordinary living space into a coZy and well- designed space? One of the strongest design elements in architecture is a harmonious combination of the home and the environment. In luxury homes, you often find large glass windows that bring the exterior inside while maintaining the continuity of the natural light that enters the house.The design practice that currently dominates the design of luxury homes is minimalism -- emphasizing what is present through what is not.And strong emphasis should be placed on the relationship between aesthetics and the functionality of the household's daily life. www.ataryuval.com golf embraces african handicrafts By iRiT MAThi AS Golf & Co is launching a capsule housewares collection as part of a collaboration with Kuchinate.

My father had mentioned the idea of skincare many times, but we knew him well, and we knew it all depended on science. He wasn't going to do another good cream based on similar ingredients. So his creating a brand truly was out of our hands. Only when dermal stem cell reservoirs were discovered and published in December 2009 did we know that he was ready to go. Over the following two years, he was focused on development, and we didn't really know if or when something would come out of these experiments and research. It was a set of good luck that both my sister and I were ready to move on from our then-careers. So within one year of the patent application and launch, we both joined him. wHat is it like to work in a family business? Working with family is both very challenging and rewarding. Roles in the company are different from the ones in the family, so there is certainly an adjustment. And it takes times for everyone to learn how to work with each other. Where we were lucky is that we all had very different expertise, so we had to rely on each other. We didn't step on each other's toes, and that was a blessing. Separating daytime, work time, and family relations is challenging, but it all works out. I think we are all feeling extremely lucky to have the opportunity to not only work together but also to create a business and a brand from scratch together. one-on-one talk By iRiT MAThi AS 33 WoMeN septeMbeR 2023 The JeRuSAleM PoSTSho P iN By iRiT MAThi AS eilat, here We come The Super-Pharm chain is launching a Gallery concept store in Eilat.
