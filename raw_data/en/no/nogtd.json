Although founded in 1887 by a group of Presbyterian ministers and laymen, Occidental has had no formal religious association since 1910. It is governed by a self -perpetuating Board of Trustees, is accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges,* and holds membership in a number of regional and national organizations relate d to higher education. The Delta of California Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was established at Occidental in 1926. The first baccalaureate degree was conferred in 1893, and graduate instruction leading to the Master of Arts degree in selected fields was inaug urated in 1922. By authority of the California State Department of Education, Occidental recommends candidates for the Single Subject Level I and Multiple Subject Level I teaching credentials. Occidental seeks to provide an education of high quality in the best tradition of the liberal arts, emphasizing thorough competence in a chosen field of study together with a broad understanding of our historical and cultural heritage, and the relationships among fields of knowledge. Students and faculty at Occidental are engaged in an intellectual partnership in which student initiative and responsibility are encouraged. To an unusual degree, students may participate in the construction of their own educational programs. Independent study and interdepartmental program s are encouraged. Occidental students represent varied intellectual interests, socioeconomic backgrounds, racial and ethnic groups, religious beliefs, nationalities, and social and political convictions. This diversity finds its expression not only in the variety of academic programs and options open to the student, but also through the entire range of student organizations and enterprises, college cultural events, visiting lecturers, and forums, all of which taken together comprise the many facets of life in an invigorating academic community. The College is committed to a philosophy of total education. Intellectual capability is a dominant component, but is conceived of as one dimension in a process which includes and stresses personal, ethical, social, an d political growth toward maturation as well. The high percentage of students in residence at the College works toward the achievement of this objective. Successful Occidental students are self -motivated, independent -minded and intellectually talented peop le. They base their judgments upon respect for evidence, ideas, and a deep concern for values, both private and public. They are alert to the possibilities of betterment in themselves, their college, and their society. Above all, they realize that no educa tion is finished, that they are in college to learn how to learn, so that they may carry on their own education for the rest of their lives. Occidental College is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer, and does not discriminate against employees or appl icants because of race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, age, gender, marital status, pregnancy, sexual orientation, or disability. This nondiscrimination policy also covers student access to College programs, including but not limited to academ ic admissions, financial aid, educational services, and employment. Occidental College is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges 985 Atlantic Avenue, Suite 100 1Alameda, California 94501 (510) 748 -9001 *Senior Colleges and Universitie s of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges: 985 Atlantic Avenue, Suite 100, Alameda, CA 94501 Mission The mission of Occidental College is to provide a gifted and diverse grou p of students with a total educational experience of the highest quality \u2014one that prepares them for leadership in an increasingly complex, interdependent and pluralistic world. The distinctive interdisciplinary and multicultural focus of the College's acad emic program seeks to foster both the fulfillment of individual aspirations and a deeply rooted commitment to the public good. This mission is anchored by four cornerstones: excellence, equity, community and service. These building blocks, in one form or a nother, have long been the basis for the College's commitment to providing responsible leaders and citizens for our democratic society. Choosing them to support the future helps to ensure that the College remains true to its mission while adapting to a cha nging world.

The Admission Committee seeks students with strong academic preparation and personal characteristics who demonstrate motivation, accomplishment, involvement, energy, and commitment. Rigor of coursework, grades, writing, recommendations, extracurricular activities, and t est scores are all taken into consideration in selecting the members of the first -year class. While there is no specific requirement for the high school course of study, it is recommended that applicants take five academic subjects each year, including advanced or honors courses when available. The emphasis in each academic area will vary with individual interests and goals, but a solid preparation in high school should include four years of English compo sition and literature,three to four years of foreign language, three to four years of mathematics (four years for students interested in science or engineering), three to four years of social studies, and three to four years of science \u2014including one year e ach of biological and physical science. (Students interested in science or engineering should be sure to include both chemistry and physics.) Regular Decision applications for admission into to the first -year class are due by January 10. Students for whom Occidental is their first -choice college may apply under one of two binding Early Decision programs. ED I applications are due November 15, with decisions mailed within a month and ED II applications are due January 2, with decisions also mailed within a m onth. Transfer applications for fall semester should be submitted by March 15, and for the spring semester, transfer applications should be submitted by October 15. International transfer applications are accepted for fall semester only, and should be subm itted by March 15. Detailed information on the College, its curriculum and programs, and admission and financial assistance is included in published materials available from the Office of Admission and online atwww.oxy.edu/admission-aid . First year and transfer candidates may apply to the College using the Common Application, which includes a required Occidental Supplement. Prospective students are encouraged to experience Occidental firsthand by visiting the College. It is possible to attend an information session, tour the campus, and visit classes. Although interviews are not required, they are strongly recommended. For more information, call 1 -800-825-5262, email admission@oxy.edu , or contact: Office of Admission, Occidental College, 1600 Campus Road, Los Angeles, CA 90041. Academic Information Undergraduate Study Bachelor of Arts Degree Unless modified in individual cases by administrative action, the following requirements must be fulfilled by all students to qualify for formal recommendation by the faculty for the degree of Bachelor of Arts: 1. Completion of a minimum of 128 units. 82. Attainment of a 2.0 grade point average or better for all courses undertaken at Occidental College and for the student's entire course of study. 3. Attainment of a 2.0 grade point average or better for all courses undertaken within a departmental major or min or. 4. Satisfaction of the writing proficiency requirement. 5. Completion of the Core Program by the end of the junior year. 6. Language 102 -level proficiency in a language other than English by the end of the third year. See below for Languages Policy. 7. Completion of a major or an Independent Pattern of Study. It is possible to have a double major. 8. Passing of a final comprehensive requirement in the senior year in the major subject or area of concentration, or in the case of those studying under an Independent Pattern of Study, as designed by the student's advisory committee. 9. Fulfillment of all degree requirements, other than the comprehensive examination and work in progress in the final semester, at least six weeks prior to graduation. 10. No Incomplete grades, NR grades, or CIP grades on the student's transcript at the time of graduation. A minimum of 64 units (exclusive of Occidental -sponsored study- abroad programs) of the required number of units for graduation must be taken by the student at Occidental College to receive the Bachelor of Arts degree. Sixteen units of the last 32 must be Occidental College courses (Study Abroad classes are considered Occidental College courses). Full-time student status is defined by enrollment in twelve or more units; part -time s tatus is defined by enrollment in eleven or fewer units. The degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred at the May Commencement upon all candidates who have satisfied degree requirements at any time since the last Commencement. Proficiency in writing Students meet this requirement in two stages, the first of which is passing the first -stage Writing Proficiency evaluation in the Cultural Studies Program. Completion of the Cultural Studies courses does not by itself satisfy the writing requirement. There are thr ee measures of proficiency: 1) Fall Semester Professor evaluates the writing of each student using a rubric (1 - 6 scale with 4 or above considered proficient). 2) Spring Semester Professor evaluates the writing of each student, using a rubric (1 -6 scale wit h 4 or above considered proficient). 3). One additional measure of writing proficiency is required; most recently this measure has been participation in a shared intellectual experience with required reading which culminates in a timed writing; professors evaluate each students writing using the 1 -6 score rubric. Frosh are expected to successfully score 4 or better on two of the three measures. Those who do not pass the Cultural Studies Writing evaluations will be asked to pass with a C or better a course i n the Department of English Writing (201) or another writing course designated by the Director of Writing Programs in conjunction with the Director of the Core Program. The second stage of the requirement will be met in the student's major department. 9Each department at the College has specified its own writing requirement in the major; students should consult their department chair. For more information, consult see \"Writing Program\" in the \"Special Programs\" section of this Catalog. Languages All students must achieve Language 102 -level proficiency in a language other than English by the end of their third year as part of Occidental's Core requirements. Some majors or minors may have additional language requirements. Placement Exams Students who plan to be gin an entirely new language at Occidental are not required to take the placement exam. First-year students may take the Occidental College Placement Examination either on - line for French, German, and Spanish, or during orientation for other languages tau ght at Occidental if: 1. they have studied a language for a semester in college or for more than one year of high school (ninth grade does not count); 2. they have participated in after -school or weekend language programs; or 3. they have extensive background in bu t no formal training in a language. Students can fulfill Occidental's language requirement in one of five ways: 1. Completing a language course numbered 102 at Occidental, or the equivalent course in any foreign language at another accredited institution. 2. Receiving an exemption -level score on Occidental's Placement and/or Exemption exam given during Orientation. (see the Language Studio site for language specific details). 3. Earning an appropriate Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) II score (560 or above in Frenc h, Spanish, or Latin; 550 or above in German or Chinese; 540 or above in Japanese; or 560 for any other language). 4. Earning an Advanced Placement test score of 4 or above. 5. For some languages not taught at Occidental, students may opt to take the ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) and the Writing Proficiency test (WPT) in the languages currently available. Please see the Keck Language and Culture Studio about demonstrating proficiency via ACTFL interviews and tests. Foreign Language Exemption Policy International students whose language of education has been in a language other than English and who have completed six years of elementary education or more in a foreign language are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Such students should contact th e chair of one of the foreign language departments to confirm their fulfillment of the foreign language requirement. 10The Honors Program The Honors Program at Occidental is designed to allow the superior student's attention to be focused on an independent i nvestigation for a sustained period of time. It is expected that students admitted to the College Honors Program will have established themselves as outstanding prospects for individualized work in the department of their major and also will have establish ed themselves as submitting work of very high quality in all that they have undertaken at Occidental. Student admission to the College Honors Program will be by formal action of the faculty in the student's major department. Ordinarily no student will be a dmitted to the College Honors Program who does not have an overall grade point average of 3.25. No student will, under any circumstances, receive Honors who has not maintained this grade point average by the end of spring semester of the senior year. Indiv idual departments may set a higher minimum grade point average, both overall and within the major. Students accepted for the College Honors Program are exempt from the eight -unit limit in Independent Study and may take Advanced Research (499) courses on an independent study basis. The purpose of such research is to prepare a special project to be submitted to the major department for evaluation no later than the 10th week of the spring semester of the student's senior year. Evaluation of the completed proje ct will be made by a committee of department faculty and may include readers from outside the department or College. Students wishing to be considered for participation in the Honors Program should contact the chair of the appropriate department during the spring semester of their sophomore year and, in any event, will be admitted to the program no later than the second week of the fall semester of their senior year. Completion of an Honors project does not in itself guarantee the conferring of College Hono rs. See also Honors in an \"Independent Pattern of Study\". Honors at Graduation Summa cum Laude : Grade point average of 3.90 or above. Magna cum Laude : Grade point average of 3.75 or above. Cum Laude : Grade point average of 3.50 or above. Grade point averag es for Honors are based on work completed at Occidental College. Study Abroad courses taken in the Fall and spring and approved by the International Programs Office are considered Occidental college courses and are calculated in the GPA for honors. No tran sfer courses are calculated in the Occidental college GPA (study abroad courses taken in the summer are considered transfer courses). Major Concentration The requirements for graduation are determined at the time students declare their major. The catalog a nd policies in place at the time (the current official catalog) determine the students' requirements for the major declared. The student has the option to use any catalog thereafter as long as the student does not take a leave of absence or withdrawals fro m the college. A student is encouraged to declare a major at any point during the freshman year, and is required to do so not later than registration at the end of the sophomore year. Only under exceptional circumstances may a major be changed after the end of the junior year and only by special petition to the appropriate Committee. Students are expected to complete those major requirements in effect in the year they declare the major. 11Unless different regulations are specified under the departmental req uirements for graduation, a student who fails to attain a 2.0 grade point average in introductory and intermediate courses within the major will not be accepted by that department as a major. The minimum number of units for a major is prescribed by individ ual departments. The maximum units that may be required by a department is 48, but a student who wishes to do so may take more than the required number of units in the major subject. At least 64 units of coursework counting toward the A.B. degree, however, must be taken outside the major department. In any single semester, students are strongly discouraged from taking more than 12 units in a single department. Each department requires senior students in the major to complete a comprehensive examination, the evaluation of which becomes a part of each student's permanent record and transcript. To double major, a student completes all requirements for the major in each of two separate departments. Students must complete separate comprehensive examinations. Minor Concentration A student is allowed to declare an academic minor, consisting of at least 20 units chosen from a list determined by each department. Students should consult the appropriate department for a list of courses acceptable for the minor. Students who wish to declare minors must do so no later than the fall semester of the senior year. Departmental Majors and Minors Art History and the Visual Arts East Asian Studies Biology Chemistry Chinese Studies Computer Science (minor only) Critical Theory and Social Justice Education (minor only) English and Comparative Literary Studies French Literary Studies Geology German Studies (minor only) Group Language (major only) History Japanese Studies Linguistics (minor only) Mathematics Music Philosophy Physics Politics Psychology Religious Studies Russian (minor only) Sociology 12Spanish Literary Studies Theater Interdepartmental Majors and Minors: American Studies Biochemistry (major only) Chevalier Program in Diplomacy and World Affairs (major only) Cognitive Sci ence Kinesiology Urban and Environmental Policy Interdepartmental Programs Classical Studies (minor only) Latin American Studies (minor only) Interinstitutional Programs 3/2 and 4/2 Combined Plan Programs in Liberal Arts and Engineering with California Ins titute of Technology and Columbia University Cooperative arrangement with Columbia University School of Law Cooperative arrangement with the Keck Graduate Institute Exchanges with Art Center College of Design and California Institute of Technology Independ ent Pattern of Study Occidental offers students, with the consultation of faculty members, the opportunity to design an Independent Pattern of Study (IPS) in lieu of a major program. An Independent Pattern of Study is appropriate when a student has a stron g and well developed motivation to pursue interdisciplinary study in areas where the College does not have a defined program. Such a program is particularly appropriate in newly emerging areas of study. It must, however, be one which is feasible for both t he College and the student. The student must demonstrate to the faculty involved a record of success in completing previous work in courses, independent study, and other programs. A proposal for an IPS should include (1) a statement of academic purpose; (2 ) a program of at least 48 units, including 32 numbered 300 or greater; (3) a proposal for the Comprehensive Project; (4) plans for faculty involvement including regular meetings with the entire committee and (5) an overall GPA of 3.25 or better at the tim e the IPS proposal is submitted for approval. The program of study must be endorsed by an IPS Committee composed of three members of the faculty, with no more than two faculty from the same department. The procedure for proposing an IPS begins with the sub mission of a proposal to the Student Progress Committee no later than six weeks before the end of the sophomore year. (Appropriate forms are available in the Registrar's Office.) The proposal, after any necessary revisions, will be presented by the student to the assembled IPS committee in preparation for final submission. Final proposals for IPS must be approved no later than the end of the sophomore year. The student's transcript will have \"Independent Pattern of Study\" listed under the heading of \"Major\" . The title chosen for the IPS will be identified on the transcript as an emphasis in the major. 13Honors in an Independent Pattern of Study College Honors may be awarded to graduating seniors who demonstrate excellence in Independent Pattern of Study course work and in an honors thesis/project. To be eligible, students must have a 3.5 or better grade point average in courses taken for their IPS and an overall 3.25 grade point average. Qualified students who wish to pursue Honors must consult with their IPS c ommittee during their junior year and submit a proposal for honors thesis/project no later than mid - term of the second semester of their junior year. Pre-Professional Courses The plan of undergraduate study at Occidental emphasizes a liberal education of the type that is generally recognized as desirable preparation for professional or vocational fields. Opportunity is afforded, however, for flexibility in developing programs suited to students' individual needs and in providing for the subjects which are specified by many professional schools as a basis for graduate study. Suggestions concerning adaptation of majors to preparation for various vocational and professional fields are included in departmental announcements in this catalog. Students are encoura ged, beginning in the freshman year, to utilize the services of the Career Development Center, where detailed information concerning vocational opportunities and preparation may be obtained. The Career Development Center offers counseling to help students become aware of their potential and how that potential may be used productively during and after the college experience. Graduate Study Occidental College offers graduate study in academic areas for which the College is able to provide distinctive offerings at the graduate level. Admission to graduate study is competitive, and the number of students admitted is sufficiently small to ensure flexibility in arranging individual program s of study within a general framework of policies that assure high academic standards. The Master of Arts (M.A.) degree is offered in the Biology department. Admission Graduates of accredited colleges and universities are eligible to apply for graduate stu dy at Occidental. Preference is given to applicants with superior preparation and achievement. Graduate students are admitted subject to the general regulations of the College. Applications for the Master of Arts in Biology are available in the Graduate Of fice. Applications and all admission credentials for graduate study must be received by March 1 for students applying to begin study during the Summer Session, or the Fall Semester, and by October 1 for students applying to begin study during the Spring Se mester. Students seeking admission to the M.A. program must have significant successful experience in the discipline to be ready for graduate study. Evidence of readiness includes undergraduate grades, completion of an undergraduate major or minor in the d iscipline, successful completion of a significant amount of course work at or above the advanced undergraduate level, and Graduate Record Examination (GRE) general and subject test scores. Consultation with the 14department chair is recommended before comple ting the application, particularly for students who have not completed an undergraduate major in the discipline. Completed applications must include the following: 1. A completed application form, including a statement of objectives for graduate work. 2. Applic ation fee of $60. (This fee is waived for current and former Occidental students.) 3. Official transcripts of all academic work at the college or university level, including previous graduate work. 4. Letters of recommendation from three persons. These should include, if possible, one letter from a professor in the applicant's major field of undergraduate study. 5. An official report of test scores from the Graduate Record Examination General Test. 6. An official report of test scores for the Graduate Record Examination Subject Test in Biology. 7. For applicants whose native language is not English, an official report of test scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language. (This requirement is waived for current and former Occidental students.) Applicatio ns for the M.A. in Biology must be submitted directly to the Graduate Office. Financial Aid Financial aid for graduate study is available from the College on the basis of financial need and academic promise. In order to be eligible for available funds, app licants must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) online and a separate Financial Aid Application for Graduate Students to the Financial Aid Office by April 19, prior to the academic school year of intended matriculation. All other r equired supplemental documents (tax returns, W -2s and verification documents) must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office by April 19. Application forms and a list of required supplemental forms may be obtained from the Graduate Office or the Financial A id Office. Candidacy for Advanced Degrees Candidacy for an advanced degree is granted to a student whose undergraduate preparation provides a thoroughly satisfactory background for the graduate work proposed. In some instances, a student who does not meet all the departmental course requirements for admission may be admitted to graduate standing but not to candidacy for the degree until specified prerequisite courses are completed. When the background courses have been completed at a level of achievement sa tisfactory to the student's major department, the department will recommend to the Graduate Office that the student be advanced to candidacy for the master's degree. Plan of Study for Candidates for the M.A. Degree At the time of acceptance for graduate st udy, each degree candidate is assigned a major advisor. The student and the advisor share the joint responsibility to formulate a consistent plan of study that is within the policies of the College and the major department. The plan of study should include a schedule for meeting all degree requirements. Credit for a graduate degree may be given for Occidental courses (including summer offerings) numbered 500 and above, but not for any course taken in fulfillment of requirements for a Bachelor's degree. As a general policy, the College does not accept transfer graduate credit from other institutions; however, students receiving Veterans Benefits should submit documentation of their prior graduate work to the Graduate Office for evaluation of potential 15credit toward their degree. Courses numbered 500 and above are ordinarily limited to graduate students. However, advanced and specially qualified undergraduates may be permitted to enroll in such courses by special petition to the instructor, the department chair , and the Director of Graduate Studies. In special circumstances, by additional petition to the Director of Graduate Studies, credit toward the Master of Arts degree also may be granted provided the course is not required to fulfill a Bachelor's degree. Gr aduate full -time status is nine or more units. Degree Requirements - Master of Arts 1. Completion of a minimum of 30 units (six courses) of graduate work at Occidental, achieving a grade of B (3.0) or higher in every course 1. Not less than one -half of the work shall be completed in the student's major department. The remainder shall be chosen, with the approval of the advisor and the major department chair, from related upper -division courses in other departments to form a consistent plan of study. 2. M.A. student s in Biology must register once for thesis credit by enrolling in Biology 590, Thesis for Master of Arts Degree (5 units). This course may count toward the 30 -units requirement. 2. Satisfactory completion of a thesis. The relevant material shall be presented to the Graduate Office in approved form as specified in the general instructions issued to degree candidates. The Special Collections Librarian will issue an acknowledgment of receipt to the student. This receipt shall be submitted to the Graduate Office as proof that the thesis has been submitted. 3. Passing of a final examination demonstrating a thorough grasp of the candidate's field of emphasis. The supervising committee for this examination shall consist of three faculty members, with the student's advi sor as the chair. The committee shall include at least one faculty member of a department other than the student's major department. 4. Other degree requirements specified by the major department in the College Catalog. 5. All degree requirements must be compl eted no later than five calendar years after the date of initial enrollment as a graduate student. Thesis Candidate Status for M.A. Students M.A. students who have completed all course work and are continuing thesis work may enroll in Thesis Candidate Sta tus. This status grants student privileges and allows the College to certify enrollment. A student may enroll in this status for a maximum of two semesters and must be either normally enrolled or in Thesis Candidate Status in the semester in which he or she graduates. Final Approval of Candidacy for the M.A. Degree The Master of Arts degree is conferred upon candidates formally recommended by the faculty on the basis of approval by (a) the candidate's supervising committee, and (b) the Director of Graduate Studies. Such approval is contingent upon completing all degree requirements. In addition, candidates must present to the Graduate Office an application for final approval of candidacy for the degree, including signed recommendations from the members of th e supervising committee. Graduate degrees will be dated as of the end of the semester in which the Registrar certifies that all College and departmental degree requirements have been met. For those candidates who wish to participate in May Commencement cer emonies, all evidence of degree completion must be received in the Graduate Office by April 1. 16Probation Policy for Graduate Students Students who do not maintain a grade point average of 3.0 or higher in all coursework after admission to the graduate prog ram will be placed on academic probation. The academic year at Occidental College consists of two 15 -week semesters, each including one week of final examinations. A student may register each semester for a maximum of 18 units. Students electing to enroll for fewer than 16 units in any semester during their course of study at Occidental must be aware they may not be making normal academic progress and must accept the consequences of a possible delayed graduation date. Only by special petition to the Dean of Students and under the most unusual circumstances may students reduce their academic load to fewer than 12 units. Students may petition to be part time through the last day to drop classes. After that date students may only withdraw from a class and the enrollment status will not change. Academic Policies The academic year at Occidental College consists of two 15 -week semesters, each including one week of final examinations. A student may register each semester for a maximum of 18 units. Students electing to enroll for fewer than 16 units in any semester during their course of study at Occidental must be aware they may not be making normal academic progress and must accept the consequen ces of a possible delayed graduation date. Only by special petition to the Dean of Students and under the most unusual circumstances may students reduce their academic load to fewer than 12 units. Students may petition to be part time through the last day to drop classes. After that date students may only withdraw from a class and the enrollment status will not change. Courses Each unit of course credit at Occidental College requires a minimum of three hours of student work per week, for every week over the duration of a semester. As such, each four -unit course represents a minimum of 12 hours of involvement per week, and each two -unit course represents a minimum of 6 hours of involvement per week. Students will typically spend a third of this time in direct interaction with faculty, and the remainder of the time will be spent preparing for class. Faculty may choose to set expectations for student involvement differently while maintaining a reasonable approximation of the minimum requirement. Faculty might al so require, or students might choose, to spend more hours than the minimum requirement. This definition holds for all types of courses (e.g., lecture, seminar, independent study, lab, practicum, etc.) regardless of the amount of credit offered. Courses num bered 1 -80 are those in the first -year Cultural Studies component of the Core Program. 100 -level courses are introductory, open to first -year students. 200 -level courses are designed primarily for second -year students. 300 -level courses are intended primar ily for juniors and seniors and 400 -level courses are advanced courses, usually open only to seniors. 500-level courses are intended for graduate students. Courses numbered 500 and above are ordinarily limited to graduate students. However, advanced and sp ecially qualified undergraduates may be permitted to enroll in such courses by special petition to the instructor, the department chair, and the Director of Graduate Studies. In special circumstances, by additional petition to the Director of Graduate Stud ies, credit 17toward the Master of Arts degree may also be granted provided the course is not required to fulfill a Bachelor's degree. Occasionally students seek to repeat a course in which they earned a passing grade. Credit is not awarded for the repeated course; both grades are averaged into the grade average, and both courses and grade appear on the transcript. Changes in course offerings after publication of the catalog for 2011 -2012 will be reflected in the online catalog. Any undergraduate course in wh ich fewer than 10 students are enrolled at the beginning of a semester may be cancelled. Registration Registration procedures are outlined in materials supplied by the Registrar. The Business Office and the Registrar must approve each student's enrollment. Students who clear their registration late will incur a Business Office fee. Registration must be completed within the first week of the semester, or the student may be denied credit for the semester's work. Spring semester registration for freshmen is co nsidered final only upon verification in the Office of the Registrar that these students have met their requirements in the Cultural Studies Program for the preceding semester. Regularly scheduled courses offered for one or two units may be available for r egistration through the seventh week of the semester (mid -term) with faculty approval. There is a two - unit limit for courses added at this time. The Registrar will announce the exact dates for the deadline. Adding, Dropping, and Withdrawing from Classes 1) Adding Classes: Students may add classes during the first week of each semester, with the permission of the instructor. Exact deadline dates are published by the Registrar in the online academic calendar. Students wishing to add a class during this pe riod must file a \"Drop - Add\" form with the Registrar's Office; forms are available from that office and online at the Registrar's web page. They must be signed by the instructor and the student's adviser. Some 1 and 2 unit fractional courses have later de adlines for adding, as noted in the online academic calendar. Students wishing to add a class after its deadline must petition the Registrar and, if approved, pay a late add fee. Students are responsible for verifying in their online records that they have in fact enrolled in and/or added all classes for which they expect to receive credit. 2) Dropping Classes : Students may drop classes without notation on their grade report during the first eight weeks of each semester. The exact Drop deadline is publis hed by the Registrar in the online academic calendar. To drop a class, students must submit a properly completed \"Drop -Add\" form (available in the Registrar's Office and online) to the Registrar in advance of the deadline. Students may not drop first -year CSP courses unless they are withdrawing from the College (see below). Students are responsible for making sure that they have dropped or withdrawn from classes that they are not attending. They will receive a grade of F in any such class not dropped or withdrawn from. 3) Withdrawing from Classes: After the eighth week of each semester, students may no longer withdraw from classes without notation on the grade report. A student unable to complete a class may, however, seek a withdrawal, which results i n a grade of \"W\" (Withdrew) on the grade report. \"W\" is not calculated into the GPA. Students wishing to withdraw from 18classes after the Drop deadline must file a \"Course Withdrawal\" form with the Registrar, available online and in the Registrar's Office . This form must be signed by the instructor and adviser, and must include a brief description of the reason for withdrawal. Students may not withdraw from first -year CSP courses unless they are withdrawing from the College (see below). Withdrawals must occur by the end of the final day of classes; after that deadline students will receive the grade earned by their work in the course. Students should be aware that dropping or withdrawing from classes may put them behind normal progress toward the A.B. de gree, and may have significant consequences for financial aid, major completion, and graduation. Such decisions should be discussed with the academic adviser and, where appropriate, with the Financial Aid office. Course Load (full -time, part -time, and ove rloads) Normally, students are limited to 18 units of enrollment per semester. However, students with at least 32 units and whose overall GPA is at least 3.0 may enroll in up to 20 units on a space - available basis (on or after the first day of classes); th e deadline for adding classes applies. Other students may seek approval of a petition to enroll in an overload submitted to the Registrar; in general, overload petitions from students in their first year at Occidental or with an overall GPA of less than 2. 7 will not be approved. Petitions must be submitted prior to the deadline for adding classes. Undergraduate full -time status is twelve or more units. Part -time status is eleven or fewer units. Graduate full -time status is nine or more units. Study Plans Each student is assigned an academic advisor on the basis of expressed interests, and together with the advisor, plans a program of study. All courses for which the student wishes to register for credit must be entered on the computer -assisted registration system. A student is responsible for every course entered. Students will not be allowed to attend classes or participate in College activities until registration has been completed. After registration, official changes of courses may be made only through official drop/add forms approved by the instructors who teach the courses and by the Registrar. One week is allowed for adding classes; eight weeks are allowed for course drops without transcript notation. Unless a course is officially dropped or withdrawn , a grade of F will be incurred. Independent Study Independent Studies are courses designed for self -reliant and motivated students to pursue intellectual inquiry outside of regularly scheduled course offerings. These are to be supervised by faculty member s, generally involving substantial, close student -faculty interactions. Each course shall be initiated on an individual basis between a student and a faculty member. Enrollment shall be through courses numbered 197, 297 (lower division), 397 (upper divisio n), or 597 (graduate) in the respective department, and must be accompanied by a completed independent study contract. Specifications 1. Advanced planning is essential. There should be some evidence that the student's background is adequate for the proposed s tudy. 2. The independent study contract must be completed, signed and submitted to the Office of the Registrar by the deadline to add deadline of the appropriate semester. 193. Sophomore, junior and senior students may enroll in one independent study per semeste r. Freshmen interested in enrolling in an independent study must complete a petition for special consideration and have it approved. 4. Students are required to have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better. 5. An independent study course cannot be used to satisfy Co re requirements. 6. All independent study courses are two units except those classified under 7 below. Requirements for a two -unit independent study: 1. The contract must include a reading list or equivalent, along with the requirements to be met before a grade can be assigned. 2. The contract requires the signature of the instructor, and the approval of the Student Progress Committee. 3. The course will be graded CR/NC. If used for a major/minor and justified on the Independent Study form, a letter grade may be iss ued. 4. If a major/minor has been declared and the department has accepted the independent study as meeting a requirement within that major/minor, the course will be assigned a letter grade. 5. A course already graded CR/NC may not be used to satisfy major/min or requirements. Petitions for retroactively changing CR/NC grades will not be approved. 7. Four-unit independent study courses are to be taken only for fulfillment of approved major/minor requirements. Requirements for a four -unit independent study: 1. Application for the course must be submitted prior to the end of the previous semester to allow time for approval. 2. The student must have a declared major/minor recorded in the Office of the Registrar prior to enrolling in the independent study. 3. The course must be used within the major/minor to meet a requirement approved by the department. 4. The contract must include a reading list or equivalent, along with the requirements to be met before a grade can be assigned. 5. The contract requires the signature of the instructor and the chair of the department, and the approval of the Student Progress Committee. 6. A four -unit independent study will be assigned a letter grade. No CR/NC grades will be allowed. 8. A maximum of eight units of independent study courses may be applied toward graduation. It is expected that students will satisfy Core, foreign language, and academic major/minor course requirements through regularly scheduled courses. Internships Overview Occidental College offers a variety of internship opportunit ies. These include internships with community groups, public agencies, businesses, and social justice advocacy organizations, among others. The opportunities include course -related internships that provide connections to community organizations, public age ncies, private entities, and non -profit organizations; career -oriented internships offered through the Career Development Center in all occupational areas of interest; summer research internships connected to various programs, such as through the Internati onal Programs Office, the Urban & Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI), the Undergraduate Research Center, the Center for Community -Based Learning, and other College entities; study abroad internships offered through various study abroad programs; and community engagement internships based on long term partnerships that are linked to courses 20and programs supported by the Center for Community -Based Learning, the student Office of Community Engagement, and UEPI. Internships are offered in Los Angeles, throug hout the U.S., and in countries abroad such as China. Internships represent a crucial component of Occidental College's mission and vision associated with community engagement, collaborative relationships, critical thinking and reflection, participant obse rvation, skill development, and career discernment and training. Each of those opportunities are described below. Academic (practicums, etc.) Opportunities Several courses and practicums provide valuable internship experiences or fieldwork experience. Acad emic Practicums offer four units of credit provide faculty mentorship and allow students to thoroughly integrate applied learning in organizations of interest within the context of a given course. For example, the Urban and Environmental Policy Department offers a course on \"Community Organizing\" that includes an internship requirement with a community - based organization working on a key community objective. The Politics Department offers a course providing internships and linkages with Public Interest Law firms; Psychology offers fieldwork for psychology and social services -bound students, and several Departments have come together to create a Public Health cluster and create courses that include internships with places like health clinics and with such par tners as promotoras (community health workers). These academic/course based opportunities, in turn, can lead to summer internships as well as continuing ties (and even future employment) with the partner community groups and organizations. Career Explorati on Opportunities The Career Development Center (CDC) supports internships that integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom and applied in a professional setting. Internship opportunities are available in all occupational sectors and may or may not directly correlate with a student's major. Internships are an opportunity to create learning experiences for the student by providing exposure in a career field or job function of interest. Through diverse occupational exposure, students can explore va rious careers, thereby greatly enhancing their progression towards career discernment while building transferable skills toward graduate and employment opportunities. Students can secure nonprofit, governmental and for -profit opportunities. Additionally, the CDC sponsors a broad -based, funded internship program in Los Angeles and Portland, that places students in full -time professional internships for ten weeks during the summer. Through the CDC, Occidental College offers both a two unit (INT 200) and a ze ro unit (INT 100) option for students. The CDC coordinates both courses and supports students during their INT 200 and INT 100 internship (see Career Center INT Program below). Community -Based Learning (CBL) Opportunities Internships supported by the Center for Community Based Learning (CCBL) allow students to continue work initiated as part of a community based learning and/or research course. Internships are defined in partnership with community partners, faculty, and the CCBL. A CCBL internship allo ws students to continue to develop skills in community engagement, community based research, and other professional skills, while providing ongoing support for projects that cannot be completed within a single semester. Depending on the focus and structure of the internship, a student can earn 2 units through the CDC internship program and receive a stipend from the CCBL. CCBL also supports community engaged courses through its Education in Action (EIA) program where students receive a stipend to support fa culty in facilitating the community aspect of the course. 21International Opportunities Over half of Occidental's four -dozen semester and summer study abroad programs include opportunities for internships or community -engaged projects. Participants test theo ries, concepts, and competencies encountered on campus in dynamic intercultural settings and set a course for global citizenship. Most earn academic credit and some tackle significant research projects. From Amsterdam to Rabat, from Cape Town to Lima, from Tokyo to Beijing, participants expect to grow in their capacity to lead in a complex world, contribute to solving transnational problems , compete in the global workforce, and thrive in intercultural situations. Students consider community engagement abroa d among their most power learning experiences. Career Development Center INT Internship Program Internships for credit must be educational experiential opportunities that meet the criteria established by Occidental and approved by the Career Development Ce nter (CDC). Students must be able to complete a minimum of 80 hours per semester of experiential learning in order to enroll in either internship course and receive credit (INT 100 or INT 200). To meet this requirement, students are advised to register wit hin the first two weeks of the semester; however, internships may be approved until mid -semester. Students must register in the appropriate internship course (see below) by listed deadlines. For either course option, it is required that students have sopho more, junior, and senior and at least part -time, registered in at least six units, status. Additionally, students must have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better at the time of application for internship credit. Only CR/NC grades will be given for internships. Students are only allowed to enroll in one internship course per semester. All students enrolled in an internship, whether for two units or zero units, must complete a reflective essay and internship evaluation, as instructed by the CDC. The CDC will also request two performance evaluations (mid and final) from the listed on -site internship supervisor. Students are obliged to notify CDC, faculty supervisor, and on -site supervisor before dropping or withdrawing from an internship as well as submit the appro priate paperwork to the Office of the Registrar. Retroactive enrollment will not be approved and credit not be issued even in cases where an internship has been completed. Students enrolling in an internship course for the summer will be charged reduced fe es for units. See the summer website or consult the CDC, the Office of the Registrar, or the Student Accounts Office for fee information. On-Campus Internship Policy In an interest to provide increased opportunities for students studying in Los Angeles, th e institution is authorizing on -campus internship opportunities that would allow students to intern on campus and receive credit through the Career Development Center Internship Program (INT100 and INT200). On -campus internships are distinct from the inst itution Work Study Program and various on -campus leadership programs by providing project based exposure in professional occupational areas, whereby the primary goal is that the student intern is the beneficiary of professional learning. On -campus departm ents wishing to create internship positions or willing to host a student intern by student request, must work with the CDC to assure that they are developing an internship opportunity that ascribes to the department's criteria. To assure student learning o f the highest caliber, the department's philosophy is to set on-campus internships to the same rigorous standard ascribed to internships available in for - profit and public service organizations. For a complete outline of requirements and policy surrounding on-campus opportunities, please contact the Internship Coordinator at the Career Development Center. The College recognizes two categories of internships: 221. Two -unit internship (INT 200) - The maximum credits awarded for an internship will be two units. The total units earned through internships may not exceed four units (students may take additional internships for zero units, which will appear on the transcript). In addition to the criteria listed above, the student must secure an on -campus faculty supe rvisor to assign, supervise, and approve the academic component of the internship. The faculty supervisor must be a full -time faculty member on -campus. The reflective component and performance evaluations, coordinated by the CDC, are shared with the facult y supervisor and may be used at the discretion of the faculty supervisor when grading the internship. 2. Zero -unit internship (INT 100) - This course is offered for no credits, but the internship will be listed on the student's transcript. Course is coordi nated and monitored by the CDC. Student and internship must meet the criteria listed above. Students failing to participate in the reflective component coordinated by the CDC will not receive credit for their internship. Withdrawal from the College, Leave of Absence, and Readmission to the College 1) Withdrawal from the College: A student experiencing severe academic or personal disruptions during a semester may petition to withdraw from all course work and receive grades of \"W\" in their classes. Student s considering Withdrawal from the College should discuss their situations with academic advisers, the Dean of Students' Office, and/or the Associate Dean of the College for Student Issues. A petition for Withdrawal must be filed with the Registrar's Offic e before the final day of classes in the semester of withdrawal. The withdrawing student must complete a \"leave/withdrawal\" form (available in the Registrar's Office and online) indicating that they have made appropriate arrangements with the offices of Student Accounts, Financial Aid, and Residential Education and Housing Services. Students on Academic Probation who petition for Withdrawal from the College may be required by the Student Progress Committee to spend an additional semester's Leave of Absence away from Occidental, take college courses elsewhere, and apply for readmission to the College (see below). 2) Leave of Absence: Students may apply to take an approved Leave of Absence from Occidental College for academic or personal reasons. The Leave may be approved for one or more semesters, and it must be taken beginning in the semester immediately following its approval. Students considering a Leave of Absence should consult with their academic advisers, the Dean of Students' Office, and/or the As sociate Dean of the College for Student Issues. Application for a Leave of Absence should be made directly to the Registrar's Office, which may consult with the Student Progress Committee before approval. If a Leave is approved, the student must complete a \"Leave/Withdrawal\" form (available in the Registrar's Office and online) indicating that they have made appropriate arrangements with the offices of Student Accounts, Financial Aid, and Residential Education and Housing Services. 3) Readmission to the College Following Withdrawal or Leave of Absence : Students who have petitioned successfully to take a Leave of Absence, or who have been required to take a Leave of Absence following Withdrawal from the College while on Academic Probation, or who have bee n subjected to Academic Suspension (see \"Academic Probation, Suspension, and Dismissal\"), must submit a \"Returning Student Application\" at least thirty days prior to their intended return to Occidental, outlining (among other things) what they have done du ring their absence from the College and a detailed plan for academic success upon return. This form is available in the Registrar's Office and online, and will be evaluated for approval by the Student Progress Committee. Students planning such a return a re urged to consult in advance with the Grades 23Scholastic standing of both undergraduate and graduate students is indicated by the following grades: A, excellent; B, good; C, satisfactory; D, barely passing; F, failure. A grade of Incomplete (INC) may be used for an undergraduate and Deferred (DEF) for a graduate under conditions outlined below. A grade of Course in Progress (CIP) is given to indicate that a course is still in progress at the end of the semester. A W grade indicates the student withdrew from a course after the eighth week of the semester or has withdrawn from the College at any time during the semester. CR/NC grades, used in certain courses, are described below. When a charge of academic misconduct is pending, a grade of NR is given; it wil l be changed to a letter grade when the pending judicial or other matter is resolved. An Incomplete (INC) indicates that although the work completed is of passing grade, some portion of the course remains unfinished because of illness or for some other rea son over which the student had no control. A student must petition prior to the last day of classes to receive an INC grade. Except under extraordinary circumstances, any student who has two Incompletes on the record from previous semesters cannot petition for an additional one. This grade, which must be approved by a dean or an associate dean, will be removed and replaced by a letter grade upon completion of the course requirements with a notation on the official transcript. The maximum time allowed for co mpletion of course requirements, whether the student is enrolled or not, is one year from the date the Incomplete was incurred. At that time the grade will revert to the default grade submitted by the professor. A graduate student's grade may be Deferred ( DEF) by the instructor who specifies the time within which the coursework is to be completed, the limit not to exceed one year except in the case of M.A. theses. If not removed within the specified time, a Deferred grade generally becomes an F. Instructors file written statements of reasons for assigning Incompletes and Failures with their grade reports at the end of each semester. In the case of an Incomplete, the statement indicates the work necessary to attain a final grade. A copy of this statement is g iven to the student. Academic Ethics Students are responsible for meeting a high ethical standard in their academic work. Academic misconduct occurs when a student misrepresents others work as her/his own or otherwise behaves so as to advantage unfairly he r/himself or another student academically. Any member of the Occidental community who believes that a student has engaged in misconduct of academic work should promptly report the possible misconduct to the Judicial Examiner. The Judicial Examiner is a dis interested third party who will ensure that procedures designed to respect the rights and responsibilities of all involved are followed. Key concepts, definitions, roles, procedures, and sanctions that constitute the policy by which charges of academic misconduct are handled can be found in the Student Handbook. Grade Appeal Policy This policy refers to procedures related to the dispute of a final grade in a class. Individual grades within a class may not be appealed and grade changes for additional work done after the semester has ended will not be approved. For grade disputes involving a claim of harassment or discrimination on the basis of disability, instead follow the Disability Services grievance policy described here. The presumption at Occidental i s that the instructor alone is qualified to evaluate the academic work of students in his or her courses and to assign grades to that work. Consequently, grades 24are not normally subject to appeal. However, when a student believes that a particular grade was assigned unfairly or in error, the student may appeal the assigned grade as follows: 1. A final grade in a class must be appealed by the end of the fourth week of the semester following the semester in which the grade was issued. No grade may be appealed af ter this period. Students are responsible for reviewing their grades at the conclusion of a semester. 2. The first step in the appeal is for the student to discuss any concerns with the instructor. 3. If discussion between the faculty member and the student do es not resolve the matter, the student should meet with the department/program chair and provide the chair with a written explanation of the student's concern. The chair will attempt to solve the problem. If the instructor is also the chair, the student sh ould meet with the Associate Dean responsible for the department within which the course was given. 4. If the department/program chair is unable to resolve the situation, the student may present the appeal to the Associate Dean responsible for the department within which the course was given. The Associate Dean will bring the matter to the Student Progress Committee, which will review the appeal and make a recommendation to the Associate Dean. The Associate Dean, who will confer with both the student and the instructor, shall review the appeal and the recommendation by the Student Progress Committee. The Associate Dean shall determine the final resolution. No further appeals are possible after the Associate Dean has issued a decision. Credit/No Credit With th e exception of required courses, including foreign language, Core, and major and minor requirements, a student may take a course on a Credit/No Credit basis with the consent of the instructor. To do so, a contract for completion of work to be graded CR/ NC must be filed with the Registrar not later than the eighth week of the semester, and the decision may not be changed after the CR/NC form is submitted to the Registrar's office. No forms will be accepted after the deadline. If the major or minor is change d to one that requires a course that has already been taken on a Credit/No Credit basis, the student may be required to take an examination in that course for a grade. A grade of Credit (CR) is to be regarded as the equivalent of a C or better only. Grades of CR or NC are excluded from grade averaging. Physical Activities Credit Students are awarded one unit of credit for each physical activities course taken, up to a maximum of four units toward graduation. Only one physical activities unit per semester wi ll be allowed. Students may enroll in additional physical activities courses for zero units. Auditors Any regularly registered full -time student may audit one four -unit course each semester, without fee, subject to permission of the instructor. All petitio ns to audit must be filed by the add deadline for the appropriate semester. Courses that require extensive student participation (such as studio art) may not be audited. Students not registered for credit may attend courses as auditors, subject to formal p ermission through forms available in the Office of the Registrar and upon payment of Auditors' fees. An auditor may not participate actively in course work or 25take final examinations and therefore does not receive credit. A grade of Audit is entered on the permanent record if requested by the student and if requirements specified by the instructor are met. Dean's List Full-time students who complete at least sixteen units for a letter grade in a fall or spring semester and have a semester GPA of 3.5 or bett er are eligible for the Dean's List. This honor will appear on the student's transcript for each qualifying semester. Class Attendance Regular class attendance is expected of all students. Although the recording of attendance is at the discretion of the in structor, students may not enroll for two courses that have any overlap in time. Faculty have the option of administratively dropping from courses any students who fail to attend the first two hours of any class in a given semester. Students are responsibl e for arranging with the instructor the manner in which work, missed through absence, will be made up. Scholarship Requirements A grade point average of 2.0 in all work taken at Occidental and in the major and minor, if any, is required for graduation. The College uses two criteria to establish the scholastic status of a student: (1) that based on the 2.0 average and (2) that based on the number of courses successfully completed with respect to the total number of courses taken (normal academic progress). Grade point average (GPA) is computed on a four -point scale: A equals 4.0, A - equals 3.7, B+ equals 3.3, B equals 3.0, B - equals 2.7, C+ equals 2.3, C equals 2.0, C - equals 1.7, D+ equals 1.3, D equals 1.0, and F equals 0.0. Courses graded CR/NC are not com puted in the grade point average. Academic Probation, Suspension, and Dismissal Occidental College requires 128 units of coursework completed with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better for graduation with the A.B. degree. At the close of each semester, the Student Progress Committee reviews the records of all students whose semester or cumulative GPA is below 2.0 or who have received at least one grade of F for the semester. Students whose semester or cumulative GPA is below 2.0 will normally be placed on academic probation for the following semester. (First -year students finishing their first semester \u2014not transfers \u2014will be placed on probation if the GPA is below 1.85.) In addition, some students with GPAs at or slightly above 2.0 may be placed on probatio n if they appear to be making unsatisfactory progress toward meeting graduation requirements (through withdrawals, Incompletes, dropped courses, etc.). The purpose of academic probation is not punitive; its intention is to alert students to developing pro blems that may jeopardize their eventual graduation from Occidental, and to urge them to take immediate action to address these problems. Students placed on academic probation will receive a letter announcing this status, with requirements that they consu lt with the Dean of Students' Office and their academic advisers to devise a plan for academic success and a return to good academic standing. 26Students who achieve a GPA below 2.0 for two consecutive semesters are subject to suspension . In making this det ermination the Student Progress Committee will consider not only the GPA but also progress toward the degree, patterns of academic improvement or deterioration, and special circumstances. Suspension is intended to provide students with serious difficultie s with time to rethink their academic strategies and relation to Occidental College, with the purpose of having them either return for a successful academic career at Occidental or develop a more successful educational plan elsewhere. It may be assigned f or one semester or two immediately following the Committee's decision. Suspended students are generally required to do coursework at another institution and complete it satisfactorily before readmission to Occidental, which must occur following the guidel ines for readmission after a Withdrawal from the College or Leave of Absence (see \"Withdrawal from the College, Leave of Absence, and Readmission to the College\"). Specific requirements for suspended students are set forth in letters sent to them notifyin g them of the Committee's decision. Students who achieve a GPA of 0.75 or below in any semester will normally be automatically suspended for the following semester. Students earning GPAs below 2.0 for three consecutive semesters will normally be automatic ally suspended for one year. When the Student Progress Committee determines that a student's chances of success at Occidental are minimal or none, it may impose Dismissal. Dismissed students are not given the option of applying for readmission. Examination s The decision is left to the instructor whether a final examination is held in a course at the close of the semester. Final examinations may not be administered before the scheduled examination period; take -home examinations may not be issued to students before the final day of classes as published in the College Catalog. With the exception of laboratory practica, no test or examination may be administered in the final week of classes. The time of an examination can be changed within the examination period if there is unanimous agreement from students in the class and if an appropriate room can be found by the Registrar. Examination times are posted on the Final Examination Schedule with the exception of courses offered at an irregular time. Comprehensive E xaminations Comprehensive examinations, required of all seniors for graduation, have two central and related objectives: 1. To provide an opportunity for senior students to synthesize the essential concepts, content, and methods of their academic field, and, during the course of their review, to establish central relationships among the materials covered in separate courses. 2. To provide an opportunity for students to demonstrate competence in their field by applying their knowledge to central relational proble ms, questions, or topics. Since no single type of examination experience will serve all academic fields with equal effectiveness, departments have freedom to set either a single examination or a related group of synthesizing experiences as constituting th e Comprehensive. Related experiences may include, but are not limited to, seminars, theses, creative projects, field research projects, and oral examinations. Any collective experience that is evaluated by the department rather than an individual instructo r, and that in the opinion of the department works toward the objectives 27and embodies the characteristics described above, may be construed as meeting the intent of the Comprehensive requirement. All departments, regardless of the nature and form of the co mprehensive examination, are required to provide opportunities for students who fail their comprehensives to retake them before the end of the academic year in order that they might be given another chance to satisfy departmental expectations before gradua tion. Departments are granted the autonomy to determine the date and time of the initial examination as well as the re - taking of the examination. Departments have the right to waive course final examinations during a semester in which the central portion of the comprehensive is administered. In place of a letter grade for evaluating comprehensive examinations, a three -category system is used: Pass with Distinction, Pass, and Fail. Graduation Ceremony Participation Requirements Normally students are require d to meet all requirements for the degree to participate in the commencement ceremony. The college will accept petitions to participate in the ceremony if a student has met all core requirements, all major requirements, successfully completed senior compre hensives and has completed a minimum of 124 units. Students receiving a failing grade required for Core, major or comps at the end of the second semester of the senior year will not be eligible to participate in that year ceremony. Course Credit by Examina tion In order to stimulate a maximum amount of effort and progress in students of high scholastic achievement and capacity for self -directed study, the faculty provides an opportunity to pass by examination many of the courses within the curriculum. It is recognized that not all courses (e.g., independent study) nor all subject matter fields lend themselves equally to such an approach. Students seeking to take specified courses through examination are required to consult with departments and instructors for information as to content and coverage. Credit by Examination may only be undertaken by consent of the instructor in the course. In courses where multiple sections are scheduled during a semester or in different semesters, the approval of the departmental chair is also required. Students seeking Credit by Examination should secure the necessary petition forms from the Registrar. A student may take one course by examination in any semester either as a substitute for a course or in addition to a normal load, which if passed would count toward the total number of units required for graduation, provided the following standards are met. 1. The student must have received no grade lower than a B in the two previous semesters at Occidental. 2. Preparation for the examin ation must be undertaken by the student independently and individually, as directed by the instructor involved, and the student will not be allowed to prepare for the examination by class attendance as an auditor in the regular course. 3. A student may not a pply for Credit by Examination in a course in which previously enrolled for all or part of a semester, or in a course audited in a previous semester. 4. After a date is set for the examination, the student cannot be excused from taking the examination at tha t time except for reasons of health or grave emergency. Failure to 28take the examination will result in a recorded grade of F. With the consent of the instructor, Credit by Examination may be taken on a Credit/No Credit basis. 5. A grade must be submitted to the Registrar for recording as Credit by Examination, which becomes part of the student's permanent record. 6. A fee for Credit by Examination must be paid at the time of filing the petition. In a semester when the student is enrolled for fewer than 11 units , the fee may be waived. See here for a schedule of fees. Course Exemption by Examination It is possible for a student to be exempted from a course by examination, with consent of the instructor. No course credit is earned; however, notice of the exemptio n is entered on the permanent record to certify that the student has fulfilled a general college requirement or a course prerequisite. Students who wish to be exempted from a Core course by examination must make arrangements with the Core Office prior to t he semester in which the course is offered. The instructor has the privilege of recording a grade of Credit/No Credit rather than a letter grade. A nominal fee is charged. Appropriate forms are available from the Registrar. Transfer Credit Transfer courses require prior approval by the department offering similar courses at Occidental College, and by the student's advisor. Transfer courses taken during the fall and spring semesters cannot be courses that are currently offered at Occidental and cannot be used to satisfy a Core requirement. Students desiring to take courses at another college while attending Oxy cannot exceed the maximum allowable units per semester (normally 18, or 20 if the student's GPA is 3.0 or better) combined. Normally, no transfer cour ses will be allowed in the second semester of the student's senior year. A \"Transfer Credit Petition\" is available in the Registrar's Office. A minimum grade of \"C\" or higher is required for transfer. The College will not accept transfer credit taken by e xamination from another institution. Courses taken in the fall and spring on non -approved Study Abroad programs will not be accepted. Transfer units from a semester system will be equal to the number of units taken at the institution where the courses were taken. Transfer units from a quarter system will be multiplied by .66 to convert to the semester system used at Occidental College. Students who participate in Off -Campus Study programs independently during a leave of absence from the College are ineligible for College financial aid or scholarships and no credit will be transferred toward the Occidental degree. Advanced Placement Credit and International Baccalaureate Course Credit Freshmen may be granted credit at the time of entrance for subjects in which they have completed College Entrance Examination Board Advanced Placement examinations with scores of 4 or 5 or International Baccal aureate scores of 6 or 7 in Higher Level (HL) courses only. This credit and resulting placement is subject to review by the appropriate departments. A student completing an approved Advanced Placement examination in most subjects with a score of 4 or 5 wil l receive four units of credit toward the degree. These examinations may not be used to fulfill Core requirements. Not all Graduate and Professional programs accept AP credit of college courses. 29An applicant who has completed courses at an accredited colle ge prior to graduation from high school also may request consideration for appropriate recognition of credit or placement. Credit earned either through Advanced Placement examinations, International Baccalaureate courses, or through college courses may mak e it possible for a student to enter advanced courses and also gain a wider opportunity for choice of electives in the undergraduate program. In general, each student will be expected to carry a normal load during the period of attendance at Occidental. Summer Study at Other Institutions Work taken elsewhere during the summer may be accepted for credit toward a degree from Occidental, subject to advance approval from the chair of the department with which the course would be identified, the student's adviso r, and the Registrar. It is also possible through petition to the Registrar to have summer study elsewhere accepted without credit to fulfill prerequisites or general college requirements. A minimum grade of C - is required for transfer. Occidental will acc ept credits from a regionally acceredited college or university only. Classification of Students The class in which a student is to be ranked is determined as follows: Freshman: The meeting in full of all entrance requirements; Sophomore: The satisfactory completion of 32 units of credit; Junior: The satisfactory completion of 64 units of credit; Senior: The satisfactory completion of 96 units of credit. Writing Program Occidental expects its graduates to demonstrate superior writing ability. The Writing Program prepares students in all disciplines to write effectively: to develop complex concepts clearly and fully, to organize essays and reports logically, and to maintain the conventions o f standard written English. This standard of writing performance is upheld in all College courses. To achieve this goal, the College emphasizes expository writing and research skills in the Core curriculum, in courses emphasizing the methodologies of vario us disciplines, and in the composition courses in the English Writing Department. The foundation of the College's Writing Program is the first -year instructional program in Cultural Studies. First -year students take year -long, sequenced seminars that help students develop college -level writing strategies in rich disciplinary content to further their knowledge and communication of the topics they study. In addition to the Core curriculum in writing, the English Writing Department offers courses to students w ho want to concentrate on the most effective strategies for writing in and out of the academy. These include English Writing 201, a class that centers on the processes and skills necessary to fine writing, and the College's advanced writing courses, Englis h Writing 301 and 401. Any student seeking individual instruction in writing or assistance with a particular paper will find support and advice available at the Center for Academic Excellence (CAE), where English Writing professors work as writing speciali sts, and where student writing advisors collaborate with student writers. The Director of Writing Programs will gladly advise students of all resources available for developing their writing ability. Proficiency in writing is a requirement for graduation. Students meet this requirement in two stages, the first of which is passing the first -stage Writing Proficiency evaluation in the 30Cultural Studies Program. Completion of the Cultural Studies courses does not by itself satisfy the writing requirement. An ad ditional measure of writing proficiency is required; most recently this measure has been participation in a shared intellectual experience with required reading. Frosh are expected to pass the writing exercise that culminates the experience. Those who do not pass the Cultural Studies Writing evaluations will be asked to pass with a C or better a course in the Department of English Writing (201) or another writing course designated by the Director of Writing Programs in conjunction with the Director of the C ore Program. The second stage of the requirement will be met in the student's major department. Each department at the College has specified its own writing requirement in the major; students should consult their department chair. FIRST STAGE WRITING REQUI REMENT FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS In order to fulfill the First Stage Writing Requirement, transfer students must: 1) have completed two writing courses (minimum six semester units) with specific writing instruction (not simply a course offered in an English de partment, nor any literature, creative writing, \"writing intensive\" courses) prior to transferring to the College; any courses not approved by the Registrar upon entrance must be appealed through the Writing Program; or 2) complete English Writing 201 or 4 01 after entering the College; or 3) submit a petition and portfolio before the senior year. Students must contact Writing Programs at the CAE to receive instructions. Each student should receive, at the time of declaring the major, a description of the pa rticular Second Stage Writing Requirement for the department. However, an overview of the department options follows: FIRST STAGE WRITING PORTFOLIO OPTION FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS Generally compiled over the sophomore and junior years, three papers are drawn from departmental work. Revisions are encouraged or may be required. One paper may be a retrospective analysis of the student's writing. A reflective analysis of the portfolio may be required in addition to the three papers. Portfolios are read by more tha n one faculty member. The requirements for submitting a portfolio are available in the Writing Programs Office. The Writing Programs Department and the Director of the Core Program make every effort to work with an individual student's portfolio submission s. SECOND STAGE WRITING Writing-Intensive Seminars: Most departments require a single junior -year seminar that includes a considerable amount of writing. The final product is read by more than one professor. A grade of B - is usually required, depending on the department. Fulfillment of the requirement is met through additional coursework when the grade in the seminar is not satisfactory. Writing Across the Major: Some departments have deemed all upper -division courses writing intensive. A few departments re quire more than one writing -intensive course in order to complete the Second Stage Writing Requirement in the major. An average grade of B - is generally required, depending on the department. See department chair for specifics. Creative Writing: It is reco mmended that students interested in creative writing choose a major or minor that will provide them background in literature. Of special interest is the Writing Emphasis in the English and Comparative Literary Studies department. The College believes that it is essential to understand a tradition of literature and authorship in 31order to become a writer oneself. There are also offerings in various creative arts at the College that would support such an emphasis. Students interested in journalistic writing should consider the importance of intellectual background and training available in the different programs in the humanities, arts, sciences, and social sciences. Students also have the opportunity to take independent studies in creative writing, and in spec ial cases, to elect Senior Year Honors Projects in writing. Specific courses that address creative writing include ECLS 380 (Creative Writing), English Writing 286 (Principles of Journalism II), English Writing 301 (Creative Non -Fiction), English Writing 4 01 (Writing Across the Curriculum), French 343 (Theory and Practice of Translation), Theater 201 (Alternative Voices in American Theater), and Theater 380 (Playwriting). Writers also are invited regularly to ECLS creative writing classes and to the Intercu ltural Community Center, events that are open to the campus at large. Additionally, every other year a Remsen Bird Visiting Artist gives classes and/or workshops on campus. In the last few years the ECLS Department has sponsored several literary Honors Projects in writing. Specific courses that address creative writing include ECLS 380 (Creative Writing), English Writing 286 (Principles of Journalism II), English Writing 301 (Creative Non - Fiction), English Writing 401 (Writing Across the Curriculum), French 343 (Theory and Practice of Translation), Theater 201 (Alternative Voices in American Theater), and Theater 380 (Playwriting). Writers also are invited regularly to ECLS creative writing classes and to the Intercultural Community Center, events that are o pen to the campus at large. Additionally, every other year a Remsen Bird Visiting Artist gives classes and/or workshops on campus. In the last few years the ECLS Department has sponsored several literary conferences with invited guests; the department also sponsors a literary contest with prizes for fiction, poetry, and short drama, and provides support for The Occidental Review, a literary magazine edited by students. Students also have the opportunity to work on the student newspaper, to join literary clu bs, and to elect an internship course under the direction of a faculty member. Internships, arranged with the help of the Career Development Center, have included work at the Mark Taper Forum, the Getty Art Institute, the Huntington Library, the Minority T raining Institute, and Dreamworks. Students at Occidental also have the opportunity to hear distinguished writers on campus; guests in the last several years have included Alice Walker, bell hooks, Walter Mosley, Toni Morrison, Joyce Carol Oates, Sandra Ci sneros, Amy Tan, Anna Deavere Smith, Maya Angelou, and Gish jen. The Los Angeles area offers opportunities to hear many other writers at Vroman Bookstore, Beyond Baroque, Skylight Books, and Dawson Books, among others. Advising Occidental students have two sources of general information and counsel about the curriculum: the Advising Center, which works closely with students during their first two years at Oxy, and a faculty advisor, assi gned to each new student when they first arrive on campus. Faculty advisors act as an individual resource until the student declares a major (by the middle of the second semester of their sophomore year) and obtains a departmental advisor. Although its foc us is on first - and second -year students, the Advising Center is available to all students on a five -day-per-week, year -round basis. The Advising Center helps students keep track of their Core requirements, offers general information about registration and concrete information about majors, minors, and College 32policies and procedures. The Advising Center also helps students connect with faculty members by making appointments and by identifying the appropriate faculty for specific questions. Faculty advisors help students understand their intended major and may also help them identify the appropriate campus resources for further help. As student interests change, faculty contacts can be changed by the student at any time. Students are encouraged and expected to seek faculty counsel regularly Other advising Opportunities National Awards - Fellowships and Scholarships . First year students are encouraged to meet with the assistant director of National awards for one -on-one advising session to explore opportunities available to them early in their academic career. The Office of Pre -Health Advising at Occidental College pr ovides information and in -depth advisement to students and alumni who are interested in matriculating to professional graduate programs in health sciences. Special Programs International Programs International Programs endeavors to advance Occidental's strategic goal \u2014to prepare \"citizens of the world\" skilled at negotiating its complexities, eclectic in their interests and tastes. Occidental recognizes the important role of international experience in a liberal arts and sciences education and as a key component in preparing undergraduates for successful and satisfying participation in today's interdependent world. International students bring diversity of perspectives to our campus. Academ ic experience abroad challenges undergraduate scholars to think beyond the cultural constructs implicit in their disciplines and socialization. Through ongoing assessment of student learning outcomes, IPO documents how exchanges \u2014 both on and off campus \u2014deve lop cross -cultural communication and analytic skills; a global perspective; and polished language proficiency, sharpened intellect, and broadened imagination. All study abroad during the academic year or over the summer must be approved by Occidental's In ternational Programs Office, linked here . Generally eligibility includes good academic and conduct standing and a 3.0 gpa. Programs may have additional eligibility or pre- requisites. Credits earned abroad during fall or spring semester are considered in-residence Occidental credits and therefore count in the GPA and honors calculations. Summer study abroad is transfer credit. College Financial Aid transfers to Fall and Spring semester study abroad, but not summer study abroad. 33Combined Plans in Liberal Arts and Engineering Combined Plans in Liberal Arts and Engineering Liaison and Advisor for Phys ical Sequence Professor Schramm (Physics) Advisor for Computer Science Sequence Professor Lengyel (Mathematics) Professor Craney (Chemistry) Occidental College cooperates with the California Institute of Technology and the School of Engineering of Columbi a University in several programs of engineering education based on a broad foundation in the liberal arts. These combined plans provide qualified students with an excellent liberal arts background and advanced -level entrance into either of two outstanding engineering schools. The programs are designed specifically for superior students who have strong preparation in English writing skills, mathematics, and science. The curriculum offers considerable freedom of choice of an eventual major. Students who, by the end of the first two years, find their interests developing in fields outside of science or technology, may still choose most nonscience majors in the College and graduate after the usual additional two years of course work. Similar options also exist t hrough the junior year for choosing majors in mathematics or most other sciences without loss of time. Thus, in contrast to many engineering programs, students choosing the combined plans do not commit themselves in the first year exclusively to an enginee ring major. This flexibility is particularly advantageous to capable students whose abilities and interests span many fields. The 3/2 Combined Plan Program requires completion of three years of work in the liberal arts and sciences at Occidental followed b y two years of regular session work at Caltech, or the School of Engineering of Columbia University. This leads to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the Combined Plan from Occidental and the degree of Bachelor of Science in the selected field of engineerin g from either Caltech or Columbia. Students interested in the 3/2 program gain entrance into the engineering school through a strong academic record at Occidental and a recommendation by the Occidental liaison officer on behalf of the faculty. At least a 3.5 grade point average, both in science/mathematics and overall, is required. Those seeking entrance to Caltech must also receive approval from the Caltech Office of Admission. Students entering the programs at Occidental should have received excellent gr ades in high school English (including writing experience), mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Four years of high school mathematics are required, including trigonometry and a course often called Introductory Analysis (or Pre -Calculus). Students wishing to enter these programs should apply directly to Occidental. Course Requirements for the Combined Plans The program of studies for the first three years consists of all of the required courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts as outlined. Unless o therwise exempted, students must begin Mathematics 110 or 114 and either Physics 106, Chemistry 120, or Chemistry 130 (depending 34on the sequence chosen) in the freshman year. All Occidental requirements must be met by spring semester of the junior year. MAJOR: Students must complete one or two years of physics, two years of mathematics, and one year of chemistry. The three sequences will require additional courses. See the sequence advisor for details. The Occidental comprehensive examination is waived for 3/2 Combined Plan students. Majors in the Combined Plans: The following is a partial list of the fields currently offered at one or both of the engineering institutions. Physical Sequence Aeronautics Applied Geophysics Applied Mathematics (3/2 only) Applied Physics Biomechanics Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering Communications and Control Computer Engineering Design Engineering Electrical Engineering Electronic Circuits Engineering Mechanics Fluids Engineering and Jet Propulsion Industrial Engin eering Nuclear Engineering Operations Research Quantum Electronics Solid State Electronics Chemical Sequence Applied Chemistry (4/2 only) Bioengineering Chemical Engineering Mineral Engineering Physical or Chemical Sequence Environmental Engineering Materi als Science Metallurgical Engineering Mining Engineering Solid State Science (4/2 only) Computer Science Sequence Computer Science Operations Research Industrial Engineering 35 Exchange P rogram with the California Institute of Technology An exchange program between Occidental and Caltech permits full -time students at either school to receive credit for courses taken at the other institution during the fall or spring semesters but not durin g the summer. The option does not apply to courses that are equivalent to those offered by the home institution, but is designed to enlarge the range of course offerings a student may take. Thus, Occidental students may enroll in such courses as applied science, astronomy, or engineering. A student in the exchange program must obtain prior approval from his or her advisor, the instructor of the course, and the Occidental and Caltech registrars. The program is usually not open to freshmen. Additional tuition payments are not required, but the student may have to pay special fees in connection with certain laboratory courses. At the completion of an exchange course, appropriate information is recorded on the student's Occidental transcript. Exchange Program with the Art Center College of Design Full-time students at Occidental and Art Center may receive credit for courses taken at the other institution during the fall or spring semesters but not during the summer, with the permission of both institutions. The program is designed for art majors and is not open to first - year students. A student in this exchange program must obtain prior approval from the chair of the Department of Art History an d the Visual Arts at Occidental, his or her advisor, the instructor of the course, and the Occidental and Art Center registrars. Additional tuition payments are not required, but there may be special laboratory fees. At the completion of an exchange course , appropriate information is recorded on the student's Occidental transcript. Cooperative Arrangement: Columbia University School of Law The Columbia School of Law may admit Occidental students upon completion of their junior year to its Accelerated Interdisciplinary Program in Legal Education, leading to the potential completion of the Bachelor of Arts degree from Occidental and Doctor of Jurisprudence from Columbia at the end of six years. The program is highly competitive in terms of both grade point average and LSAT scores. Contact the Career Development Center for details. Cooperative Arrangement with the Keck Graduate Institute In collaboration with the Keck Graduate Institute, students interested in biotechnology may qualify for admission to the Master's in Bioscience Program. Students in the program will complete th e four -year Bachelor of Arts degree in biochemistry at Occidental including specified courses for one of three tracks - computational biology, 36bioengineering, or biosystems - in preparation for study at KGI toward the Master's in Bioscience. Students with at least a 3.2 GPA in their required biochemistry classes will be guaranteed admission to the KGI master's program immediately following their graduation. National Awards - Fellowships & Scholarships The Office of National Awards advises students and alumni interested in pursuing national scholarships and fellowship opportunities. We inform, recruit, counsel and prepare Occidental College candidates in their pursuit of highly competitive and prestigious academic opportunities. First year students are encourage to meet with the Assistant Director of National Awards for one -on-one advising sessions to explore opportunities available to them early in their academic career. Students and alu mni applying for these awards should demonstrate: strong academic achievement outstanding leadership roles involvement in their civic engagement participation in research participation in internships alignment with specific eligibility criteria for in dividual awards The office works collaboratively with faculty advisors, faculty mentors and the Faculty National Awards Committee to introduce students and alumni to a range of national and international opportunities including: fellowships, scholarships, post -graduate study, internships, and research positions at highly esteemed institutions. We offer workshops on writing a personal statement and a research proposal. Information meetings are held on individual awards to inform students and alumni of the awards opportunities available to them. We work in partnership with other campus departments, the Center for Academic Excellence Writing Specialists, the Career Development Center, the Undergraduate Research Office, International Programs an d the Office of Civic Engagement to assist the Occidental College candidates in submitting their most compelling and competitive application. Visit us online at http://www.oxy.edu/national-awards or in person in South Trailer B, room 1. Pre-Health Advising The Office of Pre -Health Advising at Occidental College provides information and in -depth advisement to students and alumni who are interested in matriculating to professional graduate programs in health sciences. Through personal counseling sessions, group workshops and seminars, we assist students with the clarification of their professional and academic goals, and preparatio n for graduate level programs in health sciences. Throughout the application process, we provide individualized support to applicants to all medical and health sciences programs. If you are interested in a career in health sciences, please attend workshops offered by this office throughout the year to gather information and network with others who share your 37interests. For private sessions, meet with the pre -health advisor on a regular basis to check your progress and to develop your short - and long -term st rategies. For more information, please visit: http://www.oxy.edu/pre-health-advising Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) Althoug h there is no ROTC unit at Occidental, qualified Occidental students may be able to participate in Air Force or Army ROTC through programs at UCLA and USC. Appropriate academic credit, not to exceed eight units, may be awarded upon successful completion of transfer work in these programs. Interested applicants should consult the Office of Admission or the Associate Registrar for details. Veterans Benefits There is considerable financial a id available to veterans and their families through the GI Bill, War Orphans Educational Law, and other programs. Widows and children of deceased veterans as well as spouses and children of totally disabled veterans are eligible for educational benefits. F urther information can be secured from the local Veterans Administration Office. Students eligible to receive veterans benefits should contact the Registrar's Office to certify enrollment to the Veterans Administration. Those expecting government checks ar e reminded that this aid may not be available for two to three months at the beginning of the fall semester. All students receiving benefits through the VA are required to maintain 12 units per semester to receive the maximum monthly benefit. Disability Services The primary mission of Disability Services is to help students participate in college life to the fullest extent possible. Through providing reasonable and appropriate accommodations, assisting students with self - advocacy, providing academic support and counseling, and ensuring adherence to state and federal disability laws, Disability Services is committed to enhancing students' academic development and independence. By working closely with faculty, staff, and administrators, our goal is to create a supportive community that promotes awareness, sensitivity and understanding of students with disabilities. Summer Option While Occidental does not have a formal summer program, current Oxy students engage in independent study, research programs, and internships during the summer. The College also offers its distinctive Multicultural Summer Institute for sel ect first -year students. 38American Studies American Studies is an interdisciplinary exploration - with an emphasis on history and literature--of the voices and visions that interpret and in turn shape the American experience. The search for a distinctive American culture has a long-standing tradition. How that experience is represented is influenced by the changing dynamics of domestic affairs and the geopolitics of United States foreign policy. The study of what it means to be \"American\" both at home and abroad is to understand the often conflicting voices and visions of Americans over time. Therefore, we encourage our majors to apply for international and domestic off-campus study. The field is concerned with questions such as whether or not there is a national culture. Can we, for example, reconcile the tension between traditional narratives of individualism and self- reliance, and the counter-narratives of community and oppression? This discussion is particularly appropriate as we enter a new century of challenges in a post-Cold War world. The strengths of our department include courses offering multiple perspectives on American history, literature, culture, art, and politics. Requirements MAJOR: The American Studies major consists of a minimum of 10 courses (40 units) to include History 101 or 102 (or their equivalent), ECLS 189 or 289 (or their equivalent), and AMST 290, 390, and 490, and five other courses selected in consultation with an advisor from the American Studies faculty. Three of the five courses are required to be in American Studies. They include AMST 240, 242, 270, 272, 280, and 295. Courses acceptable from other departments include ECLS 189, 255, 289, 356. Education 213, 215. History 206, 277, 307, 312, 395. Politics 208, 209, 362. Psychology 385, Religious Studies 240, 245, 347. Sociology 350. Consulting with an American Studies advisor is essential for successful completion of the major. MINOR: Five courses (20 units) to include AMST 290 or 390, History 101 or 102, ECLS 189 or 289 and two other courses in American Studies. They include AMST 240, 242, 270, 272, 280, and 295. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in American Studies will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's college-wide writing requirement by successfully completing American Studies 290 and 390 (or their equivalent) with a grade of B- or higher. Students should familiarize themselves with the departmental requirement at the time of declaring the major. See the college writing requirement and consult the department chair for additional information. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: Completion of a paper and a presentation on a topic in the student's area of emphasis as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the senior seminar (AMST 490). Research proposals for the senior project are due October 1 of the senior year. 39HONORS: Students meeting college requirements for honors may apply for admission to the program by submitting a written proposal for an honors thesis by October 1 of their senior year. Those accepted may register for American Studies 499 during the fall or spring semester of the senior year; the thesis should be completed by the end of the senior year. In general it is expected that honors students will also take American Studies 490. For further information see the Honors Program and the department chair. Courses 197 - Independent Study in American Studies Prerequisite: permission of instructor. 2 or 4 units 240 - African American Women Writers This course examines the constructions of black women's identities as represented in twentieth century fiction by U.S. black women writers whose themes include the impact of slavery, migration, class, and family on sexuality, \"sisterhood\" and racial solidarity. Typical texts include works by writers as varied as Octavia Butler, Lorraine Hansberry, Andrea Lee, Paule Marshall, Toni Morrison, Ntozake Shange, and Paula Woods. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 242 - Great Migration & Emergence of \"New Negroes\" This interdisciplinary course examines the migration and transformation of more than half a million African American southerners who left the south to move to cities in the northeast and midwest in search of greater freedom. We will also discuss the Harlem Renaissance when the art and literature of this era were seen as examples of racial progress. Political leaders and their organizations often clashed with one another and we will discuss those debates in this critical period in African American history. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 270 - Asian American LIterature This course analyzes the social experience and cultural heritage of Asian Americans through their writing and places them in a broader comparative context of multi-racial/ethnic American society. We will examine the development of Asian American literature, its social implications and historical context, and the diversity of subject matter which makes up the literary scene of Asian American communities since the mid-19th century. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 272 - Asian Immigrants in American Society This course examines the experiences of Asian immigrants and their descendants in American society since the mid-19th century. Topics include \"push\" and \"pull\" factors that have led various Asian groups to the United States, the problems they faced as they adapted to their new homeland, changes in Asian American communities since the 1960s, the influence of U.S. policies toward Asia on Asian immigration, and the impact of globalization and transnational 40networks on Asian Americans in our rapidly changing era. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 280 - The United States and East Asia This course explores the history of the United States' involvement with and policy toward countries in East Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines, from the early 19th century to the present. Topics include the changing roles of the United States in East Asia, the process of economic development in an international context, cross-cultural misperceptions, and power rivalries in the Pacific Rim. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 290 - American Studies: Theory and Methodology This course introduces students to the major theories employed by scholars in American Studies and to the methods and materials that have been used to create interdisciplinary analyses of the cultures of the United States. Through close reading of scholarly studies and a variety of primary texts (e.g., novels, films, essays, song lyrics, children's textbooks, clothing styles), we will analyze the creation, maintenance, and transmission of cultural meaning in the U.S. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 295 - Topics in American Studies Exploring American Utopian Communities . Since the 19th century, communities of people in America, both secular and religious, have attempted to bring their vision of a perfect society into practice. In this course, students will study both historic writing and American literature that will bring to life the struggles, triumphs, rise, and demise of several of these fascinating experiments in communal living. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES Race and Gender in Asian American Films . This course will begin with a look at the creation of stereotypes of Asians as revealed in early Hollywood films. We will see graphic examples of racism and stereotyping as well as fascinating work by actors, actresses, and directors who were pioneering for their times. With this informed historical perspective, we will then look at a selection of feature length dramas made by and about Asian Americans. In addition to identifying key themes in the Asian American experience, we will examine how ideas about gender influence the spectrum of relationships; intimate, familial, and societal as portrayed in the selected films. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES Latino/a Experience. This course will explore the history and experience of Latino/a immigrants in the United States, paying particular attention to how race, ethnicity, identity, politics, class, and gender influence the lives of Latino/a immigrants. We will also examine how they have influenced historical developments in different regions of the country, especially in terms of U.S. demographics. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES Black Literary History and the Archive 41Black Literary History and the Archive Description: How do we resurrect the lives of people who were considered unimportant, those whose contributions were dismissed and buried? What does the existing historical archive tell us about what is considered valuable and about what constitutes \"memory\"? This class examines the lives of two of the most important nineteenth-century Black women writers, Harriet Jacobs and Harriet Wilson, as a means to develop the tools of literary recovery. As we expand the contours of the historical canon, we will also reflect on our own sense of the scope and shape of African American historical memory and the ways in which we organize history. How do we interpret religion, resistance and labor activities that that fall \"outside\" of the most recognized narratives about African American experience? This class will take on these larger questions as we also engage in archival work in newspapers, census records and beyond. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES Discipline And Desire: The History Of Sexuality In The United States This course examines the history of the politics of sexuality in the United States since the American Revolution. It begins with theoretical works on the intersections of sexuality and politics, including writings by Sigmund Freud, Wilhelm Reich, Daniel Bell, Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, and Michael Warner. It then considers important moments in the history of American sexuality, including the growth of cities and erotic subcultures after the war for independence, the establishment of \"republican discipline\" and Victorianism in the early 19th century, blackface minstrelsy and the eroticization of slavery, the confinement of prostitution, the creation of domestic and public spheres, the explosion of working-class sexual entertainment during the industrial revolution, feminism and the social hygiene movement, the invention of homosexuality and emergence of gay and lesbian subcultures, black music and the racialization of sex, Betty Friedan's Feminine Mystique vs. Helen Gurley Brown's Sex and the Single Girl, Stonewall and Gay Liberation, Roe v. Wade, the feminist \"pornography wars,\" the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, and the politics of gay marriage. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES Race and American Citizenship. This course examines how American citizenship, from the war for independence to the present, has been defined in relation to ideas of race. In the early republic, how was citizenship created -- as both a legal category and a set of cultural norms -- and how did it reflect and influence concepts of \"whiteness\" and \"blackness\"? During the Civil War and Reconstruction, what was required of ex-slaves to become citizens, and how did they respond to those requirements? What were the privileges of whiteness and what were its costs? For African Americans during the era of segregation, what were the problems of \"second-class citizenship\" and what were its benefits? In response to the great waves of immigration at the turn of the 20th century and after 1965, how did nativists, liberals, employers, labor leaders, and immigrants themselves re-define \"Americanism\"? How has the Supreme Court, in cases such as Plessy and Brown, ruled on questions of difference, belonging, and national ob! ligation? What was gained from the civil rights movement's campaign for \"full citizenship\" and what was lost? What does it mean to be a \"good American citizen CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL Sociopolitics of Race: Color-blind/Color-conscious. Course explores the social politics of race through the lenses of color-conscious and color-blind ideologies. Topics focus on the construction of race; racial identity development and socialization for differently positioned group members; psychological impact of race and racial identification on academic achievement, esteem, and health; contemporary research on colorblind and color conscious 42ideologies and primes; and social policy. Interdisciplinary readings include social psychological theory and research (Steele's Whistling Vivaldi, Sue's Microaggressions and Marginality, contemporary journal articles), Literary Analyses (Morrison's Playing in the Dark), Critical Theory (Delgado and Stefanic's Critical Race Theory), and Sociology (Bonilla-Silva's Racism without Racists). Heavily discussion-based. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 310 - The American South This interdisciplinary seminar examines representations of the American South in literature and film as well as material and popular culture from Aunt Jemima collectibles, D.W. Griffith's \"Birth of a Nation,\" to CNN's 2005 coverage of \"Hurricane Katrina.\" We will also discuss the impact of Asian and Latino immigration on a region traditionally characterized as \"black and white.\" Prerequisites: one American Studies or American History course.

Prerequisite: American Studies major or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY American Experiments in Communal Living This interdisciplinary seminar explores American visions of utopia in fact and in fiction. Students will study the proliferation of American \"utopian\" societies, both religious and secular, from 1780 up to the 1930s before moving to an examination of more contemporary intentional communities, including dystopian separatists, and counter-culture communes. Readings include statements by charismatic founders, personal accounts of members, historical analyses, and utopian novels. 397 - Advanced Independent Study Prerequisite: permission of instructor. 2 or 4 units 490 - Senior Seminar in American Studies This course is designed to assist students with the completion of their research papers on topics that reflect their areas of emphasis in American Studies. It will provide an opportunity for seniors to synthesize their area of specialization with an analysis of critical issues in the study of American culture and society. 499 - Honors in American Studies Prerequisite: permission of instructor. 2 or 4 units S111 - Location and Dislocation 43This course offers ways of thinking about place, including Los Angeles, using texts from different academic perspectives. The course will examine four primary themes: 1) importance of place and environment, 2) issues of migration and dislocation, 3) bodies and commerce, and 4) placement and building communities. We will analyze theoretical writings, films and other visual materials, and historical and fictional narratives. Student engagement with L.A. communities will be an essential part of the course. Students are expected to be engaged with the course materials and are expected to think critically about how they place themselves in the multiple communities that they occupy. Social Justice by the Numbers: In addition to the cultural component of the academic program, students will attend a quantitative component that develops reasoning and problem solving skills through mathematical investigations. This quantitative component is structured to accommodate students with different levels of experience in mathematics. Offered during the Summer as part of the Multicultural Summer Institute.

Visual literacy is essential for informed participation and innovation within local and global cultures. Combining the disciplines of media production and critical studies, studio art, and art history, AHVA equips students to explore critically the interplay of culture, history, theory, analysis, and practice. We offer a broad range of courses in the history of Asian and Western art, visual culture, architecture, photography, media production and critical studies, and studio classes in drawing, painting, sculpture, printmaking, book arts, video, and digital media. The curriculum prepares students to become professional artists, art historians, media practitioners, critical scholars, and educators. Graduates have pursued a variety of professional activities, including: exhibitions and screenings in museums, galleries and film festivals; curatorial work and education in museums, libraries, archives, and other non-profit institutions. Students regularly attend graduate programs in fine arts, media production and critical studies and art history. By the nature of the subject, study of the visual arts requires close personal collaboration between students and faculty. Students should consult with their advisors frequently to determine their individual interests and goals, to assess the level of their artistic or scholarly abilities, and to plan individual programs of study designed to develop the aesthetic questions, technical skills, and research agendas required for the comprehensive project in the senior year. Because the maturation of creative ability requires time as well as effort, students who may desire a major in 45studio art should consult with departmental advisors and begin taking studio courses as early as possible in their first year, and should declare a major early in the sophomore year. Students wishing to go abroad should plan to do so in the junior year. Students may pursue coursework in the Art Center at Night Program at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Requirements MAJOR: Eleven or twelve courses (44 or 48 units, depending on the emphasis) chosen in consultation with the major advisor. Emphasis in Studio Art: Minimum of 48 units, chosen in consultation with the major advisor. Three beginning courses: S102, S103 and S105; Two S203, S210, S216 or 217; Two S310, S320, or S330; and S490 Senior Seminar; One course, in Media Arts and Culture (Criticism or Production); Two Art History courses -H180 and H389. The sequencing of courses is crucial: students should take beginning and intermediate courses in the Frosh and Sophomore years; 300 level courses (Advanced Projects) in their junior year; and S490 (Senior Seminar) and any elective studio courses in the senior year. You may not take a required 100 level course as a Senior. In addition, the two Art History courses (H180 and H389), and one 300 level Advanced Projects course must be completed before the start of the senior year. S101, 104 and 106 may only be taken as electives and do not count as required beginning courses. Emphasis in Media Arts and Culture: Minimum of 48 units. This emphasis balances the making of moving images with engagement in historical, critical, and analytical studies of existing works. Students will learn the technical skills necessary to shoot and edit their work and the critical skills necessary to understand the role of media in contemporary visual culture. Students may choose to research, historically contextualize, and produce 1) a video, Web, or installation-based digital media project; 2) a feature-length screenplay; or 3) a critical senior thesis. All students, regardless of their project choice, are expected to push media scholarship, project form, and modes of audiovisual communication. There are a number of required courses for the major, but beyond these, students can move fairly freely between courses that emphasize production and those more focused on critical and media studies. The required courses are Art M courses except where indicated otherwise: 140, 146, 243, Art H287, 390, 490 (either the critical research section or the media production section based on primary nature of comprehensive project). One from the following: 241, 245, 246, 248, 295. One from: 220, 240, 242, 290. One from: 320, 340, 348, 355. One Art S (studio) course. One additional Art H (history) course. One Additional Art M course, bringing the total to 12 AHVA courses (48 units). The screenwriting comprehensives option requires that students have taken Art M220 and 320 by the end of junior year. All production comprehensives students must have taken Art M140 and either 242 or 355 by the end of junior year (along with 220 if producing fiction). Critical comprehensives students must take either Art M245 or 348 before the end of junior year. Eligible students may apply to study abroad in the Fall semester of Junior Year. Students may enroll for 2-unit internships through the Career Development Center. Occidental College also has a cross-registration agreement with Art Center College of Design, which offers various 46technical courses in media software. Students are also encouraged to take one or more related courses offered in ECLS, Music, Theater, History, Spanish, or CTSJ. (ArtF/ArtM classes reference the same courses as we transition the program's name change from Film & Media Studies to Media Arts and Culture) Emphasis in History of Art: A minimum of 48 units, including three survey-level courses (H160, H170, and H180; one of these may be replaced by a 200-level elective in the same area) or equivalent; at least one course above 300 in two of these areas: Asian, Early Western, and twentieth century (either H387 or H389); the Seminar in Art History (H390); and the Senior Seminar (H490); two additional art history courses above the 100 level, of which at least one is at the 300 level; at least two courses (8 units) in Media Arts and Culture and/or Studio Art. In consultation with the advisor, a student may substitute a course outside the department (such as history, literature, politics, or philosophy, preferably related to the topic area of the senior thesis) for one of the art history electives. Combined Emphasis: Students may declare a combined emphasis in art history and studio art: A minimum of 48 units, including four introductory courses two each in studio art (chosen from ARTS 101, 102, 103, 105, 106) and art history (chosen from ARTH 160, 170, 180); and six courses above the 100-level, three each in studio art and art history, including at least one 300-level course in each area; the Senior Seminar in studio art (ARTS490) or art history (ARTH490). Similar combined emphases between Art History and Media Arts and Culture or between Studio Art and Media Arts and Culture may be proposed in consultation with the faculty advisor. MINOR: Emphasis in Studio Art: Five courses (20 units) in the department including any four studio courses and one art history course. Studio courses must be selected from more than one professor. Emphasis in Media Arts and Culture: Five Art M courses (20 units). Emphasis in History of Art: Five art history courses (20 units) including at least one from Western art and one from Asian art; at least three must be 200-level courses or above.

Courses 47Art History H160 - Introduction to Asian Art Selected periods and monuments of Asian art from India, China, and Japan, and an introduction to the methods of art-historical analysis. Emphasis will be placed on the understanding of works of art in their original religious, intellectual, political, and social contexts, with particular attention to the ways each developed characteristics appropriate to these contexts. Among the topics to be explored are ritual arts, Buddhist art (painting, sculpture, and architecture), secular painting, and garden architecture. Museum visits required. Not open to seniors. Not open to students who have taken Art H261 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND EAST ASIA FINE ARTS PRE- 1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS H170 - Introduction to Early European Art European painting, sculpture and architecture from the Prehistoric Aegean to Renaissance Italy. Although the course will proceed chronologically, its goals are to introduce the student to a range of art historical skills and issues including stylistic analysis, iconography, the relationship between image and the artist's biography, and the relationship between the image and its historical context. Museum visits required. Not open to seniors. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE FINE ARTS PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS H180 - Introduction to Later Western Art A selective survey of Western European painting, sculpture, and architecture from the Renaissance to the 20th century. Lectures and readings are designed to provide an overview of artistic developments, as well as how to articulate the ways in which forms of expression and modes of representation were affected by unfolding political, religious, social, cultural, and economic conditions. Major themes will include: patterns of narrative and description, strategies of realism and abstraction, the changing status of the artist, patronage and audience, and the rise of the avant-garde. Museum visits required. Not open to seniors. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL FINE ARTS and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS H260 - Arts of Mesopotamia and Egypt This course will explore the works of two ancient civilizations (beginning c. 3,000 BCE) which were independent and at the same time connected through territorial proximity as well as cultural ideals and artistic intentions; the Ancient Near East and Ancient Egypt manifest complex societies with distinct administrations, religious practices and social interests, and yet in both we note (among other elements) monumental ceremonial architecture, images of divinity, and portraits of rulers as well as the documentation of both historical and mythological narratives. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: FINE ARTS PRE-1800 H261 - Buddhist Art in South and East Asia 48A survey of Buddhist art as it originated in India and spread across Central Asia to China, Japan, and Tibet. We will devote special emphasis to the ways Buddhism and Buddhist art both changed and were changed by the various cultural traditions they encountered. We will also examine the history of \"Western\" encounters with Buddhism and how these have shaped - or biased - our understanding of Buddhist art and culture. Not open to students who have taken Art H160. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND EAST ASIA PRE-1800 , Fine Arts and REGIONAL FOCUS H266 - The Arts of Japan An introduction to Japanese painting, sculpture, and architecture from antiquity through the Tokugawa Period. Emphasis will be placed on the formation of an indigenous artistic tradition and its transformation under Chinese influence. The arts produced for patrons in Shinto, Buddhist, Zen, courtly, and samurai contexts will be examined. Museum visits required. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND EAST ASIA FINE ARTS PRE- 1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS H270 - Greek Art An investigation of the art and architecture of ancient Greece, from the Bronze Age (c. 3000 BCE) to the colonization of Greek culture by Rome (c. 100 BCE). Sculpture, metalwork, mural painting, vase painting, and architecture will be considered, with particular interest in how these forms are reflective of the fundamental political, spiritual, and philosophical developments during this era - as well as how these artistic forms serve as the foundation elements for European art history. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE FINE ARTS PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS H274 - Roman Art Roman art and architecture develop in response to increasingly complex issues of individual identity, cosmopolitanism, personal and state propaganda, and the social and political pressures inspired by managing large and varied population concentrations. Roman visual culture addresses these challenges by adapting to new ideas and subject matter while at the same time maintaining traditional notions of personality, organization, and imperial supremacy. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE FINE ARTS PRE-1800 H275 - Early Christian and Medieval Art An introduction to the major works and issues of the period through an examination of key moments in Europe and the Mediterranean basin from c. 300 CE to 1500 CE. A study of the forms, language and uses of medieval visual culture will be related to the circumstances associated with the demise of the Roman Empire, migrations of Northern European peoples, the increasing power of secular rulers, the development of monasticism, and the theological perspective of the Roman Christian Church. Art and architecture associated with contemporary monotheistic religions (Judaism, Islam) will also be considered. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE FINE ARTS PRE-1800 H278 - Early Islamic Art and Architecture 49A chronological survey of the visual art and architecture created within and for the Islamic cultures of Western Asia, North Africa, and Europe, 622-1453. Covers sacred and secular architecture and architectural decoration, sculpture, painting, manuscripts, textiles, and metalwork, including objects in area collections. Readings will include primary sources, exhibition catalogs, and scholarly articles; visits to museums and a mosque is anticipated. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA/MIDDDLE EAST ? FINE ARTS H280 - Michelangelo This course is designed as an introduction to the life and work of Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564). We will investigate his painting, sculpture and architecture, while considering its context within the major urban cultural centers in which he worked: Florence and Rome. The course will proceed chronologically, but will vary from week to week as to relevant themes and methodological approaches to the career of arguably the most influential of all Renaissance artists. Among those topics to be explored: development and dissolution of a classical vocabulary; relationships between style and technique; art, biography and self promotion; the relationship between Christianity and sexuality for Michelangelo and the Cinquecento; patronage and context in Florence and Rome; the development of classical form; meaning in the restored Sistine Chapel. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 H283 - Renaissance Architecture in Italy This course examines the development of Italian Renaissance architecture from about 1300 to about 1550. It will consider buildings in the civic and ecclesiastic context, both sacred and secular. The evolution of this tradition will be studied in relationship to issues of function and structure, contemporary writing, and religious, political, and economic influences. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE ? PRE-1800 H283 - Renaissance Architecture in Italy This course examines the development of Italian Renaissance architecture from about 1300 to about 1550. It will consider buildings in the civic and ecclesiastic context, both sacred and secular. The evolution of this tradition will be studied in relationship to issues of function and structure, contemporary writing, and religious, political, and economic influences. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE ? PRE-1800 H285 - Nineteenth Century Art: Culture, Politics & National Identity This course will explore artistic practices in the US, North America, and Europe during the long 19th century, from roughly 1789 to 1900. Lectures, discussions, and readings are designed to provide a thematically-driven, chronological overview of the period. Yet the course will not be a traditional \"survey\"; rather, it will focus on some of the key changes in ideas about artistic culture, art practice, and practices of regional, national and transnational identity formation as expressed in visual art. Art's role in social and political revolution, as well as its formative status as an engine of cultural imperialism in the 19th century will be explored in addition to some of the more traditional approaches to studying the status of art, the role of the artist, and the transformation of the art \"market\" in the wake of the industrial revolution. Key debates within the field of art history will be explored as well. Museum visit required. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL ? FINE ARTS and GLOBAL 50CONNECTIONS H287 - History of Photography What is a photograph? Is it a \"document\" or a \"work of art?\" Who makes a photograph, and for whom does s/he make it? How and where do photographs circulate? What effect does the context in which a photograph is viewed have on its meaning(s)? Designed as a selective history of photography in the 19th and 20th centuries, this course revolves around questions like these (although these are not the only issues we will explore) regarding the nature and function of photography in modern culture. Through thematic lectures, a wide-ranging list of readings and in-class discussion, we will explore the medium from multiple perspectives. Students will develop the critical skills they need to read and critically analyze the visual rhetoric that shapes photographic representations. In addition to learning about the different photographic genres - exploration and travel photography; studio and portrait work; medical and legal documentation; fine art prints; photojournalism - this class will push students to investigate photography's position within a broader cultural field: the medium's shifting relations to the artistic avant-gardes; advertising and consumer culture; constructions of race, gender, and national identity; and photography's role in producing history itself. Readings will include primary source materials and theories of photographic meaning; students will be asked to grasp not only the medium's technological and rhetorical functions, but also to develop their own critical perspectives on photography's shifting relations to intellectual, social and political ideologies. Coursework will require one hands-on photographic project and a museum visit. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL FINE ARTS and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS H289 - Modern Architecture A thematic course on the history, theory, and practice of Modern Architecture in Europe and the United States from the 1780s to the later 20th century. Themes we'll explore include the following: architectural theory and design as social planning; competing notions of public and private space; modernist architectural theory and urban development; rural and urban ideologies in American architecture; the changing image of the architect in the 19th and 20th centuries; architecture and urbanism in Southern California. Coursework will include a collaborative research project and a required half-day field trip to downtown Los Angeles. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL FINE ARTS and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS H290 - Oxy at Moca: Pacific Standard Time This course takes as its departure point Under the Big Black Sun: California Art 1974-1981, a forthcoming exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art funded in part by the Getty Foundation's Pacific Standard Time initiative. The large-scale survey exhibition emphasizes the heterogeneity of art practice in California art in the 1970s through a diverse array of media including painting, sculpture, drawing, installation, photography, performance, video and film. Through a series of field trips to the museum and an analysis of critical texts about the period, students will explore themes addressed in the exhibition including the proliferation of art practice into genres, styles and mediums, the rise of the artist-centric alternative art space and concomitant post-studio artistic strategies, the decisive role of art schools and universities in sustaining the arts in California, the codification and institutionalization of Chicano and Feminist political practices, and the integration of photography into fine art. In addition, the 51class will offer students an insider's view on how a major exhibition of contemporary art is mounted at a prominent museum. Students will learn about the comprehensive research process used to develop the checklist, the challenges in borrowing artworks from outside sources for the exhibition, as well as the logistical requirements for the installation and display of art objects. 2 units H291 - Arts in Los Angeles A 2-unit seminar course to be taught by visiting curators, critics, art historians or artists focused on some aspect of the arts in Los Angeles. Topics will change in light of availability of top quality visiting faculty, and will engage directly with current exhibitions, events, and issues relevant to the artistic culture of Los Angeles. Exhibiting Latino and Latin American Art in the 21st Century. Blending theory, history and practice, this course explores current and future strategies for exhibiting Latino and Latin American artists in the global contemporary art world. Offsite fieldwork may include gallery, museum and artist studio visits. This two-unit course will be held every other week (3 hours each session) over the course of a 15-week semester. Prerequisite: permissiomn of Instructor. 2 units History of Green Architecture. This course will pursue, and ultimately aim to reconcile, two separate questions about sustainability and architecture. To begin with, what makes a particular building -- house, office block, or skyscraper -- green? Second, and more fundamentally, how has our understanding of the relationship between architecture and nature shifted over the centuries? The course will begin by looking at a range of depictions of that relationship in art, architecture, literature, and philosophy before moving on to examine architecture's role in the nascent environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s. It will consider the rise and increasing codification of green architecture in the last 15 years in the U.S. and Europe, isolating certain buildings as case studies and assessing in some depth recent debates over the American green-design rating system known as LEED. Finally, we'll ask what green architects might learn from the ways that other sustainability movements -- in transportation, product design, clean-energy, and food policy -- have matured over the years. Students will visit a number of built examples of green architecture in and around Los Angeles. No prior study of architectural history is required. 2 units H362 - Art in Early China H362. ART IN EARLY CHINA Chinese art and archaeology from the neolithic period through the Tang Dynasty. Readings in historical, literary, and religio-philosophical texts will contextualize the study of the formative period of Chinese art history. We will trace the emergence, florescence, and decline of ritual art in ancient China; the birth and ascent to dominance of the Confucian scholar-elite as consumers (and ultimately producers) of art; and the impact of the introduction of Buddhism on the history of Chinese art. Archaeological discoveries continue to deepen our understanding of ancient China, and we will examine the most important excavations of the past 30 years. Prerequisite: Art H160 or Asian history course, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND EAST ASIA FINE ARTS PRE- 1800 52H364 - Art in Later China Chinese art of the last millennium. Primary attention will be paid to the arts of painting, calligraphy, and architecture (palaces and gardens), seen in the context of patronage groups and other intellectual, social, and political factors. The role of the scholar-gentry class in the consumption and production of art is particularly important, but we will also examine the impacts of the imperial court, the religious establishment (Chan or Zen Buddhist), and the merchant class on the art of imperial China. The course will conclude with a consideration of art in contemporary China and its relationship to pre-revolutionary Chinese traditions. Prerequisite: Art H160 or Chinese history course, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND EAST ASIA FINE ARTS H368 - Japanese Painting A survey of Japanese painting with emphasis on the Heian through Tokugawa periods (10th-19th centuries). The transformative influences of Chinese culture and changing patronage groups (from courtly to zen/samurai to the merchant class) will inform our analysis of monochrome ink scrolls, gold-leaf screens, and ukiyo-e woodblock prints. Where possible, we will consider the works in the architectural settings for which they were intended. Field trips to the L.A. County Museum of Art and other collections will be arranged. Prerequisite: Art H160 or Art H266, or Japanese history course. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND EAST ASIA FINE ARTS H373 - Major Figures in the Italian Renaissance. Art and Biography of Michelangelo Painting, sculpture, architecture, and urban planning of Michelangelo Buonarroti. This course considers the development of the artist from his apprenticeship in the shop of Domenico Ghirlandaio through his late paintings in Rome. All works are considered for their stylistic, iconographic, and social context. Particular attention will be paid to the urban and specific patronage context of each work, which are critical for a more complete understanding of Michelangelo?s art and intellectual development. This course requires travel to Italy during the winter break. Prerequisite: permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE FINE ARTS PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS H374 - Art of the Early Italian Renaissance A survey of the painting, sculpture and architecture of Italy from about 1300 to 1500. All major figures, including Giotto, Ghiberti, Donatello and Botticelli will be considered. Works will be examined in terms of setting, patronage, and cultural context in addition to questions of style and meaning. Prerequisite: Art H170 or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE FINE ARTS PRE-1800 H376 - Sixteenth Century Italian Art High Renaissance and Mannerism. Among those artists considered are Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titian and Raphael. Of special consideration is the nature of the Papacy as a patron of art and the city of Rome as a context for artistic activity. The course will also consider the reasons for the dissolution of the classical tradition during this time by artists such as Pontormo, Parmigianino and Giulio Romano. Prerequisite: Art H170 or permission instructor. 53CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE FINE ARTS PRE-1800 H378 - Art of the Northern Renaissance An examination of the artistic traditions of Northern Europe from c. 1400 to 1600 CE. Points of consideration include significant artistic personalities and individual works, the relationship between patron and image, territorial distinctions, in addition to the connection between northern and southern (Italian) visual developments during this period. Prerequisite: Art H170 or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE FINE ARTS PRE-1800 H387 - European Visual Culture, 1900-1945 This course will focus on European visual culture from 1900-1945. We will consider the nature and transformation of the avant-gardes during this period through lectures and discussions about Cubism, the Russian Avant-Garde, the Bauhaus, Dada, and Surrealism. Yet we will also try to make sense of practices that do not usually figure in histories of this period, paying particular attention to the ways in which a \"return to order\" emerged in artistic practices during the years after World War I. Media to be explored include painting, sculpture, photography, film, and architecture; we will also investigate the increasingly important role played by art exhibitions in shaping contemporary ideas about art, artistic identity and art's connection to politics. Readings will be drawn from art history, art theory, literature, history and philosophy. Coursework will require one formal oral presentation and a museum visit.

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL FINE ARTS H295 - Topics in Film and Media Studies The study of film and media has involved disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches for about half a century. This intermediate topical course of varying emphases studies the key critical terms, issues, and debates in popular media cultural study, including genre study, in relation to specific topics. Readings of film and media examples illustrate how different theories or perspectives can be applied to contemporary pop culture. Genre in Contemporary Film, TV, and Digital Media. Genre films were part of Classic Hollywood, but genres started changing in interesting ways as media industries evolved after World War II, with the introduction of television, new technologies that enabled shooting on location or new opportunities with color film, the rise of drive-in movie theaters and indie or exploitation filmmaking. We will study the shift from classic genre films and theory to hybrid genres and genre revisionism in film/media movements spearheaded by people of color, feminists, and LGBT communities as well as studios. The focus in the class is on genre theory studied through historical and technological shifts in media production. Screenings will introduce a range of genres, from classic films like the Western and noir to more recent genres like road films, television melodramas and war video games. Prerequisite: M146 or 243, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: FINE ARTS Imagining War: Genre on Screen and Battlefield. The war film has arguably been one of the most consistent and popular elements of cinema's history. It was a component of film from its beginnings and is now a regular mainstay amongst Hollywood blockbusters. It has also undergone several political revisions and technological shifts in media production, distribution and exhibition, making it ideally suited to study the theory and history of genre. Importantly, this course will not only look at how war figures in film, but how film also profoundly effects and configures war. Entertainment andwar are the United States' primary exports. Militarism and the Hollywood studio system have had a long and deadly interdependence. By conceiving of the viewing screen as an extension of the battlefield (and vice versa), this course will look at 56the profound social and political implications of the classic genre system. We will do this by examining such films as Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Hiroshima Mon Amour, Battle of Algiers, Black Hawk Down, Kandahar, Night and Fog, The Hurt Locker. Das Boot, Saving Private Ryan, All Quiet on the Western Front, Dr. Strangelove, Inglourious Basterds, Birth of a Nation, Rambo, MASH, as well as a host of television shows, Websites, and video games . rerequisite: M146 or 243, or permission of instructor.

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: FINE ARTS Modernity and the Rise of Cinematic Visuality. Many have argued that the history of modernity has been, above all, a history of visualization. In this course, we will examine a diverse range of nineteenth and early twentieth century visual practices, technologies, and experiences\u2014including train rides, panoramas, urban spaces, assembly lines, medical photographs, amusement parks, side shows, optical toys, and more\u2014that helped shape the \"modern observer\" by altering both the perception and understanding of time and space, public and private, work and leisure, the normal and deviant, and the individual and collective. Through a combination of critical readings and screenings, we will ask how such practices of looking not only influenced early cinematic form and content, but also how they continue to inflect postmodern media culture, from television to the internet. M255 - Media, Bodies, and Space This course examines the history, theory, and practice of integrating time-based media into three-dimensional space. This is a theory/practice course: students will study the history of video and audio installation and attendant theories around interactivity, virtuality, and site specificity, while experimenting with different methods of troubling the passive relationship of viewer to screen in traditional cinema. Through hands-on exercises, students will develop sensitivity to three-dimensional space, explore the relationship of the human body to aural and visual environments, and create a series of linear and non-linear narratives that take into account viewers in motion.

A thorough foundation in both biology and chemistry forms the core of biochemistry. Occidental's biochemists seek to use their scientific knowledge and broad education in the liberal arts to advance the public good and improve health care, 73economic opportunities, environmental stewardship, national security, as well as expanding human understanding through their teaching and research. The interdisciplinary portion of the major includes Biology 130, Molecular Biology 221, two biochemistry classes, Biology 322, and Chemistry 350, plus the comprehensive examination in biochemistry. Classroom activities are supplemented by extensive laboratory experience involving the design, execution, and interpretation of experimental results. Biochemistry graduates generally elect to pursue graduate training toward a Ph.D. in Biochemistry, a doctorate in the health professions, employment in the biotechnology field, or a career in education. Students planning on pursuing a Ph.D. in Biochemistry are advised to take several more courses including the advanced Cell and Molecular offerings in Biology, and advanced Chemistry courses in Chemistry, to broaden their education. Biochemistry students are strongly encouraged to pursue their particular interests through an independent study-research project (Biology 395 or Chemistry 395). The Biochemistry program is eager to accommodate the foreign study aspirations of its majors; however, due to the curriculum's sequential nature, careful advanced planning is required. Students wishing to declare a Biochemistry major should have completed two Biology and two Chemistry classes with at least a 2.7 GPA in these classes and arrange for the discussion of their schedule with one of the Program's advisors. Requirements MAJOR: Consists of: Biochemistry 490; Biology 115, 130, 221, 322 and one additional upper level Biology course (with lab) in the area of cell and molecular biology; Chemistry 120 or 130, 220, 221, 240, 300, and 350; Mathematics 110 and 120; Physics 110 and 120, or Physics 115 and 125. All courses must include a lab component unless otherwise specified. One of the two \"Biochemistry\" courses (Bio 322 and Chem 350) can be replaced as follows: Bio 322 can be replaced by an additional 300 level biology course, with lab, in the area of cell and molecular biology; Chem 350 can be replaced by taking 4 units total of 300 level chemistry course(s), CHEM 395 or BIO 395 cannot be used to replace CHEM 350. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Biochemistry will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's writing requirement by completing a portfolio of five specified papers or the appropriate Writing and Rhetoric class.

Within an evolutionary framework, our program investigates the interactions between molecules, cells, organisms, populations, and ecosystems that constitute life on earth. Interdisciplinary and integrative by nature, the biology program at Occidental engages both majors and non-majors in a curriculum that emphasizes laboratory and field investigations. Our students are encouraged to collaborate with faculty mentors, whose research employs current methods in addressing questions from the molecular to the global in scale. Students acquire skills from careful observation through hypothesis formulation and experimental design to formal oral and written presentations of results. After participating in the biology program at Occidental, students are prepared for rewarding work and lifelong learning, armed with the tools necessary to understand and help explain the complexity of living systems. After completing the major, many students elect to take graduate training toward the Ph.D. in biology or doctorates of medicine or dentistry. Others enter into careers such as biomedical research, teaching, law, or government service. The Department of Biology is housed within the Bioscience building which is contiguous with the Moore Laboratory of Zoology. Facilities include the bird and mammal collections (70,000 specimens) of Moore Laboratory, greenhouses, facilities for microscopy (scanning and transmission electron and fluorescence), a tissue culture suite and fluorescence-activated cell sorter, fully-equipped molecular biology laboratories, field vehicles, and three research vessels for nearshore marine studies and SCUBA diving. Because of its proximity to the Mojave Desert, the Santa Monica, San Gabriel, and San Bernardino Mountains, and seacoast, Occidental College is ideally suited for field and laboratory studies of environmental biology. Requirements MAJOR: The major consists of nine Biology courses (36 units) plus Senior Comprehensive Seminar (Biology 490, 4 units), and five supporting courses (20 units). Required Biology classes are Bio 105, 106, 110 or Bio 115, Bio 130, Bio 490, and seven additional 200- and 300- level Biology classes that satisfy the breadth and depth requirements defined below. Two semesters of introductory biology are required. In these courses, students are exposed to basic biological principles and the diversity of life. 76The introductory courses may be taken in any order, but at least one should be taken during the first year. One course must be in organismal biology, stressing diversity and the relationship between structure and function (Bio 105, 106, 110 or 115). The second course must be in cellular and molecular biology (Bio 130) and provide a broad introduction to the biochemistry, physiology, and molecular biology of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. 100-level Biology courses are not open to senior Biology majors. To meet the requirement for breadth within Biology, majors will take four classes, one from each of four biology subject areas: Cellular and Molecular Biology (Bio 221, 222, 224 or 226), Environmental Biology (Bio 106, 260, 270 or 275), Evolutionary Biology (280), and Organismal Biology (Bio 240, 250 or 275) 200 level requirements. In 300-level courses, students engage deeply with a particular specialized subject. Three 300-level courses (at least two of which must be laboratory courses) are required. We accept Kinesiology 301 for this 300 level requirement. One seminar course (Biology 490) is required to fulfill senior comprehensive requirements. Five supporting classes are required for the major: Two semesters of chemistry (Chemistry 120 or 130, and 220); Calculus I and one other course with a strong quantitative component (this requirement can be filled by Calculus II, Math 150; Math 186, Bio 260 or Bio 368; Physics 110, 115, 120 or 125; or Psychology 201); and one other 4 unit course with a lab from Biology, Chemistry, Cognitive Science, Geology, Kinesiology, Mathematics, Physics and Psychology at the 200 or 300 level. Biology majors must complete these courses within the Biology Department at Occidental: at least two of the four 200-level courses and at least two 300-level electives. A course used to fulfill one requirement cannot fulfill another major requirement. 2 unit and AP courses do not meet requirements for the major. Students intending to apply to health professional programs or graduate programs in Biology should include four semesters of Chemistry, two semesters of Physics, and two semesters of Calculus in their course plan. Pre-professional students are strongly encouraged to consult with the Health Professions Office early in their career. Students planning to apply to graduate programs in Biology are also advised to include research (Biology 395) in their program of study, and may wish to select an emphasis (see below). Students intending to obtain a teaching certification in biology should contact the Education Department as early as possible for advice on course selection. Additional advice concerning courses and career planning may be obtained from the major advisor. The Biology Department encourages international study for Biology majors. Among the semester options available are programs in Tropical Biology in Costa Rica, Global Medicine and Public Health in Costa Rica, and direct enrollment at James Cook University in Australia (with strengths in Marine Biology and Tropical Biology.) Students may receive credit towards the Biology major and to meet Core distribution requirements. See the International Programs Office and Professor Braker for more information. EMPHASIS WITHIN THE MAJOR: Students may construct an individual program to meet the Biology major requirements, or they may choose an emphasis in Cell and Molecular Biology or Marine Biology, or the Environmental Sceince Concentration in Biology. 77Cell and Molecular Biology Emphasis: This emphasis is designed for students who are interested in pursuing a career in the health professions or graduate school in cellular or molecular biosciences. Cell and Molecular Biology encompasses a wide range of studies, including: gene expression and regulation, transmission of genes between generations, cell-to- cell communication, cell physiology, the biochemistry of DNA and RNA, the development of a fertilized egg into a multi-cellular organism, the biology of microbes, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive the specialized functions of the immune system, the nervous system and other organs and tissues. All requirements for the Biology major apply, with the addition that students must take two of the three courses at the 200 level as part of their program of study: Bio 221, 224, and 226 as part of their program of study. At least two of the required three courses at the 300 level must be chosen from the following list: Bio 320, 322, 323, 325, 326, 330, 333, 340, 349 and 350.

Drawing on the fields of mathematics, 103philosophy, psychology, neurobiology, computer science and linguistics, Cognitive Science studies the nature of consciousness, the interaction of mind and matter, and the relationship between thought and language. Cognitive Science addresses long-standing questions about the nature of thought, intelligence, perception, emotion, and other aspects of our mental life by employing the methodologies of the contributing disciplines mentioned above, including philosophical reflection and argument, experimental psychology, the modeling of intelligence with machines, and the investigation of the biological basis of cognition. The Cognitive Science Program includes courses in biology, linguistics, mathematics, philosophy, and psychology, as well as introductory and advanced courses in Cognitive Science. The Cognitive Science major has three parts: first, a basic course requirement which introduces the student to the field and its contributing subfields, and second, an emphasis requirement where students begin to focus on the aspect of cognitive science which interests them most. Finally, students complete a senior comprehensive project within their cognitive science emphasis. Requirements MAJOR: All cognitive science majors take the following eight fundamental courses: Cognitive Science 101: Introduction to Cognitive Science; Cognitive Science 242: Computational Approaches Cognition; Philosophy Logic; Psychology 306: Cognitive Psychology; Cognitive Science 310: Research Methods in Cognitive Science; Cognitive Science 320: Cognitive Neuroscience; Cognitive Science 330: Linguistics for Cognitive Science, Linguistics 301: Introduction to Linguistic Structure or Linguistics 350: Psycholinguistics; and Cognitive Science 490: Senior Seminar.

Students who fail the requirement or who fail to meet the deadline will be required to take both a composition course in the senior year and demonstrate acceptable writing skills in the senior comprehensive in order to graduate. Students should familiarize themselves with the departmental requirement at the time of declaring the major. See the Writing Program and consult the department chair for additional information. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: In the senior year the student carries out a project or writes a thesis on a topic in Cognitive Science related to the chosen emphasis. The project or thesis is coordinated with the work of the Cognitive Science Senior Seminar. All majors take the Senior Seminar in the fall semester of the senior year. MINOR: A minor in Cognitive Science consists of Cog Sci 101, 242, 310, one of Cognitive Science 330: Linguistics for Cognitive Science, Linguistics 301: Introduction to Linguistic Structure or Linguistics 350: Psycholinguistics; and two other courses in cognitive science or from the list of courses included in the four emphases. HONORS: Honors in Cognitive Science may be awarded to graduating seniors who demonstrate excellence in their course work and distinction in their senior comprehensive project. To be eligible, students must have a 3.5 grade point average in the major and a 3.25 overall grade point average. In addition, the comprehensive project or thesis must be judged as a \"pass with distinction.\" See the Honors Program and consult the program chair for further details. Courses 101 - Introduction to Cognitive Sciences An interdisciplinary introduction to the discovery of the mind through philosophical texts, psychological experiments, artificial intelligence, the study of nerve cells and neural networks and investigations into language. The purpose of the course is to foster an appreciation of the wonder and complexity of minds and brains, both human and otherwise. Not open to seniors in spring semester. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 104 - Introduction to Neuroscience This course provides a basic introduction to the nervous system [for students with little or no experience in this area]. It will include an introduction to how nerve and glial cells contribute to different brain functions. Brain structures and systems and how they act to produce sensory experience, thought, emotion, and memory will also be covered. Other topics might include: factors that affect embryonic development of the nervous system, and the effect of drugs, environment, stress, education, and age on the brain. This course is not open to students who have taken Biology 333, Cognitive Science 320, Kinesiology 301 or Psychology 322. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 105210 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Can one create intelligent machines-machines capable of posing and solving problems and of interacting effectively with a complex and dynamic environment? If so, how? And what insights into natural cognition do we gain through efforts to create artificial intelligence? Fundamental principles, architectures, and algorithms for machine perception, control, and problem-solving will be addressed. We will also look in detail at strategies for developing intelligent machines, including traditional Artificial Intelligence and the more recent perspectives of situated and embodied cognition. The laboratory component of the course will involve computing and simple robotic devices. Prerequisite: COGS 242, or MATH 186, or MATH 210, or permission of instructor CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 230 - Mind, Brain, and Behaviour The course will examine questions from cognitive science at the levels of the mind, the brain, and behavior. By bringing together these different perspectives, the course will explore how the nervous system can give rise to the diversity of human cognition and behavior, both normal and abnormal. We also will apply these perspectives to inform relevant issues in today's world such as medications for cognitive enhancement, neuroimaging for lie detection, and the use of cell phones while driving. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 241 - Cognition of Music and Sound As part of human cognition, our perception, production, and understanding of music has elicited many questions: What is music in relation to \"sound\"? Is music an evolutionary adaptation? What is the relationship of music and emotions, or memory? Can music influence perception in other modalities? What is the meaning of music? Can music make us smarter? Is music a language? What is biological and what is cultural in the esthetics of music? This course will reframe many of these questions from the interdisciplinary standpoint of cognitive science, acoustics, music theory, and semiotics to explore music as a cognitive process Topics will include the perception of pitch, timbre, rhythm, and localization; music and the brain; cognitive aspect of the esthetics of music; the relationship between music and language in terms of their structures and neurological processing; music and memory; music and emotions; music and meaning. We will also discuss the role music plays in cross-modal interactions, either in the real world, or in films and multimedia art works. Same as MUSC 241. Prerequisite: Any Cognitive Science class or Music class, or instructor's approval CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCIENCE ? FINE ARTS 242 - Computational Approaches to Cognition Computational modeling provides important insights into how the mind/brain may work. We will examine three different approaches that have been used to provide insights into cognition: symbolic methods, connectionism, and probabilistic methods. We will use computer software to explore how these approaches work in practice. Specific applications such as perception, language, and memory will be covered. The assumptions and limitations of each approach, as well as the metaphor of mind/brain as a computer, will be critically considered. This course has a mandatory laboratory component which will include both experimentation and computer 106programming. No previous programming background is required. Prerequisite: Cog Sci 101 as prereq or coreq OR prereq of Phil 225, Math 186, 210, 214, 252, or CS 157, 161, 165, or 211 OR permission of instructor CORE REQUIREMENT MET: LAB-SCI 295 - Topics in Cognitive Science Intelligent Agents .This course explores the some of the issues in the nature of intelligent agents: Concepts are the building blocks of thoughts; they are what allow intelligent agents to think about, reason about, and understand the world around them. This course will explore major theories of the nature of concepts from philosophy, psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and related fields. The goal will be to gain a better appreciation of what concepts are, and how the study of concepts ties together different fields in the study of cognition. Pre-req: Any cog sci course or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 301 - Applied Cognitive Science and Education This course will address current cognitive science research as applied to learning and education.

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 310 - Research Methods in Cognitive Science The aim for this course is to provide students with the necessary foundation to think critically about research in cognitive science and to lay the groundwork for the original research that will be done in the senior thesis/project. We will extensively examine primary literature, considering carefully the processes involved in moving from a general idea to a specific research question. We will consider the strengths and weaknesses of a range of approaches, such as psychological experimentation, neuroscience methods, and computational modeling. In addition, we will generate and analyze experimental data, including a basic overview of common statistical techniques. The course will culminate in an original research proposal. Prerequisite: Cognitive Science 101 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL ? MATH/SCI 320 - Cognitive Neuroscience This course is an introduction to the biology and physiology of the nervous system from the perspective of cognition. The material that the course covers will start with membrane biophysics and the production of electrical signals by nerve cells. Then studies of synapses, learning, memory, and plasticity of neural connections will be covered. Finally, the course will conclude examining models of simple nervous systems (non-human and computer-generated). Prerequisite: Cognitive Science 101, Biology 130, or Psychology 322, or permission of the instructor. Familiarity with high school or college physics is beneficial. Co-requisite: Cognitive Science 320L 107CORE REQUIREMENT MET: LAB-SCI 330 - Linguistics for Cognitive Science Language and cognition are intimately related. For this reason Linguistics has had an extremely strong influence on Cognitive Science. This course studies language and linguistics in the context of Cognitive Science. We will address such questions as how are language and thought related? How is language represented in the brain? How do we process language? To what extent is the human capacity for language innate? Is there a language of thought? What are the best ways to model language acquisition and language processing? We will cover some topics in traditional linguistics, and we will look at current research on connectionist and traditional artificial intelligence approaches to modeling language. Reading will include work by Chomsky, Pinker, McClelland, Rumelhart, Fodor and Elman. Prerequisite: Cognitive Science or 242. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 343 - Probabilistic Models of Cognition Probabilistic models have increasingly been applied to understand how the mind works across domains such as motor control, decision-making, and causal inference. We will learn how such models work, learning the mathematical tools necessary to implement them, such as Bayesian inference, graphical models, and Markov models. We will consider both how human cognition can inform machine learning and how computational approaches can lead to new ideas about cognition.

UC Davis; M.A., Ph.D., UC Santa Barbara Ramin Naimi Professor, Mathematics B.S., UCLA; Ph.D., Caltech Core Program The Core Program is a cross-disciplinary array of courses required of all students. providing the intellectual foundation for Occidental's commitment to excellence, equity, service, and community. Core classes ask students to engage in analytic and creative thinking: posing questions from different points of view, solving problems, formulating hypotheses, gathering evidence to support claims and arguments, drawing appropriate conclusions, and expressing ideas clearly. These classes explore the large questions which we believe all students must address in order to participate fully in their academic careers, their vocations, and their lives: questions of human cultures and beliefs, of creativity, and of the physical world. Students are asked to examine previously held ideas in the context of new and challenging ones, to experiment imaginatively, to articulate similarities and differences, and to revise both ideas and written work. Methods and materials vary, in disciplines ranging from the humanities to the social sciences, to science, mathematics, and art; and analytic thinking may take place in the context of a lab, in the close reading of a text, on a stage, in a lecture hall, on a computer screen, in a screening room, or in the field. Assignments will also vary from papers, to arguing a thesis, to problem sets, to research term papers, to lab reports, to paintings. The first-year Cultural Studies Program Seminars are the centerpiece of the Core Program. These are small seminars, each designed by a faculty member around a topic in his or her field of expertise, emphasizing discussion, critical analysis, and intensive instruction in writing. Students take one seminar in the fall and one in the spring, for a total of 8 units. In the fall seminars, faculty and students jointly explore human culture from a variety of disciplinary as well as cultural perspectives. Spring seminars approach topics from a global perspective and stress the writing of scholarly research-based essays, Successful performance in Cultural Studies Seminars, along with a satisfactory writing evaluation, satisfies the college's first-stage writing requirement (see the College writing requirement ) and is equivalent to two semesters of English composition. The Seminars for the coming year are described below. Students may not drop a Cultural Studies Program Seminar. In addition, students participate in the study of culture as embodied in the arts and sciences as well as in the humanities and social sciences. We require a minimum of three courses (12 units) taken in academic departments that provide significant experiences in (a) diversity in the United States, (b) global connections between cultures, regions, and nations, and (c) a region of the world other than the United States. One of these (or an additional course) must focus on 113a period prior to 1800, and one (or an additional course) must treat the theory or practice of the fine arts. Individual courses can meet a maximum of two Core requirements. Lifelong learning requires a basic understanding of the theory and methods of the sciences. Accordingly, students are required to take a total of three courses (12 units) in the sciences and mathematics. Of the three, at least one must be a laboratory science. Finally, graduates of the College must demonstrate proficiency in a language other than English. The various ways of satisfying this requirement are detailed in the requirements for Undergraduate Study. Requirements 1) Culture and Fine Arts: A minimum of 12 units (16 or 20 units are recommended) continue and expand on the first- year CSP seminars by situating the study of culture and the arts in specific disciplinary and geographical contexts. Students must enroll in a minimum of four units in each of three different categories. Four units must represent study of historical periods prior to 1800, and four must be devoted to the fine arts. The pre-1800 and fine arts requirements may be met in courses also representing one of the three major categories of culture requirements, although no course may satisfy more than two requirements. Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate examinations may not be used to satisfy any of these requirements. Students who matriculated at Occidental prior to fall 2013 must meet 12 units of the culture requirement as follows: One four-unit course must be chosen from each of any three of the following six cultural/geographical categories: Africa and the Middle East (CPAF) Central, South, and East Asia (CPAS) Europe (CPEU) Latin America (CPLA) U.S. Culture (CPUS) Intercultural (CPIC) Some of these courses are also designated Pre-1800 (CPPE) or Fine Arts (CPFA). Students who matriculated at Occidental in fall 2013 or later must meet 12 units of the culture requirement as follows: One four-unit course must be chosen from each of the following three categories: Global Connections (CPGC) Regional Focus (CPRF) U.S. Diversity (CPUSD) Some of these courses are also designated Pre-1800 (CPPE) or Fine Arts (CPFA). 114Courses will be listed in the Catalog and online Course Counts with both pre- and post-2013 designation. 2) Science/Mathematics Requirement . A minimum of 12 units in science and mathematics. Four units must be in a science course with a laboratory component. The remaining 8 units may be taken from among any of the courses that satisfy the Science/Mathematics requirement. Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate examinations may not be used to satisfy any of these requirements. 3) Foreign Language: 0-8 Units. All students must achieve Language 102-level proficiency in a language other than English. Students may not take Language 101 for credit if they have taken more than one quarter in college or more than one year in high school (grades 10-12) Placement: Students may begin study of a new language at the 101 level if they have not taken it previously for more than one quarter in college or more than one year in high school (grades 10-12). They are not required to take the College's placement exam. First-year students may take the Occidental College Placement Exam either on-line for French, German, and Spanish, or during orientation for other languages taught at Occidental if: a. they have taken more than one quarter in college or more than one year in high school (grades 10-12) b. they have participated in after-school or weekend language programs; or c. they have extensive background in but no formal training in a language. Students can fulfill Occidental's language requirement in one of five ways: 1. by completing a language course numbered 102 at Occidental, or the equivalent course in any foreign language at another accredited institution. 2. by receiving an exemption-level score on Occidental's placement and/or exemption exam given during orientation. (see language studio website for language specific details). 3. by earning an appropriate Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) II score (560 or above on French, Spanish, or Latin; 550 or above on German or Chinese; 540 or above on Japanese; or 560 for other languages): 4. by earning an Advanced Placement test score of 4 or above or. 5. for some languages not taught at Occidental, students may by taking the ACTFL oral proficiency interview (OPI) and the writing proficiency test (WPT) in the languages currently available. Please see the Keck Language and Culture Studio about demonstrating proficiency via ACTFL. Foreign Language Exemption Policy International students whose language of education has been in a language other than English 115and who have completed six years of elementary education or more in a foreign language are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Such students should contact the chair of one of the foreign language departments to confirm their fulfillment of the foreign language requirement. CORE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS: Transfer students may meet the Core requirements through classes taken before matriculation at Occidental, or through classes taken at Occidental, or (as is the case for most transfer students) through a combination of both. Transfer students must take the equivalent of two Cultural Studies Seminar (8 units or 2 classes), a minimum of 12 additional units or 3 classes in distribution courses in culture (including pre-1800) and the fine arts, as described above, and 12 units or 3 classes in science and/or mathematics, including a designated lab science course. They must also complete the language requirement. Appropriate equivalents are determined in consultation with the Core Program Office and the Registrar. Cultural Studies Seminar (4 units). A conventional English composition class, or a course specified as \"writing-intensive,\" will ordinarily satisfy this requirement. Any four-unit course in Occidental's Department of English Writing will meet the seminar requirement. The first stage of the writing requirement is a different requirement, and is explained under the Writing Program. Culture and Fine Arts Distribution Courses (Minimum 12 units or 3 full classes, 16 or 20\u20144 or 5 full classes\u2014recommended). Transfer students must take a minimum of 4 units or one full class from each of three groups listed above (U.S. Diversity, Global Connections, and Regional Focus), and must take 4 units or one full class in courses designated \"pre-1800\" and 4 units or one full class in courses designated as \"fine arts.\" The pre-1800 and fine arts requirements may be met in courses also representing one of the three major categories of culture requirements, although no course may satisfy more than two requirements. Mathematics and Science (12 units or 3 full classes). Most transfer students have met at least some of these upon entry. Of these, at least one class must include a laboratory or field component. All of these Core requirements should be completed by the end of the junior year. Courses Cultural Studies Program Fall Writing Seminars 116 1 - CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL SEMESTER. 16 units: counts as four courses (CSP, Biology 106, Economics 101, and Geology 105). Satisfies fall CSP requirement and Core Lab and Non-lab Science requirements. Join a group of first-year students and three faculty learning about natural science, economics, and the environment of California. The spectacular California landscape will be our laboratory as we investigate the geology, biology and economics of our environment through data collection, laboratory and computer analysis, critical thinking and writing, and classroom learning. Multi-day field trips during the school week introduce you to your fellow CES classmates while hiking and camping in State and National Parks throughout California. All of your coursework in Fall semester will be taken with your CES peers. The California Environmental Semester is a great way to begin your college career. In addition to satisfying three Core requirements, its classes may count toward seven different programs of study: Biology, Economics, Environmental Science, Geology, Politics, Diplomacy and World Affairs (DWA), and Urban and Environmental Policy (UEP). Beyond these programs, CES students excel in a wide variety of majors and college activities from the theater stage to the playing fields to student government. 10 - SUNSHINE AND NOIR: LOS ANGELES CULTURAL STUDIES. This course will consider how Los Angeles has been represented in a cross section of 20th century literature, film, music and popular culture. We will examine contradictory visions of the metropolis as a land of promise and peril where issues of space, race, and class intersect to create an urban culture in which conflict and cooperation exist in productive tension. Primary texts in the various media will be supplemented and contextualized by secondary readings in social history and cultural theory. Cultural events in greater Los Angeles may be incorporated if appropriate opportunities come up. 11 - THE HERO VS DEATH AND GOD. This course will examine the peculiar aspirations and struggles of the ancient hero--not (to quote the 90's film classic, Swingers) the modern \"PG-13 hero, the one everyone really hopes is going to make it happen,\" but rather the \"R-Rated\" ancient hero, \"the one you're not so sure you like yet.\" We shall begin the course with the four thousand year old story of Gilgamesh, the troubled and troubling hero-king of the Ancient Near East; we shall then attempt to interpret anew the meaning of three of the most famous Greek and Roman epic heroes (Achilles, Odysseus, and Aeneas); and finally, we shall conclude the class with an examination of the heroes of the Mahabharata, the great religious epic of ancient India. Too energetic, too angry and far too proud to shrink back from a challenge, these difficult figures made a habit of exposing themselves not only to the mortal dangers of advancing enemy hordes, but, more meaningfully, to all those maddening contradictions our human existence seems to entail for us: the \"higher\" powers that even against our wills determine us, the sad mortality that against all our longing ends us. Scorning the safety of the familiar and the everyday, the heroes of ancient epic pushed themselves relentlessly to act and to think to the very limit of things. Availing ourselves of any number of modern philosophic theories (deconstruction, 117phenomenology, existentialism and the like), we shall endeavor in this class to think that exasperating limit in intimate company with them. This class will occasionally meet with Professor Freas's CSP16. 12 - DESERT OR GARDEN. Does our world appear to us like an abundant garden--or is it a stony, unforgiving desert? This seminar will explore the opposed images of desert and garden, of barrenness and fruitfulness that pervade Western history. Beginning with a close reading of Genesis and the story of human expulsion from the Garden of Eden, we will first examine these images in a number of literary and artistic appearances (including T. S. Eliot's famous diagnosis of the \"modern\" condition as an unredeemed \"waste land\"). In the second phase of the course we will consider their specific effects, for better and for worse, on the development of an iconic U.S. institution: the city of Los Angeles. 13 - AN IMAGINED HOLLYWOOD: THE REAL AND THE REPRESENTED IN HOLLYWOOD'S TEXTUAL HISTORY This seminar will explore the myth, idea, culture, and history of Hollywood through careful readings of both historical and literary texts. The objective of this course is to consider which kinds of texts offer us the most \"authentic\" representation of Hollywood. What is real Hollywood? And what is just imagined? In a place like Hollywood, where entire lives, landscapes, and narratives are manufactured for film, can we attempt to untangle the essential Hollywood - the real Hollywood - from its textual representations? As we move through these topics, we will also be exploring the various skills necessary for writing critical and analytical essays, including crafting a thesis statement, the difference between summary and analysis, and integrating textual evidence. 14 - MAKING IT NEW: MODERNITY, MODERNISM, AND THE AVANT-GARDE During the first half of the 20th century\u2014a time of great social, political, and technological change\u2014many writers, artists, and musicians sought new and innovative modes of expression. While their works varied in both genre and style, modernists shared a common desire, in the words of the poet Ezra Pound, to \"make it new.\" Focusing on the period from 1910 to 1968, this interdisciplinary course will examine a tumultuous half-century through an exploration of the radically new forms of literature, art, and music it produced. How did writers, artists, and musicians deal with issues of race, gender, and sexuality? How did they react to brutal wars and periods of intense political oppression? And what exactly is the avant-garde? From Woolf to Kerouac, Kandinsky to Warhol, and Stravinsky to Sgt. Pepper, this course will examine what it means to create modern works for a modern world. 15 - ENVIRONMENT AND POWER IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. This interdisciplinary seminar examines the intellectual, social and political history of the California environment with a particular focus on the ways in which different cultural and ethnic groups have perceived, used, managed, and conserved it over the past 250 years. The course will introduce students to essential concepts, concerns and methods in environmental history, at large, while engaging topics specific to California history including the Spanish frontier, the Gold Rush, forestry, the hydraulic empire, wilderness parks, industrialization, urbanization, and environmental justice. Los Angeles as a field of study will occupy a significant place in our exploration. 16 - VIOLENT FEMMES: CLYTEMNESTRA AND MEDEA IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY. This course explores the literary depiction of two exceptional women in myth: Clytemnestra and Medea. Clytemnestra is an adulteress who murders her husband, King Agamemnon, 118upon his victorious return from the Trojan War. Medea, after being spurned by her husband who remarries a young princess, kills the bride, her father the king, and her own two children in order to punish her husband. The course title points to the subversive qualities possessed by these two figures: neither woman should use violence to acquire power, but they do and so confound historical expectations for their gender. In this course we will consider what can be learned about women (and men) from these presentations of Clytemnestra and Medea and think deeply about what has made them so fascinating and horrifying for over two thousand years. This class will occasionally meet with Professor Stocking's CSP11. 17 - HUMAN RIGHTS IN LATIN AMERICA IN LITERATURE AND FILM. Until not long ago, Latin America was best known for its economic, social and political turbulence. With most of the region in the hands of authoritarian governments, human rights violations were widespread and ranged from a lack of free elections to \"disappearances\" and state-sponsored genocidal violence. Today the region is, to varying degrees, almost all democratic, but problems such as drug-related violence, poverty, and arbitrary criminal justice systems still take a toll on individual rights. Yet the region should not just be known for its problems. Argentina's post-dictatorship experience has become a model in transitional justice studied around the world, Mexico has adopted important changes in its criminal trial procedures, and Brazil has challenged its long-standing complacency about the integration of its African-heritage population by implementing an interesting blend of affirmative action policies. Largely relying on novels, short stories, essays and films, \"Human Rights in Latin America in Literature and Film\" will explore human rights-related problems and progress in Latin America over the last 60 years. 18 - NAVIGATING LIFE'S OPPORTUNITIES - HOW TO GET OUT OF YOUR OWN WAY. The content of this course is derived from the disciplines of sport psychology, positive psychology, and stress management. Concepts such as motivation, goal setting, energy management, and finding meaning will be discussed in a way that is directly applicable to daily living. Students will have the opportunity to engage in self-exploration in addition to being exposed to lives of individuals such as John Wooden, Viktor Frankl, and Morrie Schwartz (of \"Tuesdays with Morrie\"). Students will leave the class with a greater awareness of how to utilize their strengths and be equipped with strategies that foster resilience when dealing with challenges. 19 - SPORT IN FILM. From The Freshmen (1925) to Rocky (1976) to Bull Durham (1988) to Remember the Titans (2000) to Blue Crush (2002) to Bend It Like Beckham (2002) to The Fighter (2010) sport has been central theme in film for close to a century. This course will explore such topics as race and class, gender, sexual orientation as depicted in sport film. Students will explore additional topics including motivation, personality, friendship, competition and group dynamics through film (an additional 2hrs is spent per week viewing films). 2 - REVOLUTIONS: AFRICA AND BEYOND. Tunisia, Egypt and Libya in 2011, South Africa 1993, Algeria 1962. These are some of the 119revolutions that captured international attention and dramatically changed the social and political landscape of Africa. The revolutionary thinking of Marx, Lenin, Gandhi, Mao, Ho Chi Minh, Fanon and Biko and others, formed the basis of mass mobilization against oppressive regimes. Furthermore, African political thought and praxis inspired civil rights movements and anti-colonial struggles throughout the world. Beyond exploring these revolutions, the class will introduce students to Africa and African diaspora cultures in Los Angeles through activities and excursions that will encompass the visual and dramatic arts, music, culinary experiences, lectures and tours. \"Revolutions\" comprises one half of the entire fall semester course load (8 units), and students taking it should plan their remaining courses carefully. It is particularly recommended for students interested in History and/or Diplomacy and World Affairs, or for those going on in the social sciences and humanities generally. 20 - IN SEARCH OF AFRICANISMS IN THE MUSICS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. This course surveys African musical elements as they exist in North, South and Central America as well as in the Caribbean Islands. Through readings, lectures, videos and sound recordings, we will trace the historical origins of some traditional aspects found in Africa and relate them to the development of many musical genres found in the Western Hemisphere. 21 - LESSONS FROM THE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS. We will begin by reading selections from the ethical writings of three great philosophers: Aristotle (4th century BCE), Immanuel Kant (18th century), and John Stuart Mill (19th century). We will then use the insights and arguments of the great philosophers to determine what the nature of a meaningful life is -- what we ought to value and how we ought to live. We will consider what kinds of moral obligations we have, not only to ourselves, our families, and our friends, but also to strangers, to non-human animals, and to nature. 22 - WRITERS AND READERS. Why do we write, if not to communicate with a reader? Readers can be anyone: yourself, someone you know, someone you hope to meet, or a whole group of people whose expectations you must imagine, and whose responses you may never see. In this course, we'll explore expectations of writers and readers in academic contexts, persuasive personal writing, professional writing, journalism, and creative writing. We'll experiment with a variety of essay styles and writing development tools to translate writer-centered work into reader-centered work, with an emphasis on reader feedback, revision, and reflection. The class workshops will help you find your voice as a writer; improve your understanding of professors' and other readers' expectations for writing; boost your confidence in your own abilities as a reader, writer, and scholar; and help you design your own path to mastery of effective writing. This course is for all students who want to master a broad range of writing styles and situations, and it is of particular benefit to students who prepared for college outside the US. 23 - LA TRANSITIONS: RACE, SPACE, AND PLACE IN THE CITY OF ANGELS. Complex and contradictory, Los Angeles defies simple understandings. Through the lens of neighborhood transitions this course will examine the economic, political, and social forces that shape this city. Relying upon insights from a variety of disciplinary perspectives including 120critical theory, ethnic studies, geography, history, political science, sociology and urban planning we will examine how LA's neighborhoods have been created, contested, and recreated over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries. Our texts will include maps, photography, literature, film, music, and others. This course will be supplemented by community-based learning exercises that may include field trips and off-campus assignments. 24 - POPULARS, JOCKS AND NERDS: PEER RELATIONS IN CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE. The course is designed to examine current scientific research on peer relationships in childhood and adolescence. The questions which will guide the course include: What types of children are victimized by their peers? Why are some children more popular than others? What effect does popularity have on children and adolescents' emotional, behavioral, or academic functioning? What role does aggression play in establishing and maintaining status in the peer group? What types of peer crowds do adolescents affiliate with? How are peer relationships different as individuals develop? We will discuss how psychological science has been used to examine these, and related questions about child and adolescent peer relationships. The course will examine the form and function of peer relationships in Western and non-Western cultures. 25 - PRODUCTION, CONSUMPTION AND WASTE. During this seminar, we will study capitalism not only as an economic system, but also as an ethos (or way of being). We will begin by examining a number of accounts of the emergence and functioning of the mechanisms of capitalist production and consumption. This will lead us to an exploration of the ways in which this transforms individuals, societies, and cultures. In particular, we will focus on the way in which waste and idleness are experienced as problems and then addressed. Students will be asked to consider how different configurations of these mechanisms and practices can together create conditions of existence for us. In the latter part of the seminar, students will be asked to identify the limits created by these conditions and to explore through research possible alternative modes of living and working. 26 - VISUAL STORYTELLING AND NARRATIVE FILM. Through readings, review of films from a variety of genres, hands-on visual projects, writing exercises, and class presentations this course will explore, examine and analyze the complex relationships between Production Design (Settings and Costumes), Lighting, Composition and Editing that create the images of narrative film. Our framework will be the investigation of the basic principles of visual storytelling and the development of a set of evaluative criteria with which to critique the form, content and style of films from various eras and genres\u2014mystery, comedy, epic, and musical. The goal of the course is for the student to develop a greater understanding of how visual storytelling functions as well as an awareness of the applications and implications of these principles beyond cinema. The focus of the course will be developing the student's critical eye, exploring the practice of visual storytelling and fostering improvement of writing skills. 27 - GREEK TRAGEDIES AND MODERN AUDIENCES. Since the sixth century b.c.e., playwrights and audiences have returned over and over to the stories and characters, the dramatic structures and devices, and the complex layering of ideas 121first presented in the Theater of Dionysos. We will investigate the myths and the dramaturgy of Aeschylus' Agamemnon, Sophocles' Elektra, and Euripides' Orestes translation well as a number of reinventions, appropriations, and adaptations of these plays for audiences of today. What in our own cultural and political moment leads playwrights such as Charles Mee, Sarah Ruhl, Ruth Margraff, Steven Berkoff, Luis Alfaro, and Caridad Svich back to the ancient Greeks and their tragic themes? And what in those themes continues so powerfully to draw audiences more than 2500 years later? Students in this seminar will attend at least one performance of a modern adaptation of Greek tragedy. 28 - RESIST AND EXIST: MODERN LITERATURES OF RESISTANCE IN THE U.S. AND MIDDLE EAST When the Martinican psychiatrist Frantz Fanon suggested in The Wretched of the Earth (1961) that \"decolonization is truly the creation of new men,\" what did he mean? Who was the \"new man\"? the\"new woman\"? What happened and happens in the process of global decolonization? We will examine the representation of the emerging \"new man\" in novels and short stories by Native American, African American, Chicano/a, and Asian American writers as well as in works from Palestine, Egypt, and Iran. We will begin in the mid-twentieth century and work through the present day to understand how literatures of resistance have offered challenges and critiques to Fanon's concept of the \"new man\" while expanding upon and complicating his idea. 3 - TRANSAMERICA: IDENTITY, MOBILITY, AND AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM. This course will examine \"American Exceptionalism\" through twentieth-century portrayals of travel, migration, and wanderlust. After historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the U.S. frontier \"closed\" in 1893, cultural representations of mobility became a unique marker of racial, class, and sexual identity. We will examine a range of texts, from 1930s blues songs' affective expressions about African American \"Great Migration\" to constructions of 1950s white hipster masculinity in Beat writings to the emergent genre of the transgender road movie. Because Hollywood film was historically the U.S.'s first major international export, this class will focus in particular on cinematic representations, both foreign and domestic, of how traveling identities support or interrogate American nationalisms. Materials will include fiction and memoir by Jack Kerouac and Marilynne Robinson; critical theory addressing topics from the \"vanishing\" of Native Americans to the travels of transnational Barbie; music from Memphis Minnie to Led Zeppelin; and movies such as Badlands, Thelma and Louise , My Own Private Idaho, Brokeback Mountain , and Transamerica . 4 - REPRESENTING LA: IMAGINED SPACES AND LIVING PLACES. As a major U.S. city that grew in importance during a time of increasing globalization, Los Angeles occupies a unique position within the cultural imagination. This course will explore how the unique geographical and cultural space of Los Angeles has contributed to ways in which the city has been imagined and represented in literature and film. In our explorations, we will consider how L.A.'s roots, migrating populations, shifting community boundaries, and multiple forms of power shape imaginings and lived realities of the city. How do various representations reflect - and diverge from - living communities within Los Angeles? How are the city and its communities shaped by national and global forces? How has Los Angeles as a destination city for migrants shaped the ways it is imagined? How do we reconcile the dueling representations of L.A. as both utopia and dystopia? Over the course of the semester, we will 122examine a broad range of film and literature that will guide our discussion of these and other questions, interrogating what it means to live in the city of Los Angeles. 5 - CHANGING ASIA, CHANGING THE WORLD: STUDENTS MOVEMENTS IN ASIA. Some have discounted the youth of our society as apathetic and trivial, becoming further distanced from society at large and ever more self-absorbed in their own cyberworlds of social media and networking. In the recent past, however, the strength and ideologies of youth toppled governments and changed the world. The focus of this course will be on examining and analyzing pivotal historical student movements in Asia: the Anpo movements in 1960s Japan, the democratization movement of the 1980s in Korea, and finally 1989's Tiananmen Demonstrations in China. Points of comparison are the student movements in 1960s America and the most recent Occupy movements. 6 - QUEER 2.0: LGBT RIGHTS IN THE INTERNET ERA. This course is about the past, present and future of the fight for equal citizenship for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, commonly known as the \"gay rights movement.\" A central concept is that gender, race, sex and sexual orientation (among other aspects of one's identity) are social constructions. We analyze the historical time period from the Internet's birth (1950s) to present day. We examine the historical, cultural, religious, legal and societal significance of marriage as a lens to view the myriad ways that civil rights and fundamental freedoms are mediated by identity. Texts include academic articles, court cases, legal briefs, popular media, fiction, blogs, videos, tweets and images. We use Web 2.0 tools (Blogger, Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook) to facilitate students' development as both consumers and producers of intellectual, academic material. The ability of students to produce and critique online content is a learning outcome of this class. No previous knowledge of any particular internet tool is required. Technological support is provided. 7 - MUSIC AND MIGRATION. In recent years scholars of human migration have begun to see music as a rich source of information about migrant communities and cultures. Because migrant communities do not always have access to other forms of communicative media, music can sometimes offer a unique glimpse into the worldviews and immigration histories of those who have voluntarily and involuntarily left their lands of origin. Why do people migrate and how can music help us to understand the varied circumstances that have historically impelled migration? How does music inform migrant's attitudes about their communities of origin and about their host societies, and articulate the new social locations and economic possibilities that emerge post- migration? How are contemporary patterns of global migration different from early migrations and how can music help us to understand those differences? In this course we will approach music as a lens through which to understand the complex socio-economic circumstances, motivations, and life trajectories of diverse migrant communities. 8 - SCIENCE AND YOU. Who should you believe: the sculpted Adonis who attributes his heavenly body solely to Product A, or your middle-aged doctor as he looks over horn-rimmed glasses and preaches to you his mantra of fruits and vegetables? This course will explore how science is portrayed to the public, with the aim of deconstructing issues to objectively evaluate the merits of the 123arguments. The first part of the course will explore in great depth the perpetual, self-corrective process of the scientific method to demonstrate the necessity of research and contradictory viewpoints. The focus will then shift towards topics that include, among others, health/fitness, biotech, and the environment. Be prepared: . This course includes a rigorous writing component, requires intensive group work both within the classroom (e.g., presentations) and beyond (e.g., community engagement), and emphasizes development of oral presentation skills. . Students enrolling in this course must have a solid background in high school chemistry and biology. 9 - THE ARTIST'S LIFE. Many students know the typical novel focuses on a single character's life journey\u2014what literary scholars call the \"bildungsroman.\" In this class we will examine an understudied subgenre\u2014the k\u00fcnstlerroman or \"life of the artist.\" We will consider key features of this narrative form and how it alters across literary, film, visual art and musical genres. By framing fugitive slave narratives as \"escape artists\"; by exploring visual artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Kara Walker; by watching Black Swan starring Natalie Portman and Spike Lee's Bamboozled ; and by listening to hip-hop like Kanye West's solo albums, we will understand the complexity of taking up the artist's journey in the modern world and how this path becomes a metaphor for past and present social struggles. Cultural Studies Program Spring \"Global Issues\" Research Seminars CSP 50 and 51 are designated CSP \"Lab\" courses, team-taught experimental seminars designed to engage their students critically and actively in synthesizing knowledge and ideas about an important topic. In these classes you'll work closely with faculty from more than one academic field, developing new, cross-disciplinary perspectives; you'll engage in intensive reading, writing, and discussion; you'll learn to think and work collaboratively, as a member of a diverse intellectual community. 50 - FROM THE TEN COMMANDMENTS TO THE DEATH OF GOD This interdisciplinary study of European culture will examine and analyze material from literature, philosophy, science, medicine, religion, the arts, and political theory. We will consider, in their historical context, such figures as the authors of the Hebrew Bible, Homer, Sappho, Hippocrates, Sophocles, Thucydides, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, the authors of The New Testament, St. Augustine, figures in medieval Islamic science and medicine, Machiavelli, Luther, Calvin, Copernicus, Kepler, Queen Elizabeth, Galileo, Descartes, Mozart, Wollstonecraft, Napoleon, Charlotte Corday (bathtub murderess of the French Revolutionary leader Marat), Mary Shelley (author of the original Frankenstein), Balzac, Marx, Darwin, Florence Nightingale, Nietzsche (and his claim that \"God is dead\") Freud, Woolf, Sartre, de Beauvoir, and Gandhi. 124This is an 8-unit colloquium and seminar course. Students enrolled in this colloquium will not only get credit for the first year spring seminar requirement, but also will meet the Core Program's Cultural Studies Distribution requirement for Regional Studies/Europe. 51 - CULTURE OF FOOD. What do you like to eat? Who prepares your food, and who is at the table eating it with you? In this course we will take on these and related questions, covering aesthetic, historical, social, and cognitive approaches to food studies. In addition to critically examining cross-cultural aspects of food culture, students will engage with Los Angeles food culture. This is an 8-unit colloquium and seminar course. Students enrolled in this colloquium will not only get credit for the first year spring seminar requirement, but also will meet the Core Program's Cultural Studies Distribution requirement for Global Connections. 52 - THE RUSSIAN EXPERIENCE. The Russian Experience focuses on the enigma and riddle known as \"Rus\", \"Russia\", \"The Russian Empire\", \"The Soviet Union\" and \"The Russian Federation\". This strange land has been a combination of great extremes: West and East, blinding poverty and dazzling wealth, great talent and shocking brutality. The course focuses on the period of Russia's explosion onto the world stage both politically and artistically, beginning with the reign of Alexander I, the Napoleonic Wars and the Decembrist Revolt, and following the development of Russian society and the Russian/Soviet State through the 19th and 20th Centuries, up to the current post-Soviet Russian Federation. There will be equal emphasis on internal politics, the arts, and international relations. 53 - CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND THE KILLING STATE Why does the United States continue to use the death penalty when nearly every other industrialized Western nation in the world has abolished its use? What explains the persistence of America's contentious commitment to capital punishment? When the state kills, who wins? These questions will guide our exploration of the death penalty's past, present and future. Using various historical, legal and social perspectives, we will examine the shifting rationales and nature of contemporary death penalty debates; cross-national public opinion; racial disparities and the historical legacy of lynching in America; the social and personal impacts of executions; and contemporary problems with the death penalty's current application (e.g., wrongful convictions, sentencing disparities). 54 - MAGICAL REALISM AND THE FANTASTIC IN LATIN AMERICA. How do Latin American writers approach the question of the supernatural? What makes a work \"magical realist\"? Why are Argentinean writers Jorge and the Uruguayan writer Cristina Peri Rossi considered practitioners of the fantastic short story, whereas Alejo Carpentier (Cuba), Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (Colombia), and Isabel Allende (Chile) are called magical realist? Is there a regional (Caribbean and MesoAmerican) aspect to magical realism? Is there an urban aspect to the fantastic? How are irony and humor used by the fantastic and magical realist writer? This course will be attentive to how the use of Western and non-Western myth, popular folklore and Latin American popular Catholicism, 125European surrealism and genealogical family novels shape magical realism, as well as to how the narration of a single, disturbing or fearful event tends to characterize the fantastic, but we will also discover to what extent \"magical realism\" is a very difficult category to pin down. 55 - THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS: PERSPECTIVES AND REFLECTIONS ON CHILDHOOD. Using a variety of methods, including historical, literary, and psychological, this co-taught course will investigate the multiplicity of ways in which childhood has been and is conceived from the 18th century to the present. The course will explore questions such as \"what is the role of innocence in defining childhood\" and \"what is the role of imagination, truth, and fantasy in childhood development\"? Students will conduct research regarding how digital technology shapes the early literacy of children by writing their own digital children's story and assessing how actual children in the Childhood Development Center respond to digital texts. 56 - DOCUMENTARY DISCOURSE. \"Documentary Discourse\" provides students with writing instruction situated in documentary film. For better or worse, documentary has become one of the main ways we access \"truth\" today. We will write about a variety of non-fiction films, treating them as examples of visual argument. Along the way we will analyze particular sub-genres within documentary history, scrutinizing the truth-telling techniques of the directors. Students will come away from this class understanding what makes for effective arguments, both in their own writing and in documentary film. Effective composition will result from an awareness of the importance of audience, voice, context, and argument. 57 - RENAISSANCE INDIVIDUALS. Experience the European Renaissance of the 14th through 17th centuries-- an age of classical revival, religious reform, and global exploration. A book of almost 100 concise biographies\u2014Renaissance People: Lives that Shaped the Modern World\u2014introduces students to the daily lives of a diversity of men and women and the controversies their lives provoked. Films will highlight the multi-varied individual, like the courtesan and poet Veronica Franco, as well as the confrontation between artist Michelangelo and military pope Julius II. A source reader will provide practice in analyzing texts, as well as objects of material culture, in an age of encounters between cultures. For a research-based essay utilizing evidence from the times, each student will focus on two individuals in a field of the student's interest such as politics/diplomacy; court life; sexuality/gender; crafts and the arts; reformation in religion; scientific experiment and enlightenment; mapping the globe; or travel and encounter. Together students will share the evidence upon which scholars re-interpret the past to meet concerns of our present world. 58 - REIMAGINING THE \"ART OF THE WEST\" AT THE AUTRY: CURATION AS CULTURAL PRACTICE. In the summer of 2013, the Autry will open a new set of galleries that joins works of art from the collections of the Autry and Southwest Museums. The newly renovated galleries will offer a dramatically different account of the \"Art of the West\" than has been offered since the museum opened in 1988. The new gallery structure will integrate works by Native American, Euro-American, Hispanic and other artists within spaces previously given over to paintings, 126sculptures, and objects of material cultured by European American artists. Students in this seminar will be asked to focus on and learn about both the history of the Museum's engagement with, and promotion of, an \"Art of the West.\" At the same time they will consider the transformation of the historical and curatorial goals of the museum by focusing on the re- invention and re-narration of the Museum's art collection underway in 2013. Our seminar group will also have the opportunity to collaborate with an Autry Museum Curator throughout the semester. 59 - ENERGY, SUSTAINABILITY, AND THE PLANET. This broad-ranging course will explore the science impacting the use of energy in our society as well as the sustainability of this practice on the planet. Case studies from both the developing and developed world will be the focus. This discussion-focused, writing-intensive course employs a scientific framework in considering four themes (1) fossil fuel energy sources and their use, (2) renewable sources, (3) consequences of energy consumption in our global society and (4) implications for sustainable development on the planet. In addition to a final paper, each student will also develop a 15-minute oral presentation on a scientific question related to one of the four key themes noted above. Students enrolling in this course should have completed at least one course at the high school level in biology, chemistry, and physics. 60 - THE ARTIST'S LIFE. Many students know the typical novel focuses on a single character's life journey\u2014what literary scholars call the \"bildungsroman.\" In this class we will examine an understudied subgenre\u2014the k\u00fcnstlerroman or \"life of the artist.\" We will consider key features of this narrative form and how it alters across literary, film, visual art and musical genres. By framing fugitive slave narratives as \"escape artists\"; by exploring visual artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Kara Walker; by watching Black Swan starring Natalie Portman and Spike Lee's Bamboozled ; and by listening to hip-hop like Kanye West's solo albums, we will understand the complexity of taking up the artist's journey in the modern world and how this path becomes a metaphor for past and present social struggles. 61 - SUNSHINE AND NOIR: LOS ANGELES CULTURAL STUDIES This course will examine texts of fiction, poetry, essay, music, film and graphic arts that have as their subject the problems and promise of urban life in major world-cities of the 19th and 20th centuries. Among the cities we may explore through their imaginative representation are London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Mexico City. Field study in Los Angeles may be incorporated as pertinent events or opportunities come up. 62 - REIMAGINING FAMILY. We will explore the alternative family structures depicted in contemporary British and U S novels. Among the novels we will read are: Angela Carter , The Magic Toyshop ; Don DeLillo, Mao II ; Louise Erdrich, Tracks ; ,Nick Hornby, How To Be Good ; Jamaica Kincaid, Annie John ; Maxine Hong Kingston, The Woman Warrior , and Anne Tyler; Saint Maybe ; and Alice Walker, The Color Purple . 63 - THE BERLIN WALL AND ITS FALL IN 1989. POLITICAL AND CULTURAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF A METROPOLIS. 127Berlin has been a focal point of German, European, and indeed world politics for more than a century. The course will focus 1) on the post WWII years, when Berlin became a divided city, a fault line in the Cold War, and the wall was a symbol of the irreconcilable differences between East and West, known throughout the world, 2) its unpredicted fall thanks to a powerful grass roots civil rights movement whose motives and expectations will be analyzed, and 3) the aftermath of the re-unification with its consequences, problems, and achievements throughout Germany. The goal is to compare rhetoric and reality of the Cold War, the achievements and shortcomings of the GDR civil rights movement, the expectations of East and West (after unification), the politics of memory, the role of various urban communities, and the changing character of the city. A major component of the course will be the collaboration with the Wendemuseum in Culver City which houses tens of thousands of documents and other items around the wall, its fall, the Wende or \"turning point,\" and everything relating to the GDR world. We will also work closely together with the Villa Aurora - a German cultural institution in Pacific Palisades - which invites young writers, film makers, and artists many of whom come from Berlin. 64 - REACTING TO THE PAST. In \"Reacting to the Past,\" students participate in role-playing games that enable them to relive important intellectual debates in three separate historical moments. In \"Threshold of Democracy: Athens in 403 B.C.,\" students draw on Plato's Republic as well as excerpts from Thucydides, Xenophon, and other contemporary sources to debate the prospects for Athenian democracy in the wake of the Peloponnesian War. In \"Rousseau, Burke, and Revolution in France,\" students enter the intellectual and political currents that surged through revolutionary Paris in 1791. And in \"Defining a Nation: India on the Eve of Independence, 1945,\" students participate in the struggle to reconcile religious identity with nation building, perhaps the most intractable and important issue of the modern world. 65 - MUSIC AND TRANCE: HOW MUSIC INFLUENCES THE ECSTATIC STATE THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE. This course explores the relationship between music and consciousness in different world cultures with the intention of developing an understanding of the role that music plays in ecstatic experiences. This course draws on ethnomusicology, psychology, anthropology, dance ethnology, and religious studies. 66 - IGNITING SOCIAL CHANGE. Because law is deeply entwined in our political, economic, and social worlds, the pursuit of social change invariably intersects with law. This course seeks to engage students who wish to understand how law can be harnessed for social change. We will consider the ways in which the adversarial dynamics of our legal system influence policy choices between means and ends, the role of lawyers as social change agents, and the nature of legal conflict in defining racial, ethnic, gender and economic hierarchies. We will use interdisciplinary readings, films, experiential learning, and case studies. Students will work closely with faculty and peers to plan and facilitate class sessions. Students will also be required to attend events outside of the course meeting times. 67 - BLACK PARIS: THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE AND THE FRENCH CONNECTION 128During the early 20th century Paris was a center of intellectual activity for writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance as well as Caribbean and African thinkers. This course will examine the international elements of the Harlem Renaissance, addressing themes such as Jazz Age Paris, the Pan-African congress, Negritude and Garveyism. Readings will include works by and about figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, Josephine Baker and L\u00e9opold Senghor. 68 - PERFORMING PERFORMANCE. It can be argued that, since the Renaissance, theater artists have been communally and delightedly inspired by a certain subject: themselves. From the plays within Shakespeare's plays A Midsummer Night's Dream and Hamlet to Pirandello's meta-theatrical examinations of self in Six Characters in Search of an Author and Tonight We Improvise to Broadway's send- ups of the production process Noises Off and The Producers - no theatrical subject matter intrigues quite like the making of theater. What are these artists saying about the nature of their own art form? Where do they converge? How do they differ? What is so consistently alluring about the act of performance? Students will explore these questions and various plays through in-class readings, artist visits and attendance at live performance. 69 - FROM THE PHONOGRAPH TO AUTO-TUNE: EXPLORING THE CULTURES OF RECORDED MUSIC. Writing in 1906, the American composer John Phillip Sousa expressed grave concerns about what he termed the \"menace of mechanical music.\" According to Sousa, the advent of devices like the player piano and the phonograph threatened to remove \"the human skill, intelligence, and soul\" from music and reduce it to little more than \"a mathematical system of megaphones, wheels, cogs, disks, and cylinders.\" More than a century later, musicians and audiences today have embraced musical technology in ways that would have been inconceivable in Sousa's time. How did the introduction of such technologies transform musical culture at the turn of the twentieth century? And how has the subsequent development of new musical technologies changed the way people both produce and listen to music? Through the examination of a diverse range of literature, films, archival materials, and sound recordings, this course will explore the complex and continually evolving relationship between music and technology\u2014from the primitive phonograph introduced by Thomas Edison in 1877 to vibrant culture of digital sampling, MP3s, and Auto-Tune of the present day. 70 - JAPAN AND KOREA THROUGH FILM AND FICTION Through the mediums of cinema and fiction, this course will introduce students to the similar, yet vastly distinct, societies and histories of Korea and Japan. In addition to work from great storytellers such as Ozu Yasujiro, Natsume Soseki, Lee Changdong, Mansik, we will look at some less \"celebrated\" and perhaps more popular works. At the end of the semester, it is my hope that students will not only come out with a better understanding, but more importantly a greater appreciation and interest in the Korean and Japanese peoples. 71 - WRITERS AND READERS. Why do we write, if not to communicate with a reader? Readers can be anyone: yourself, someone you know, someone you hope to meet, or a whole group of people whose expectations you must imagine, and whose responses you may never see. In this course, we'll 129explore expectations of writers and readers in academic contexts (standardized tests, classwork, disciplinary scholarship), personal writing (personal statements, cover letters, statements of purpose), professional writing (memos, proposals, reports), journalism (stories, reviews, commentary), and creative writing (blogs, fiction, non-fiction, genre fiction, poetry). We'll experiment with a variety of essay styles and writing development tools to translate writer-centered work into reader-centered work, with an emphasis on reader feedback, revision, and reflection. Whether you were an excellent writer in high school, a writer who hated the formulas of high school essays who wants to reclaim your connection to your writing, or a writer whose exposure to conventions of academic writing was limited in high school, this workshop-focused course can help you find your voice as a writer; improve your understanding of professors' and other readers' expectations for writing; boost your confidence in your own abilities as a reader, writer, and scholar; and help you design your own path to mastery of effective writing. This course is for all students who want to master a broad range of writing styles and situations, and it is of particular benefit to students who prepared for college outside the US. 72 - JUSTICE PERFORMED: THE FEEDBACK LOOP BETWEEN LAW AND PERFORMANCE This course addresses the fluid boundary between law and performance. We will think through how performances of law influence legal practice and vice versa. We will also interrogate how theater provides an alternative site for the performance of justice - one that may satisfy needs that go unmet in state and federal courts. To do this we will not only attend an actual trial at a Los Angeles courthouse, but we will also study past trials and their dramatizations, such as the Scopes trial and Inherit the Wind, the McCarthy hearings and The Crucible, the trials of Oscar Wilde and Gross Indecency, and the 2010 federal legal battle against California's Proposition 8 and Dustin Lance Black's play 8 -- to name a few. We will put these plays and trial transcripts into conversation with contemporary theater, performance and legal criticism, while also thinking about how our own needs and impressions of justice have been, or can be, staged in and through performance. Other Cultral Studies Program Courses CSP 98 - Experiencing Los Angeles Cultures This course is designed to expose students to some of the many cultures of Los Angeles, a vibrant microcosm of the \"complex, interdependent, pluralistic world\" of the 21st century described in Occidental College's mission statement. Students may acquire one semester unit of credit for participating in five off-campus \"cultural encounters\" during a semester. Students will select these events from a list compiled each year by the Core Program in consultation with the Center for Community Based Learning and faculty teaching courses focusing on Los Angeles. A short two-page paper is due on the last day of class. This course is graded CR/NC only and will not meet specific Major/Minor or Core requirements. Students may take this course twice, for a maximum of two units being applied toward graduation. 1 unit CSP 99 - Experiencing the Arts This course is designed to expose students to the arts, to broaden their cultural horizons, and to instill in them a desire to expand their knowledge of and attention to the arts. In addition, the 130course is designed to prepare students for life-long learning, for engaging in their communities, and for having the basis for further exploration in the field of the arts. Students may acquire one semester unit of credit for attending eight on-campus events during a semester. Students will select these events from a list of events compiled each year by the Arts Committee; at least two of the events attended must combine an arts presentation with a lecture or discussion by the artist or a faculty member. A short two-page paper is due on the last day of class. This course is graded CR/NC only and will not meet specific Major/Minor or Core requirements. Students may take this course twice, for a maximum of two units being applied toward graduation. 1 unit Faculty Regular Faculty John Swift Associate Dean for Curriculum and Student Issues; English and Comparative Literary Studies; Core Program; Advisory Committee, Urban and Environmental Policy B.A., Middlebury College M.A., Ph.D., University of Virginia Critical Theory & Social Justice Critical Theory - Social Justice (CTSJ) is fundamentally interdisciplinary, drawing on ideas from across traditional academic disciplines. \"Critical\" refers to various bodies of theory and method?Marxism, psychoanalysis, the Frankfurt School, deconstruction, critical race studies, queer theory, feminist theory, postcolonial theory, and intersectionality?that interrogate the essentialist assumptions that underlie social identities. \"Social justice\" refers to an extrajuridical concept of fairness that is focused on exposing and ending social inequalities. The aim of the Critical Theory - Social Justice department is to promote understanding of how categories such as \"race\", \"sexual orientation,\" and \"nationality\" help people recognize and combat some injustices and hinder them from recognizing and combating others. The department's course offerings are divided into three levels: 100-level classes teach students how to think critically about a wide range of topics, including race, gender, sexuality, and nationality. 200-level classes teach students how to participate in a seminar, including how to contribute to class discussion and how to research and write a scholarly paper. 300-level classes teach students a major body of critical theory or a research methodology. Requirements 131MAJOR: The major in Critical Theory - Social Justice requires ten courses (40 units) selected in consultation with the student's departmental advisor, based on the student's own particular approach to the major as defined in the student's major declaration. Of the ten courses, at least five must be offered by the CTSJ Department, including at least one 4-unit course at the 100 level, one at the 200 level, two at the 300 level, and the Senior Seminar (CTSJ 490). At least four of the units must be in experiential learning. ACCEPTABLE COURSES FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS: The department regularly accepts for CTSJ credit courses from other departments. Decisions (about which courses to accept) are made on an individual basis in consultation with the student's advisor, and/or the department chair. MAJOR WITH TOPICAL EMPHASIS: A student may choose to major in Critical Theory - Social Justice with an emphasis in one of three areas: Critical Race Studies, Postcolonial Theory, and Feminist and Queer Studies. Choosing one of those emphases is not required, but upon declaring the CTSJ major, each student is required to submit a major declaration that outlines what the student defines as the student's goals for completing the major. To graduate with an emphasis, a student must fulfill the requirements of the major (see above) and at least twenty of the student's forty major units must be recognized by the Department as counting toward the student's emphasis. These twenty units are chosen in consultation with the student's advisor. Courses from other departments may be counted toward the student's emphasis. MINOR: The minor in Critical Theory - Social Justice requires five courses (20 units), including at least one course offered by the CTSJ Department at the 100 level, one at the 200 level, and one at the 300 level. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Critical Theory - Social Justice satisfy the final component of Occidental College's college-wide writing requirement by submitting a portfolio by the eighth week of spring semester of the junior year. A portfolio consists of two essays, one a research paper (written for a 200-level CTSJ class) and one an analytical essay (written for a 300-level CTSJ class). At least one of the essays should relate to the comprehensive project that the student plans to complete during his or her senior year. A student whose portfolio is not accepted by the department will be required to take ENWR 401: Writing Across the Curriculum in the fall semester of the student's senior year. See the Writing program and the department chair for additional information. EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING REQUIREMENT (4 units): Credit for this component may be earned through participation in a departmentally-approved internship or by completing a community-based learning course offered by CTSJ or another department. Students will work with their advisors to determine how to fulfill this requirement in the context of their own courses of study as defined in their major declarations. SENIOR COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT : In their senior year, students majoring in CTSJ are required to complete a comprehensive project concerning a topic of the student's own particular interest. Students produce drafts of their projects during CTSJ 490: Senior Seminar in the fall semester of their senior year. (A student graduating in December is encouraged to take 490 in his or her third-to-last semester, rather than in the last semester.) Each student is directed to consult with at least one CTSJ professor in addition to the professor teaching the 132senior seminar. The final version of the comprehensive project is due the Friday before spring (or midterm) break of the student's final semester. A typical project culminates in a 20- to 25-page paper. The department is open to critical projects of comparable length that employ other media from students formally trained in those media. A comprehensive project earns the grade \"Pass with Distinction\" if the department faculty determine that it is of the quality publishable in the CTSJ Journal or another journal in the fields embraced by Critical Theory- Social Justice. HONORS: A student with the minimum overall GPA set by the College for honors and a 3.70 GPA in the courses that count toward the student's major in CTSJ, may apply to enter the department's honors program. To apply for honors a student must choose a department faculty member who agrees to supervise the student's research, and the student must submit a 2- to 3-page prospectus, defining the student's research topic and outlining a plan for completion. To graduate with departmental honors, a student must enroll in CTSJ 499: Honors Thesis during the senior year. The student must also maintain the GPAs required for departmental honors and complete the Senior Comprehensive requirement (see above). An honors thesis earns the grade \"pass with distinction\" if the department faculty determine that it is of the quality publishable in the CTSJ Journal or another journal in the fields embraced by Critical Theory- Social Justice. Courses 101 - Critical Theory - Social Justice Colloquium The Critical Theory-Social Justice Colloquium introduces students to the CTSJ major. Students will engage with topics and materials in the areas of emphasis within the major: Critical Race Studies, Gender and Queer Studies, and Postcolonial Studies. All CTSJ faculty will engage with students in this course. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 105 - Immigration and Education This course will locate the topic of immigration and education within historical, legislative, and cultural debates on what it means to be an American and who has the right to an Education. Students will explore and debate precedent-setting Supreme Court cases, such as Mendez v. Westminster, which challenged the segregation of Mexican children into separate schools, and Lau v. Nichols, which fought hard for non-English speaking students to have linguistic access to the public school curricula. In addition, students will research the historical antecedents to the recent anti-immigrant movements in California, Arizona, and Colorado, which target the use of languages other than English in school settings, and have all but abolished bilingual public schools. Against this historical and legislative backdrop, students will examine ethnographic research detailing the persistent challenges that immigrant children face in schooling, including migrant children, and the ways in which they, their parents, and communities experience those challenges. Satisfies the experiential learning requirement 106 - Representing the Metropolis In the US, roughly 80% of the population lives in urban regions (2000 US Census), while according to United Nations figures, about 52% of people are urban-dwellers worldwide. This course will examine various representations of the modern metropolis through film, literature, 133and cultural theory. The city, as we experience it today is the product of multiple historical, cultural, and social forces. Over the course of the semester, we will consider how cities have been shaped by these forces, as well as how they, in turn, shape our own experience and understanding of culture, history, and social practices. In an era of increasing globalization and mobility, the role of the metropolis continues to evolve and expand. As we consider representations of the city in a variety of films and novels from around the world, including some from our own city of Los Angeles, we will interrogate the ways in which the city has played a formative role in how we imagine life in the contemporary moment. In what ways has the city become a vehicle for the production of culture? How does life in the city serve to normativize certain notions of what it means to live in the modern world? How does life in rural spaces complicate representations of modernity that take the city as their norm? Does the city promote accessibility, or, alternatively, does it rigidify codes of exclusivity? These are some of the many questions we will address as we consume a spectrum of world cinema and literature. As we work our way through the material, we will strive to develop a complex understanding of how cities shape our cultural imagination. Emphasis topic: Postcolonial Theory. Same as ECLS 106 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 140 - Critical Theories of Sexuality This course introduces students to critical theories concerning human sexuality. We read feminist, Marxist, psychoanalytic, structuralist, and poststructuralist theories of sexuality and discuss what makes each of these theories \"critical.\" Topics include the political economy of marriage, the relation between sexuality and procreation, uses of the erotic, homosociality, and the incitement to discourse. The authors we read include Engels, Freud, de Beauvoir, L\u00e9vi- Strauss, Gayle Rubin, Andrea Dworkin, Foucault, and Judith Butler. Emphasis Topic: Queer Studies. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 180 - Stupidity Stupidity is neither ignorance nor organicity, but rather, a corollary of knowing and an element of normalcy, the double of intelligence rather than its opposite. It is an artifact of our nature as finite beings and one of the most powerful determinants of human destiny. Stupidity is always the name of the Other, and it is the sign of the feminine. This course in Critical Psychology follows the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Gilles Deleuze, and most recently, Avital Ronell, in a philosophical examination of those operations and technologies that we conduct in order to render ourselves uncomprehending. Stupidity, which has been evicted from the philosophical premises and dumbed down by psychometric psychology, has returned in the postmodern discourse against Nation, Self, and Truth and makes itself felt in political life ranging from the presidency to Beavis and Butthead. This course examines stupidity. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 186 - Introduction to Critical Theory This course introduces critical theory in the context of the problem of social justice. Introductions will be made to psychoanalytic, Marxist, Feminist, Structuralist, Deconstructive, and Postcolonial Criticism. Reader-responses, New Criticism, lesbian, gay, and queer criticism will also be surveyed. There will be close readings of the work of Louis Althusser, Georges 134Bataille, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida as well as in depth readings of essays by Guy Hocquenghem, Julia Kristeva, and Trinh T. Minh-ha. 210 - Mother Goose to Mash-Ups: Children's Literature and Popular Texts Why did the London Bridge fall down? Is Rub-a-dub-dub really about bath time? Why didn't an old man live in a shoe? Who is more imperialist, Babar or Peter Pan? Is Tinky Winky gay? Is South Park a children's show? Is Harry Potter a Hero? How tired was Rosa Parks? Using different critical approaches, this course will examine children's poetry, picture books, novels, cartoons, feature films, and music videos. Analysis will include topics related to gender, race, culture, and nation, as they play out in the aesthetics, images, and poetics of children's texts. Emphasis topic: Critical Race Theory CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 211 - Critical Pedagogy Critical pedagogy aims to develop collective critical consciousness for the purpose of transforming oppressive socio-political conditions. In this course, students will study critical pedagogy from historical, political, and sociological perspectives. Students in the course will consider traditional student/teacher relationships, pedagogical approaches, as well as hierarchies of knowledge promulgated by schools and textbook publishers. Students will analyze and critique theories of the Frankfurt School and the emancipatory works of Paolo Freire, the most renowned critical pedagogist. Additionally, contemporary readings from Henry Giroux, bell hooks, and Peter McLaren will focus on critical pedagogy in relation to social structures, globalization, media, and race. Emphasis topic: Postcolonial Theory CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 215 - Critical Discourse Analysis This seminar introduces students to discourse analysis as the ontological and epistemological deconstruction of every day language and symbols and their relationship to power. Throughout the course, students develop techniques for gathering and analyzing multimodal transcripts of naturally occurring conversations, interviews, discourses in institutional settings, media discourses, and texts of historical materials. The course draws from systemic functional linguistics, genre/text studies, multi-modal semiotics, interactional sociolinguistics, and critical social theory to understand how linguistic features of texts constitute and are constituted by the social, cultural and local relations, processes and contexts in which they are embedded. Using a seminar format, students will engage the readings and apply discourse analysis strategies in order to develop their own independent qualitative research projects. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 222 - Body Politics The course offers an interdisciplinary analysis of gender, power, and the body. The theoretical center of the course will be Foucault's work on biopower, including Discipline and Punish and Foucault 2.0. Topics include: class and the body (Atwood, Bodily Harm, and Larsen, Passing); law and the female body (Wendy Williams, Mary Poovey); science and gender (Emily Martin, Thomas Laqueur); pornography (Catherine McKinnon, Laura Kipnis); race, body, and gender (Morrison, Beloved; Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler); multiculturalism and cross-race 135identifications Imitation of Life, Wyatt, \"The Hazards of ldealization\"); and, Latin American perspectives on gender, torture, and memory. Prerequisite: at least sophomore standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 230 - Fundamentals of Queer Theory This class is designed to introduce the classical texts of Anglo-American queer theory as well as explore recent trends in the field. While situating queer theory's 1990s academic advent in its historical context of identity politics, the emergence of the AIDS pandemic, and the U.S. \"culture wars,\" the course will begin by reviewing crucial antecedents in gay and lesbian studies, psychoanalysis, and the interventions of Michel Foucault. Readings will include works by Judith Butler, Eve Sedgwick, Leo Bersani, Lee Edelman, and Teresa de Lauretis. Additional readings will trace recent debates about \"what is still queer in queer theory?\" as critics engage ongoing questions about neoliberalism, homonormativity, and politics in the 21st century. Emphasis topic: Feminist and Queer Studies. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 232 - Introduction to Cultural Studies This course introduces the methodologies and key theories of Cultural Studies, focusing on analyses of popular cultural and subcultures. Readings will include selections from Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, bell hooks, Jean Baudrillard, Guy Deborg, Stuart Hall, Matthew Arnold, Raymond Williams, J. Halberstam, Michel de Certeau, Henry Louis Gates, Inderpal Grewal, Oliver Sacks and others. We will focus on non-traditional academic disciplines and media including television studies, new media theory, performance studies, history of science, fashion, cartoons, built environments, slang, and fan culture with the intention of honing rigorous research skills and critical argumentation. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 233 - Queer Literature and Culture This course introduces students to literary questions of queerness, canonization, and nation in the context of the United States' twentieth century discourses about homosexuality. Students will critically examine the production of certain ideas of the nation through literature by examining questions raised through queer texts. The course will run concurrently with CTSJ 333: The Queer Novel; assignments for CTSJ 233 will be designed for a 200-level course. Emphasis Topic: Feminist and Queer Studies . CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 255 - Women of Color This course will examine intersecting and overlapping categories of \"difference\" by focusing on the lives of women of color. By looking at conditions that shape race, sexuality, gender, class, and cultural differences, this class will critically examine multiple discourses surrounding feminism, anti-racism, heteronormativity, and critiques of imperialism. We will consider contexts of individual and collective work for social change. Using personal essays, stories, scholarly writings, artistic works, music, film, and other media, the course will look at sources that women of color draw from to ground themselves and their activist work. Emphasis topic: 136Critical Race Studies or Feminist and Queer Studies. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 257 - Critical Praxis: Voice, Memory, and Community Transformation This course will employ community-based research strategies to engage students with questions of \"voice;\" dynamics of race, gender and class; and multiple perspectives that shape understandings of community transformation. Students in the course will work with community partners to develop and implement a research project. Satisfies the experiential learning requirement CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 259 - Bodies for Exchange: Migrations, Markets, Politics This course examines movements of bodies through political, legal, economic, and social exchanges. Drawing from a variety of materials (theory, literature, film), the course examines practices such as human trafficking, organ transplantation, transnational adoption, and surrogacy. Emphasis topic: Critical Race Studies or Postcolonial Theory. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 280 - Critical and Post-Colonial Theory in the Afro-Caribbean This course will examine the character of postcolonial theory in the Afro-Caribbean. Particular attention will be paid to the work of C.L.R. James, Walter Rodney, Franz Fanon, Marcus Garvey, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, Eric Williams, Kamau Brathwaite, and Bob Marley. The course will also examine Rastafari as a religio-political protest movement. We will chart the musicological development of Reggae and Dub Poetry as distinctive expressions of Rasta. Prerequisite: a 100-level CTSJ class. Emphasis topic: Postcolonial Theory. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 285 - Foucault This course will cover the early writings of Michel Foucault, paying particular attention to his psychological writings. We will conduct a close reading of \"Madness and Civilization\". Prerequisite: a 100-level CTSJ class 286 - Whiteness This course seeks to engage the emergent body of scholarship designated to deconstruct whiteness. It will examine the construction of whiteness in the historic, legal, and economic contexts which have allowed it to function as an enabling condition for privilege and race- based prejudice. Particular attention will be paid to the role of religion and psychology in the construction of whiteness. Texts will include Race Traitor , Critical White Studies , The Invention of the White Race , The Abolition of Whiteness , White Trash , and Even the Rat was White . Prerequisite: a 100-level CTSJ class. Emphasis topic: Critical Race Theory. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 295 - Topics in Critical Theory-Social Justice 137This seminar will engage important topics and issues in Critical Theory ? Social Justice. All CTSJ faculty will participate in order to facilitate an interdisciplinary engagement with complexities and nuances of these topics. Students from other CTSJ courses will be invited to participate in the construction of discourse around the topics. Topics might include Whiteness, Theory-Practice (Critical Theory - Social Justice), and Representation-Embodiment. Prerequisite: a 100-level CTSJ course or permission of instructor. Materialist Feminism. Is there such a thing as a \"woman's condition\" and can that condition be explained by examining the economic dimensions of women's history? Is the violence that people are disproportionately exposed to based on gender, race, sex, and sexuality only a tool in the production and reproduction of economic classes or do these identities and experiences require an analytic framework that transcends economic relations? In this course we will consider a particular intellectual tradition that engages these questions: Materialist Feminism. We will begin our readings by considering texts by Marx and Engels that form the backbone of this tradition. We will then consider texts from American, British, and Italian traditions of thought and activism that include feminists working in national and transnational Women of Color traditions. Readings will include Mich\u00e8le Barrett, Hazel Carby, Carolyn J. Eichner, Silvia Federici, Combahee River Collective, Mariarosa Dalla Costa and Selma James, Angela Davis, Friedrich Engels, Rosa Luxemberg, Karl Marx, Heidi Hartmann and Denise Riley. Emphasis Topic: Feminist and Queer Studies. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: US DIVERSITY Property: Public and Private . From Defoe's \"kept\" woman, to Austen's marriage market; Melville's slave vessel, to Gaskell's factory floor, and finally to Woolf's manor house, \"Property: Public and Private,\" examines the way in which novels depict owned things and scenes of work. Through the depictions that constitute this thematic thread however, these novels also provoke interrogation of the concept \"property.\" Can people be bought and sold? Are families units of labor? Whose economic and emotional conditions interest our novelists and how do these authorial choices guide our readings? CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE Soc. Movements/Representational Forms In this course, we will examine the competing advocacy, within social movements, for documentary, fiction, journalism, lyric, abstraction, and other representational forms. For each social movement or political issue that we cover, students will compare multiple modes of representation, considering why they emerged, what their strengths and weaknesses were at each specific conjuncture, and what significance they have for future struggles. We will begin with some theoretical grounding and then proceed via a set of case studies: these may include debates about realism vs. modernism in the Frankfurt school, testimonios in Latin America, confession vs. experimentation in feminist literature, reportage vs. the essay in journalism, and slogans, songs, and posters in queer activism.n this course, we will examine the competing advocacy, within social movements, for documentary, fiction, journalism, lyric, abstraction, and other representational forms.

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 138 310 - Qualitative Interview Methods This course is designed to introduce students to the methods and approaches used in qualitative interviewing. In addition to structured interviews, students learn about semi- structured, biographical, and narrative interviewing methods. The course also explores the ethical dilemmas and research challenges inherent during interviewing, as well as the details of conducting qualitative interviews. By the end of the semester, each student will have constructed, modified, conducted, analyzed, and written up an interview study. Satisfies the experiential learning requirement. 311 - Children, Poverty, and Public Policies In this course, students examine contemporary child poverty both in the United States and abroad. Topics include how poverty is defined both locally and globally, the numbers and distribution of poor children, as well as the causes of child poverty. Readings explore poverty in relation to education, economics, homelessness, child labor, family, gender, and race. Students analyze historical anti-poverty policies such as the New Deal, the War on Poverty, and the United Nations Convention on the rights of the child, as well as contemporary proposals to reduce child poverty such as childcare, welfare, job training, job creation, and tax policy. Emphasis topic: Postcolonial Theory CORE REQUIREMENT: INTERCULTURAL ? UNITED STATES and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 312 - Language, Literacy and Culture This course combines theory and practice in the study of language and literacy across cultures and institutions. It will introduce students to competing theories of language and literacy development and the politics that undergird those theories. The course will also explore topics such as gender, race, culture, and ethnicity as they intersect and shape language learning. Students will learn about language acquisition, heritage languages, language variation, dialects, and bilingualism. The course will also explore controversies surrounding multimodal literacies involving speech, writing, drawing, pictures, video, and music. Prerequisite: Junior Standing CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 320 - Culture and Community This class provides an opportunity for students who wish to continue and deepen their intellectual and community work to interact with a highly-motivated small group of students and community activists and organizations. Topics we will examine will be determined in consultation with community partners. Students will work together on a significant final project that links academic learning and community praxis and engagement. Satisfies experiential learning requirement. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 332 - Psychic Life of Violence 139Sigmund Freud's intervention in personal sexual life often overshadows how psychoanalysis uniquely theorized violence in the context of two World Wars. This course will consider how contemporary social justice issues might be informed by psychoanalytic concepts including aggressivity, group identification, neighbor relations, and altruism. Readings include Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, Beyond the Pleasure Principle, and key essays; Franz Fanon's anti-racist masterpiece Black Skin, White Masks; Melanie Klein's studies of negative affect; queer theory's relation to the death drive; and essays by contemporary critical theorists grappling with the ongoing problems of war, racism, class conflict, and sexual violence. Prerequisite: 200-level CTSJ course CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 333 - The Queer Novel This course addresses literary questions of queerness, canonization, and nation in the context of the United States' twentieth century discourses about homosexuality. To reframe Eve Sedgwick's famous question about queer literature, the course asks, has the twentieth-century U. S. produced a gay Socrates, Shakespeare, or Proust? While acknowledging that poetry, drama, film, memoir, \"zines,\" television, and the Internet have increasingly provided more salient outlets for queer content, this course traces the nationalist ideology of \"the Great American Novel\" through queer negotiations with the genre. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing or higher. Emphasis topic: Feminist and Queer studies CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 335 - The Queer of Color Critique This course examines the emergent field of queer of color critique. Combining woman of color feminism with queer theory, queer of color critique analyzes intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and class through interdisciplinary methodologies. This course will engage essential background and formative essays including the texts of Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Gloria Anzald\u00faa, and Chandra Mohanty; cultural instances of race and sexuality's crossings in work by James Baldwin, Cheryl Dunye, and Issac Julien; and recent critical work by such contemporary theorists as Roderick Ferguson, Jasbir Puar, and Queer Studies. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and US DIVERSITY 337 - Queer of Los Angeles This seminar is designed to uncover genealogies of sexuality in Los Angeles and Southern California by examining diverse archives and cultural sites. We will study histories of gays and lesbians in the film industry; connections and conflicts around local bar scenes; leftist homophile organizing and the mainstreaming of homosexual identities; the economic and social worlds of queer sex workers; and sociologies of queer demographics and architectures. Students will be encouraged to conduct primary research in archives and engage in community organizing around the city while honing skills in their chosen critical methodologies. Satisfies the experiential learning requirement . Prerequisite: any 100- or 200-level CTSJ Emphasis topic: Feminist and Queer Studies. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 340 - Critical Ethnography 140In this course students learn how to do ethnographic research and writing by conducting exercises in participant-observation on or near campus. We review the history of the ethnographic method and its relation to anthropology and the colonial encounter. We also discuss what makes an ethnography critical and the tensions between ethnography sympathy and critical theory. Authors we read include Malinowski, Geertz, Delmos Jones, Dorinne Prerequisite: a Emphasis topic: Postcolonial Theory. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 355 - Boundaries and Borderlands This course employs postcolonial theory to consider transformations of religions and cultures that occur when physical, experiential, geographic, and intellectual borders are crossed and blurred. How are cultures and \"differences\" named? From what locations? We consider cultural hybridities, re-mapped borders of culture and difference, postcoloniality, transnational migrations, and other postmodern conditions as sources for reconceiving identities, relationships between religions and cultures, and social transformations. Prerequisite: a 200-level CTSJ class. Emphasis topic: Postcolonial theory. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 357 - Law and Empire This course employs interpretive tactics from critical legal theory and critical race theory in order to examine the use of law to justify and sustain U.S. colonial/imperial projects. We will look at how these projects are connected to the control of domestic populations (especially indigenous and racialized groups) and the expanding desire for territory. We will look at questions about nation, state, and sovereignty; law and hegemony; and relationships between \"change\" and maintenance of the same in legal discourse. The course will also investigate relationships between globalization, international legal regimes, and new forms of Empire. We will consider specific topics that raise questions about ongoing operations of and resistances to imperialism, including trafficking in persons, sovereignty and indigenous people's rights, the legal status of territories and protectorates and the selective use of the U.S. Constitution in those locations, and issues rising from the \"war on terror.\" Prerequisite: a 200-level CTSJ class. Emphasis topic: Critical Race Theory or Postcolonial Theory. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 369 - Clinical Psychology Laboratory The Clinical Psychology Laboratory (CPL) provides experiential opportunities for students interested in graduate study in psychology, law, and social justice. Students are given the opportunity to participate in the data analysis of clinical psychological assessments. Students will also participate in research under a Human Studies Committee approved project, with the goal for an early exposure to the field, and with the objective to yield research data for presentation or publication. In some projects, students may have limited opportunities to observe and participate in forensic psychological assessments as prescribed in the respective protocols. Prerequisite: instructor interview and approval required. May be repeated three times for credit. 2 units 141370 - Marx, Freud, and the Frankfurt School This seminar will explore the origins of the world famous Frankfurt School, a group of German social philosophers and theoreticians which emerged at the Institute for Social research of the University of Frankfurt am Main in the 1920s who wanted a) to analyze the conditions of modern capitalism and its impact on society in general, on family and social structures, value systems and mass culture, b) critically review the theories of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and Max Weber, and c) to establish the principles and foundations of a 'critical theory.' We'll read and discuss major works by Max Horkheimer, Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Siegfried Kracauer, Leo Loewenthal and others. The seminar will focus on the 'first phase' of the Frankfurt School, its beginnings and its work and development during the thirties and forties - when the school relocated to New York and many of its collaborators lived in other American cities or abroad - and the immediate post WWII period. (A second seminar will follow next year and explore the school's development and its world wide impact in the sixties and seventies.) The course is taught in English. Students minoring or majoring in German will read some of the original texts (especially Marx, Freud, Benjamin, and Kracauer) in German. Prerequisite:Junior/senior standing. Same as GERM 370 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 380 - Psycho Analysis: Freud The work of Sigmund Freud continues to be of signal importance to students of literature, psychology, and feminist social theory. This course is designed to provide students with an in depth knowledge of his work as a model of intellectual courage and as a great and problematic achievement of the human imagination. The course will rely on the work of historian Peter Gay, Freud, a Life for our Time, for a well-contextualized treatment of Sigmund Freud's life and work. There will be close readings of three of Freud's seminal works, The Interpretation of Dreams, Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, and Beyond the Pleasure Principle. We will also read two case studies central to the emergent feminist critique and re-analysis of Freud's work: Anna O. and Dora, an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria. In addition to critically evaluating his contributions to contemporary thought, this course will employ Freud as a great writer. The assignments will therefore emphasize the recognition and imitation of Freud's skill as a writer. There will be four writing assignments from the different psychoanalytic genres: case history, dream interpretation, death-wish analysis, and an exercise in psychoanalytic theory. The course will be taught as a seminar with an emphasis on student participation. Prerequisite: a 200-level CTSJ class. Emphasis topic: Feminist and Queer Studies. Satisfies experiential learning requirement. 384 - Bataille A close reading of the works of Georges Bataille, including The Impossible, The Unfinished System of Nonknowledge, The Accursed Share, On Nietzsche, Story of the Eye, The Dead Man, and Collected Poems. Prerequisite: 1st year students cannot enroll in this class. 386 - Critical Blackness Critical Race Theorists have begun to describe \"critical blackness,\" post- blackness,\" and \"unforgivable blackness.\" This emergent scholarship, which describes a feminist New Black Man, also seeks to \"queer blackness\" and to articulate a black sexual 142politics that addresses a \"new racism.\" By calling us to examine the possibility of a black political solidarity that escapes the problems of identity politics, this scholarship provokes We Who Are Dark to imagine more complex and free identities. This course invites all of us to engage this scholarship. 395 - Special Topics in Critical Theory - Social Justice An advanced seminar in Critical Theory - Social Justice. Prerequisite: a 200-level class in CTSJ or permission of instructor. May be repeated for credit. 395 - Cosmopolitanism & Identity: Kwami Anthony Appiah This 2-unit seminar offers students the opportunity to engage the works of the 2011 graduation commencement speaker Kwame Anthony Appiah. The course will focus on Appiah's writing on the concepts of cosmopolitanism and identity, paying particular attention to how these developments challenge the mission of Occidental College. Several distinguished faculty from across Occidental's majors will join the CTSJ faculty in an interdisciplinary exploration of the ways in which collective identities such as race, gender, social class, and ethnicity constrain or enable freedom, individuality and a global awareness. Additionally, the course will consider the evolution of cosmopolitanism as it relates to multiculturalism, and interrogate the power of multiculturalism to ground an adequate ethic \"in a world of strangers. 2 Units CORE REQUIREMENT MET: PARTIAL INTERCULTURAL 397 - Independent Study in CTSJ Prerequisite: permission of instructor. 2 or 4 units 490 - Senior Seminar in Critical Theory - Social Justice This course is offered in conjunction with CTSJ majors' ongoing research for the senior thesis. Seminar meetings will be devoted to discussion and critique of students' work in progress and to close readings of a select few texts in Critical Theory - Social Justice. Prerequisite: senior CTSJ majors only. 499 - Honors Project in Critical Theory - Social Justice Prerequisite: permission of the department.

Brown University, Ph.D. U.S.C. Diplomacy & World Affairs DWA is Occidental College's nationally recognized International Relations major. This innovative department grounds students in IR theory, security and human security, international organizations, economic development, and case studies regarding state-building, nationalism, religion, identity and ethnic conflict. Recognizing the variety of academic connections that can inform the study of global politics, offerings in the Economics, History, Politics, Religious Studies, and Urban and Environmental Policy departments can be used by students to supplement the the DWA major's core offerings. The Chevalier Program in DWA was established in 1957 by the late Mrs. Stuart Chevalier to honor the memory of her husband, a distinguished lawyer and pioneer leader on behalf of the United Nations, who for 19 years served as a member of Occidental's Board of Trustees. The program is one of the few undergraduate interdisciplinary majors in international relations offered at a Liberal Arts institution such as Occidental. OCCIDENTAL-AT-THE-UNITED NATIONS: DWA students are strongly encouraged to participate in study and research programs abroad and on Occidental's UN program in New York. Students interested in this rich array of opportunities should work with an advisor to plan their curriculum to include language and other prerequisite courses as early as possible CAREERS: Opportunities of interest to DWA graduates include service with U.S. government agencies, such as the Department of State and the Foreign Service, the Peace Corps, the Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Defense, and Central Intelligence Agency, as well as careers with the United Nations or one of its affiliated agencies, and in the non-governmental organization (NGO) community. Students also have an opportunity to prepare themselves for work in the general fields of international business and banking, law, or the academic world. 144Requirements MAJOR: The major in Diplomacy and World Affairs has two main components: a core of courses required of all students (taken in the departments of DWA, Economics, and languages), and an additional set of upper-division electives, focusing on specific topics in international relations. All DWA majors must take the following: 1. DWA 101, DWA 201, and DWA 490. 2. Economics 101, 102 and either DWA 220 or Econ 311. 3. The equivalent of four college semesters of one language, two college semesters each of two languages. 4. One 300 level DWA course listed in the course catalog under \"junior seminar\" to meet the junior writing seminar requirement (note: not all 300 level classes fulfill the junior writing seminar requirement 5. Four additional classes numbered 200 or higher in International Affairs at the College. At least three of these courses must be in DWA. By petition, department credit can be given for up to one course in international relations from a different Occidental academic department, the United Nations Program, or from study abroad. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Diplomacy and World Affairs will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's writing requirement by taking one 300-level DWA course that is listed under \"junior seminar.' These junior writing seminars will focus on preparing students to do their Senior Comprehensive Project (DWA 490) and will include substantial writing assignments and a requirement that the instructor deem a student's writing proficient. See the Writing Program for additional information on the College's writing requirements. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: Seniors will complete DWA 490 as their comprehensive requirement in the spring of their senior year. There are three options within DWA 490: Thesis: a 30-50 page thesis based on independent academic research. Policy Seminar: Small group seminar based on in-depth readings on key issues in International Relations and policy presentations by students on their topics of expertise. Film/Documentary: Production of a documentary film that advances knowledge in the IR field. To undertake the documentary option, it is a requirement that you have completed ArtF140 from the AHVA/Film department. It is recommended that you have taken at least one additional course in documentary production or theory in the AHVA/Film department, preferably ArtF242. Details on these options will be given to students during the spring of their Junior year. Students must submit a proposal for the option they hope to pursue during the fall semester of their senior year for approval by the department. HONORS: Qualified majors may achieve Departmental Honors at graduation through (a) maintenance of an overall grade point average of 3.25, with a 3.5 GPA in the major (inclusive of courses from all departments taken at Occidental that count toward fulfilling DWA major requirements. Study abroad, language, and Oxy-at-the-U.N. courses do not count toward the major GPA); and (b) completion of the comprehensive requirement with a grade of Pass with Distinction (Honors). Those interested should see the Honors Program and consult the department chair for details, preferably in the junior year. 145Courses 101 - International Relations: The Changing Rules of the Game The purposes of this course are: 1) to introduce fundamental tools and perspectives on the study of world politics, including major theories and analytical approaches to international relations; 2) to understand the historical evolution of the contemporary international system, with special emphasis on the post-World War II era; 3) to apply theoretical and conceptual understandings of international relations to current issues in world politics. Emphasis is placed on the state and trans-state foundations of contemporary international relations. We will study this in the context of such key issues as economic development, \"security\", human rights, state- building, international organizations, terrorism, and the intersection of social relations with world politics. Open to Frosh and Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors by instructor permission only 201 - International Organizations A survey of the role of international organizations in global politics. The focus will be on an in- depth study of the three themes by which the United Nations has defined itself: Security, Human Rights, and Development. Within the rubric of those three themes we will look at activities by the U.N. family of agencies, other international organizations, and NGOs on issues that include the management of violent conflict, human rights and how they have been mainstreamed into the work of international organizations, and approaches to economic underdevelopment that seek to alleviate both poverty and insecurity. Prerequisite: DWA 101. 220 - International Political Economy This course is an undergraduate survey of the field of international political economy (IPE). It is intended as an introduction for students who already have some background in the field of international relations and are interested in exploring international economic relations at a deeper level. The course covers major theoretical, empirical, and policy perspectives. The theme to be explored in this course is \"National Interest vs. Global Governance?\" - that is, we will explore the theory and history of international political economy as an extension of national interest and an arena for the development of global governance, and the question of whether or not these two dimensions of international political economy are compatible or competitive with each other. The first part of the course will cover the basic concepts and theoretical foundations of IPE. The focus is on core theoretical principles and approaches. The goal is to understand how theory is framed and \"works,\" the potential inferences of this theory, and the issues of contention within the field. The second part of the course draws on the theoretical foundations to examine a set of specific international economic issue arenas, including international trade, finance and economic development. SAME AS POLS 232 221 - International Development Against the backdrop of 840 million persons worldwide suffering from malnourishment and nearly 1.3 billion people living on less than a dollar per day, this course surveys the field of international development, wealth creation, and global welfare from an historical, global and comparative perspective. It will introduce students to the field's academic contours, building 146from the historic role of economics in pioneering and undergirding the field to a broad understanding of now inter-disciplinary field that has emerged. The multi-disciplinary and inter- disciplinary perspective of this introductory survey course is in keeping with an emerging global consensus that measures of poverty go beyond income and consumption and that poverty reduction requires bridging disciplines (economics, political science, history, anthropology, geography) and methods (quantitative and qualitative, observational and participatory). The course will be divided into two parts. During the first part of the course, students will be introduced to the main theoretical ideas on social, economic and political development that have informed the field's evolution. This will familiarize students with fundamental thinking on development as well as the frontiers of research. The second part of the course will explore some of the current debates about development. Students will analyze such debates in a rigorously multi-dimensional and inter-disciplinary manner. 229 - Intro to Human Rights: Focus on the Americas After a review of the historical, legal, and conceptual underpinnings of the international protection of human rights, students in this course will learn about human rights and mechanisms for their protection within the context of the United States and Latin America. Students will discuss key situations from the last half century involving challenges to human rights, including the phenomenon of disappearances common in Argentina and Chile in the 1970s, the application of the death penalty in the United States, and the current \"war on drugs\" in Mexico and Central America. In the course of these discussions, students will learn about national and international mechanisms for the promotion and enforcement of human rights, such as the incorporation of treaties into national law, the use of the Alien Tort Statute in the United States, and the decisions of the Inter-American Commission and Court of Human Rights. They will also have a chance to examine the United States from a double perspective: one the one hand, as a key country with a major interest and impact on human rights conditions in Latin America, and on the other, as a country with its own policy areas of struggle and progress. CORE REQUIREMENT MET - LATIN AMERICA and REGIONAL FOCUS 230 - Gender and International Human Rights This course will explore the evolution of women's rights as human rights, the struggle of women's movements to place gender-specific concerns on the international human rights agenda, and the relationship of the UN and its agencies to the broad feminist goal of advancing the political, economic, social, and cultural status of women. While \"women\" are of necessity central to the concerns of this course, the study of human rights will be approached from a gender perspective, recognizing that gender relations is key to understanding the nature, occurrence, and prevention of rights violations. Key themes to be covered in the course include the relationship between the \"crisis of masculinity\" and women's human rights; gender and economic rights, gender-based violence, and health and human rights 231 - Gender & IR This 2-credit seminar explores how assumptions of masculinity and femininity have informed foundational concepts and theories in the field of International Relations, the determination of what is considered to be worthy of investigation and what qualifies as appropriate methods of investigation, and who is (and is not) recognized as a subject of international politics. It applies 147a gender lens to practical concerns in the field, including political and economic development, the environment, human rights, and violent conflict. And it engages the tensions associated with theorizing gender and IR, given the fluidity and intersectionality of identity. In the spring, a 2-credit seminar will be offered that focuses more in-depth on the theme of gender and security. 2 units 232 - Gender & Security This 2-credit seminar explores how taking gender seriously unsettles the traditional dominance in International Relations of state-centered and military-oriented approaches to security. The course will engage questions such as: What are the consequences of women's invisibility in security theory and practice? Who is being secured by security practices? What is the relationship between gender construction, militarism, and war? How is conflict gendered? What is the relevance of gender to conflict resolution, peace-building, and post-conflict justice? 2 units 233 - Development and Human Rights in South East Asia The course will explore the tensions that have arisen in South East Asian countries between the promotion of economic development and the realization of human rights. Through case studies of Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, we will engage in critical thinking and debate, examining such topics as the legacy of colonialism in the region; state-civil society relations; the politics of religion and ethnicity; the construction of gender roles and identities; and the implications the tsunami disaster has had on both development and human rights in the region. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND EAST ASIA 234 - South African Politics This course examines the political dynamics of apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of black political opposition since the 1970s, including both militant action against the state, as well as inter-ethnic political action and violence. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST 235 - Nationalism and Ethnicity This course will explore nationalism and ethnicity from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. Nationalist and ethnic discourses have always been central to political movements, rebellions and revolutions. The passions and commitment of individual members in these movements often leads to political ideologies and war tactics that are violent and which encompasses entire communities. The course will use examples from Southern Africa, South Asia and Eastern Europe. 237 - Cuba, China, Vietnam: Communism in a Post Communism World The course will examine some of the communist countries that have survived the collapse of the Soviet Union, specifically: Cuba, Vietnam, and China. We will discuss the political and 148social life within each country, their relationship to the United States and the prospects for political change. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 238 - South Asian Diaspora This class will focus on South Asians who were indentured to British colonies from 1860, immediately following the abolition of slavery. Over one million Indians were indentured to Mauritius, South Africa, Guyana, Trinidad, and Fiji. South Asians currently constitute a substantial proportion of the population in each of these countries, and they are in the majority in Mauritius and Trinidad. We will conduct a comparative study based on theoretical perspectives related to diaspora's, globalization, trans-state identities, and analytical themes associated with identity andcitizenship. 240 - Comparative Revolutions This course will examine why, how, and when voices of dissent turn into a full-scale revolutionary movement. We will compare and contrast revolutions that have taken place in different social, political, and cultural contexts (e.g., Nicaraguan Revolution, 1989 Revolutions of Eastern Europe, and the Ukrainian Orange Revolution). 241 - International Relations of the Middle East A study of Middle-Eastern international relations in the context of three themes that structure the region's modern political history: 1. Colonialism: how the reaction against colonialism continued to define and limit Middle- Eastern politics, both internally and in its relations with outside powers. 2. Religion: in particular, political Islam (or \"fundamentalism\") is a key variable in the region's contemporary politics, but by no means all-defining. 3. Nationalism(s): a source of political identity and mobilization. How religious, national, linguistic, and ethnic nationalisms inform conflict and cooperation within the region. In the context of these three themes, we will explore the following regional issues with global implications: 1. The Arab-Israeli conflict. The flash point of conflict in the Middle-East, the Arab-Israeli conflict can only be understood on the basis of an informed appreciation of its historical and ideological underpinnings. 2. Iran. The Iranian revolution had an enormous impact on regional and international affairs. Current unrest within Iran is, perhaps, a harbinger of yet another radical shift in Iranian politics. 3. Domestic upheaval in the region as seen in the Arab uprisings of 2011-12. . Despite this being an \"IR\" class, on-the-ground social and political movements (\"domestic,\" yet transnationally informed) have an enormous impact on the region's politics. This is particularly true in the shadow of the recent Arab uprisings on which we will place particular attention. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST and REGIONAL FOCUS 242 - Revolutionary Iran in Historical Perspective Iran has experienced crisis, revolts, and revolution more than any other country in the region. 149The level of revolutionary zeal, ideological debates, and mass participation has elicited unprecedented attention by media experts and academics's endeavoring to resolve what is termed as \"Persian Puzzle\" or \"Iranian Paradox\". In view of remarkable infrequency of revolutions, Nikki Keddie - the eminent scholar of modern Iran ? has devoted years of research in striving to answer the question, \"why has Iran been revolutionary?\" She reiterates that Iran has seen more modern revolutions than any country in the Muslim world and more than most countries anywhere. Consequently, the course on \"Revolutionary Iran\" addresses the following question: Is there anything peculiar or particular about Iran that could explain the rise of modern revolutionary movement? The course critically examines the theoretical and historical perspectives that have been proposed to answer this question. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST 243 - Law, War Crimes and Transnational Politics This course will focus on the international community's efforts since World War II to bring an end to impunity for those who violate fundamental human rights and humanitarian norms. International efforts to bring violators to justice from Nuremberg to the International Criminal Court will be the primary focus of the class. The class will also discuss more recent efforts to bring civil lawsuits against individuals and corporations for their complicity in human rights violations. 244 - Modern Iran: Society & Politics This course is a survey of Iranian politics and society from the establishment of the Qajar dynasty in the late nineteenth century to the present. The aims of the course are twofold. (1) To introduce students to major events shaping Iranian politics over the last century. Among the topics covered are the rise and demise of the Qajar dynasty, the Persian Constitutional Revolution, the rise and fall of the Pahlavi dynasty, the role of Western imperialism, the geopolitics of oil, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the Iran-Iraq war, the crisis of theocracy, etc., and (2) To expose students to a set of theoretical and analytical issues underlying Iran's political development: the causes and consequences of revolutions; state-society relations; secularism and modernization; fundamentalism and reform; democracy; autocracy and clientelism; corruption and the rentier state. Above all, this course is design to help students think, talk and write in an informed and critical manner about politics in modern Iran. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST and REGIONAL FOCUS 249 - Public Health & Human Rts: Global and Local Practices This course explores core concepts in global public health, the development of human rights' instruments, and how these two fields have increasingly intersected in global and local public health work. Specifically, we will review public health methods of measurement and analysis -- spanning epidemiological, economic, and political approaches -- to understand if and how a rights-based approach to health can inform more critical and more productive approaches to issues such as HIV/AIDS and other sexual and reproductive health concerns. Finally, this course examines how global public health issues have generated dramatically different responses across and within regions and countries and communities. We will particularly focus on the experience of Brazil given its changing role in the global economy and its progressive public health approach. Same at UEP 308 150250 - International Security This course is an introduction to international security and strategic studies. This field is fundamentally about both the use of force by and violent conflict among states and non-state actors. The course will be guided by general theoretical questions regarding security: How does violent conflict, or competitions shaped by the lurking possibili\u00acty of such conflict, affect international relations and individual societies? How has the role of violent conflict in international politics changed since the end of World War II? What is the nature of security today? These general questions will frame explorations of more specific strategic questions. Such questions will include: How do states and non-state actors use force to persuade their enemies to take (coercion) or refrain from taking (deterrence) a particular action? How can nations best prepare to prevent violent conflicts or to win them if they occur? What has determined success and failure, the intensity, duration, and consequences of military action? We will have a particular focus on emerging transnational security issues, intra-state security, and the relationship among security, development and state failure. Pursuing answers to these questions will require an approach that integrates theory, history and current events. Same as POLS 233 252 - Security Issues in South Asia While Washington policymakers during the Cold War paid only episodic attention to South Asia, the region has become a focal point for U.S. security policy over the last decade or so. Since the nuclear weapon tests by India and Pakistan in 1998, their entrenched, conflict-prone strategic rivalry has acquired a much more dangerous edge. The region is also the epicenter of global terrorism, with Islamabad simultaneously acting as a sponsor of the Taliban forces fighting in Afghanistan and serving as a pivotal U.S. ally in the war against Islamist terrorism. Finally, after decades of disdain about India's strategic potential, U.S. officials have invested singular energy in recent years in developing what is a tacitly anti-China security partnership with India. Although South Asia encompasses a number of countries, this course will focus on the region's two most important powers - India and Pakistan - and their relationships with the United States and China - the two extra-regional powers that have the most influence on regional affairs. The following topics will receive special attention: The sources of and prospects for the India-Pakistan strategic rivalry, including the long-standing territorial dispute over Kashmir and the more recent competition for influence in Afghanistan. The effects of nuclear proliferation on India-Pakistan interactions. The economic rise of India and its implications for New Delhi's security posture, especially vis-\u00e0-vis Islamabad, Washington and Beijing Pakistan's national prospects and their security implications. China's growing role in regional security affairs The emergence of non-traditional security challenges in the region (e.g., conflicts over access to natural resources, population pressures.) The impact of South Asian security issues on U.S. strategic interests, the development of U.S. bilateral relations with India and Pakistan, and the management of the triangular relationship. CORE REQUIREMENTS MET: INTERCULTURAL 254 - Transnational Security: Understanding Gray Area Phenomena The course will provide a conceptual framework for understanding the evolving scope and dimension of transnational security in the contemporary era. The unit will include an examination of the principal features of the current international system that are serving to foster gray area phenomenon; an analysis of five specific threats that have received particular 151attention in terms of their destabilizing potential (terrorism, drug smuggling, weapons trafficking, maritime piracy, the spread of disease, pandemics, environmental degradation/change); and an assessment of how these challenges can best be mitigated at both the domestic and global level. 255 - Understanding Terrorism and Global Security through Cyborgs, Zombies and Morgoths The course will use popular culture allegories as a strategy for building a complex understanding of the nature of transnational terrorism in the post-9/11 era and challenges faced by policy makers in this arena. It will begin with a review of key approaches and concepts in security studies and will confront different definitions of terrorism. The course will then go on to discuss certain policy responses that have elicited particular concern, such as torture, assassination, surveillance programs, detention without trial and deliberate entrapment. Cyborg, Zombie, and Lord of The Ring allegories will serve to illustrate different conceptual and practical approaches to terrorism. The course will conclude with an examination of the different implications for policy decision making suggested by the use of different allegories. 260 - Model United Nations Research, discussion and analysis of important issues in international relations in preparation for a three day college conference in early April. Student delegates role play as ambassadors for countries and present views, negotiating with other representatives and arguing for possible resolutions in a simulation of the United Nations. 265 - Global History of the United States: 20th and 21st Centuries This course will examine the political, military, economic, and cultural interactions between the United States and the rest of the world from the Spanish-American War to the present day. Taking a much broader view than traditional diplomatic histories, the course will weave together analyses of major diplomatic initiatives, armed conflicts, and the ways in which the cultures and economies of the U.S. and other nations have influenced one another. Topics will include the causes and consequences of wars, the meaning of American empire, and the flow of consumer goods, languages, music, dance, motion pictures, fashion, social norms, and people to and from the U.S.. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 266 - History and Theory of International Politics This course aims to introduce students to both analytic and normative approaches to the study of international politics. In the first part of the course the historiography of both the states- system and the academic discipline of International Relations (IR) are examined, along with the methodological issues underlying IR (and the social sciences in general). The second part of the course is devoted to learning about theories of international politics - e.g. (Neo)Realism, (Neo)Liberalism, (Neo)Marxism, Post-modernism/-structuralism, Gender and IR, Constructivism - and examining the debates within and between them. The Last part of the course considers the application and implications of theories discussed to and for major present-day trends and developments such as globalization, militarism, financial crises, 152extremism, and environmental degradation. This course is, above all, designed to help students think, talk and write in an informed and critical manner about international issues. 280 - Globalization: Issues and Controversies The course explores the various facets of the globalization process, its causes and wide- ranging consequences, and its implications for U.S. domestic and foreign policy as well as for global governance. Has globalization benefited East Asia, Africa, and Latin America? What have been the differing impacts on those regions? Questions that will be addressed include: *what are conceptual perspectives on globalization? *what are globalization's cultural dimensions? *what impact has globalization had on issues such as global health and illicit trafficking in peoples and goods? *what are the political consequences of globalization? *what are policy responses to the challenges globalization presents? CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 282 - Global Los Angeles A critical examination of greater Los Angeles and it's economic, political, social and cultural ties to the world economy and other countries--all the ways in which Los Angeles is an integral part of the post-Cold War global society. How does this globalization affect the life of Los Angeles and in what ways does Los Angeles contribute to globalization? What are the positive and negative impacts and the implications for US foreign, economic and social policies of Los Angeles as a Global City? CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 284 - Sports and Diplomacy in a Globalized World A critical examination of the political and economic role that sports plays in the globalized world-- the diplomatic, political and economic effects of the Olympics, the World Cup, other international sporting events, and the increased globalization of professional sports leagues across national boundaries. A look a case studies of Ping-pong diplomacy, rugby reconciliation in South Africa, and soccer wars in Latin America, as well as an analysis of the impact of foreign players on national economies and societies from American baseball players in Japan to Russian ice hockey players in the US. CORE PREREQUISITE MET: INTERCULTURAL 285 - Diplomacy, Conflict and Cooperation in World Politics This course aims to introduce students to both analytic and normative approaches to the study and practice of diplomacy in international politics. In the first part of the course we will chart the evolution of diplomacy from a tool of statecraft in the modern states system to a practice of mediating disputes and estrangement in international society. The second part of the course is devoted to examining a series of historical case studies illustrative of the successes and failures of modern diplomacy. The last part of the course considers the utility and limitations of contemporary diplomatic practices for major international trends and developments such as globalization, militarism, financial crises, extremism, and environmental degradation. This course is, above all, designed to help students think, talk and write in an informed and critical manner about complex and seemingly intractable global issues. 153295 - Virtuous Drones, Selfish Humanitarians? Emerging Issues in IR What is the ethical goal of international policy? Who do we take seriously? Who do we count? What matters most? This is course is designed to help students, as future global citizens, explore ethical approaches to current global challenges. We will use case studies to confront challenges in areas such as torture, rebellion, peace-building, corporate responsibility, war technology, and climate change. Each student will develop special expertise in a specific policy area, and will draft a report on pressing global issues in this policy area. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 295 - Topics in Diplomacy and World Affairs Human Security, An Introduction. In May 2003, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, and Professor Amartya Sen, Nobel laureate in economics, presented the report of the Independent Commission on Human Security to then-UN Secretary- General Kofi Annan. The report proposed a new security framework - that of \"human security\" - that re-frames the concept of international security away from the pillars of the Westphallian system - territorial integrity and national sovereignty - to a focus on the protection of persons and populations. This course is an undergraduate survey of the topic of human security, exploring this emerging concept and the evolving corresponding norm of the \"responsibility to protect,\" which demands that states protect their populations and re-frames humanitarian intervention as a responsibility of the international community to protect peoples when their governments fail to do so. Throughout the course, we will explore a number of interrelated issues such as conflict and poverty, protecting populations in conflict and post-conflict situations, crimes against humanity, and rights-based development. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL Introduction to International Law . This course will introduce students to the legal rules and principles that apply to states and non-state actors in areas such as the use of force, human rights, environmental protection, and the prosecution of war criminals. Students will explore the mutual impact of international law and politics, and assess the efficacy of international rules as policy instruments, and as guidelines for legitimate international behavior. Course materials will include decisions of international tribunals and real-life problems that illustrate how international law works in practice. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL . Global Public Health. The course will examine major global public health problems and the range of responses from international organizations, transnational networks, and domestic and community-based institutions. Despite improvements in the health status of low- and middle- income countries over the last half-century, the challenges to advance global public health remain daunting. What are the sorts of strategies these actors have used in addressing such health issues as HIV/AIDS, malaria, unsafe food and water, tobacco use, and others? What is the role of human rights in addressing the underlying determinants of ill-health? The course will present basic concepts for understanding global public health, including morbidity, mortality, demography, epidemiology, and the political, social and economic determinants of health. We will utilize a case study method to examine successful and less successful efforts to improve global health and to debate enduring political, economic, social and cultural controversies in the arenas of global health. Students can expect to gain knowledge of the major issues and 154actors in global public health and an introduction to the analytic and quantitative skills needed to monitor and evaluate evidence used in formulating policies and programs. Same as UEP 295 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL The Political Economy of Global Conflict . This course aims to introduce a number of fundamental concepts in the field of international political economy and then demonstrate a relationship between those concepts and global conflict. The first section of the course is devoted to introducing several core concepts of IPE within the context of the more generalized debates about the relationship and interaction between the international and domestic and the relationship and interaction between the state and society. After establishing this theoretical foundation, we begin to explore the way a political economy-centered approach helps us explain and understand interstate and intrastate conflict around the world. A number of case studies provide common ground for exploration on topics such as the relationship between global conflict and the economic rise of China and India, trade disputes, the relationship between poverty and conflict, and the relationship between natural resources and conflict (particularly intrastate violence). In each of these cases, our political economy approach is used not only to explain but also to explore possible solutions and challenges. In this context, the relative importance of international institutions and the challenges associated with collective action are also discussed. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL Obama Foreign Policy A course in current US foreign policy focusing on the challenges abroad faced by the Obama administration. The course will examine how President Obama and his team handled two wars inherited from the Bush administration, as well as an international economic crisis--and how the administration responded to new developments such as the Arab Spring. In an election year, foreign policy can sometimes become a campaign issue, and events abroad can affect Presidential politics, so the course will also consider the role of foreign policy in the 2012 Presidential campaign. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES International Relations of Africa This course examines the international relations of states in sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on major themes that have characterized international politics in Africa since the end of the Cold War. We will pay particular attention to the constraints that poverty and state weakness place on African states, as well as the associated importance of non-state and external actors in African affairs. Sample topics that the course will cover include: major conflicts of the past two decades (Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, and Sudan), international peacekeeping, slow economic development, foreign aid effectiveness, epidemics, and food security. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA/MIDDLE EAST 299 - Qualitative Methods and Research Design The goal of this course is to provide students with some of the tools to embark on systematic inquiry in political science. It will introduce students to qualitative methods in political science, ethical issues in qualitative research, proposal writing and interviewing techniques, and finally, the essential components of a research paper (a proper research question, thesis, literature review, and case selection). Guidance through the Institutional Review Board process will be provided. This course is geared towards students preparing grant applications to conduct research abroad and/or those preparing for their senior comprehensive thesis since they will 155be expected to apply the methods they learn to their own research topics. 2 unit 305 - Peoples, States, and Wars: Revolutionary Readings This course will address enduring challenges in global politics in the political, economic, and social spheres. These challenges will be contextualized through three prisms: 1. Evolving norms of international society and justice. 2. Histories of peoples and states. 3. Key intellectual works that have both been informed by and helped construct collective understandings of these norms and histories. The challenge of war, nationalism/ethnic conflict, economic underdevelopment, and international justice will be addressed through seminal texts, both classic and contemporary. In order to expand the scope of traditional international relations inquiry, these texts will extend into related intellectual traditions. prerequisite: DWA 101 310 - Religion and Politics As of late, religion has re-emerged on the political stage offering different perspectives regarding political norms, values, and behavior. In this course we will explore the various ways in which religion has been conceptualized and utilized in different political and cultural settings. Some of the questions that we will seek to answer are: In what ways can religion be separated from politics? What are the roles of religion and religious institutions in political life? How do religions and religious institutions respond to the challenges of a pluralist and secular modern world? Prerequisite: DWA 101 or equivalent. Open only to DWA majors with junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 325 - United Nations Internship/Practicum Internships are designed to enable students to learn experientially in an organization engaged in work relevant to their coursework in Occidental College's Program at the United Nations as well as their broader academic and career goals. By gaining firsthand work experience at an United Nations Mission, a Specialized Agency of the United Nations or a related Non- Governmental Organization students should develop skills and knowledge that will help them in pursuing post-graduation employment. Prerequisite: DWA 201 and ECON 101 329 - Human Rights and Trafficking in Persons Trafficking in persons - the use of force, coercion, fraud, or deception for purposes of exploitation - is the third most profitable form of illicit activity globally, following the traffic in drugs and arms. In this course, we will explore the different forms of trafficking, including domestic servitude, sweatshop labor, migrant agricultural work, and child soldiering, although the course will focus most closely on the topic of trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation. Throughout the class, the causes, consequences, and responses to trafficking will be analyzed through a human rights lens. We will study the processes behind the construction of gender identities, in order to gain insight into why particular populations are especially vulnerable to trafficking and why certain constraints exist to preventing and responding to trafficking at both the domestic and international levels. We will study the relationship between trafficking and militarism, including the legacy of the United States' military presence in Asia for sex tourism and trafficking in the region today. And we will engage the debate over whether trafficking is a 156\"discourse\" that perpetuates relationships of dominance and subordination between the global North and South. Prerequisite: DWA 101. Open only to DWA majors with junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 331 - Ethics, Religion, and International Relations - State Interest vs. Universal Morality An inquiry into the field of ethical inquiry in international relations with a particular focus on the increasing recognition of the multiple frames of ethics contributed by the world's religions. It is intended as an introduction for students who already have some background in the field of international relations and are interested in exploring the subject at a deeper level. Ethics has traditionally occupied an unenvious position in mainstream theories of international relations. Either it has been relegated to the margins of the field or placed in opposition to the contingencies of state practice. Denying their own normative foundations, (Western) theories of international relations traditionally ignored the relevance of ethics for the conceptualization and practice of world politics. This course reviews alternative approaches to traditional international relations theory by placing ethics at the center of the field. The course focuses on the ethical underpinnings of state practice, and analyzes a range of contemporary foreign policy issues in which ethical questions are likely to arise, especially the protection of human rights, the historical development and contemporary formulations of ethical norms for the use of force, and distributive justice in the global economy. Special emphasis will be given to religious influences on national ethics; religion as a matter of conflict; religious communities as transnational agents for justice, protection of human rights, and peace; and ethical and religious contributions to reconciliation, solidarity, and peacemaking. The theme to be explored in this course is \"State Interest vs. Universal Morality?\" - that is, we will explore the question of whether or not these two dimensions of international relations are compatible or competitive with each other. Prerequisite: DWA 101. Open only to DWA majors with junior or senior standing. 333 - North Africa and the Middle East: Islam and the Politics of Identity A study of Islam in North Africa and the implications of religious ideology on intra and inter state conflicts. The course will also analyze the relationship of the Islamic North to the rest of Africa and to the Middle East. Given in alternate years. Prerequisite: DWA 101. Open only to DWA majors with junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST 336 - Religion, Ideology, and Democracy in the Middle East This is an advanced seminar on the relationship between religion, ideology, and democracy in the Middle East; it presupposes background knowledge of the region and only basic exposure to comparative politics. The course surveys the historical and political trajectories of selected nationalisms and Islamist ideologies in the Middle East: Pan-Arabism, various Arab territorial nationalisms, Zionisms, Turkish nationalisms, Kurdish nationalisms and various strains of prerequisite: DWA 241 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA/MIDDLE EAST 157337 - Islam and Democracy This course covers key questions, arguments, and debates concerning the relationship between Islam (as a rubric for identity and mobilization) and democracy (as a political form and value) in the Middle East. The course is organized around major topics concerning the history, culture, and politics of the Middle East since the end of World War I: Islam and modernity, nationalism and independence, authoritarian state building, the European imperial legacy, revolution and fundamentalist resurgence, political Islam and democracy, democracy promotion, and the future prospects for democracy in the region. This survey explores several theoretical questions about the relationship between Islam and democracy in the region: Why did the region's experience with some seemingly representative/liberal forms of the politics (c. 1930s-1950s) give way to the rise of authoritarian regimes? Why have various Islamist political movements come to represent the strongest forces pushing for political reform, government accountability, and democracy in the region? Does political Islam represent an obstacle/threat to the democratization of the Middle East or, alternatively, a necessary component for democratization? How are new forms of populist mobilization and political organization reshaping politics in the region? Prerequisite: DWA 101 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST 338 - Theory and Practice of Human Rights in the Transnational Muslim World The place of human rights in the transnational Muslim world in comparative and theoretical perspective. The focus will be on 20th century political and ideological events in the Muslim world, broadly defined to include its diverse formations. There will be particular attention paid to movements for the integration of human rights into domestic, international, and transnational politics, and attendant theoretical questions. The course will be reading-intensive and we will focus class discussions around each week's readings. Prerequisite: DWA 101 Open only to DWA majors with junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST 340 - Contemporary Issues in International and Human Rights Law International law has taken an increasingly central and often controversial place in contemporary international relations. This junior writing seminar will explore the foundations of international law, human rights law, and humanitarian law. It will do so in the context of their intersections with topical issues that range from international criminal law, torture, non-state transnational actors, humanitarian interventions, and sexuality, and will have a particular focus on the theoretical foundations for human rights. Prerequisite: DWA 101. 342 - Transnational Identity and International Relations This class will explore the various aspects of transnational identities focusing on ways in which they challenge state borders and state nationalisms. The various aspects of transnational identities like questions of citizenship, ethnicity, religion, gender, and generation, will be analyzed. Special attention will be given to the ways in which Islamic beliefs have transcended state boundaries and the impact this has had on notions of citizenship. The class will also focus on a few case studies to highlight the various aspects of transnational identity. 158Prerequisite: DWA 101. Open only to DWA majors with junior or senior standing. 343 - Transnationalism and Global Governance Global Governance: State, Trans-state, and Non-state Approaches to International Issues. \"Global governance\" describes state, trans-state, and local approaches to addressing issues which cross traditional nation-state borders. This class will study theories of global governance: what is global governance and how do we account for its increasing relevance? We will do so in the context of an exploration of a number of intersecting issues, including human rights, economic development, migration, political transitions, post-conflict reconstruction, and global security. Prerequisite: DWA 101. Open only to DWA majors with junior or senior standing. 344 - Nation-Building A course in the politics and economics of nation?building and the responsibility of the international community towards failing states. What are the lessons to be learned from past attempts to reconstruct war-damaged or failed stages - e.g., the defeated axis powers Japan and Germany, war-torn Bosnia, or post-war Iraq? Can the United Nations provide the needed expertise or is it up to the U.S. to do the job? Is nation-building a necessary part of a Freedom Agenda (as President Bush termed it) or a U.S. strategy of democratic enlargement (President Clinton's term)? If so, how can it be done effectively without acting in a neo-colonial manner? On a related topic, when is so-called Humanitarian Intervention appropriate and who decides to do it?the U.N., the U.S., the European Union, North Atlantic Treat Organization, or other powers? Are new U.S. government agencies or new international organizations needed for these tasks, if they are to be undertaken? Students will examine these critical and difficult questions through readings such as Samantha Power's A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide; James Traub's The Freedom Agenda?Why America Must Spread Democracy (Just Not the Way George Bush Did); Ghani and Lockhart's Fixing Failed States; and the RAND Corporation's studies, America's Role in Nation-Building from Germany to Iraq, and The Beginner's Guide to Nation-Building. In addition to understanding and analyzing the key issues, students will also work in teams to devise new US and international policy approaches to nation-building. Prerequisite: DWA 101 or equivalent. Open only to DWA and Politics majors with junior or senior standing. 350 - Global Political Economy: Advanced Topics Each year this course will focus on some sub-set of contemporary issues in the global political economy. This could include topics such as the state of the global economy and global economic crises; multinational corporations and corporate social responsibility; global production and supply chains; emerging forms of regulation in the global economy, transparency and accountability, and global inequality, among others. Prerequisite: DWA 101 352 - Water in the World: Issues, Conflicts, Prospects Water is necessary for human survival and public health, economic prosperity and environmental sustainability. Water is a spiritual value, a human right, an economic good, and a natural resource. One billion people on our planet do not have access to the water they need. Escalating human population growth, concomitant climate change and other environmental changes, poor management, and emerging/(re-)emerging diseases are 159compromising the availability and quality of water resources even for those who have access. Political controversies over water of various kinds are mounting; some argue future wars will be fought over water. This course examines current issues, conflicts and prospects with respect to water resources globally and how this issue will influence the health of humans, societies, and the planet. Prerequisite: DWA 101 368 - American Grand Strategy: The Perils of Being Number One America is the most powerful nation in the post-Cold War world but has not, as yet, forged a national consensus on post-Cold War foreign policy. The country, and the world, have repudiated the neo-Con unilateralist approach of the Bush administration?but there is no agreed upon substitute. Various authors are proposing strategies from \"ethical realism\" to \"liberal interventionism\" to \"neo-isolationism\" and on. The course will examine critically proposals for a new American Grand Strategy from leading foreign policy thinkers and from groups such as the Princeton project. We will try to agree on what a workable Grand Strategy might be?and analyze whether it might have widespread bi-partisan support at home and ample international support abroad. Prerequisite: DWA 101 or Politics 101. Junior or senior standing in DWA or Politics 370 - Democracy in Global Politics This course investigates the contours of historical and contemporary debates about democracy in global politics. The central aim of the course is to make such terms as \"pluralism,\" \"representation,\" \"freedom,\" and \"democracy,\" which simultaneously serve as hollow tropes in contemporary political discourse and as the basis for a secular religious faith for many on the left and the right, more difficult. Rather than cleansing these terms of their complications, students are encouraged to see them from all sides, interrogating their maddening paradoxes and ugly undertones while never losing sight of their awesome possibilities. Accordingly, this course is divided into three sections. The first section offers a historical/philosophical overview of the rise of, and a variety of challenges to, the idea of democracy as both a political ideal and an institutional form from the advent of the American and French revolutions to today. The second section is devoted to various schools of thought on democratic governance, with a special focus on post-World War II developments in democratic theory. The last section of the course focuses on contemporary politics of surrounding the discourse about and promotion of democratic values in a global context. Prerequisite: DWA 101 377 - Rising Nations: The Political Economy of the BRIC countries and the Challenges to US Leadership Junior seminar on the global impact of the rising nations of Brazil, India, Russia and China--so- called BRIC countries--the growth of their economies and their growing political and economic influence on global power arrangements--and an analysis of the US response to the rise of these nations in the post-Cold War era of globalization. What is the intellectual justification of the course? Provide juniors and seniors in DWA and related majors with an analysis of key players on the international scene and a critical examination of how the US is responding to a multi-polar world. Prerequisites: DWA 101 or Politics 101. Junior or senior standing in DWA or Politics CORE REQUIREMENT MET: ASIA 160395 - Special Topics in Diplomacy and World Affairs Seminar in International Institutions and International Law. Our globalized political and economic system relies on international regimes and related organizations to help set, monitor, and enforce the rules. This seminar examines comparatively the historic rationale behind prominent international institutions and legal frameworks, and analyzes their current and possible future roles in economic development, global governance, and political stability. Prerequisite: DWA 201. Open only to DWA majors with junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 397 - Independent Study in DWA Prerequisite: permission of instructor. 2 or 4 units 401 - Human Development in a World of Promise and Peril This seminar-style course will focus on practical case studies to identify the drivers of and potential brakes on sustainable human development. Illustrative country cases from around the globe will focus students on the present day reality of people's lives; the role of development planning, policies and actions by the State; and how the norms established at the global level of the UN are implemented at the national as well as local levels. Modern day global issues related to population dynamics, climate change, inequality, food security, energy access, natural & man made disasters and others will be examined for their impact on human development against the backdrop of the U.N. Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio +20), the U.N.'s focus on the Post 2015 Development Agenda, and the Millennium Development Goals. Cases will range from a review of specific UN programmes that went to scale and led to fundamental national change (examples: Mongolia microfinance, Cambodia decentralization and Ethiopia's HIV/AIDS response) -- to a review of individual countries where multiple UN programmes and the political economy stand out as driving factors for change (examples: Myanmar, Costa Rica and Brazil). These cases will be informed through literature review and through contact with UN staff and UN agencies who worked on the programmes as well as with individuals from the concerned Missions. Prerequisite: DWA 201 402 - UN and Conflict Prevention: Actors & Architecture The importance of conflict prevention and conflict resolution policies has long been recognized at the United Nations. The debate was originally focused on the effectiveness of peace keeping operations and traditional diplomatic measures. Its parameters have been broadened considerably and now encompass longer term efforts to assist developing countries in enhancing durable structures conducive to peace and democratic stability and the targeted use of development cooperation. Combining theoretical /conceptual and practical concerns and drawing from case studies of recent conflicts, the ultimate objective of the course is to identify feasible short term and long term conflict prevention strategies and tools and to develop practical suggestions to move from a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention. More specifically, the course will deal with: a. the evolving meaning of prevention as it was understood in the Charter of the United Nations and subsequently shaped by the changing causes and nature of conflicts; b. the main actors in conflict prevention against the backdrop of UN institutions; c. the tools and practice of \"operational\" prevention (i.e. early warning, 161mediation, sanctions, peace operations, peace enforcement and the role of regional organizations); d. the tools and practice of \"structural\" prevention (good governance and democracy, mainstreaming human rights and gender, meeting post conflict reconstruction and addressing the root causes of conflict); and e. the significance of the emerging norm of the \"responsibility to protect\". Prerequisite: DWA 201 403 - United Nations Internship/Practicum Participants in the program serve as interns in the United Nations Secretariat, the United States Mission to the United Nations, or a non-governmental organization connected with the United Nations. Prerequisite: permission of department. Prerequisite: DWA 201 404 - Directed Study: Research Methods in the U.N. The objective of this course is to enable students to acquire the skills needed for developing and carrying out social science/policy oriented research projects for academic and/or professional purposes, with a particular focus on research at and on the United Nations. This will be achieved through readings on methodological issues, lectures by practitioners, and by providing students with the opportunity to conduct directed research on an international relations topic that may (but will not necessarily) connect to their U.N. internship. Prerequisite: DWA 201 410 - Task Force in Diplomacy and World Affairs The abilities to locate, compile, synthesize, evaluate and compellingly present complex and up- to-date knowledge on rapidly changing global issues - and to do so in a team - are highly valued across public, private and civil society sectors. This course helps students learn and practice how to research, write and present an extended policy/practice oriented report for a real-world client on a contemporary and exciting topic in world affairs, and practice being part of a high-functioning team. The topic and thus client will be unique each time the course is taught. The skills acquired and applied in Task Force help students stand out as they venture into the world and towards the jobs and activities they are passionate about in diplomacy and world affairs. Prerequisites: DWA 201 490 - Senior Seminar in DWA Preparation, research, writing, and discussion of senior thesis projects in fulfillment of the comprehensive requirement.

We aim to help our students understand how decisions are linked to incentives and how policies can help align individual incentives with social objectives, including an efficient use of the world's resources and an equitable distribution of its output. We also aim to equip our students with the rigorous theoretical and empirical tools of our profession to enable them to better analyze and guide the decision making of individuals, the conduct of businesses and nonprofit enterprises, and the policies of governments and international organizations. The Department aims to ensure that students majoring in Economics (1) understand the framework that professional economists use to analyze social and economic issues; (2) recognize how economic behavior and policies can affect both the aggregate level of prosperity and differentials in prosperity across members of society distinguished by characteristics such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status; (3) have proficient decision- making and problem-solving skills; (4) are competent in writing and speaking; and (5) possess critical-thinking skills that enable them to apply the theoretical and empirical tools of professional economists to a wide range of issues. Requirements ECONOMICS MAJOR: A major in economics requires a minimum of ten courses. Of these, a core of seven must be the following: Economics 101 and 102 (introductory economics); Calculus 1 or equivalent; Economics 250 and 251 (intermediate theory); Economics 272 (econometrics; requires Mathematics 146 or equivalent); Economics 495 (senior seminar). The remaining three courses may be selected from among the 300-level economics courses (electives) described in this catalog. In order to declare an economics major, a student must have completed Economics 101 and 102 and Calculus I (or equivalent). A typical schedule might be arranged as follows: First year: Economics 101, 102, and Calculus 1 Sophomore year: Economics 250, 251, and Math 146 Junior year: Economics 272 and 300-level electives Senior year: Economics 495 and 300-level electives Students who have received a score of 5 on both the AP Microeconomics test and the AP Macroeconomics test will be allowed to skip Economics 101 and Economics 102. Students who have received a score of 4 or 5 on both the AP Microeconomics test and the AP Macroeconomics test will be allowed to skip Economics 101. 177The major can be completed in fewer than four years, but it is almost impossible to complete the major in less than three years. CHOOSING ELECTIVES: The economics department offers so many electives that it's helpful to think about how these electives might be grouped to give more intellectual continuity to a course of study. For example, students interested in obtaining a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) and/or having a career in management are encouraged to complete Economics 233 (Accounting and Financial Analysis), an internship, and either Economics 350 or 326. Students interested in obtaining a Ph.D. in economics are encouraged to complete Mathematics 150 (instead of Math 146), Math 120 or equivalent, Math 212, 214, 310, and at least one of Math 330, 332, 341, 342, 370, or 372. Students interested in a career in public policy are encouraged to complete either Politics 101 or UEP 101, an internship or service learning experience, and at least one of the following: Economics 301, 302, 308, 312, 320, 324, 325, 328, or 361. MINOR: Economics 101, 102, 250, and 251, Calculus 1, and two 300-level courses in economics (or Economics 272 and one 300-level course in economics). Please note that Calculus 1 is a prerequisite for Economics 250 and 251. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Economics will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's college-wide writing requirement by arranging (with the instructor) for an Economics 300-level course (or Economics 272) to be designated as the student's writing course. The writing requirement must be satisfactorily completed by May of the student's junior year. Students who fail the requirement or who fail to meet the deadline will be required to both take a composition course in the senior year and demonstrate acceptable writing skills in the senior comprehensive in order to graduate. Students should familiarize themselves with the departmental requirement at the time of declaring the major. See the Writing Program and consult the department chair for additional information. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: Met by passing the Major Field Test (MFT) in economics in February of the student's senior year and by completing Economics 495 in the fall semester of the student's senior year. The MFT is administered at the College, and students must sign up for it early in the fall semester of their senior year. Students who will not be on campus during one of the semesters of their senior year should contact the department chair. HONORS : Majors can earn honors by taking Economics 499 in the fall of their senior year and by writing and defending, in that class, a thesis that is judged by the department faculty to be of honors quality. Enrollment in Economics 499 is limited to students with GPAs of 3.5 or higher (both overall and within the department). Interested students should consult with their academic advisor and then apply to the department chair by end of their junior year. OFF-CAMPUS AND TRANSFER CREDITS A student may skip Economics 101 and Economics 102 only if the student receives transfer credit for both Principles of Microeconomics and Principles of Macroeconomics. Students who have taken only one may skip Economics 101 and take Economics 102. An off-campus economics course can qualify as an Economics 300-level elective only if the course specifies previous coursework in economics principles as a prerequisite. Economics majors must complete the following courses at Occidental and may not 178satisfy them with transfer credits: Economics 250, 251, 272, at least two 300-level electives, and their Senior Comprehensives course. Students may take one accounting course for College credit, either at Occidental or through transfer credits. Students may not receive College credit for any other business- related course. Students who have received a score of 4 or 5 on either AP Calculus test have met the departmental Calculus I major requirement (and the calculus pre-requisite for courses that require Calculus I). Courses 101 - Principles in Economics I An introduction to the economic way of thinking that includes both micro- and macroeconomic topics.

The course will approach topics from both theoretical and applied perspectives. 180Prerequisite: Economics 250. 304 - The Chinese Economy This course will analyze the Chinese economy since 1949. It will review the economy's development, the historical legacies of the command economy, and the economic reforms that brought about the transition to a market economy. The course also will analyze the current problems and future challenges that face the Chinese economy. It will end with a discussion of the relationship between the Chinese economy and the rest of the world. Prerequisite: ECON 102 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL/SOUTH/EAST ASIA and REGIONAL FOCUS 305 - Game Theory This course is an introduction to the study of strategic interaction using the tools of game theory. The focus of the course is on developing a set of analytical techniques, with the goal of understanding and using game theoretical models in economics. The first part of the course introduces the basic framework and tools of game theory. The second part of the course covers a number of economic (and some non-economic) applications of game theory; specific topics may include auctions, bargaining, voting, and market competition. Prerequisite: Econ 250 or permission of instructor. 307 - Economics of Information This course focuses on the economic implications of asymmetric information, which exists when one party in a relationship is better informed than another. For example, the seller of a used car has better information about the car's quality than the buyer; the owner of a firm cannot perfectly monitor the effort levels of employees. Asymmetric information represents an important deviation from the perfectly competitive model, and can give rise to inefficient outcomes. Applications that will be covered include corporate governance, labor markets, auctions, and public decision making. Concepts will be covered in a mathematically rigorous way. Prerequisite: Economics 250. 308 - Public Finance An investigation of the economic principles of \"market failure\" and government involvement in the economy, especially in the efficiency and income redistribution effects of major U.S. tax/expenditure policies. We will develop a theoretical structure with which to analyze the microeconomic functions of government, and then apply this structure to analyze and evaluate current governmental policies in the areas of social security, health care, welfare reform, the environment, education, and especially the design and reform of the federal tax system. Prerequisite: Economics 250. 309 - Free Market Economics: The Austrian Perspective Comparative Economic Systems: The Austrian Perspective. The Austrian School of Economics, so-named because of the national origin of its founders, is an alternative approach to economics that emphasizes methodological individualism and subjectivism. The Austrian School of Economics traces its roots back to the works of the Spanish Scholastics of the 181sixteenth century and stresses the importance of the individual, private property, limited government and the organizing power of the free-market. Students will read from authors such as Menger, Mises, Hayek, Kirzner, Rothbard and Hoppe and evaluate various properties of a state-planned economy versus a decentralized free market economy. Prerequisites: Economics 102. 311 - International Economics Economic activity in a global context. The first part of the course covers the causes and consequences of international trade, with a consideration of both national welfare and income distribution issues.

Case studies will be drawn from the development experiences of Asian, Latin American, and African economies. Prerequisite: Economics 101 or 102. 324 - Economics of Immigration This course examines the economic causes and consequences of immigration. The focus of the course will be on the United States' experience. However, we will also examine aspects of other international migrations. The course will focus on the economic reasons that motivate people to migrate to other parts of the world, the labor market and fiscal impacts of immigration on sending and receiving countries, and the economic consequences of U.S. immigration policy choices. Prerequisite: Economics 101. 325 - Labor Economics The goal of Labor Economics is to enable you to use economic analysis and reasoning to understand wage and employment determination in U.S. labor markets. This course will expose you to current theoretical and empirical debates within the discipline. We will cover such topics as labor force participation, labor demand unemployment, labor mobility, wage structure, labor unions, human capital investments (education and training), internal labor markets, and labor market discrimination. Relevant public policy issues such as the minimum wage, living wage ordinances, compensating wage differentials, immigration policy, affirmative action, income inequality, and welfare programs also will be addressed in this course. Prerequisite: Economics 250. 326 - Economics of Human Resource Management An application of economic analysis to various topics in personnel economics, including compensation and incentives, hiring, training, downsizing/buyouts, stock options, pensions, and teams, among many others. In order to add realism to, and applications for the analysis, students will discuss and evaluate numerous real-world mini-cases and more formal case studies. Students will be evaluated on the quality of their written work, problem sets, examinations, and discussion, and a variety of class formats will be used. Prerequisite: Economics 250. Note: students who take this course may not take Professor Moore's section of Economics 495. 328 - Economics of Race and Gender An examination of the historical and contemporary economic positions of women and minorities.

These countries include two of the largest economies in the world (China and Japan), one of the fastest growing developed countries in the world (South Korea), and a rapidly growing country with enormous potential (India). The first part of the course will focus on the recent 183growth and development of China and South Korea, including the similarities between the rise of the US and the rise of China. The second part of the course will focus on Japan and India. A continuing topic will be to try to understand the usefulness and the limitations of Western economic thinking in understanding major non-Western economies and societies. Prerequisite: Economics 101 Counts as a \"300-level class\" for the purpose of completing an economics major only if the student has not taken Economics 304. Prerequisite: ECON 101 or 102 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL/SOUTH/EAST ASIA and REGIONAL FOCUS 337 - The Great Depression The Great Depression of the 1930s was the most significant crisis of capitalism in modern history. It was global in its reach, decreasing economic output and production and bringing international trade and finance to a halt. Businesses and households suffered from banking crises, the restriction of credit, as well as the loss of employment. In the recent 2008 financial crisis, the memory of the Great Depression has often been invoked as a possible worst-case scenario. In this course, we will study the economic and historical circumstances that led to the instability of the economies in the 1920s and the devastating crash that followed. We will learn about the underlying economic models that explain the devastating economic collapse and analyze the political, social, and cultural ramifications of the widespread economic crisis. These include the political challenges to the existing systems of parliamentary democracy embodied in Fascism and Nazism, as well as those from the left. We will examine the social implications of massive unemployment and mass poverty, including homelessness, family dissolution, and \"hoboism.\" We will look at cultural responses to the crisis, including attempts to represent the crisis realistically, as in the \"New Realism\" movements, and efforts to offer distraction from the devastation, such as the Shirley Temple and Busby Berkeley Hollywood films. We will also discuss the role of the interwar Gold Standard in propagating the crisis and look at policy measures taken to stimulate economic activity. Last we will analyze the macroeconomic lessons that have been learned from the Great Depression and look at their implementation and effectiveness in fighting the current economic slump. We will focus on the United States and selected European nations. Prerequisite: Economics 101 or 102. This is the same class as History 337. 340 - Behavioral Economics This course will provide an introduction to the relatively new field of Behavioral Economics. Standard models of economic theory provide a useful, but not always realistic way to characterize how individuals make decisions. In this course we will investigate the evidence showing how people may behave in ways that are not predicted by this standard theory. Individuals may exhibit nonstandard preferences, nonstandard beliefs, or nonstandard decision- making. We will look at each of these in turn with applications that may include saving, finance, labor supply, gift giving, voting, and addiction. The methodology of the course will not itself deviate from the standard way of doing economics; we will state clear assumptions, build models, determine their logical conclusions, and think about how to empirically test both the assumptions and implications of such models. Prerequisite:Economics 250 350 - Managerial Economics The application of economic theory and analytical tools to business and management decision making. Topics to be covered will include examples from a variety of fields, including pricing, 184ethics, entrepreneurial startups, strategy, new products, acquisitions, marketing, human resources, and production. The course will include a large number of case studies with required student presentations. Prerequisite: Economics 250. 351 - Macroeconomic Policy Since the Great Depression Since the financial crisis of 2008, the U.S. economy has languished: unemployment has remained elevated, job growth has been anemic, and poverty rates have risen to levels not seen in decades. What should policymakers do to help get the U.S. economy out of this mess? This course revolves around this question. It does so by analyzing the current macroeconomic policy challenges facing the United States from the vantage point of modern macroeconomics and economic history. Students will read state-of-the-art empirical research in macroeconomics and develop a sense for how macroeconomists conduct research and make policy recommendations. Special emphasis will be placed on exposing students to the major developments of U.S. macroeconomic policy since the Great Depression and on the role of history in guiding contemporary macroeconomic policy decisions and debates. Prerequisite: Economics 251. 361 - Topics in Macro-Economic Theory and Policy This course examines issues in macroeconomics beyond those typically addressed at the intermediate level with a strong emphasis on macroeconomic policy. Specific topics include intertemporal choice in macroeconomics, inflation targeting and the risk management approach to monetary policy, international macroeconomics, recent advances in the study of the aggregate labor market, real business cycle models, government debt and the intertemporal government budget constraint, and time series macroeconomics.

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 190215 - Educating African America This course critically examines the history of the education of Africans in America beginning at the Middle Passage, through Reconstruction and the post-bellum South, to contemporary post- industrial urban contexts. Emphasizing the sociohistorical and political-economic dimensions of schooling African Americans, the course explores the role of key factors in shaping the academic 'success' and 'failure' of Black students historically and in current K-16 contexts. Analysis of case law, policy, and practice will inform our understanding of African American experiences in schools nationally and locally. Further, we consider the implications these experiences hold for democratic participation and the overall life chances of African American citizens. Prerequisites: Education 201 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 219 - Educational Inequality This course will analyze the educational infrastructure PK-16 pipeline to examine the nature of inequality. The following three areas will be examined: 1) theories of educational inequality, 2) research on inequality, and 3) policies of inequality. Students will gain a basic understanding of the theories of educational inequality as they relate to genetic, cultural, school and societal perspectives using a critical theory lens. Students will also examine the research addressing educational inequality paying attention to designs, methods and samples covered. And finally, students will analyze educational policies that either reproduce or eliminate inequalities. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 283 - Technology in Education This course covers the various uses of technology in the classroom as well as other related issues, e.g., differential student access. Students demonstrate their understanding of computers and software through hands-on activities and class presentations. They illustrate how technology can be integrated across the curriculum in the classroom through written lesson plans and units. Students learn to access electronic databases for student/school-level information and for subject matter support. 313 - Educational Policy National reform efforts (e.g., Nation at Risk, No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top) have permeated the educational establishment for decades, yet the achievement gap between rich and poor, and white - non-white students has shown no appreciable progress. This course will analyze current and past policies in education intended to improve the educational experience of all students and address this achievement gap. Students will receive an understanding of policy formation, the effect of applied research relative to educational policy and then select a reform policy (e.g., value-added teacher pay, class size, charter schools, etc.) to further investigate as a project field assignment.

Prerequisites: Education 201, 205 & 300 (concurrent or permission of instructor). 315 - Critical Pedagogy in Secondary Urban Schools In this course, the students will understand that unlike traditional perspectives of education that claim to be neutral and apolitical, critical pedagogy views all education theory as intimately linked to ideologies shaped by power, politics, history and culture. Given this view, schooling functions as a terrain of ongoing struggle over what will be accepted as legitimate knowledge and culture. In accordance with this notion, critical pedagogy must seriously address the concept of cultural politics both legitimizing and challenging cultural experiences that comprise the histories and social realities that in turn comprise the forms and boundaries that give meaning to student lives. This course will ask students to conduct 15 hours of fieldwork to analyze and evaluate the current state of urban education as well as see transformational models that are possible CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 316 - Healthy and Safe Schools and Communities In this course, single subject students are provided multiple opportunities to learn and practice how personal, family, school, community, and environmental factors are related to students' academic, physical, emotional, and social well-being. Students acquire knowledge about diverse family structures, community cultures, and child rearing practices in order to develop respectful and productive relationships with families and communities. Students learn about major laws and principles that address student rights and parent rights pertaining to student placements. In addition, they have an opportunity to learn about the effects of student health, safety, and accident prevention on student learning. Prerequisites: Education 201 or permission of instructor. 318 - Learning Disabilities and Schools Students in this course will examine laws and policies related to the education of students with special needs in public schools. Principles and practices of effective implementation of these mandates will be analyzed through readings, case studies, guest speakers and reflections from field observations. Students will also learn and practice planning, instruction and assessment and analyze the role of instructional technology in realizing the goals of providing a free and appropriate inclusive education for students with special needs. Requires thirty-six hours participation in tutoring and teaching in public school classroom. Prerequisite: Education 201 or permission of instructor. 320 - Critical Race Theory in Education Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a historic movement among legal scholars of color in the U.S. that has enjoyed widespread application in a number of disciplines, including Education. This 192course introduces students to CRT through a close reading of the key writings that formed the movement. We will examine the application of CRT in education research, theory and practice contextualized in a variety of settings including schools, community-based organizations, and other relevant spaces. Specific attention will be paid to the CRT methodology of counter- storytelling and its utility in centering the experiential knowledge of people of color in education. Prerequisite: A 200-level course in Education, or instructor permission CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 341 - Math/Science Specific Pedagogies During interrelated coursework and fieldwork, students are provided with instruction and supervised practice to plan and deliver content-specific instruction/pedagogy focusing on the state-adopted academic content standards and/or curriculum framework in the Math and Science content areas. The course provides multiple opportunities for each Math and Science candidate (a) to learn, practice and reflect on the specific pedagogical knowledge and skills targeting the subject-specific Teaching Performance Expectations (TPEs). The focus of the course is on planning and organizing instruction to foster student achievement of state-adopted Math and Science academic content standards and using instructional strategies, materials, technologies and other resources to make content accessible to students. Prerequisites: Education 201 and 205 or permission of instructor) . 350 - Freire, Fanon, & Freedom in Education \"How can the oppressed, as divided, unauthentic beings, participate in developing the pedagogy of their liberation?\" This course focuses on Freire's theoretical, pedagogical, and practical contributions to contemporary movements in critical pedagogy, critical literacy, and educating for 'social justice'. Beginning with Franz Fanon's influences on Freirean thinking about revolution and decolonization, we will analyze the construction of the 'Pedagogy of the Oppressed'. We pay particular attention to the role of the Hegelian dialectic as a driving philosophical method, as well as the significance of Freirean themes in understanding contemporary schooling, education, community activism, and vocation in general. Students will analyze, critique, and reflect upon their own framing philosophies for personal engagement with oppressed peoples and communities - towards the broader goal of defining an individual role in the development of a pedagogy of the oppressed that both negotiates and is informed by students' multiple identities. Prerequisite: A 200-level course in Education, or instructor permission.

Students in English and Comparative Literary Studies (ECLS) courses read works from British, American, and world literary traditions, including those of classical Greece and Rome. We ask our students to become knowledgeable both about well- known writers and about voices traditionally excluded from literary canons. In addition to providing an experience of intense reading and discussion of individual literary works, departmental courses strive to present those works in a rich historical context of human social, political, and psychological behavior. Students are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the various theories of literature and representation that have informed literary analysis since Aristotle. All ECLS courses involve extensive work in close reading, critical thinking, and analytical writing. Most courses in the department are conducted as lecture/discussions or as seminars, with a strong emphasis on interaction and the collaborative construction of knowledge. In the required survey courses (ECLS 286-289) students learn the breadth and diversity of literary history; in required majors' seminars in the sophomore, junior, and senior years they develop increasingly sophisticated skills in literary analysis, discussion, writing, research, and 194presentation. Requirements MAJOR: A minimum of eleven courses (44 units). These must include three historical survey courses (ECLS 286 or 287, ECLS 288, and ECLS 289) and two seminars for majors (ECLS 390 and ECLS 490). Students may substitute one of the first-year courses 186-189 for its counterpart in the 200-level historical survey series. The remaining six elective courses should be chosen in consultation with the adviser; they must include one course from each of the following four categories, and no more than two taken at the 200-level: Ancient Literature (courses numbered 200-209 or 300-309) Medieval and Renaissance Literature (courses numbered 210-229 or 310-329) 18th and 19th Century Literature (courses numbered 230-249 or 330-349) 20th and 21st Century Literature (courses numbered 250-269 or 350-369). Students considering going on to graduate work in literature are strongly encouraged to take additional ECLS courses beyond the minimum of eleven which will broaden and deepen their knowledge of literary history. They should also take ECLS 370, Literary Criticism. Most graduate programs also require proficiency in at least one foreign language. ACCEPTABLE COURSES FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS: Some literature courses in American Studies and several upper-division literature courses in Chinese, CTSJ, French, German, Greek, Japanese, Latin, Russian, and Spanish may be used to fulfill requirement. Contact the department chair for additional information. CREATIVE WRITING EMPHASIS: Students majoring in English and Comparative Literary Studies may elect to take an additional number of courses in order to complete a Creative Writing Emphasis, a special track which provides a strong background in both literature and creative writing skills. Students choosing this emphasis must take a total of 12 courses, including ECLS one course from each of the historical periods noted above as Ancient Literature, Medieval and Renaissance Literature, 18th and 19th Century Literature. Only one of these may be from ECLS 200-249); and four additional writing courses. These four may include ECLS 380 (may be repeated for credit), ECLS 397 and/or 499; a variety of English Writing classes: 285, 286, 301, 401; Theater 380; French 343. Other opportunities for students interested in writing are listed in the catalog and are available from the emphasis director, Professor Martha Ronk. Students interested in pursuing the emphasis in writing should work out a careful program in consultation with Professor Ronk. MINOR: Five courses (20 units); two courses from 286-289 (a first-year course from 186-189 may substitute for one of these); and three other courses, two of which must be taken at the 300-level. ADVANCED PLACEMENT POLICY: ECLS majors who before entering Occidental have completed the AP test in English with a score of 4 or 5 may petition the department chair to be allowed to graduate with 10 courses (including all required courses and historical categories) rather than the 11 specified above. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in English and Comparative Literary Studies 195will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's college-wide writing requirement by successfully completing ECLS 390 in the junior year and receiving a notation of \"Satisfactory\" for its writing component. See the department chair for information concerning specific writing skills assessed for satisfaction of the requirement. Those students who, for legitimate reasons (study abroad, late entry into the major, etc.), cannot take ECLS 390 in the junior year will be required to submit a portfolio of written work consisting of three papers written in ECLS courses to the department chair for evaluation by a faculty committee by the end of the junior year. Students not achieving a \"satisfactory\" notation by either of these means will be required to undertake additional coursework in academic writing during the final two semesters of study. ECLS majors should acquire the full description of the departmental writing requirement at the time of declaring the major. See the Writing Program for additional information. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: All majors must take ECLS 490 (Senior Seminar) in the fall of the senior year, where they will design, develop, and complete a significant project involving literary research and analysis. The project will result in a substantial paper and a 20-minute formal oral presentation at the ECLS Senior Symposium held during the spring semester. See the department chair for more details. HONORS: Honors may be awarded to graduating seniors who demonstrate excellence in course work and in an honors thesis. To be eligible, students must have a 3.5 grade point average in courses taken toward the major and an overall 3.25 grade point average. Qualified students who want to pursue honors should consult with the department chair during the spring semester of the junior year and should submit a proposal for an honors thesis by the end of the first week of Fall semester. Students whose proposals are accepted will register for ECLS 499 (Honors), usually for two units in both the fall and spring semesters, and they will write a thesis to be completed and orally defended before a faculty committee during the spring semester. Honors candidates are required to take ECLS 370; if possible they should take it in the junior year. For further details, see the department chair or your ECLS advisor and pick up a copy of the ECLS honors regulations in the department office. Courses ECLS Courses Open to All Majors ECLS courses numbered 200-290 are open to all Occidental students of any major who have completed the first-year fall CSP writing seminar. No more than two may be counted toward the ECLS major. 106 - Representing the Metropolis In the US, roughly 80% of the population lives in urban regions (2000 US Census), while according to United Nations figures, about 52% of people are urban-dwellers worldwide. This course will examine various representations of the modern metropolis through film, literature, and cultural theory. The city, as we experience it today is the product of multiple historical, cultural, and social forces. Over the course of the semester, we will consider how cities have been shaped by these forces, as well as how they, in turn, shape our own experience and 196understanding of culture, history, and social practices. In an era of increasing globalization and mobility, the role of the metropolis continues to evolve and expand. As we consider representations of the city in a variety of films and novels from around the world, including some from our own city of Los Angeles, we will interrogate the ways in which the city has played a formative role in how we imagine life in the contemporary moment. In what ways has the city become a vehicle for the production of culture? How does life in the city serve to normativize certain notions of what it means to live in the modern world? How does life in rural spaces complicate representations of modernity that take the city as their norm? Does the city promote accessibility, or, alternatively, does it rigidify codes of exclusivity? These are some of the many questions we will address as we consume a spectrum of world cinema and literature. As we work our way through the material, we will strive to develop a complex understanding of how cities shape our cultural imagination. Emphasis topic: Postcolonial Theory. Same as CTSJ 106 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 189 - American Experiences A historical survey of the major literary genres from the colonial to the contemporary period, emphasizing the persistent thematics of the American experience from a cross-cultural perspective. This class is particularly suited for students interested in the ways in which well- known American authors are in conversation with African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos/as, and white women, who, until recently, had been left out of the literary canon. Open only to first year students. ECLS 189 counts as the equivalent of ECLS 289 toward the ECLS major. Students may not receive credit for both 189 and 289. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 205 - Wake of the Ancient The object of this course (as the three- or four-fold pun of its title implies) is not only to celebrate Ancient Literature on the occasion of its supposed passing, but also to highlight the ways in which Ancient Literature has informed the creation of ? and might yet continue to re- inform our understanding of-many subsequent forms of literary expression. The course will begin, therefore, with the close textual analysis of one or more ancient literary works, and proceed with a comparative study of a text (or texts) drawn from later literary traditions. Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, English Writing 201, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 220 - An Introduction to Shakespeare An introductory study of Shakespeare's plays both as text and as performance. We will investigate five plays in detail in an attempt to establish our own relationship with the Shakespearean text. We will then view at least three films of each play and inquire into the ways in which these films seek to mediate our reception of the text, the influence this mediation has upon our view of the text, and the specific means by which each cinematic interpretation of Shakespeare is constructed. Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, Writing and Rhetoric 201, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 241 - Race, Law, and Literature 197A study of the construction and representation of race in selected American literary works and law cases around the turn of the twentieth century. Fiction by authors such as Mark Twain, Charles Chesnutt, William Dean Howells, and Frances Harper will be read in the context of the legal history that led up to and built upon the famous 1896 \"separate but equal\" Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson. Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, Writing and Rhetoric 201, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 253 - African American Literature In this introductory class we will examine African American literature and culture by reading across genres that include multiple genres such as the slave narrative, fiction, the essay, theater and poetry. Some attention will also be paid to primary research skills and to oral presentations that are sophisticated in terms of content and multimedia. Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, English Writing 201, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 255 - Twentieth Century American Fiction Dick and Deleuze: this course will consider the novels and short stories of Philip K. Dick, perhaps the most famous and original science fiction writer of the 20th century. To decode Dick's strange fiction, we will employ the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze especially as he wrote in association with the psychologist Felix Guattari. While students will only be required to view the texts through close-reading, history, and genre considerations, our further objective will be to apply the notion of \"Schizo-analytics\"developed by Deleuze and Guattari to resist the materialism of late capitalism and the mental confinements supplied by Freudian portrayals of sanity. Prerequisite: Completion of Fall CSP Seminar or Equivalent CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 267 - The Death of Hip- Hop: Liner Notes to an Aesthetic Theory If the deaths of the novel, of poetry, of painting, of sculpture, and of opera might serve as indicators, then perhaps the death of U.S. hip-hop suggests it is transforming, moving into a new phase? The thought-experiment inspiring this course does not question what might hip- hop might give to the world. On the contrary, it questions if the world can critically accept and appreciate what hip-hop might offer it. Theoretical readings include Tricia Rose's Black Noise, Adam Bradley's Book of Rhymes; Jeff Chang's Total Chaos; selections from Theodor Adorno's Aesthetic Theory and Philosophy of Music; music will include the work of Notorious BIG, J Dilla, Kanye West, Lauryn Hill, Wu Tang Clan, Outkast, and Erykah Badu. Prerequisite: Any first year fall CSP writing seminar, Writing and Rhetoric 201, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 272 - Major Figures: Du Bois and Hyperbolic Thinking This course is an in-depth engagement with the thought and activism of W.E.B. Du Bois. Despite the currency of some of his texts and concepts, only recently have scholars have called for a more focused engagement with Du Bois' vast and diverse set of writings. Some have reduced Du Bois' legacy to a few salient points that they say cover his entire career; others have periodized his thought too rigidly to consider its flexibility. But neither of these approaches helps us understand how and why Du Bois spent over 70 years (and over 175,000 198pages) using philosophy, fiction, correspondence, editorials, novels, poetry, lectures, and historiographies to reformulate his understanding of African Americans in US society and the world. This course involves close readings of Du Bois corpus, framing him as a key thinker of modernity, democracy, and the role of the intellectual through his ongoing analysis of the African American. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 278 - Literature and Philosophy: Humor This class will attempt to find a theory of the laughable. We will read short stories and brief novels from Twain to Nabokov and philosophers from Aristotle to Nietzsche. 279 - Literature and Politics Body/Politics . Linking literature and politics, the course offers an interdisciplinary analysis of gender, power and the body. The theoretical center of the course will be Foucault's work on biopower. We will also look at issues of class and the body (including Chopin's The Awakening, Larsen's Passing, and Atwood's Bodily Harm); egalitarian law and the female body (Wendy Williams, Mary Poovey); science and gender (Emily Martin, Thomas Laqueur); and pornography (Catherine McKinnon, Laura Kipnis). Race and multiculturalism can also be viewed through this lens, and we will read Morrison's Beloved. Judith Butler's work offers yet another approach, questioning whether bodily differences determine sex or gender. Recent Latin American history of military rule and repression has emphasized the role of the body and memory in political change. Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, Writing and Rhetoric 201, or permission of instructor. 280 - Creative Writing In this multi-genre creative writing workshop, we will explore the paradox of identity. Author Sandra Cisneros' has said you should \"write about what makes you different.\" What does this mean and where does it lead you? How do we evoke culture, class, ethnicity in our work? How can we (and might we want to) situate our work in a specific time and place, to locate our characters in a world so particular only we can describe it? Besides writing and sharing their own work, students will be asked to read and discuss a variety of writers who explore identity and difference, including Gish Jen, Nam Le, Paul Beatty and Jeannette Winterson.. Prerequisite: junior or senior standing or instructor's permission 281 - Urban Nature Writing This course, taught by Los Angeles poet, activist, and founder of the Friends of the Los Angeles River, will include presentations, discussions, and readings drawing on the language (and poetry) of nature, of Los Angeles, of the River, of politics, and the different ways that MacAdams has himself produced language that captures his interests - and life work. The course will be taught in the second half of fall semester 2011. It may be taken independently for 2 units or linked with UEP 211, The Los Angeles River, to produce a 4-unit course. 286 - European Literary Traditions This course will examine literary themes and styles from a number of Pre-Modern cultures: 199Archaic and Classical Greece, Republican and Imperial Rome, the medieval societies of England, France, Germany, and Italy. Special emphasis will be laid upon the ways in which the concerns of ancient and medieval literature continue to shape our own immediate English and American literary productions. Genres to be covered include: epic, lyric, tragedy, comedy, long narrative, and epistle. Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, Writing and Rhetoric 201, or permission of instructor. Students may not receive credit for both 186 and 286. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 287 - Early British Literary Traditions One of the three introductory courses for the major designed to provide a broad historical background and covering texts from Beowulf through Paradise Lost. The course includes the various genres of epic, drama, and poetry, and demands both close reading and an understanding of how the texts are produced by particular cultural and historical periods. Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, Writing and Rhetoric 201, or permission of instructor. Students may not receive credit for both 187 and 287. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 288 - Modern British Literary Traditions The course will focus on British literary traditions since 1660, with references to other national literatures. It will emphasize the close reading of both poetry and prose. Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, Writing and Rhetoric 201, or permission of instructor. Students may not receive credit for both 188 and 288. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 289 - American Experiences This class surveys American Literature from the Puritans to the Moderns. We will study periods, genres, authors, and cultural trends in a historical framework. Significant emphasis will be placed on responsible reading and analytic writing. Students will be introduced to the nomenclature of literary analysis through close readings of individual texts. Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, Writing and Rhetoric 201, or permission of instructor. Students may not receive credit for both 189 and 289. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 290 - Introduction to Literary Analysis This course will introduce potential ECLS majors and other interested students to the basic principles and techniques of literary study. Each section will look closely at various literary forms and will investigate the analytical resources with which these forms are most commonly approached. The course will also look at the relationship between literary texts and literary theory. Students should expect ample practice in analytical writing. It is intended principally for ECLS majors and satisfies no core requirement. Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, Writing and Rhetoric 201, or permission of instructor. 297 - Independent Study in ECLS Prerequisite: permission of department. 2 or 4 units 200345 - American Literature Before 1990 DICKINSON. This class will read a very limited number of Dickinson'slyrics with extraordinary attention to the details of syntax, semantics, and sound. Her poetry will be analyzed against the default presumptions of \"common sense\" and the dominant predispositions of metaphysics. Her poetic practice will appear then not as a mimetic form but as a material intervention into linguistic habituations. To help understand the ideas she uses, we will read brief snippets of philosophy along with the works Upper Level ECLS Courses ECLS courses numbered 300-385 are designed primarily for ECLS majors and students from other majors with some experience in reading and writing about literature at an advanced level. Successful completion of one 100-level or 200level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing, is required for these courses. In some cases individual instructors may require additional prerequisites, as listed below. 297 - Independent Study in ECLS Prerequisite: permission of department. 2 or 4 units 300 - Survey of Ancient Greek Literature CORE REQUIREMENT MET: PRE-1800 303 - Genres in Classical Literature This course examines the meanings, effects, social contexts and historic development of one of the major Classical genres: epic, lyric, tragedy, comedy, and so forth. In 2010-2011, the course will focus on the ode, especially as represented in the works of Pindar. Attention will also be given to the long term socio-cultural effects of ode in subsequent European literary history, as for instance in Horace, the English and German Romantics, and others. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 309 - The Bible as Literature and Philosophy We will read selections from the Old and New Testaments, together with Medieval and Modern commentaries by such figures as Rashi, Maimonides, Ibn Ezra, Spinoza, 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: PRE-1800 310 - Medieval Literature: Poetry and Platonism in the Middles Ages The philosophy of Plato has had many interpreters but perhaps none so important as the Neo- Platonic philosophers of late antiquity and the Middle Ages. Medieval interpretations of Plato 201influenced nearly every manifestation of western art and culture from the time of St. Augustine to the late 15th century and the foundation of the Platonic Academy in Florence where the actual writings of Plato were finally made available to the west. In ECLS 310 we will look at the philosophy of Plato as it was understood in the Middle Ages, and we will trace its influence on medieval literature including the poetry of Chretien deTroyes, Dante, and Chaucer in an effort to discover some of the earliest expressions of many of the principal themes in western literary culture.. Prerequisite: Any 100 or 200-level ECLS course or junior or senior standing. Can be repeated one time CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE ? PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 318 - Chaucer An analysis of Chaucer's major poetry and the insight it provides into the social, religious, philosophical, and psychological instability of the fourteenth century. We will place Chaucer's texts in the context of both literary and intellectual history, and we will confront directly their relevance to an understanding of the most persistent idioms of Western culture. Prerequisite: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. Prior completion of ECLS 287 is highly recommended. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 320 - Shakespeare Shakespeare's plays explore the deep anxiety attached to the experience of being in the world, the instability of a personal identity rooted in nothing more substantial than its own performance. This performance, in turn, is persistently upstaged by the paradox of desire: the pleasure of longing unreconcilled with the yearning for fulfillment. We will read ten plays that span Shakespeare's career and investigate how he returns again and again to the themes of identity and desire, performance and being. In the process we will explore the questions Shakespeare raises about what it means to be in the world. Prerequisite: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 322 - Renaissance Literature An investigation of Renaissance literary texts as vehicles for conflicting, at times self- contradictory, expressions of private desire, moral authority, and political power. We will focus especially on texts of melancholy, using Hamlet in text and film as a primary focus, and including As You Like It, Shakespeare's sonnets, Webster's The Duchess of Malfi, poems by paired 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 330 - Restoration and Eighteenth Century British Literature A survey of poetry, prose and drama from 1660-1730. Authors to be studied include Aphra Behn, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Daniel Defoe and Jonathan Swift. Prerequisite: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 332 - Eighteenth Century Literature: 1730-1800 202The Gothic - this class will attempt to trace the origins and oddities of gothic/horror fiction from its roots in the Bible and Shakespeare to its \"official\" onset in Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. From there, we will explore its convolutions ending with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Our discussion will be bracketed by the aesthetics of the sublime and the contending concepts of chaos and reproduction. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 341 - Race and Literature Bondage Up North: Rethinking Slavery. When Americans think about \"bondage,\" the images of southern slavery generally come to mind: plantations and cotton, coffles and the Civil War. This class will consider narratives of enslavement that depart from the conventional model in order to explore the ways in which \"bondage\" was a part of the broader United States. What do we make of the fact that Sojourner Truth was enslaved in New York? We will read narratives and criticism that examine Northern bondage and will consider the historical erasure that has relegated this exploitation and violence to the South in the popular imagination. This class also focuses on student engagement with criticism; one of its objectives is to significantly improve student's writing competencies and confidence. Prerequisite: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 345 - American Literature Before 1990 DICKINSON. This class will read a very limited number of Dickinson'slyrics with extraordinary attention to the details of syntax, semantics, and sound. Her poetry will be analyzed against the default presumptions of \"common sense\" and the dominant predispositions of metaphysics. Her poetic practice will appear then not as a mimetic form but as a material intervention into linguistic habituations. To help understand the ideas she uses, we will read brief snippets of philosophy along with the works 346 - Beautiful Democracy: 19th Century Af Am Lit This course thinks through current debates over the relationship between literary aesthetics and harmony in American democracy. Does aesthetics foster a more harmonious or disharmonious national culture? Does aesthetics create more peaceful cities and craft a common culture? Should its subject matter be legal resolutions to conflict and representations of peaceful communities? Or, is disharmony ever important to progress? How does literature represent protests for social change that are often only possible outside the law, like the many freedmen and freedwomen escaping slavery and demanding the destruction of that system? How does this alter our understandings of what it means to be \"fugitive\"? How can the fugitive fighting for freedom be distinguished from the unprincipled outlaw? From another perspective, we will consider how the complications of American society have altered certain traditional literary forms. While recent scholarship has addressed these questions in regards to early to mid 20th century literature, this course will look back further, starting from the early 19th century to the very beginning of the 20th. will complement the literature by reading relevant historical materials from the abolitionist movement, labor movements, government debates over Emancipation and Reconstruction, etc. The course will include literature from Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Walt Whitman, Ida B Wells, and Charles Chesnutt, amongst others, and cover several genres, including oratory, autobiography, political pamphlets and short fiction. 203347 - 19th Century Novel and Bollywood Cinema This course will examine nineteenth century British and Indian novels in dialogue with their twentieth century Bollywood adaptations. A product of the largest film industry in the world, Indian cinema is consumed globally. Questions of globalism were also central to nineteenth century novels, which were written during the height of colonial rule. We will examine the films and novels, paying particular attention to representations of cultural subject formation, gender and racial norms, and nationalist sentiment in the era of empire and the postcolonial moment. Prerequisite: Any 100 or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 351 - Twentieth Century British Fiction Readings in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Anglo/Irish fiction, with particular attention to the crises of masculine and imperial power that early modern writers encountered and reflected in their fiction. Authors will include Conrad, Kipling, Joyce, Lawrence, Woolf, and Forster. Prerequisite: any 100 or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 352 - Contested Territories: Ethnic/Racial Literatures of the U.S. \"SouthWest\" This course will study texts which treat the \"Southwest\" as a determining and originary site of cultural interaction and expressive production. An attention to social geography (the felt \"sense of place\" effected by social history) will guide our examination of literary and popular cultural texts produced by Euro-Americans, Chicanos/Mexicanos, and Native Americans. Beginning with the hegemonic discourse of the \"Southwestern Genre\" (Charles F. Lummis) at the turn of the century, we will consider subsequent mediations of this historically complex and culturally rich geography. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 353 - The Global 1930s:Literature, Philosophy & Politics Reading the Global 1930s: Depression-era Literature, Philosophy and Politics Frequently, US politicians, including President Obama, have said the Great Depression of the 1930s is the only economic crisis that surpasses the world's current economic travails. This frequent comparison does not exhaust the significance of the Great Depression for the US or around the world. What makes the 1930s so intriguing is that, all over the world, the economic collapse spawned new or renewed older political and artistic movements. Most importantly, in the Global 1930s thinkers and artists all over the world not only rethought their political identities; they also pondered the very meaning of the political for the past, present, and the future and felt that art and philosophy were central to their investigations. This is important for humanities scholarship because even if we are currently exiting the \"Second Great Depression\" in terms of economic productivity, the question remains: what cultural rebuilding remains to be done and how does art contribute to such processes? 1930s writers took up this question in several different forms, through the trope of the document and its archival drive, the unconscious and the search for the Marvelous, the raised fist of labor movements or anti-racist activism. Simply put, what can the First Great Depression of the 1930s teach us about cultural reconstruction in the Second Great Depression of the early 2000s? This course will look at several literary (and related art) movements in and cutting across America, the Caribbean, and Europe. Texts will include (but are not limited to) literature from Richard Wright, Langston Hughes, and Muriel 204Rukeyser; from Surrealist writers in Europe and the Caribbean like Andre Breton, Aime and Suzanne Cesaire; and political readings from figures like Antonia Gramsci. Although this is a literary course, it will also be informative to students in History, Art, Philosophy and Politics. 354 - Chicano Literature A survey of major works and authors in the Chicano literary tradition, covering the genres of poetry, novel, short story and drama. Some attention will also be paid to the relationship of literature to forms of popular culture, such as video, film, graphic art, and music. Prerequisite: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 355 - The Global 1930s:Literature, Philosophy & Politics Reading the Global 1930s: Depression-era Literature, Philosophy and Politics Frequently, US politicians, including President Obama, have said the Great Depression of the 1930s is the only economic crisis that surpasses the world's current economic travails.

Although this is a literary course, it will also be informative to students in History, Art, Philosophy and Politics. 356 - Black Reconstruction:Rethinking Black Radicalism in African American Literature Through lecture and class discussion, this course focuses on writings from African American authors pondering the possibilities and goals of reconstructing their communities and the United States at large. We will cover multiple literary genres-including poetry, slave narrative, novel, and the essay, among others-used in the African American literary tradition placed in their historical, cultural, and institutional contexts. By reading the African American literary tradition in these contexts, we will pursue a number of questions, regarding issues of political agency, the role of the writer as intellectual, the relationship of literature to the folk, and literature as an avenue of recovering alternative histories. Prerequisite: Any 100 or 200-level ECLS course or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNTIED STATES 358 - Modern Poetry 205This course will be devoted to studying the work of a series of major figures in poetry and poetics. Each of these-Pound, Eliot, Stein, Stevens, H.D., Williams, Oppen, and members of the New York School-undertakes ambitious experiments that expand the formal and perceptual bounds of poetry. The purpose of the course is to read each poem carefully and slowly; and to understand major artistic movements as they address culture, including war, urbanization and capitalism, the fragmentation of identity, and changes in technology. We will specifically examine the use of collage. Students will have opportunities to write analytically and/or creatively. T.S. Eliot: \"poets in our civilization, as it exists at present, must be difficult. Prerequisite: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNTIED STATES 359 - Probing the Limits of Representation: The Holocaust The Holocaust has been positioned at the limits of representation -- as the indescribable, the incomprehensible. The impossibility of adequately expressing the atrocities of the Holocaust stands in contrast to the need to transmit knowledge about this event to later generations. Attempts to represent the Holocaust, to describe and understand this event and its implications, are numerous and have occurred across a wide range of media forms (literature, film, photography, art, music, monuments, etc.), and genres (as in documentary, drama, comedy, science fiction). As the Holocaust recedes in time and the numbers of living historical witnesses and survivors decline, these representations increasingly shape our perception and understanding of the event. This course will investigate literary, filmic, and artistic representations of the Holocaust, focusing in particular on questions of ethics, aesthetics, and history. We will begin with a historical survey and then turn to examining the various debates and controversies surrounding the issue of representation of the Shoah and discuss some of the theoretical texts that have shaped the area of Holocaust Studies. Finally, we will explore the ways in which these written, filmic, and artistic cultural artifacts have attempted to narrate the events of the Holocaust, and examine exemplary responses to the Shoah in a variety of media forms and genres. The course will deal with questions of ethics and aesthetics, such as the meaning of art and the limits of historical representation. What are the aesthetic and ethical implications of creating art about the Holocaust? Does all representation entail an aestheticization of horror? What are the implications of the commercialization of the Holocaust? Students will obtain a basic grasp of the historical events; they will gain an interdisciplinary, personalized, historical, and cultural understanding of this genocide; and are exposed to ongoing debates regarding the limits of representation of the Holocaust. Prerequisites for ECLS 359: any 200-level ECLS course, or permission of instructor. Same as GERM 320 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURA 365 - Contemporary Literature The Anglophone Novel. This course will focus on the global novel in English. By 1914 the British Empire had colonized almost 85% of the world, bringing diverse cultural traditions under the encyclopedic gaze of Western modernity. If part of the project of the colonial apparatus was to collect knowledge of the world in ways that bodies, cultures, and landscapes could be understood and ordered by the West, contemporary societies are now negotiating their own means of self-representation in the often violent space of postcolonial rupture. Throughout the term, we will work with texts and visual images produced out of, and in response to, the history of the colonial encounter. Drawing on a broad range of literary, filmic, and theoretical materials we will develop strategies for understanding the production and consumption of postcolonial 206representation, in both local and global contexts. As consumers of these cultural products within the space of the Western academy, we will be attentive to the function of the stereotype as we consider representations of gender and sexuality, violence and terrorism, class structures, and migration. Texts considered will include Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things, Tsitsi Dangarembga's Nervous Shani Mootoo's Cereus Blooms at Night, and Tayeb Salih's Season of Migration to the North. Prerequisiste: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES Directions in Contemporary American Fiction. An examination of innovative literary techniques and thematic preoccupations in significant works of American fiction written since the end of WWII. Among the writers we will consider are Ralph Ellison, Sandra Cisneros, Don DeLillo, Kurt Vonnequt, Tim O'Brien, and Louise Erdrich. Prerequisite: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES Comparative U.S. /Latino Cultural Studies. Through analyses of literature, film, music and graphic arts we will explore how Latinos have understood and represented their individual and collective social experiences in the United States. In order to allow some depth of comparison, primary attention will be given to the expressive cultures of Chicanos in Los Angeles and Puerto Ricans in New York. However, other national-origin Latino communities will be selectively incorporated to the course. Secondary texts of cultural criticism, social theory and community history will be read alongside the primary creative texts. Prerequisite: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 367 - IIluminated Manuscripts: From Comic Books to Graphic Literaure This course will study the evolution of word-and-image narratives from their pulp origins in early superhero and action comics to their contemporary emergence as a recognized medium of \"high\" cultural expression. The texts will be primarily from the United States, but some attention may be given to foreign works in translation. In addition, we may also consider how graphic narratives compare as a medium to related works in print literature and cinema. Prerequisite: Any 100 or 200-level ECLS course or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENTS MET: UNITED STATES 368 - Post Colonial Literature and Theory This course will provide an introduction to some of the critical issues (modernity, hybridity, nationalism, globalization, etc.) that link disparate national literatures under the sign of \"postcoloniality.\" While the major focus of the class will be on the theoretical texts produced in response to colonial occupation and the process of decolonization, we will also consider the ways in which postcolonial literature performs, and at times challenges, the paradigms of postcolonial theory. Through this engagement we will develop an understanding of the complex dialogue which emerges between literature and theory in the postcolonial context. In addition, throughout the course, we will look at how the many stylistic techniques (e.g., the use of patois, magical realism, temporal experimentation) which are particular to this body of literature not only develop a new mode of expression, but also interrogate the conventions of the Western canon. In this manner, our analysis of literature will be supplemented by a consideration of postcolonial theory in order to contextualize the literature within an 207understanding of the particular historical, political, and social discourses from which it emerges. Conversely, our study of theory will be anchored in a discussion of the ways in which it is materially practiced in its accompanying literary context. This survey will include authors such as Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, Arundhati Roy, as well as Said. Prerequisite: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 369 - Archaeologies of Black Memory This course engages with recent theoretical, aesthetic, and practical concerns with the \"archive\" in the Black Diaspora. We will focus especially on how scholars on the Black Diaspora have thought critically and imaginatively about the archive, blurring the lines between critical discourse, historical investigation, and aesthetic representation. In this hybrid space, perhaps we will hear the silences that speak so loudly about black subjection and agency in the archive. Theory from David Scott and Michel Foucault, text art from Glenn Ligon, travel narratives from Saidiya Hartman, and poetry from the likes of Langston Hughes and Marlene Nourbese Philip will aid our exploration.Prerequisite: Successful completion of one 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 370 - Literary Criticism This course engages with recent theoretical, aesthetic, and practical concerns with the \"archive\" in the Black Diaspora. We will focus especially on how scholars on the Black Diaspora have thought critically and imaginatively about the archive, blurring the lines between critical discourse, historical investigation, and aesthetic representation. In this hybrid space, perhaps we will hear the silences that speak so loudly about black subjection and agency in the archive. Theory from David Scott and Michel Foucault, text art from Glenn Ligon, travel narratives from Saidiya Hartman, and poetry from the likes of Langston Hughes and Marlene Nourbese Philip will aid our exploration.Prerequisite: Successful completion of one 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 372 - Major Figures in Literature Faulkner and Morrison. Discussion of the major novels of William Faulkner and Toni Morrison. Prerequisise: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 373 - A Genre in Literature Lavender Cowboys: The Erotics of the American Western. An exploration of the fantasy world of cowboys (and Indians and others) inscribed on the American West, from Texas to California to Wyoming, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Through close readings of themes of violence and sexuality, we will consider the ways in which the Western reflected or responded to an evolving sociopolitical culture of \"manliness.\" Primary writers will include Mark Twain, Owen Wister, Theodore Roosevelt, Mary Austin, Zane Grey, and Willa Cather, but we will also spend some time considering the lingering presence of the West in 21st century culture. Prerequisite: any 100 or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 208374 - Women Writers In 2010-2011: Women novelists of the 19th and 20th centuries: Anglo-American writers Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot, Kate Chopin, Virginia Woolf; and African American writers Harriet Jacobs, Nella Larsen, Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, and Jamaica Kincaid. 375 - Lit and Hist: Blackness: Literary, Theoretical and Historical Explorations This course provides a conceptual history of \"blackness\" as it shapes and is shaped by the aesthetic, the philosophical, and the political. Although the course could be described as a study of marginal identity, its true focus is on nonidentity-the creative flux at the heart of blackness and, by extension, humanity at large. The course stages an encounter between the theories and aesthetics of the Black Radical tradition, on the one hand, and Western leftist theory, particularly Marxism, on the other. We will read short, poignant essays/chapters from theorists like Cedric Robinson, Karl Marx, Saidiya Hartman, Fred Moten, and Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. These theoretical essays will be read alongside literary \"case studies\" from African American (and some African Diasporic) writers, in the genres of slave narrative, the novel, and experimental poetry, including Frederick Douglass, Zora Neale of one 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 377 - Literature and the Other Arts Orson Welles and Literature: Often rated the greatest film maker of the 20th century, this course will attempt to understand Welles use of literature. We will begin with his Shakespeare films, pass through Kafka, and detective fiction to end with a close examination of his filmic realization of his own novel, Mr. Arkadin. The course will supply a rudimentary introduction to film history, technology, and theory. Prerequisiste: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES Urban Fictions: The Modern City in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture. This course studies texts in several expressive media and literary genres which have as their subject the problems and promise of urban life in major world-cities of the 19th and 20th centuries. Among the cities we may consider are London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles and Mexico City. Field study in Los Angeles may be incorporated as pertinent events or opportunities come up. Imaging the Image. The term \"photography\" means light writing. As such, it implies a form of language that is unmediated by authorial intention. What the history of photo application has demonstrated, whether digital or analog, is that photography often uses its appearance as unbiased to disguise its indebtedness to the tradition of image and the imaginary. Thus, photography and its varieties ? film, television, computer, etc. ? have come to represent our talent for virtualization, not truth. Since the 19th century, literature has explored this double aspect of photography ? as realism and as ideology or deception. This class will explore this relation using theorists such as Peirce and Berger. The works studied will range from Hawthorne to Dick. 378 - Literature and Philosophy 209Schools of Being in the House of Style. In this course, we shall attempt to come to terms with that most elusive feature of literary and all other arts: style. By surveying selected moments in the history of philosophy, literature, music and the plastic arts, we shall put to the test the idea that style, though non-propositional, may in fact have a kind of referent, a referent to which (to use the language of Heidegger) is not ontic, but ontological. Style, in other words, might be taken to refer not to any particular thing in the world, but to how things are, and come to be, in general. The course will thus attempt first to discern some of the major stylistic shifts in Western, aesthetic history, and then to theorize them. 380 - Writing Identity In this multi-genre creative writing workshop, we will explore the paradox of identity. Author Sandra Cisneros' has said you should \"write about what makes you different.\" What does this mean and where does it lead you? How do we evoke culture, class, ethnicity in our work? How can we (and might we want to) situate our work in a specific time and place, to locate our characters in a world so particular only we can describe it? Besides writing and sharing their own work, students will be asked to read and discuss a variety of writers who explore identity and difference, including Gish Jen, Nam Le, Paul Beatty and Jeannette Winterson. Prerequisite: junior or senior standing 382 - Advanced Creative Writing Students familiar with the elements of craft-setting, characterization, plot, dialogue, etc.-will produce several new stories and revise them, and will read and critique the works of their peers. In?class writing exercises and outside readings will also be required. Prerequisite: Junior and senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: FINE ARTS 390 - Junior Seminar in ECLS The Junior Seminar is a small, discussion-oriented seminar required of all majors, emphasizing advanced critical approaches to a literary topic. Enrollment is limited and restricted to ECLS majors. Objects of Beauty. In her recent book, On Beauty and Being Just, Elaine Scarry makes the claim that \"At the moment we see something beautiful, we undergo a radical decentering.\" Others might suggest that notions of beauty have been used precisely to center certain normative standards, often violently marginalizing those who do not adhere. Whether dismissed as frivolous, theorized as a philosophical category of inquiry, or politicized in the service of feminist or anti-racist discourse, beauty does many things: it captivates, it incites pleasure and desire, it oppresses and subjugates, and it excludes. Throughout the course of this term, we will evaluate Scarry's claim, looking at texts dealing with both theoretical and practical aspects of aesthetic experience. Beginning with Aristotle, we will evaluate Western theorizations of beauty through the Enlightenment and into the contemporary era. In addition, we will look at how non-Western writers have responded to aesthetic norms imposed upon them. Texts such as Paula Black's The Beauty Industry and Robert Young's Colonial Desire, will provide a framework for examining how politics of race, class, and gender shape questions of aesthetic value. Within this theoretical context, we will consider representations of beauty in print and visual culture, including popular cinema and literature. 210The Greeks . . . in Theory. This course will examine the ways in which critical theory has been used to understand Ancient Greece, and (conversely) the ways in which Ancient Greece has been used to develop critical theory; possible authors for consideration in this course would include Nietzsche, Heidegger, Lacan, Derrida, Foucault, Nancy, Agamben. Particular attention will be paid not only to the manner in which the Greeks exemplify this or that theory, but the way in which, somehow, they always seem to exceed the models thrust upon them; the course will thus emphasize hermeneutics, the problem of interpretation as such. Textual Mappings : The Literary Politics of Space and Place. This course will consider the significant spatial turn in recent literary and cultural studies. We will review key works of geographic materialist theory and criticism, and apply their insights to our reading of contemporary world fiction, poetry, and graphic narrative. The primary works of literature (and perhaps some films) will be selected for their representation of socio-political dynamics in regions of heightened spatial contestation (such as Israel/Palestine, apartheid-era South Africa, or metropolitan inner cities), or for their mediation of such spatially inflected experiences as exile, migration, urbanization, and deterritorialization. 490 - Senior Seminar: ECLS Comprehensive Project In this course seniors will design and carry out advanced research projects in areas of their own interests. Seminar meetings will be devoted to discussion of a core group of theoretical and/or historical texts (varying from year to year) and to practical issues of sophisticated literary critical work. The course will result in a substantial critical paper, a version of which will be presented at the spring ECLS senior symposium in satisfaction of Occidental's comprehensive requirement. Open only to senior ECLS majors 499 - Honors in ECLS Research, writing, and defense of the honors thesis in ECLS. May be taken for 4 units fall or spring, or for 2 units fall and spring.

Irvine Geology The mission of the Geology major is to foster in students an understanding of the Earth: the processes that affect its surface and interior; its formation and evolution through time; and its functioning as the physical environment for the living world. The major accomplishes this goal 212by offering to students a set of coordinated experiences in the classroom, laboratory, and field. Geology is an intrinsically interdisciplinary science, drawing upon the tools of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and environmental science to examine problems that range in scale from a single mineral grain to the entire solar system. Geology majors learn to work together on inquiry-based laboratory and field projects, and each produces a Senior Thesis describing independent research they have undertaken with a faculty mentor. There is a special emphasis on articulating ideas orally, graphically, and in writing, skills that are valuable not only in science but also in the many other careers where geology majors from Occidental have found success. Geology is a global science, and so students who have made progress in the major as sophomores are encouraged to study abroad for a semester during their Junior year. The Geology major expresses the Department's commitment to prepare students to excel in an increasingly complex and environmentally stressed world. Requirements MAJOR: The following courses are required for completion of the major program in the Department of Geology: Geology 105 (or equivalent), 215, 225, 235, 305, 325, , 345, 490, and at least three of the following: Geology 245, 255, 342, 355, 365, or 4 credits of 390. Mathematics through Math 120 (or equivalent) or Math 110 and a Department-approved statistics course is also required. Students interested in Geology are encouraged to take Geology 150, which fulfills the intercultural core requirement. All graduate schools and professional careers in geology require at least a basic understanding of chemistry and physics. Students considering graduate school or professional careers in geology should also take the following courses: Chemistry 120; Physics 110 and 120 or 115 and 125. Environmental Science Concentration in Geology Environmental Science is a Concentration that explores earth processes and ecosystems and develops skills that students need for environmental analysis and problem-solving. The Environmental Science Concentration is designed for students who want to more fully understand the biological and geologic foundation of Environmental Science and provides them with a shared academic experience and expertise within a specific scientific field. Participation in a core of introductory courses establishes the interdisciplinary breadth necessary for understanding complex environmental problems. Further specialization gives students a strong background in Biology or Geology, preparing them to become involved in research projects, fieldwork, internships, and environmental studies. Students will receive their Bachelor of Arts in Biology or Geology with an Environmental Science Concentration, enabling them to pursue graduate work in Biology, Geology or Environmental Science, and professional careers in these and related fields. Environmental Science Introductory Core: (7 courses) First level courses: Earth: Our Environment (Geology 105) Introductory Biology (105, 106, 110, or 115) Introductory Economics (101) Second level courses: Spatial Analysis with GIS (Geo 255) Earth's Climate: Past and Future (Geo 245) Biodiversity and Organization of Marine and Terrestrial Ecosystems (Bio 260) or Ecology (Bio 270) 213Environmental Economics (Econ 301) or another 300-level course dealing with environmental policy, chosen in consultation with Academic Advisor.

Students considering graduate school or professional careers should also take the following courses: Chemistry 120; Physics 110 and 120 or 115 and 125. As with all Geology majors, the comprehensive examination requirement is met by a passing grade on the senior thesis research project, as described below. MINOR: Geology 105, 215, 235, and any other two courses in Geology to be selected with department approval. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Geology will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's college-wide writing requirement by submitting a portfolio of at least two papers from any of the intermediate- or advanced-level writing-intensive Geology courses normally required for the major (or appropriate course work). Students should familiarize themselves with the departmental requirement at the time of declaring the major. See the Writing Requirement and consult the department chair for additional information. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: The senior comprehensive project is based on research conducted under the supervision of Department faculty or in an off-campus summer research program or field camp. This project can be started as early as the Junior year and typically involves field or laboratory work during the summer between Junior and Senior years. Seniors are expected to present their research orally and submit a written thesis by Spring Break. During the Fall semester of senior year, all Geology majors attend a senior seminar (Geology 490 or equivalent). A major goal of these meetings is to help students make timely progress on their comprehensive projects. HONORS: Students with a GPA of at least 3.25 are eligible to graduate with honors in geology. For these students, a larger senior thesis is planned, and students start their research earlier than the fall of their senior year. For this extra work, the honors student receives additional course credit beyond credit for comprehensives. Refer also to the general College policies regarding the Honors Program.

San Diego State University German, Russian, & Classical Studies 218The study of a culture through its language offers insights into unfamiliar worlds which cannot be realized in any other way; such study is one of the distinguishing features of a liberal arts education. Moreover, competence in a language other than English can provide a decided advantage for any post-graduate education or career objective. In addition to literature courses, various culture courses (some taught in the language of study, others in English) make aspects of this cultural tradition available to all students. The Department also strongly encourages all students to investigate Occidental's opportunities for study abroad. In recent years, students from a wide variety of departments, including the sciences, have taken advantage of these programs, greatly enhancing their education and future opportunities. These programs exemplify Occidental's ideal of a liberal education that increases sensitivity to and appreciation of other cultures. Requirements German MINOR: Five courses (20 units) numbered German 202 and above. Three of the five courses must be completed as Occidental courses. GROUP LANGUAGE MAJOR: Students may combine German with another language (Chinese, French, Japanese, Russian, Spanish) or with Linguistics into a Group Language major by taking at least five courses (20 units) numbered 202 and above in German (two of which can be taken, upon faculty approval, in related areas such as history, art history, politics, language learning/linguistics), and five courses (20 units) in the other language. Students planning a Group Language major are encouraged to participate in Occidental's programs sbroad as part of their plan of study. Interested students should consult with faculty in both languages before entering the group program. WRITING REQUIREMENT AND COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: The specifics of the writing requirement and the comprehensive requirement will be determined by the advisors of the student's two languages at the time the student declares the Group Language major.

We will focus on the difficult transition from the old monarchy to a parliamentary democracy, the economic and political challenges of the new republic and its slow demise in the early thirties. Some lead topics will be: the rise of film and other forms of popular culture, the styles of Expressionism and Neue Sachlichkeit, the experience of the city, the emancipation of women, and the fight against the onslaught of fascist tendencies. We will read texts by Bertolt Brecht, Ernst Toller, Erich K\u00e4stner, Irmgard Keun, Marieluise Nosferatu, Metropolis, Kuhle Wampe and others) and study the new trends in architecture (Bauhaus), the arts (Beckmann, Kirchner, Heartfield), photography, music and the media. The course is taught in English. German minors and group majors will read some of the texts in the German original. Prerequisite for German minors and group majors: German 201 or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 282 - Nazi Visual Culture The rise and fall of National Socialism is one of the most intensively studied topics in European history. Over six decades after its collapse, Nazi Germany continues to fascinate the general public, and with good reason. Although the fascist state lasted only for twelve years, it started history's most destructive war while committing crimes of unprecedented proportions. For the most part, it did so with the acquiescence of the German public. This class will investigate the rise of National Socialism as a political, social, and cultural phenomenon. The central focus will be on the decisive role of film and the visual arts as most popular means of mass manipulation. Prerequisite: 1st year students cannot enroll in this class. 221CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 288 - The Neo-Nazi Movement Decades after the fall of Nazi Germany, there is a growing concern that the spirit of Nazism still lives on. The Neo-Nazi movement continues to exist in Germany. A recent report revealed that one out of twenty 15-year- old boys belong to a Neo-Nazi group. Neo-Nazism is not an exclusively German phenomenon, though - we find similar developments in other European countries, in Canada, and in the US. This course will track the activities of Neo-Nazis in Germany from 1990 to the present. We will analyze the impact of unification on the growth of right wing militancy throughout Germany, and examine examples of Neo-Nazi and skinhead activities as well as the efforts of various governments to control this movement. A key question will be why exactly young people between 15 and 30 are drawn to these groups who often use and develop sophisticated networks. Finally, the question will be asked what the most effective means of combating these movements would or should be. Prerequisite: Sophomore status or higher. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 320 - Probing the Limits of Representation: The Holocaust Probing the Limits of Representation: The Holocaust in Literature and Film The Holocaust has been positioned at the limits of representation -- as the indescribable, the incomprehensible. The impossibility of adequately expressing the atrocities of the Holocaust stands in contrast to the need to transmit knowledge about this event to later generations. Attempts to represent the Holocaust, to describe and understand this event and its implications, are numerous and have occurred across a wide range of media forms (literature, film, photography, art, music, monuments, etc.), and genres (as in documentary, drama, comedy, science fiction). As the Holocaust recedes in time and the numbers of living historical witnesses and survivors decline, these representations increasingly shape our perception and understanding of the event. This course will investigate literary, filmic, and artistic representations of the Holocaust, focusing in particular on questions of ethics, aesthetics and history. We will begin with a historical survey and then turn to examining the various debates and controversies surrounding the issue of representation of the Shoah and discuss some of the theoretical texts that have shaped the area of Holocaust Studies. Finally, we will explore the ways in which these written, filmic, and artistic cultural artifacts have attempted to narrate the events of the Holocaust, and examine exemplary responses to the Shoah in a variety of media forms and genres. The course will deal with questions of ethics and aesthetics, such as the meaning of art and the limits of historical representation. What are the aesthetic and ethical implications of creating art about the Holocaust? Does all representation entail an aestheticization of horror? What are the implications of the commercialization of the Holocaust? Students will obtain a basic grasp of the historical events; they will gain an interdisciplinary, personalized, historical, and cultural understanding of this genocide; and are exposed to ongoing debates regarding the limits of representation of the Holocaust. The course is taught in English . Prerequisite: 202 or 232 for German minors and Group Language majors . SAME AS ECLS 359 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 325 - Crisis in Europe The European project - i.e. the gradual unification of the continent - which had been successful for decades seems to undergo a fundamental crisis at present. This crisis has different 222aspects. Primarily, it has to do with the economic inequities within the European Union which became tangible in the aftermath of the world economic crisis of 2008. In its wake, the \"weaker\" economies, mostly at the periphery, were more affected than the stronger ones. But there also other problems, such as the lack of democratic structures as well as strong leadership, the weight of a centralized bureaucracy, and the lack of a European public sphere. The course will take a look at the achievements of the European Union , the multiple reasons for its current crisis and the various attempts to overcome it. Prerequisite: Open to juniors and seniors CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 370 - Seminar on a Selected Topic Bertolt Brecht and the Twenties . Bertolt Brecht is one of the most influential playwrights and aesthetic thinkers of the 20th century. In order to understand the scope and dimension of his work and its world wide influence this course will focus on the artistic development of young Bertolt Brecht who, in the early Twenties, moved to Berlin, the capital of newly founded democratic Weimar Republic and one of the most important cultural centers of the 20th century, and participated in practically all innovative tendencies and art forms of the time, from Expressionism and Dadaism to New Objectivity, from experimental theatre to radio and film. Some of his great early works, such as the \"Three Penny Opera\", will be seen in the context of the time, especially the very turbulent last years of the Weimar Republic before Hitler's rise to power. We will also look at Brecht's legendary film \"Kuhle Wampe\" and visit at least one contemporary production of a Brecht play staged at a theatre in Los Angeles. Bertolt Brecht: The Great Plays. Brecht's great plays changed the stage of world theatre. In order to understand and appreciate their powerful and long lasting influence, all major plays written during Brecht's exile, i.e. in the years between 1933, when he was driven out of Germany, and 1948, when he returned to Switzerland and ultimately Berlin, will be discussed. Aside from detailed analyses of plays such as \"Mother Courage\", \"The Good Woman of or \"Life of Galilei\" Brecht's developing theory of epic theatre and the general conditions and dilemmas of exile will be discussed. We will also look at Brecht's role in Hollywood, his collaboration on the film \"Hangmen Also Die\", and his successful attempts to direct his own plays on German and European stages after 1950. Students minoring in German, or majoring in Group Languages or IPS will read most of the texts in the original. Prerequisite for German minor and Group Language majors: German 202 or 232. Open to all other non-first year students. The course is taught in English, no knowledge of German is required. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE ? FINE ARTS Memory, Trauma, and Victim Culture This course is concerned with the cultural politics of memory and trauma after the catastrophic events of the Holocaust and World War II. We will start with basic questions, such as: Whose memories are sought, and commemorated in the public sphere? What problems do traumatic events present for those attempting to represent them? Is trauma a useful cultural concept? What are the differences between individual and collective memory? The first part of the course analyzes memory and trauma on both the individual level and the collective level, and turns then to the specific processes that occur when traumatic events are remembered by survivors as well as the collective processes involved when memories of traumatic events, such as the Holocaust, are shared with an audience who has no first-hand experience of them.- The second part of the course aims to identify the recent fascination, especially in European and 223American culture, with the phenomenon of trauma, suffering and victimhood. We will study the cultural politics of trauma and memory in relation to two events - the Holocaust and German suffering during World War II. The unit \"Holocaust victimhood and American-Jewish identity\" explores how the kitsch nature of popular culture representations of the Holocaust (from the Anne Frank movie of to the very successful TV-series Holocaust to the Hollywood movie Schindler's List) created the paradigm for trauma culture at large. The unit \"Germans in collective memory between perpetrators and victims\" discusses contemporary German memory discourse which primarily focuses on the experience of German suffering as a consequence of the war and the Third Reich. However, to recast Germans as victim is highly problematic since the position of victim is already occupied by those people who were persecuted and murdered by the Germans/Nazis. Memory, trauma, and victimhood are crucial aspects of the experiences of Jews and Germans after 1945. A systematic exploration of these aspects (as manifested in a broad variety of cultural forms) promises important insights into recent history and culture. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL Offered in spring 2012 Nazi Culture. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, they took over control of all aspects of German life. One of the first tasks the new government undertook upon their ascension to power was a synchronization of all professional and social organizations with Nazi ideology and policy. Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Minister for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda, began an effort to bring German arts and culture in line with Nazi goals. The government purged cultural organizations of Jewish and other officials alleged to be politically suspect or who performed or created art works which Nazi ideologues labeled \"degenerate.\" Some 650 works by such renowned artists as Max Beckmann, Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee were declared \"degenerate art\" and removed from German museums. The Nazi \"cultivation of art\" also extended to the modern field of cinema, theater, music, architecture, youth education, and even to the lower levels of popular culture. Throughout the duration of the Nazi regime, 'culture' in all its manifestations played a crucial role. Political rallies, military parades, sports events, open air festivals, and other skillfully organized events were used from the beginning to suggest a \"national awakening\" and the \"revolutionary spirit\" of the new regime. The efforts of the Nazis to regulate German culture corresponded to what historian George Mosse calls an effort \"toward a total culture,\" i.e. an effort to influence at the most basic level the lives and actions of all Germans. This course will explore the various forms of culture during this time and will raise the question to what extent 'Nazi culture,' or culture under Nazi domination, was capable of stabilizing the regime until its very end in 1945. German minors and group language majors have to complete either German 202 or 232 since they will read some of the material in German. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE Offered in fall 2011 Marx, Freud, and the Frankfurt School. This seminar will explore the origins of the world famous Frankfurt School, a group of German social philosophers and theoreticians which emerged at the Institute for Social research of the University of Frankfurt am Main in the 1920s who wanted a) to analyze the conditions of modern capitalism and its impact on society in general, on family and social structures, value systems and mass culture, b) critically review the theories of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and Max Weber, and c) to establish the principles and foundations of a 'critical theory.' We'll read and discuss major works by Max Horkheimer, Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Siegfried Kracauer, Leo 224Loewenthal and others. The seminar will focus on the 'first phase' of the Frankfurt School, its beginnings and its work and development during the thirties and forties - when the school relocated to New York and many of its collaborators lived in other American cities or abroad - and the immediate post WWII period. (A second seminar will follow next year and explore the school's development and its world wide impact in the sixties and seventies.) The course is taught in English. Students minoring or majoring in German will read some of the original texts (especially Marx, Freud, Benjamin, and Kracauer) in German. Prereauisite:Restricted to Junior/senior. Same as CTSJ 370 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE The Frankfurt School, 1945 to the Present. Social Analysis, Cultural Theory, and Political Action. This seminar will explore the history of the Frankfurt School after World War II when it was re-established in Frankfurt and began to play a crucial role in the development of a 'critical theory' of society and culture during the West German 'economical miracle;' afterwards, with the onset of the German (and international) student movement of the mid- Sixties, it gained international reputation and impacted social, political, and cultural discourses in countries like France, Great Britain, Italy, or the United States. We will study primarily some of the major writings of Th. W. Adorno (especially on art, music, cultural theory, and the lessons of Fascism), H. Marcuse (whose writings on social theory and aesthetics, on 'repressive tolerance' and 'liberation' exerted a strong influence on the student movement), and of J. Habermas who became one of the most influential European intellectuals in the decades after 1970. This seminar is the continuation of an earlier class on the beginnings of the Frankfurt School and its history until 1945; participation in that earlier seminar is not required. The course is taught in English. Students minoring in German or majoring in Group Language or IPS will read some of the original texts in German.

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 278 - In Stalin's Time Stalin was arguably the first totalitarian dictator who created the model for similar regimes in the twentieth century. This course describes the changes Stalin brought to Soviet society, the terrible consequences of his dictatorship, and the reaction of cultural figures criticized as they rebelled against the system. This course examines those movements through popular culture, film, literature, and first-hand testimony. The everyday life of Soviet citizens will be studied by looking at both permitted and forbidden forms of entertainment. The dissident movement that erupted in the 1960s and 1970s will be examined through the Sotsart artistic movement, as well as short stories that circulated underground throughout the late Soviet period. Finally, the course will look at Stalin's legacy in Putin's authoritarian Russia of the twenty-first century. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 282 - The Supernatural in Slavic Culture An examination of Slavic myths and their manifestation in folk culture, literature and film.

COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: Students will fulfill the Group Language comprehensive requirement in one of two ways: (1) A student may choose to submit a 20-page paper on a senior research project on comparative literature or linguistics combining both halves of the major. To prepare for this comparative paper written in English, the student should enroll in two two-unit Independent Studies (with separate faculty advisors for the corresponding halves of the major) in the fall of the senior year . If one or both of the languages for the major is French, German, or Spanish, the student must also submit a complete version of the paper in one of these languages. In the spring semester of the senior year, the student will also give an oral presentation, conducted in both languages of the major, on the comparative paper. OR (2) Students choosing not to write a comparative paper may conduct two separate research projects and do the following for each half of the Group Language major: Chinese: A student will fulfill the Chinese portion of the comprehensives through: (1) a two-unit Independent Study in the fall of the senior year, in which the student will produce a 10-page paper in English on Chinese literature or linguistics which include texts written in Chinese; followed by (2) an oral presentation in Chinese about the research project in the spring semester. French: A student will fulfill the French portion of the comprehensive EITHER (1) by completing the Major Seminar FREN490 which includes an oral presentation on a seminar theme; OR (2) by completing a two-unit Independent Study in the fall semester of the senior year, which includes writing a 10-page paper in French on a topic in francophone literature and making an oral presentation in French on the paper's topic.

HONORS: Group Language majors with an overall GPA of 3.25 and a 3.5 GPA for major courses may submit an honors research proposal at the end of the fall semester of the senior year. If the proposal is supported by faculty from both components of the major, the student will enroll in two two-unit Independent Studies in the spring, in which they will develop the comprehensive papers from the fall into two distinguished papers of 20 pages each. Papers for French, German, and Spanish must be written in the target language. The student may instead choose to conduct a comparative study and integrate the two papers into a single paper of 40 pages in English. If one or both of the languages for the major is French, German, or Spanish, the student must also submit a complete version of the paper in one of these languages. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Group Language will satisfy the final component of Occidental College-wide writing requirement by submitting a paper in English from a 300 level or seminar course in the fall of the senior year.

Our department offers a broad diversity of courses and approaches covering every time period, and cultures from all over the globe. Students will become familiar with intellectual, social, political, comparative and oral history, and may select from a wide spectrum of courses including such geographical areas as Latin America, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Europe, the United States, and such topical areas as Women's History, the History of Science and Medicine, revolution and history in film. The faculty recognizes that students will develop their own perspectives on the material presented, and welcomes close interaction with motivated and involved majors. History is, after all, an exciting kind of detective work, finding and putting together the pieces of the puzzle to enhance our understanding of the past, but also of the present, and perhaps even the future. Some history majors go on to further studies in the field, but because of their wide exposure to various times and cultures, they are well prepared for 233almost any career. Besides providing a background for anyone interested in a truly liberal education, History helps prepare students for the fields of law, business, foreign service, librarianship, museum work, historic preservation, journalism, environmental studies, and teaching from primary and secondary through university levels. Requirements MAJOR: The History major consists of a minimum of forty units, or ten four-unit courses. This includes two required courses (300 History Colloquium and 490 Senior Seminar) and three surveys from different geographical areas (United States, Latin America, Asia, Europe, Africa/Middle East). Survey courses (the 100 series and some of the 200 series) cover a broad chronological time frame. Three of the remaining five classes should be additional upper division courses (in the 300 and 400 series). At least one course must deal with the pre- modern period. Students thus have the opportunity to sample a breadth of fields and periods. Of the ten required courses, at least seven must be taken in the History department, and no more than three will be accepted from other departments or institutions (see discussion of acceptable courses from other departments below). Students with AP scores of 4 or 5 receive academic credit, but still need to take the requisite 10 courses for the History major. They may, however, be excused from one survey requirement, taking 2 rather than 3 area surveys, although we discourage this, believing as we do that our department courses are far more challenging and sophisticated than even the best high school AP class. Students must have a grade of B- or better on the 15-page paper in History 300. ACCEPTABLE COURSES FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS: The department occasionally accepts for history credit courses from such other departments as American Studies, Art History and the Visual Arts, Critical Theory - Social Justice, Diplomacy and World Affairs, English and Comparative Literary Studies, Philosophy, and Politics. These decisions are made on an individual basis in discussion with the student's advisor and/or the department chair. Courses that may be counted toward the major without petition are: American Studies 272, 280, 290, 295, and 390; ECLS 341. No more than three courses from other departments or transfer courses from other institutions (including study abroad courses) will be counted towards the History major. MINOR: Five courses (20 units) in History from at least two areas, including History 300. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in History satisfy the final component of Occidental's college-wide writing requirement by successfully completing History 300. Students should familiarize themselves with the departmental requirement at the time of declaring the major. See the Writing Program and consult the department chair for additional information. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: Students meet their comprehensive requirement by taking History 490 in the fall semester of their senior year and writing for that course a 25-page paper that involves research and analysis of primary and secondary sources. They are required to turn in a 5-page prospectus of their project and attend several meetings in the spring of their junior year to prepare for History 490. Papers may concentrate on a geographical area or take a topical approach, such as History of Science and Medicine; Women's History; or Revolutions. 234HONORS: Students with sufficiently high GPA (3.25) overall can write an honors thesis. Senior history majors pursuing honors will take the Senior Seminar in the fall and, if invited by the Senior Seminar instructors in consultation with thesis advisors, will extend their thesis work in the spring Honors Seminar. The honors thesis is a 40-page paper, which demonstrates excellence in historical research, writing, and analysis, written under the supervision of the Honors Seminar instructor, the thesis advisor, and a third faculty reader. Students planning to try for honors must make known their intentions in a written proposal early spring semester of their junior year. See the Honors Program for additional information. DISTINCTION: Students are eligible for distinction if they receive an A or A- on their paper for History 490. AWARDS: The R. Lee Culp Prize is awarded annually to a senior for the most outstanding senior thesis. The Edith Culp Prize is awarded annually for the best term paper or junior seminar paper. The Diana Culp Bork Prize is awarded annually for outstanding service to the department. Courses Asia 141 - East Asian Survey Since 1600 A survey of Chinese, Japanese and Korean societies from the late 16th century to the present. The focus will be on the transformation of their traditional order from relative isolation to the confluence of East-West history. Several themes to explore include the clashing of cultural values, maritime trade, persistent Confucian values vs. rising forces of imperialism, nationalism and revolutionary ideologies, contrasting roads taken by each society in order to meet the challenges of modernity, cultural debates over gender and generational issues, and contesting appeals of western ideologies, from liberalism to fascism and communism. Finally a review of the post-WWII era: opposing alignments in the U.S.-led Cold War, socialist state building and experimentations, military rule, democracy Asian-style, fundamental societal changes, including youth and mass culture, successive economic \"miracles,\" and China's re-emergence as a global power. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: ASIA PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 242 - Imperial China A chronological and thematic survey of the Chinese civilization from neolithic times to about 1600. Major themes will include the nature of the Chinese world order, family and lineage, gender issues, philosophical and religious transitions, political authority and its ideological underpinnings, dynastic cycles and broader patterns in socio-political movements, interactions with other civilizations, and the impact of technological and demographic changes through time. We shall use the comparative approach on specific themes to illuminate contrasts and similiarities between Chinese and western societies, and take note of recent archeological finds and new scholarly interpretations to better understand its dynamic past and rapidly changing present. 235CORE REQUIREMENT MET: ASIA PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 243 - Modern and Contemporary China Chinese history from about 1600 to the present: encounter with the West, maritime trade, the growth of the domestic economy, the rise of the Manchus and territorial expansion, internal decline, rebellions, imperialism, and revolution. Modernization efforts, ideological struggles, and the cultural and economic transformations under the People's Republic. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: ASIA and REGIONAL FOCUS 246 - Pre-Modern Korea According to legend, the Korean people were born from the union of the son of the \"Lord of Heaven\" and a bear-woman, with a good measure of garlic and mugwort aiding the process. From these mythic origins, tracing roughly 2000 years of Korean history, we will end with the forced opening of the Korean peninsula, and people, in the mid-nineteenth century. The main objective of this class is to impart an understanding of the major social, cultural, political, and intellectual developments that occurred along the way. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: ASIA ? PRE-1800 247 - Pre-Modern Japan This survey will examine Japanese history from the emergence of the samurai class in the twelfth century to the Mejii Restoration of 1868. We will begin by considering the origins and rise to power of warriors as a discrete social group. Next we will look at the balance of power between the Kyoto court, the new warrior government in Kamakura, and the powerful Buddhist institutions that defined the culture of the medieval period. We will then examine the disintegration of central authority under the rule of the Ashikaga shoguns, leagues and other local attempts to organize independently, and the concomitant cultural efflorescence of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The course will conclude by examining the political structures, popular culture, and social stratification of the early modern (Edo or Tokugawa) period. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: ASIA - PRE-1800 248 - Modern Japan This course covers the history of Japan from the 1868 Mejii Restoration to the present, with particular focus on the emergence of modernity, the Pacific War, and popular culture. The first section of the course will examine Japan's modern revolution in the Mejii Restoration; industrialization and modernization in the Mejii Period; and the development of Japanese colonialism. The second section of the course will focus on the Pacific War, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the American Occupation, with particular focus on the politics of gender and race. The third section of the course will look at Japan's explosive postwar economic recovery and the consumer and popular culture it produced. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: ASIA 249 - Modern Korea Korea is unique, or so say the Koreans. In many ways, it is. Politically, of the democratic nations in the world, south Korea is one of the precious few to have achieved democracy through the blood and sacrifice of its everyday citizens, that is from the bottom up. 236Economically, after the Korean War, Korea was one of the poorest nations in the world ranking below sub-Saharan countries in terms of GDP; now, it is a member of the G20. This survey will begin with the forced opening of the \"Hermit Kingdom\" in 1872, and conclude with the twenty- first century international phenomenon of K-pop. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL/SOUTN/EAST ASIA and REGIONAL FOCUS 295 - Japanese Imperialism & the Modern Korean Identity In this course, we will explore the complex interplay between Japanese imperialism, colonial occupation, and the formation of modern Korean identities. Beginning with an examination of shifting premodern relations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, we will move onto theories addressing imperialism, nationalism and Orientalism. Students will be asked to assess the applicability of these theories to early twentieth-century Korea under colonial occupation in particular, and to non-Western societies in general. Special emphasis will be devoted to the themes of national consciousness, identity formation, gender, class, socio- economic development and industrialization, resistance and collaboration. Prerequisite: 1 History course. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 295 - Topics in Chinese History: Peasant China in Transformation Throughout the twentieth century, the Chinese state as well as various political movements attempted to transform the peasantry into modern productive citizens. While all of these projects sought to modernize China by transforming and reorganizing the peasant, most of them failed to change the peasant as planned. When these projects reached the village, they were altered by peasants, local elites, and the logics of village life, leading to unintended consequences. Course topics will include: late imperial attempts to strengthen control over village life; organizing peasants for revolution; early twentieth century cooperative movements; socialist land reform; rural gender relations; the Great Leap Forward and the commune system; the Cultural Revolution in the countryside; sent down youth; the private lives of peasants under socialism; the return to household-based farming in the early 1980s; and, contemporary protest and attempts to organize peasant cooperatives. Through film, personal accounts, fiction, and primary and secondary sources, we will take an intimate look at Chinese peasant society in transformation. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL/SOUTH/EAST ASIA and REGIONAL FOCUS Comparative/Transnational 274 - Medicine And Disease In Western Society A study of three aspects of the history of medicine: theory and practice from ancient times to the present; great doctors and healers, both male and female, examined in their social contexts; the effects of epidemics, such as the Black Death, on the course of Western civilization. We will end with some historically based speculations about the medical future. 237CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 278 - Twentieth Century Decolonization in Global Perspective This sophomore seminar aims to rethink imperial and postcolonial history from the perspectives of the colonized and to consider how decolonization, one of the most important political developments of the twentieth century, impacted local lives. The timings and patterns of decolonization are extremely varied so we will narrow our focus to the core periods of decolonization in Asia and Africa from the 1920s to 1960s and nationalism and revolution in Latin America from the 1920s to 1980s. We will also consider the Third World Movement in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. We will define decolonization as the political struggle for legal sovereignty as well as social movement for moral justice and political solidarity against imperialism, both formal and informal and external and internal. Topics will include the role of metropolitan and international politics; economy and labor; nationalism and anticolonialism; race and ethnicity; and gender and sexuality in the Pan-African movement; decolonization in India and the Middle East; the nationalist movements of China, Vietnam and Indonesia; and the revolutions of Mexico, Cuba, and Central America. Enrollment limited to sophomores. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 312 - Race, Rights & Revolution In The Atlantic World The circulation of labor, goods, people and cultures between Africa, Europe and the Americas created an Atlantic World whose history transcends continental and national boundaries. This course examines the relationship between race, rights, and revolution during the Atlantic Age of Revolution that stretched from roughly the mid-eighteen to mid-nineteenth centuries. In particular we will explore how Revolutions in British North America, France and Haiti influenced the movement to end the slave trade and slavery in the Americas and galvanized slave revolts and other movements for Black liberation and human rights around the Atlantic World. A variety of readings including autobiography, social and political history and ethnography, will illuminate not only the history of the Atlantic World but new forms of scholarly writing that break the mold of national historical narratives. Themes include: slavery, slave revolt, the discourse of human rights, resistance, religion, labor, and shifting ideologies of difference, in particular gender, class, and race. Prerequisite: Satisfactory completion of at least one History course or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 376 - Genocide and the Ethical Crisis of Modernity This course confronts the difficult and profound ethical, social, and political questions unleashed by the crime of genocide. The idea, actuality, and experience of genocide in the twentieth century have raised questions about the very nature of society and humanity. By studying the genocidal crises of the modern age, from the Armenian Genocide of 1915 to the Holocaust to the contemporary genocide in Darfur in the Sudan, we are forced to consider the darkest chapters of modern history and the ethical trauma which follows in their wake. While most students have heard of the Nazi-perpetrated Holocaust which murdered the Jews of Europe, the other genocides of the last hundred years are less well known. This course, by comparing the societies which experienced genocide and the conditions which produced it, will examine the psychological, cultural, and societal roots of human cruelty, mass violence, and genocide. With this in mind, this course will take a chronological and thematic approach to introducing students to the history of genocide. 238CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 395 - Imperialism: Theories And Practices Imperialism is defined as \"the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan centre ruling a distant territory\" (Edward Said). This semester, we will explore the diverse interpretations of this concept and its manifestations, including its relations to the political, economic, social, and cultural. Descending from the realm of the abstract, we will ground these theories in historical case studies, to name just a few, the British, French, and Japanese Empires. Lest we forget, imperialism is a dialectic movement not just between theory and practice, but perhaps more importantly, between the imperial subject and subjected. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL Europe 121 - Antiquity to 1700: Europe and the Middle East A survey of multiple Western civilizations and their interrelationships. Among ancients, we shall study Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Hebrews, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. In medieval times, we shall examine Catholic Europe, Greek Orthodox Byzantium, Islamic Civilization, and their interrelationships. We shall consider the treatment of women and of minorities, and shall highlight travelers between civilizations. We shall conclude with the European Renaissance and Reformation, Turkish hegemony in the Eastern Mediterranean, and the shift in trade from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean as modern science and enlightenment challenge traditional civilizations. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 122 - Europe 1700 to the Present The course emphasizes the political, social and economic implications of the \"twin revolutions,\" the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution. Themes include the rise of nationalism, new nation-states, urbanization, the emergence of the workers' and women's movements, and the crisis of liberalism. We trace the political, social and economic legacies of the 18th and 19th centuries through to Fascism and the post-World War II era. Discussion sections to be arranged. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 220 - Ancient Athens and Renaissance Florence This course provides an opportunity to vicariously \"live\" in historical cities considered to be creators of democratic or representative forms of government as well as of great literature and art. Historian Thucydides, comic Aristophanes, and philosopher Plato draw us into Athenian politics and culture; likewise, Lorenzo de' Medici and Machiavelli inform us of Florentine politics and culture. Monumental architecture and sculpture continue to serve to decorate and sustain the individuality of each city. By examining documents of daily life (including court cases) and the luxury products of the diverse crafts, we increase our knowledge of the controversial 239behavior and productivity of a wide spectrum of women and men. By focusing on two cities in their \"golden age,\" the class will emphasize the shared positive, as well as negative, characteristics of ages historians have designated as \"golden.\" Students may petition for 300-level credit for this class with the completion of additional work arranged with the instructor. CORE REQUIREMENTS MET: EUROPE ? PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 223 - Rise of French Culture History of France and of French creativity in literature and in the visual arts from the High Middle Ages to the Age of Enlightenment (12th to 18th centuries). Students may petition for 300-level credit for this class with the completion of additional work arranged with the instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 224 - Italian Renaissance This course offers a chance to come to know a variety of individuals who lived in the Italian peninsula in the 1300s, 1400s, and 1500s. We shall \"visit\" the republics of Venice and Florence, the papal court of Rome, and the ducal courts of Urbino and Mantua, and shall enjoy distinctive creations in literature, education, philosophy, and the arts. Diplomat Machiavelli witnessed independent Italian city-states fall to French and Habsburg conquests, and he described such realistic politics; courtesan Veronica Franco successfully practiced her sexual trade while writing poems celebrating her true love as well as her mercantile city-state. Students may petition for 300-level credit for this class with the completion of additional work arranged with the instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 226 - The Age of Encounters As the early modern network of trade shifted from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean, the Portuguese, the Spanish, the French, the Dutch, and the English competed for trade and for colonization of peoples newly encountered. We shall evaluate Renaissance arts and letters, traveler reports and images of peoples of South America, and Protestant Christianity and the Catholic Counter-Reformation with subsequent competition among missionaries and European states for converts around the globe. We shall discuss amusing short satires by the most famous Northern humanist and humorist Erasmus, A Short Account of the Devastation of the Indies by protester of cruelty Las Casas, and empirical scientist Bacon's scientific utopia New Atlantis. Students may petition for 300-level credit for this class with the completion of additional work arranged with the instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL PRE-1800 and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 234 - The Crisis of Interwar Europe The class examines the political, social and economic crises which shook the nations of Europe in the two decades following the First World War. In particular, we address the character of the crisis, the varied European responses to it and the challenges represented by the end of the First World War, Depression, Fascism, the Second World War and the Holocaust. While assessing the nature of the social, political, economic crisis of interwar Europe, we will also pay close attention to historiographic debates on the rise and nature of 240Fascism and the origins of the Second World War. We focus strongly on primary sources, such as the novels, film and art of the era. Topics include the \"Lost Generation,\" the Weimar Republic, the Spanish Civil War, and the Popular Front in France. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 235 - Cultures of Violence in Twentieth Century Europe This course examines the history of modern Europe with a focus on popular and state- supported ideologies of exclusion and violence in the long twentieth century, 1890-2011. Central to this course is a focus on the discursive boundaries of civil society based on race and class. Throughout the course we situate European developments in a world-historical framework as a way to understand the increasingly interdependent political, social and economic relationships between Europe and the colonial periphery. We begin in fin de si\u00e8cle Europe and trace the polarization of national politics and the development of the contending state ideologies of fascism and communism. We explore the consequences of various programs of decolonization as well as the popular revolts against cultural diversity and post- colonial immigration to the metropole. The course also investigates the origins and consequences of the neo-liberal \"revolution\" of the 1980s, the ethnic violence stemming from the disintegration of the Soviet Union and eastern bloc nations, and the return of the radical right throughout Europe in the 1990s. Our course readings combine secondary and primary sources, literature, as well as a wide range of cinematic and musical sources in order to understand the evolution of European notions of race, national belonging and political violence. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 237 - History of Feminism This course will trace the development of feminism in Europe and the United States and will consider policy issues in applications of feminism in contemporary American law and within the global human rights movement. In early modern times, popular conceptualizations of the intersection of gender, ethnicity, and class divided women from each other just as feminism emerged from a debate on women's nature to a debate on opportunities for women: to be educated, to write, to speak out, to preach, to express one's individuality in dress and demeanor, to work in one's chosen occupation. For the transformation in political theory from Lockean family representation to Suffragette individual representation in the state, we shall explore the literature on \"rights\" from Wollstonecraft to United Nations declarations on Women's Rights. Participating in contemporary feminism, students will debate alternative viewpoints on issues such as abortion, violence against women, and discrimination; and we shall also experience together a diversity of feminist films. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 271 - Herstory: Women in European Culture This seminar will focus on the various ways exceptional women made their mark over the course of Western civilization. We will examine women in Antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the Romantic period, and the 20th century. Examples of outstanding female contributions will be drawn from literature, the arts, the sciences, philosophy and politics. We will do intensive readings of primary texts by and about these women. Students will choose particular individuals to study and research in depth and in the context of their period. Open to sophomores and juniors only. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 241328 - Age of Enlightenment Ideas, politics and society in 18th Century Europe, especially France, where challenges to authority and tradition boosted confidence in reason and progress and eventually exploded the Old Regime. Particular attention will be given to the \"republic of letters\" of the philosophes whose mission was to bring about reform by \"changing the common way of thinking.\" The role of women in this \"salon\" society will be examined, as will such controversial works as Dangerous Liaisons and the writings of the Marquis de Sade. Prerequisite: Satisfactory completion of at least one History course. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 330 - The French Revolution and the Birth of Haiti The Storming of the Bastille, the Great Fear, the Women's March, War with the rest of Europe, the September Massacres, the King's trial and execution, Robespierre's Republic of Virtue, the Reign of Terror, the Thermidorian reaction, the rise and fall of Napoleon, the impact of the rhetoric of revolution overseas, the end of slavery in France's colonies, the transformation of French colonial Saint Domingue from slave colony into the new nation of Haiti, and the meaning of \"liberty, equality, fraternity\" for our own time. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL PRE-1800 AND GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 336 - Modern Italy, 1789 to the Present This course traces the creation and development of the modern Italian nation state. We will study Italian politics and society as Italy moved from a group of separate states toward a unified government and culture. Starting in the late 18th century, the course covers themes such as, the character and legacy of Italian unification, the Southern Question, Fascism, postwar parliamentary democracy. Prerequisite: one European history course. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 337 - The Great Depression The Great Depression of the 1930s was the most significant crisis of capitalism in modern history. It was global in its reach, decreasing economic output and production and bringing international trade and finance to a halt. Businesses and households suffered from banking crises, the restriction of credit, as well as the loss of employment. In the recent 2008 financial crisis, the memory of the Great Depression has often been invoked as a possible worst-case scenario. In this course, we will study the economic and historical circumstances that led to the instability of the economies in the 1920s and the devastating crash that followed. We will learn about the underlying economic models that explain the devastating economic collapse and analyze the political, social, and cultural ramifications of the widespread economic crisis. These include the political challenges to the existing systems of parliamentary democracy embodied in Fascism and Nazism, as well as those from the left. We will examine the social implications of massive unemployment and mass poverty, including homelessness, family dissolution, and \"hoboism.\" We will look at cultural responses to the crisis, including attempts to realistically represent the crisis, as in the \"New Realism\" movements, and efforts to offer distraction from the devastation, such as the Shirley Temple and Busby Berkeley Hollywood films. We will also discuss the role of the interwar Gold Standard in propagating the crisis and look at policy measures taken to stimulate economic activity. Last we will analyze the 242macroeconomic lessons that have been learned from the Great Depression and look at their implementation and effectiveness in fighting the current economic slump. We will focus on the United States and selected European nations. Prerequisite: Economics 101 or 102. Same as Economics 337. 345 - The Holocaust: History, Testimony, and Memory The Holocaust: History, Testimony, and Memory will be a research seminar which confronts the history of the Holocaust through in-depth investigations into survivor testimonies and commemoration and memorialization. The course will examine the genocide of the European Jews by the National Socialist regime, introduce students to the history of Europe from 1919 to 1945, and raise questions about the moral and ethical legacies of the Holocaust. During the semester, we will use a variety of visual and written sources to document and analyze the systematic and bureaucratic murder of European Jews by the Nazis. Using the survivor testimonies archived at the USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive and the museum installation at the Museum of Tolerance, we will interrogate the emerging fields of witnessing and testimony in relationship to the memory of the Holocaust and the phenomenon of Holocaust commemoration and memorialization. We will ask questions about how individuals and society assimilated the experience of genocide: what narrative choices, what linguistic choices, and what visual choices did survivors and the larger culture make when remembering and commemorating the Holocaust? In this way, the course will be interdisciplinary combining the methods and sources of history, Jewish Studies, cultural studies, and art history. Prerequisite: One course in History CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS Latin America 150 - Colonial Latin America This course provides an overview of the historical evolution of Latin America from 1492 to 1820. The course begins with an introduction to the indigenous, Iberian, and African backgrounds and traces the convergence of cultures and ethnicities that shape Latin American societies and cultures. The course examines this process of change through the writings of Latin American men and women who reflected upon the peoples and culture of their own times. Topics of study include race and ethnicity; gender; class; native resistance to colonial rule; and Afro-Brazilian religion. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: LATIN AMERICA PRE-1800 151 - Modern Latin America This course offers a survey of postcoloial Latin America as a process of cultural transformation, political struggle, and economic change. We will explore the complex challenges of colonial legacies posed to emerging nation-states in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and seek a balance between engaging particular histories and larger processes common to the region. The first section of the course introduces themes of the nineteenth century: colonial heritage 243and the different routes taken to political independence; the political, economic, and social challenges of independence in a multi-cultural context; citizenship and race, and the development of export agriculture. The second section introduces themes of the twentieth century: industrialization; revolution; U.S.-Latin American relations; and select intellectual trends. Students will use a variety of sources including scholarly works, films, and primary sources to engage these topics and issues. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: LATIN AMERICA and REGIONAL FOCUS 258 - Mexican Politics in the Twentieth Century This course offers an introduction to some of the major issues and themes in the political history of twentieth-century Mexico. We will examine a century of Mexican history covering the late nineteenth-century authoritarian regime of President Porfirio Diaz, the Mexican Revolution, the post-revolutionary corporatist regime of the PRI, and finally, the transition to democracy with the decline of the PRI and the crises in Mexican society in the late twentieth century. A focus on the use of cultural history to understand Mexican politics will engage the analytical categories of class, gender, ethnicity, and hegemony. We will pay particular attention to the process by which the state and grassroots society in Mexico have developed a relation, which shaped the course of the nation and its popular culture. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: LATIN AMERICA 354 - The History of Race in Latin America This course examines historical and cultural constructions of race from the time of contact between indigenous, European, African, and Asian peoples in the colonial period to the present. We begin with the establishment and evolution of the ethnic hierarchy in the colonial period, focusing especially on African slavery in Latin America, interethnic interaction among Iberians, indigenous, and Africans, and attitudes toward marriage, sexuality and racial mixing. The course continues to explore a broad variety of themes in the modern period, including racial ideology and national policies and identities, immigration, the marketing of whiteness, the legacy of slavery, and Afro-Latino and indigenous social movements. The class focuses on Mexico, the Caribbean, the Andes, and Brazil, but we will not neglect to consider many other places, such as Venezuela, Central America, and California. Prerequisite: one History course. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: LATIN AMERICA 355 - Indians of Mexico This course on Mexican history studies the complex cultures and civilizations of indigenous peoples from prehispanic times to the present, focusing especially on the Nahua (\"Aztecs\"), Maya, Mixtec, and Zapotec. The course examines the cultural survival of native peoples who have faced the challenges of conquest, devastating population loss, secondary status under Spanish colonial rule, constant exposure to external influences, and continuing exploitation to the present. The course traces the evolution of native community organization, art forms, social structure, and religion in the colonial and modern periods and considers native responses to contemporary issues, such as migration, environmental degradation, and social injustice. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: LATIN AMERICA PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 359 - Mexico-United States Borderlands This course traces the history of a region that has undergone a series of extensive 244transformations in the last three hundred years. In the modern era, it changed from a periphery of the Spanish empire, to provinces of northern Mexico, and finally, to the southwest region of the United States. The area is a site of complicated and overlapping histories marked by processes of colonialism, diaspora, and nationalism. With particular attention to issues of race, gender, place, and power, we will examine the Mexico-U.S. borderlands through Chicana/o history, Mexican history, and U.S. Western history, as well as through fiction and art that explores the themes of boundaries, the body, and space. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: LATIN AMERICA Middle East and Africa 182 - The Social and Cultural History of the Modern Middle East This is a survey course in which we will explore the cultural and social historical experience of the Middle East from the nineteenth century to the present. Our goal in this class is to develop a sense of how people in the region view themselves and their history. We consider the currents of social change wrought by political and economic transformation, focusing particularly on the rise of new social movements and cultural currents. Here we will focus on issues of gender, religion, new social categories and notions of personhood and new forms of collective and individual identity. Finally, we look at the emergence of modern nation-states and their attendant juridical notions of citizenship and minority status. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA/MIDDLE EAST and REGIONAL FOCUS 183 - Middle Eastern History Since the Nineteenth Century This is a survey course in which we will explore the political and socio-economic history of the Middle East from the over from the beginning of the Ottoman reforms of the 1830s until the present. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the events of the past two centuries. In addition to the Ottoman reform period we will look at the rise of Mehmet Ali in Egypt, the incorporation of the region into the world economy, WWI and its continuing legacies in the region, the development of the Arab/Israeli question, the revolutions of the 1950's and the populist regimes they brought to power, the crisis in Lebanon, the Iranian Revolution, the war between Iran and Iraq and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. We will also consider some of the principal features of the economy of the region: agriculture and land reform; oil and state, and labor migration from poor states to richer ones. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA/MIDDLE EAST 282 - The Muslim World In Modern Times The term \"Muslim World\" is often criticized as imprecise. After all, Muslims constitute a fifth of humanity and live on six different continents. Nevertheless, Muslims often describe themselves as constituting a single community with shared sets of concerns. This class engages these differing views through an examination of the lives of Muslims over the past two centuries of globalization, colonialism, post-colonialism, nationalism, and ever changing technologies of transportation and communication. Our inquiry will concentrate on how Muslims were caught up in and reacted to and, in turn, influenced the Great Transformation that reshaped the entire 245world over the past two centuries. Dealing with issues from state building to women's rights to radical militancy, this class considers the various features of what we might call Muslim Modernity. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 283 - Peasant, Tribe and Nation in the Middle East This course examines the role of peasants and tribal formations in the process of nation and state building in the modern Middle East. In addition to looking at some of the empirical and theoretical problems inherent in defining and writing about \"peasants\" and \"tribes\" we will also consider how nationalism complicates these issues even more. We will investigate the ways that rural populations were incorporated into, or excluded from, the processes of state- formation. Finally, we will look at how representations of peasant/tribe in ideologies of state- building and nationalism shaped social and political relations within some of the region's nation- states. While we will discuss the region as a whole, we focus most of our attention on two empirical cases: Iraq and Egypt. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA/MIDDLE EAST 385 - Identity Formation in the Modern Middle East and Africa This course explores histories of the Middle East and North Africa over the last century and a half through an examination of identity formation. In the simplest terms, this means we will study the ways that people in the region came to understand themselves and their place in the world. Specifically, we will consider the intersections of religion, nationalism, colonialism, and minority status in the emergent nation-states of the region. Prerequisite: successful completion of one History course. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST Seminars 300 - History Colloquium This course introduces students to the practice and writing of history through topical approaches. Students will explore methodological approaches to historical inquiry, conduct research projects, and improve their writing skills. Prerequisite: one History course. This course may not be used to satisfy a Core requirement. Open to majors and minors only, or may enroll with instructor's approval. The Mexican Revolution. Studies of the Mexican Revolution have been at the forefront in the development of modern Latin American social, political, and cultural history. The studies have also contributed to comparative discussions in world history about the meanings of revolutionary experience in the twentieth century. However, historians and other social scientists have reached no consensus about the Mexican Revolution from its periodization to its actual existence. This seminar will examine the competing set of interpretations alongside primary sources to analyze the origins, course, and legacy of the Mexican Revolution. Prominent historiographical themes for the course include: conflict between elite liberalism and 246mass mobilization; agrarian reform and unionization within a capitalist project of development; corporate representation of social interests; the institutionalization of revolution; race, gender, and class in nationalist rhetoric; and, the role of art, education, and science/technology in state formation. Open to majors and minors only, or may enroll with instructor's approval. Reel History. This course will examine some of the ways that the history of France has been represented in films. Joan of Arc, The Return of Martin Guerre, Ridicule, The Rise to Power of Louis XIV, Danton, La Nuit de Varennes, Abel Gance's Napoleon, and Night and Fog are among the great movie classics to be analyzed. We will also deal with recent theoretical work on \"historical\" cinema. Are images as valid as written text when making meaningful connections with the past? Open to majors and minors only, or may enroll with instructor's approval. Writing the History of the Middle East. This course is a junior seminar on recent developments in the research and writing of history as practiced by professional historians of the modern Middle East. We will look at the history of historical writing about the region and the transformative developments in the field over the last thirty years or so. The objective is to cultivate your awareness of historiography and historical criticism. Historiography can be defined as the history of historical interpretation. Historical criticism refers to how we understand history as an object of study. To appreciate various modes of inquiry in the field, we will read exemplary texts embodying established traditions and new departures as well as critical works on the ideological roots of particular fields of history. . Open to majors and minors only, or may enroll with instructor's approval. The Fascist Revolution: Politics, Culture, and Soc. This History 300/ Junior Seminar closely studies the period known as Fascist Italy (1922 to 1945). Through a close analysis of the politics, culture, and society of Italy under Fascist dictatorship, we study the causes, character, and ramification of the Italian abandonment of democracy in the wake of World War I. Because it is a History 300 historiographic seminar, we examine the central debates of the field, such as whether Mussolini ruled primarily through coercion or consent, the extent of Fascist race ideology, and whether the regime was \"modern\" or \"backward-looking.\" Other major themes include Fascist cultural modernism, gender and Fascism, and the Italian road to empire and World War II. This course uses primary sources, such as translated documents, memoirs, and diaries, as well as contemporary historical analyses. Prerequisite: Majors and minors only, or with Instructor Permission 397 - Independent Study in History Reading tutorials, off-campus internships, and research projects are among options available. Prerequisite: permission of instructor. 2 or 4 units 490 - Senior Seminar in History In this fall semester seminar students will write a major paper that involves research and analysis of primary and secondary documents. Papers may concentrate on a geographical area, or take a topical approach, such as History of Science and Medicine, Women's History, or Revolutions. In addition, the seminar participants will read works by historians reflecting on their craft. The seminar culminates with individual oral presentations on the thesis research to the Department and campus community. Prerequisite: permission of instructor. 247495 - Honors in History The honors seminar is designed for history majors who have completed the History 490 Senior Seminar and have been approved by the History 490 instructors to continue on as candidates for Honors designation. Over the course of the semester, each honors thesis writer will work with the seminar instructor on advanced methodologies and multiples drafts to expand his/her original research and revise the thesis from a 25-page paper to a 40+-page paper. The seminar will culminate with a program of oral presentations, in which each student will share his/her work with the Department and the campus community. Prerequisite: HIST 490 United States 101 - United States Culture and Society This course is an introduction to early North American/U.S. history reaching from colonization to the Civil War. Of particular interest in this course will be the theme of cross-cultural interactions in the midst of transforming economies, an expanding nation, and unequal power relations. We will combine a broad introduction to early American history with an in-depth look at five case studies of individuals and communities encountering each other across borders of nation, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, and class. Each case study offers a unique perspective on the question of how broad economic structures of colonization, slavery, and the market revolution shaped human encounters between natives and newcomers, captives and captors, slaves and slaveholders, northerners and southerners. Ultimately, these case studies encourage a critical rethinking of concepts of liberty, equality, and democracy, which have formed the bedrock of master narratives in United States history. Within the context of these broad, sweeping themes we will look closely at primary historical documents, produced by men and women of their time period and we will read carefully the arguments of historians in our own time. The class will emphasize history as a process of critical interpretation. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES PRE-1800 and US DIVERSITY 102 - United States Culture and Society II This course is an introduction to early North American/U.S. history reaching from colonization to the Civil War. Of particular interest in this course will be the theme of cross-cultural interactions in the midst of transforming economies, an expanding nation, and unequal power relations. We will combine a broad introduction to early American history with an in-depth look at five case studies of individuals and communities encountering each other across borders of nation, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, and class.

Within the context of these broad, sweeping themes we will look closely at primary historical documents, produced by men 248and women of their time period and we will read carefully the arguments of historians in our own time. The class will emphasize history as a process of critical interpretation. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES PRE-1800 and US DIVERSITY 206 - History of American Women This course will examine the variety of female experiences in 19th and 20th century America by looking at the class, racial and ethnic dimensions that shaped women's lives. A second major concern will be to study women in the context of the historical developments of their time; reform movements, westward migration, industrialization and urbanization, will be examined in light of their impact on women's experiences and values. The course will also consider a number of themes, including popular images of women, women and sexuality, women and the family, women and work, women as consumers, and women as reformers. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 277 - Cross-Cultural Perspectives on Women and Community Health This course explores the history of women as promoters of community health in the diverse cultures of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century United States. Although women have not traditionally held power in mainstream biomedical occupations and institutions, women have nevertheless been critical to health and healing in local communities as caregivers, activists, and even scapegoats for disease. Furthermore, women's role in community health has been heavily shaped by gendered constructions of the body, disease, and wellbeing. Thus, while the focus of the course is on the social history of women's health and healing, the theoretical framework of the course also aims to explore how ideologies of gender, race, class, and sexuality shape the women's relationship to community health as both caregivers and health- seekers. The course is organized by a set of common themes that cut across time, space, and racial/ethnic boundaries in U.S. History. Themes include: spirituality and healing; work and health; sexuality and reproduction; activism for health justice. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 295 - Topics in American History American Frontiers The Frontier is backcountry, ghost town, cowboys and Indians, prairie ?and homesteaders, ranchers and sodbusters. It is more than these ?familiar images, though: the American Frontier is the encounter of the ?Americas and the Americans - native and immigrant, from Europe, Asia, ?and Africa - with the rest of the world, a historical development that ?began in 1492 and is still going on today. Although this is a ?transnational phenomenon, this course is primarily concerned with the ?Frontier in North America and particularly in the American West and in ?California, viewing it simultaneously as place, process, and myth. In ?this course, we will also be doing our own original research in the? Occidental Library's John Lloyd Butler Special Collections on ?Railroading, so students will have a chance to make their own mark ?upon the American Frontier. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY Modern America: US History 1945 to Present In this course we will examine the emergence of the U.S. as a world power, along with the challenges and realignments that ensued: the persistence and then erosion of the New Deal 249order, with its replacement by a politics more skeptical of a welfare system; the triumph of consumer culture; the growth of social diversity, both as an ideal and a reality; and the roles played by social movements, especially the civil rights movement, the women's movement, and the conservative movement. We will use a combination of primary and secondary sources as texts and students in addition will view a number of films from the era. Prerequisite: 1 course in history CORE REQIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY U.S. Intellectual History Since 1865 This course examines major themes in the history of thought and culture in the United States since the late nineteenth century. Among other topics, we will consider the modern liberal- progressive tradition and its radical and conservative critics; the uneasy status of religion in a secular intellectual culture; cultural radicalism and feminism; consumer culture and its interpreters; the implications of American ethno-racial pluralism for national identity; the responses of intellectuals to hot and cold wars, the Great Depression, and the upheavals of the 1960s. In addition, course readings and lectures will introduce students to ongoing debates about the public role and responsibilities of intellectuals as a distinct social group. American intellectuals have long struggled to define their vocation as inquirers and critics. In the process, they have sought to understand how that vocation might best respond to the demands of a broader public sphere. Their efforts to balance intellectual integrity with civic engagement provide an opportunity to reflect on your own experiences as students and interpreters of the United States and its culture. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY Women and American Politics A little under one hundred years ago, American women were denied the vote. Now women make up 53 percent of the electorate, women hold a record proportion of Senate and House seats, and the nation has nearly elected a woman president. The change is meaningful, yet the U.S. still ranks just 55th on the World Economic Forum's index of women's empowerment. This course will examine the history of women in American politics from 1920 to the present, with a focus on 1960 to today. Topics will include: the politics of sexual revolution, women in elections as candidates and voters, liberal and conservative women's movements, women and gender in the political parties, feminism, the intersection of race, class, and gender in U.S. national politics, and public opinion on women's issues. Most class sessions will include film, guest speakers, or group projects. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 304 - The American Revolution, 1760-1815 This course considers the American Revolution as a broad social transformation whose origins preceded the conflict over British taxation and whose consequences stretched beyond the ratification of the Constitution. We will explore the cultural and social origins of American independence and recognize the role of Native Americans and enslaved Africans in shaping the political and military conflict. The course will devote significant attention to the early republic and the effort of diverse Americans to find a meaningful freedom in the new nation. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES PRE-1800 306 - The Emergence of Modern America: the United States 1919-1945 This course will cover the domestic history of the U.S. from 1919 to 1945 and the social, cultural, and political changes accompanying America's evolution into a modern society. 250Themes include: developments in work, leisure, and consumption; impact of depression and war on the organization of the public and private sectors; persistence of traditional values such as individualism and the success ethos in shaping response to change; and the diversity of America's people and American experience. Prerequisite: Satisfactory completion of at least one American Studies or History course. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 307 - Happy Days? America 1946-1963 This course concentrates on the 1950s and encourages students to move beyond the stereotypes of Happy Days . Using movies, music, television, and written texts, the class will explore the tensions of the Fifties, the era of overt repression and covert rebellion stretching from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Themes include the Cold War and McCarthyism, early rock 'n roll, the Beats, the Bomb, civil rights protests, HUAC, the \"feminine mystique,\" sexuality, and cultural icons such as Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Prerequisite: satisfactory completion of at least one American Studies or History course. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 309 - Slavery in the Antebellum South This course examines the southern region of the antebellum United States as a \"slave society\", that is, a society in which slavery was central to the region's economy and a powerful slaveholding minority held the reigns of political power. We will examine the rise of a \"peculiar\" institution of southern slavery and the impact of chattel slavery on southern households, political institutions, and cultural practices. How did the institution of slavery shape the lives of southerners differently depending on race, class, gender, and geography? In what ways did the centrality of an institutionalized system of human property shape the social relations and lived experiences of enslaved African Americans, common whites, slaveholding planters, and Native Americans of the South? How did these groups of Southerners draw upon religion, violence, and ideologies of sex and race both to challenge and reinforce the southern social order? Finally, what did the South as a region come to mean to other antebellum Americans as sectional conflicts heightened in the 1850s? Students will explore the social and cultural history of the antebellum South through primary documents, first-person narratives, film, fiction, music, and extensive secondary scholarship. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 390 - Research Seminar in History History of Consumer Culture in the US 1880-1980 The consumption of goods, services, and experiences has been an important element in the history of the United States, from the seventeenth century to the present. However, the century beginning in 1880 transformed the nation into a modern consumer society. This research seminar provides a lens through which to explore such issues as the impact of mass media on society; the gendered, racial, ethnic, and class issues that shape the experience of consumption; the role of the United States in the global development of modern consumption; and the ways in which the intersections of consumption, production, and politics shaped the nation. This seminar has two focal points. First, reading contemporary historical scholarship provides both models for students' own research and ways of understanding issues such as the power relationships that undergird a consumer society and the moral challenges consumption has posed. Second, as the semester proceeds, attention will increasingly turn! to 251original research projects that draw on the widest variety of sources, such as visual culture, novels, newspapers and magazines, and the literature of social protest. What is the intellectual justification of the course? This course examines the rise and significance of consumer culture in the U.S. It will introduce students to important secondary works on consumer culture in the U.S. and will teach research methods and skills. Prerequisite: Satsifactory completion of at least one History course. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 395 - Special Topics in American History Reading and Writing Los Angeles. Major urban centers such as Los Angeles have always been evocative locations for cultural representation. The densely packed topographies, rich and diverse social interactions, and complex hierarchies of power and influence situated in these exemplary places lend them an air of excitement and mystery. These same factors that inspire intriguing urban literature, film, and journalism also make cities exemplary subjects for historical investigation. In this course, we will employ a strategy of documentary archaeology to reconstruct the relations of power, race, gender, and ethnicity embedded in the historical landscapes of Los Angeles during the twentieth century. Through archival research (in Occidental College's Special Collections and elsewhere), close reading of cultural artifacts, and careful exploration of scholarly works, we will seek to uncover something of the fabric of everyday social history in the noir megalopolis. Life in the Mosaic: 160 Years of Jews in Los Angeles. The story of Jews in Los Angeles is both familiar and unique. Familiar because it is a story of the growth of Los Angeles and the mobility of its citizens. Unique because Jews have been at both the center and the margins of influence in the political, social, and cultural movements that have created contemporary Los Angeles. This course explores, from the beginning of the American era to the present day, the pivotal roles Jews have played in the shaping of Los Angeles, and the reshaping of Jewish identities, communities, and perspectives by the opportunities and challenges found in Los Angeles. By examining how Jews have negotiated, and continue to negotiate, the complexities of life in Los Angeles, the course offers students an opportunity to consider the processes of social incorporation, marginalization, and fragmentation against the backdrop of urban development. Using the perspective of one of the many diverse groups that have transformed the region, it anchors historical change in a comprehensible narrative. By considering how the place and myth called Los Angeles has shaped Jewish identities, the course offers students an occasion to reflect on their own notions of self-identity, community, and society in the twenty- first century. The course themes and topics are derived from an exhibition to be mounted at the Autry National Center in Spring 2013. Through course assignments and related activities, students will be able to contribute to the development of the exhibition with their original research, as research and editorial interns, and through analytical critiques of various elements of the exhibition. The combination of class and field work will allow students to acquire experience in historical research, interpretation, and public presentation. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY The US Since 1945. This readings course will focus on the cultural, social, and political dimensions of the history of the United States, from 1945 to the present. Among the topics under consideration will be race, ethnicity, gender, consumer culture, religion, social movements, as well as the intersection between politics, culture, and globalization. The texts studies will be major books by historians, political scientists, sociologists, and non-fiction authors. Prerequisite: One History course 252CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY California Since 1940. California Since 1940 Before World War II, California was in many ways an agricultural settler society, far removed from the global currents, which propelled it to world prominence in previous centuries. But the war transformed the Golden State into an industrial powerhouse and brought dramatic social changes, which would define the nation throughout the twentieth century. In this class, we begin with the Depression and War to witness the birth of a new, noir California, particularly in Los Angeles, and trace the intersection of military/technological expertise and leisure culture as it produced the counterculture, Internet, and personal computer revolutions that would once again place California at the center of the world. Prerequisite: One history course CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY The Arts and Public Life in Modern America An exploration of the ways in which the arts have influenced public life in the United States since the early 20th century and have, in turn, been shaped by competing visions of democratic citizenship. In addition to examining the public interventions of artists, we will study the history of institutions ranging from museums and government cultural agencies to local community arts groups. The course combines seminar meetings with visits to area sites and organizations. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY Transportation and Place in American History. How have our ways of moving through the world affected our understandings of familiar spaces around us? Can we think of transportation technology as a form of mass media that has changed over time, thus altering perceptions of even the most familiar landscapes? In this course, we will explore several historical modes of perceiving and navigating the landscapes of American cities, and particularly greater Los Angeles, ranging from the pedestrian city to the metropolis of railroads and streetcars (including the famous Pacific Electric system) to the sprawling megalopolis of automobiles and freeways. We might even speculate what a transit and pedestrian Los Angeles of the future might look like - will it be a return to the past, or betoken new ways of understanding, and organizing, our everyday urban spaces? Central to this exploration will be extensive research in the college's John Lloyd Butler Special Collections archives on railroads and their history and on Southern California in the twentieth century. In this process, students will carry out original archival research, culminating in a significant paper reflecting both their own research discoveries in the archives as well as their new perspectives on American urbanism in Southern California and elsewhere.

Within each subdiscipline students study stressors, positive and negative, that govern human performance. In addition, discussions focus on numerous clinical conditions, and the exercise, nutritional, and medical techniques used to prevent and control these problems. The purpose of this major is to develop and integrate the concepts and principles from each subdiscipline to understand the complexity of the human mind and body. This major prepares students for advanced studies in medicine, physical therapy, dentistry, kinesiology, and other related life science programs. Departmental Mission Statement: Our mission is to foster in a diverse group of students an understanding and appreciation of human functions and to encourage and develop learning skills that enhance their personal and professional growth. Goals: 1.Critical Thinking. Students should learn how to engage in critical, evidence-based thinking. 2.Integration Across Levels of Analysis. Students should understand and integrate different levels of analysis in their working model of human form and function. 3.Mastery of Core Knowledge. Students are expected to master a significant proportion of the vocabulary and core body of knowledge in Kinesiology. 4.Mastery of Discipline-Specific Conventions. Majors should be able to read and understand the primary source literature in Kinesiology (journals and books) and to integrate and present that information in prescribed, discipline-specific ways, including oral and written exposition. Requirements MAJOR: Eight courses (37 units) are required for the Kinesiology major.

By extending the study of \"Latin America\" beyond the geo-political borders of the region to include the Caribbean and the United States, the major emphasizes the importance of migrations, interethnic interactions, and cultural exchanges of Indigenous, European, African, and Asian peoples throughout the Americas. The LLAS program engages students with a variety of perspectives on the socio-political complexities and cultural traditions of the Americas, and the historical development of unique regional societies and cultures. The transnational perspective of our curriculum distinguishes the LLAS major from more traditional area studies programs. Students in the major develop proficiency in Spanish and take courses from a broad range of academic disciplines and departments, including history, Spanish, sociology, English and comparative literature, music, politics, critical theory-social justice, economics, psychology, and 260education. LLAS majors are strongly encouraged to participate in study abroad and summer research programs in Latin America or Spain. Our program also encourages students to engage in community-based learning through the different activities available in the Latino and Latin American communities that are integral to the city of Los Angeles. The major prepares students for graduate school as well as for a variety of career paths, including community organizing, social work, education, public history (museums and cultural centers), government, law, public service, and business.

The Mathematics department is committed to engaging a diverse range of students in the active study and creative application of the principles, ideas, and methods that characterize mathematics and the mathematical sciences, and offering preparation toward a wide variety of careers and educational pursuits. Upon graduation, some mathematics majors go on to graduate or professional school while others begin careers in teaching, business, industry, or government. The major can be structured to provide a solid foundation in the mathematical sciences-pure and applied mathematics, statistics, and operations research-and fields close to mathematics like computer science, actuarial science, and engineering. A major or minor in mathematics can also provide an excellent technical and theoretical complement to a major or minor in other fields. Computer Science is a rapidly developing field, rooted in mathematics but playing an increasingly important role in a wide range of human endeavors. Undergraduate study of computer science can lead to a variety of opportunities for employment or graduate work, as well as giving one insight into the greatest revolution in information technology since the invention of printing. Please consult the Mathematics department's home page for more detailed and regularly updated information on the program.

STATISTICS PLACEMENT: Students receiving a 4 or 5 on the AP Statistics Exam are exempt from Math 146; Math 150 is recommended for these students wanting to take further statistics courses. MATHEMATICS COURSES: Calculus is a prerequisite for all mathematics courses with the exceptions of Mathematics 105 and 146, as well as for most Computer Science courses. All students planning to take Calculus must take the online Calculus Placement Exam prior to the beginning of the Fall Semester unless they are exempt due to having received an Advanced Placement exam score. (See Calculus Placement above or contact the Mathematics Department for further details.) Prerequisites for any course may be waived with permission of the instructor. Courses Calculus Calculus differs in some respects from the traditional courses offered at some secondary schools and most other colleges or universities. Occidental's program is based on scientific modeling, makes regular use of computers, and requires interpretation as well as computation. A variety of courses comprise this program, accommodating different levels of preparation. The core content is described below as Calculus 1 and 2. Actual courses suited to different levels of preparation are listed under each description. Calculus 1: Scientific Modeling and Differential Calculus 267Many mathematical models in the natural and social sciences take the form of systems of differential equations. This introduction to the calculus is organized around the construction and analysis of these models, focusing on the mathematical questions they raise. Models are drawn from biology, economics, and physics. The important elementary functions of analysis arise as solutions of these models in special cases. The mathematical theme of the course is local linearity. Topics include the definition of the derivative, rules for computing derivatives, Euler's Method, Newton's Method, Taylor polynomials, error analysis, optimization, and an introduction to the differential calculus of functions of two variables. CALCULUS 2: Scientific Modeling and Integral Calculus This course continues the study of the calculus through scientific modeling. While Calculus 1 is concerned with local changes in a function, Calculus 2 focuses on accumulated changes. Models solved by accumulation functions lead to the definition of the integral and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Additional topics include numerical and analytic techniques of integration, trigonometric functions and dynamical systems modeling periodic or quasiperiodic phenomena, local approximation of functions by Taylor polynomials and Taylor series, and approximation of periodic functions on an interval by trigonometric polynomials and Fourier series. 108 - Unified Precalculus and Calculus 1-A The first of a two course sequence enriching the material in Calculus 1 with additional study of elementary functions, algebra, trigonometry, graphing, and mathematical expression.

UC Davis; M.A., Ph.D., UC Santa Barbara Music The Occidental Music Department is a community that values and cultivates the creation, performance, and critical study of the world's musics. Students majoring in music develop an integrated understanding of music as creative work, as cultural and historical expression, and as performance. Through its curriculum, recitals, lectures, master classes, residencies, and other public events, the Music department leads the musical discourse that enriches College and community life. Music majors and minors develop their craft in a rigorous analytical study of music from the world's musical traditions, which they apply to their own artistic expression as they engage in specific studies in composition, performance, conducting, music theory, and music history. In addition to upper-division courses requiring a reading knowledge of standard music notation, the Music department also offers a wide array of special topics courses in subjects ranging from popular music and jazz to opera, choral music and art song, instrumental music, music for film, and music in world cultures. Classroom and private studies are coordinated with opportunities to attend live concerts by the world-class musical artists who perform on campus and elsewhere in the Los Angeles area. Students study, practice, and perform in Booth Music Hall and Thorne Hall, with ready access to practice rooms, large and small performance halls, an electronic music studio, and a music library of scores, recordings, and computers with musicianship and notation programs. The music major is designed to enable students to enter into music-related professions. Alumni have become successful in opera, musical theater, professional choruses and orchestras, in careers as concert artists, and as composers and arrangers for films, television, and theater. Many have become music teachers in private studios or at the elementary, middle and high school, or college and university level. Still others have become involved in related professions such as arts management, sound engineering, music editing, and publishing. Because of the quality, breadth and depth of Occidental College's liberal arts curriculum, alumni who majored in music are prepared to enter graduate school with a wide variety of professional goals. The music curriculum is structured so that students who are undecided about majoring in music may begin their music studies in their second year at Occidental and complete the major by the end of their fourth year. However, the development of musical craft and artistry requires time as well as effort, and students considering a major or minor in music are urged to begin taking music theory courses and applied music studies in their first year at the college. Students who plan to study abroad in their third year at the college must begin their music 277theory studies in their first year.

In this course we will study music- cultures that are enabled and generated by digital media and technology. We ask how digital media shape the mode of production, transmission, and reception of contemporary popular music. Using principles of ethnomusicology, we will examine how music as a \"digital vernacular\" creates a sense of place and self in the increasingly globalized world; how social, media, and technological institutions organize 21-century music participation at the grassroots, independent level. A laptop computer is required . CORE REQUIREMENT MET: FINE ARTS ? INTERCULTURAL 288115 - Topics in Opera Since its beginnings in late 16th-century Florence, opera has occupied the most diverse of minds: whether lovers of authority (from Louis XIV to Rudy Giuliani) or lovers of the folk (from Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Rufus Wainwright); whether masters of horror (from Edgar Allen Poe to William Friedkin) or masters of the humane (from S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard to Toni Morrison); whether purveyors of the scholarly (from Friedrich Nietzsche to Kwame Anthony Appiah) or purveyors of the popular (from Scott Joplin and George Gershwin to Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Woody Allen). In this historical survey course, we will examine this diversity of responses to and in opera by studying 1) the precise musical forms and styles of the most famous operas, and 2) the primary source documents written as responses to individual operas and opera writ large. We will thus study individual operas in their political, philosophical, and cultural contexts. Required listening and reading will be supplemented by required trips to the Los Angeles Opera, for rehearsals of operas by Mozart, Verdi, and Puccini. No prior musical experience is required. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: FINE ARTS ? INTERCULTURAL 117 - Topics in Music for Film and other Media This course will survey film music from its silent film era origins to the present, focusing on its many functions through in-class viewing, analysis, and critique of film clips. The works of many prominent film composers as well as some lesserknown figures will be examined in terms of style and approach, as well as their own views on the film-scoring process. Fundamental information on music, film, and psychology of music will be introduced, and the role of music in other media (such as TV and experimental video) will be explored. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL FINE ARTS 119 - Why Music Matters This course provides a general introduction to the elements and history of Western music over the last three centuries. Students will focus on learning how to listen to music, with an emphasis of identifying musical forms, genres, and styles.

Prerequisite: Music 130 or permission of instructor. 2 units CORE REQUIREMENT PARTIAL: FINE ARTS 241 - Cognition of Music and Sound As part of human cognition, our perception, production, and understanding of music has elicited many questions: What is music in relation to \"sound\"? Is music an evolutionary adaptation? What is the relationship of music and emotions, or memory? Can music influence perception in other modalities? What is the meaning of music? Can music make us smarter? Is music a language? What is biological and what is cultural in the esthetics of music? This course will reframe many of these questions from the interdisciplinary standpoint of cognitive science, acoustics, music theory, and semiotics to explore music as a cognitive process Topics will include the perception of pitch, timbre, rhythm, and localization; music and the brain; cognitive aspect of the esthetics of music; the relationship between music and language in terms of their structures and neurological processing; music and memory; music and emotions; music and meaning. We will also discuss the role music plays in cross-modal interactions, either in the real world, or in films and multimedia art works. Prerequisite: Any Cognitive Science class or Music class, or instructor's approval . Same as COGS 241 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCIENCE ? FINE ARTS 250 - Theory and Practice of Music II This course deepens students' exposure to techniques for analysis and composition in the style of 18th-19th century common practice. We will study imitative genres and sectional forms (ternary, sonata, rondo), exploring chromatic extensions of diatonic practice. Students will engage in analytic and compositional projects in consultation with Music History faculty. Prerequisite: Music 151/151A. Requires concurrent enrollment in Music 250A. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: FINE ARTS 251 - Theory and Practice of Music III Students will explore extensions of chromatic harmonic practice through the turn of the 20th century, and will be introduced to the musical language of iconic 20th-century composers 290(Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Debussy, Bartok). Students will engage in analytic and compositional projects in consultation with Music History faculty. Prerequisite: Music 250 or permission of instructor. Requires concurrent enrollment in Music 250A. 257 - Composition and Orchestration I Writing exercises to develop technical facility; study of characteristics of instruments; exercises in scoring for various vocal and instrumental combinations. Prerequisite: Music 151 or permission of the instructor. 261 - Western Music and Culture: 1600-1789 This course surveys the two centuries that gave rise to European art music's most enduring legacies: opera, instrumental art music, and, especially, the major-minor tonal system, which, as the system that informs most music today, is arguably Europe's greatest-ever cultural export. The emergence of this tonal system will enable instrumental music to sustain a listener's attention through dramatic forms and without the aid of words; comprehending how these forms behave will be one of our central tasks. In turn, the cultivation of instrumental genres will fuel the operatic accomplishments of Classical composers, notably Mozart. Our study of vocal and instrumental music will proceed chronologically and focus on individual cities, starting with Florence and ending with Vienna. With the only prerequisite in taking this course being the ability to read musical notation, students from other disciplines who are eager for music-intensive study are especially welcome. Music majors and minors taking the course will be given assignments tailored to their knowledge and departmental expectations. Freshmen may not enroll in this course. Prerequisite: sophomore Status CORE REQUIREMENT MET: PRE-1800 ? EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 262 - Western Music & Culture in the 19th Century This interdisciplinary course will survey the music of the long 19th century, from the French Revolution to the beginning of World War I. We will commence by considering Beethoven's response to Napoleon, the Eroica Symphony, in the context of post-Revolution European geo- politics, and end with the musical cultures of turn-of-the-century Vienna, Paris, and New York City. Topics to be explored include the following: the Industrial Revolution and emergent technologies (including photography); landscape painting and poetry; nationalism (including \"folk\" music); aesthetics and philosophy; science and medicine; the expansion of tonal and formal musical language, and the essaying of new musical forms; the public concert, and music for home performance; and Richard Wagner and artistic responses to his music and writings. No prerequisites. CORE REQUIREMENTS MET: FINE ARTS EUROPE 263 - Western Music & Culture in the 20th Century This course surveys Western musical practice of the 20th century, commencing with the wide- ranging artistic responses to the music and writings of Richard Wagner, in Europe and in the United States, and the emergence of a \"musical modernism,\" as new forms and new pitch systems take hold. We will then follow the radical experimentation of the 1920s ultra- modernists through to the post-minimalist eclecticism of John Adams and Kaija Saariaho at the century's end, throughout alert to the political, philosophical, and cultural forces shaping the music at issue. With the only prerequisite in taking this course being the ability to read musical 291notation, students from other disciplines who are eager for music-intensive study are especially welcome. Music majors and minors taking the course will be given assignments tailored to their knowledge and departmental expectations. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: FINE ARTS ? INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 272 - Instrumental Conducting Basic principles and gestures of instrumental conducting in a variety of genres: symphony, concerto, opera. We will also discuss the \"business\" of conducting and running rehearsals. Prerequisite: MUSC 151 273 - Choral Conducting Introduction to conducting technique from a choral/vocal perspective. Students will learn to develop musical interpretation through score study, analysis, and clear gestural vocabulary. Prerequisite: Ability to read music; choral experience preferred. 280 - Introduction to Ethnomusicology Offers an introduction to the principal concepts and methodologies of the field of ethnomusicology as well as the style and practices of selected world musical traditions. Prerequisites: Music 101 or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL FINE ARTS 285 - Topics Crit Stud Music: Music and Social Protest Over the past century, music has played a central role in political and social movements that seek to shift the balance of power in local, national, and transnational contexts. From the songs of the African American freedom struggle to the music of the nueva cancion movement in Chile, from the live performance practice of the Occupy and immigrant rights movements to the raucous sounds of Russia's Pussycat Riot, music has been an important mode of circulating alternative political messages and inspiring rebellion against the status quo. How can music be used to convey political messages and extend the reach of social movements? Why does music enhance cohesion and solidarity among movement participants and/or sway or destabilize oppositional forces? Are there differences between mass-mediated modes of political protest and live, grassroots political performances? When voices raised in song become powerful, what protocols are established to censor and repress them. We will examine these questions in the context of social movements which have inspired mass participation, comparing and contrasting case studies from Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 357 - Composition II Study of the compositional techniques and resources of the 20th and 21st centuries. Refinement of the composer's stylistic originality, through repertoire study and short compositional exercises. Composition of a substantial original piece for chamber ensemble, working with performers towards a final recital performance. Prerequisite: Music 255, 257, or permission of the instructor. 292374 - Junior Recital Preparation Preparation for junior recital. Requirements include more extensive practice expectations as well as research and preparation of program notes. Prerequisite: approval of the department. May be repeated once for credit. 2 units 385 - Advanced Topics in the Critical Study of Music Music Claiming Space Music can serve as more than just a cultural artifact. Music can also be an epistemological catalyst, connecting societies quickly and transparently to celebrations of, and debates surrounding, shared systems of belief. As such, this course examines the notion of place, how place is made into music, and how music is made into meaning. The objectives of the course are 1. to provide a forum for discussion about the ways in which notions of place are musically rendered; 2. to engage some basic tenets of phenomenological inquiry and reasoning in our learning, writing, and research about music that provide you the chance to critically feel, think, and write about music; and 3. to understand how the relationship between music and place is in dialogue with, and an expression of, extra-musical, global trends. Prerequisite: Freshman may not enroll in this course Performance and Politics of the U.S./Mexico Border This course examines the ways that the United States-Mexico border has been represented as a space of violence and creativity, limits and possibility in music, theater, literature, and film. Shuttling back and forth between the border as a geopolitical boundary and as a trope of emergent identity, the cultural texts we will examine challenge dominant narratives of national belonging, self and other, gender and racial hierarchy, and economic marginalization. Engaging in a historically situated analysis of cultural texts that offer alternative perspectives on the lived experiences of those who inhabit the dynamic contact zone between the United States and Mexico, students will critically engage the concepts and issues that have shaped the master narrative of the border. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 390 - Junior Seminar in Music Topics in Musical Analysis. Topics in Music Analysis is a small, discussion-oriented seminar emphasizing analytic and critical approaches to a musical topic. prerequisite: Junior standing Igor Stravinsky. In celebration of the 100th anniversary of Stravinsky's iconic Rite of Spring (1913), this course examines the musical works by Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971). We will investigate his idiomatic musical language with respect to his distinctive use of structure, metrical displacement and elements of rhythm and pitch, and also consider how these are employed within the immense range of his oeuvre. Students will become familiar with the core of the Stravinskian theoretical literature, as well as with Stravinsky's own polemical writings. Among the topics and repertoire covered will be the early Russian ballets (including the scandalous premiere of The Rite of Spring); the short piano pieces and ragtime-influenced works of the late 1910s; several neoclassical works of the 1920s-30s; and finally his collaboration with Hollywood movie producers and late exploration into serial techniques during 293his final decades spent in the United States. Students will use a variety of analytical methods in analytic assignments, in-class presentations, and an argument-driven research paper. The course will be supplemented by guest lecturers and class field trips. 397 - Independent Study in Music 2 or 4 units 474 - Senior Comprehensive Preparation in Music This course provides individual coaching and advisement to students preparing to present their senior comprehensive project. May be repeated once for credit Prerequisite: Junior Standing 2 units 490 - Senior Seminar in Music In this fall semester seminar students will complete a draft of their senior comprehensives paper.

Simeon Pillich Adjunct Assistant Professor, Music B.A., M.A., Ph.D., UCLA 295Philosophy The practice of philosophy provides students with the skills of conceptual analysis, logical reasoning, and critical thinking. These skills are intrinsically valuable throughout one's life and apply to a wide variety of professions, including law, medicine, education, journalism, business, public policy, and government. In addition, the methods and skills developed in a philosophical education aim to provide students with the intellectual grounds for reflecting on their beliefs, to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of alterative beliefs, and to understand how philosophical ideas have shaped their culture and history. Studying philosophy will help students develop these intellectual grounds. In both these respects, the mission of philosophy promotes responsible citizenship, social and economic justice, and the recognition of and respect for differences among groups and between individuals. Requirements MAJOR: Ten courses (40 units) in philosophy are required for the major, including Philosophy 210; Philosophy 225; Philosophy 230; six additional courses in philosophy, three of which are upper division (in the 300-series); Philosophy 490. Philosophy 101 can be counted toward the six additional courses in philosophy, but is not a required course. The three upper division courses must meet the following distribution requirements: one must concentrate on the history of philosophy (300; 305; 310), one on moral and political philosophy (300; 310; 330; 340; 345; course can fulfill two distribution requirements. For example, Philosophy 305 can count both toward the history of philosophy and metaphysics and epistemology; and Philosophy 300 and Philosophy 310 can count both toward the history of philosophy and moral and political philosophy. The flexibility of the major allows students to pursue the study of philosophy broadly, or to tailor a course of study to their philosophical interests. The following course clusters are intended as guides for students interested in concentrating their studies toward a specific philosophical interest. These suggestions should supplement, rather than replace, significant and frequent discussion with a faculty adviser concerning designing and executing a coherent plan of study within the major. Students interested in Law and Politics: Philosophy 230: Introduction to Ethics Philosophy 240: Philosophy of Race Philosophy 245: Feminism and Philosophy Philosophy 255: Environmental Ethics Philosophy 300: Topics in Classical Philosophy Philosophy 310: Hobbes to Kant Philosophy 330: Globalization and Justice Philosophy 340: Philosophy of Law Philosophy 350: Contemporary Classics in Political Philosophy Students interested in Physics and Mathematics: Philosophy 325: Metalogic 296Philosophy XXX/Mathematics 354: Set Theory and Foundations of Mathematics Philosophy 355: Philosophy of Space and Time Philosophy 360: Philosophy of Science Philosophy 375: Theory of Knowledge Philosophy 380: Wittgenstein Philosophy 385: Metaphysics Students interested in Health and Bioethics: Philosophy 230: Introduction to Ethics Philosophy 240: Philosophy of Race Philosophy 245: Bioethics Philosophy 255: Environmental Ethics Philosophy 365: Philosophy of Science Students interested in Philosophy of Psychology and Cognitive Science: Philosophy 325: Metalogic Philosophy 360: Philosophy of Mind Philosophy 365: Philosophy of Science Philosophy 370: Philosophy of Language Philosophy 375: Theory of Knowledge Philosophy 380: Wittgenstein Students interested in the History of Philosophy: Philosophy 205: Introduction to Ancient Thought Philosophy 210: Historical Introduction to Philosophy Philosophy 230: Introduction to Ethics Philosophy 300: Topics in Classical Philosophy Philosophy 305: Topics in Modern Philosophy Philosophy 310: Hobbes to Kant Philosophy 380: Wittgenstein WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Philosophy will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's college-wide writing requirement by completing at least one writing- intensive upper division philosophy course with a grade of B-or higher (or appropriate course work). Students should familiarize themselves with the departmental requirement at the time of declaring the major. See the Writing Program and consult the department chair for additional information. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: Graduating seniors in philosophy write one long essay, the \"state of thought\" essay, to satisfy their comprehensives requirement. This essay, approximately 30 pages long, is on a topic of their choice and is written with the advice and assistance of two faculty advisers. Seniors begin work on this essay in the Senior Seminar (Philosophy 490) in the fall semester. In this class, which is organized by a faculty member, seniors focus on writing a preliminary 20-page essay that provides a broad survey of the \"state of thought\" on their chosen topic, along with a discussion of the important and differing approaches taken by the key philosophers who have written on their topic. With satisfactory completion of the preliminary essay, students receive a grade of CIP (course in progress) at the end of the fall semester. 297Although there is no class associated with the philosophy comprehensives in the spring semester, seniors continue to work on their \"state of thought\" essays, with the assistance of the instructor for Philosophy 490. In the spring semester seniors focus on assessing the arguments that have been brought to bear on their topic, and on developing their own contributions to the topic. Once essays are complete, seniors present their work orally to the campus community. With satisfactory completion of their essays and oral presentations in the spring semester, the fall semester CIP grade is changed to a letter grade. The letter grade is based on the quality of their essays, the quality of their contributions to the seminar discussions in Philosophy 490, and the quality of their oral presentations in the spring. Final grades will be determined by the philosophy faculty as a whole. MINOR (updated 12/5/11): Five courses (20 units) in Philosophy, including Philosophy 225. At least one course must be an upper division course (in the 300 series). Students who wish to craft a narrowly focused course of study for the minor should consult a philosophy faculty adviser and the concentration guides above (listed under \"Philosophy Major\"). INTERDEPARTMENTAL MAJOR IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE: See Cognitive Science. GRADUATE STUDY IN PHILOSOPHY: Students interested in pursuing graduate study in philosophy should contact a faculty adviser as early as possible for assistance crafting an appropriate course of study both in philosophy and relevant cognate fields. HONORS: There is no special class associated with honors. Honors in philosophy is awarded in recognition of excellence in work done for the senior essay, and will be determined by the philosophy faculty as a whole once final versions of the senior essays have been submitted. Seniors need a 3.3 GPA in philosophy and a 3.25 GPA overall to be considered for Departmental honors. See the Honors Program and consult the department chair for further details. Courses 101 - Introduction to Philosophy This course is an introduction to the practice of philosophy through engagement with four canonical philosophical texts: Rene Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy, David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, J. S. Mill's On Liberty, and Friedrich Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morals. These texts each, in their own way, grapple with doubt, human fallibility, and the role of reason in either creating or conquering this doubt. Engagement with these texts will challenge students not only to develop the skills of philosophical argumentation, but also to think more clearly about topics of perennial philosophical interest: the nature of knowledge, the existence of God, the legitimacy of political institutions, and the source(s) of morality. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 205 - Introduction to Ancient Thought An examination of the problems in moral and political philosophy created by, and resulting from, the historical events surrounding Athens in the 5th Century B.C. The course will examine 298historical writings (Herodotus, Thucydides), Greek tragedy, Pre-Socratic thought and Plato, and developments in art, with as much reference as possible to their social and economic contexts. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 210 - Historical Introduction to Philosophy We will address some of the fundamental issues in epistemology and metaphysics while reading selections from the works of some important philosophers throughout history. Among the issues addressed will be the existence of the external world, the relation between the mental and the physical, and the foundation of our knowledge of the future. Philosophers covered will include Berkeley, Descartes, Hume, and Kant. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 225 - Formal Logic We will study the formal properties of arguments and sets of statements. This will involve learning two formal languages, the propositional calculus and the predicate calculus. Within these languages we will formalize the notions of validity, soundness, and consistency, and show how these properties can be tested. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 230 - Introduction to Ethics This course will address some fundamental questions in ethics, such as: What is the best life for a human being? Should I be good? Can I be good? Is morality objective, subjective, or relative to one's society? Is there any relation between ethics and religion? What are our obligations to others, both friends and strangers? What are our obligations to non-human animals? We will read both classical and contemporary writings in ethics. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL COMNNECTIONS 235 - Feminism and Philosophy A critical analysis of contemporary feminist theories and their philosophical roots. Topics for discussion will include: equality, respect, meaningful work, parenting, friendship, sexual relations, abortion, rape, pornography, and prostitution. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 240 - Philosophy of Race This course will philosophically examine the concept of race and the way race informs identity. Topics include the reality of race, the origins and nature of the concept, and the extent to which race does and should impact our social and personal identities. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 245 - Science, Law, and Sexual Orientation The course investigates the current scientific data on sexual orientation in order to evaluate the implications this information has in law and social policy. While biological findings on sexual 299orientation will be presented and explained, the level of instruction is designed for non-biology majors, and no prior familiarity with law and social policy is presupposed. Some questions that will guide our inquiry include: What is the data that supports biological predisposition? Is sexual orientation genetic? Is it epigenetic? Is it immutable or a matter of choice? How should the law treat sexual orientation as a matter of classification? How should the benefits and burdens of the law be distributed according to this classification? What effect do stereotypes of sexual orientation have on science and social policy, for example, in AIDS research? The course aims to promote an understanding of the biological impact on complex behaviors such as sexual orientation, and to discuss the social and legal implications of that relationship as engaged citizens. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 250 - Bioethics This course is an introduction to the methods of ethics developed for addressing moral issues in the practice of health care and research. Methods addressed will include: professional ethics (practice standards and professional norms), casuistry, the principles of biomedical ethics, applied normative theory, feminist bioethics, and narrative ethics. We will use these methods to address a host of topics of concern to those participating in health care institutions, either (directly) as providers or (somewhat less directly) as policy makers. Given in alternate years. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 255 - Environmental Ethics This course will examine the nature of environmental values and their role in decisions and public policies concerning environmental protection. Some of the questions we will address include: What is the relation between the environment and human health and well-being? Are there reasons other than human health and well-being for protecting the environment? How do we compare environmental values against other values in making reasonable decisions? What are the ethical issues involved in cost-benefit analysis? What are our duties to future generations and non-human animals? CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 285 - Paradoxes Paradoxes and their resolution have played a significant role in the development of philosophy; they still have an influence on philosophy today. While Xeno's paradoxes of motion where first posed about 2000 years ago there is still not a consensus about what to say about them. Semantic paradoxes such as the liar paradox and the paradoxes of vagueness reveal problems with everyday concepts such as truth and implication. Supertasks reveal problems with our understanding of infinity. What to say about these problems, what they show us about how to understand space, time, infinity, truth and implication, for example, are some of the issues we will discuss in this class. We will examine various paradoxes, puzzles, and purported paradoxes, and discuss different proposed resolutions to them. 290 - Art: Form, Meaning, Value This course will explore foundational questions in the philosophy of art: What is art? Is there a 300quality, or feature, or function that all works of art share? How does art get its meaning? Does the artist or the viewer (or both, or neither) determine the meaning of an artwork? (Why) do we value the authenticity or originality of an artwork? What determines whether something is a good work of art? Can art make us better (or worse) people? Can good works of art have morally bad properties? How can we be moved by fictions (that is, how can we fear the monsters of horror films)? CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL ? FINE ARTS 300 - Topics in Classical Philosophy An examination of the moral and political philosophies of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Questions for discussion will include: how should I live and what sort of person should I be? What is the nature of happiness? Can I be happy and also morally vicious? Do I have any good reason to act in the interests of others when they conflict with my own interests? What is the nature of justice and the just state? How do states affect our desires and aims? Given in alternate years. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 305 - Topics in Modern Philosophy A detailed examination of some central philosophical texts from the 17th and 18th centuries. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 310 - Hobbes to Kant An examination of four great figures in Western moral and political philosophy of the 17th and 18th centuries: Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. Topics to be discussed include: the basis of political obligation, the nature of the just state, the basis of human rights and the right to property, the nature of human reason and its relation to passion, and the foundation of moral obligation. Given in alternate years. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 312 - 19th Century German Philosophy This course examines the major figures of post-Kantian German Idealism and their critics, including Fichte, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche. Special attention will be paid to the central problem of this tradition to justify the concept of freedom. Topics to be discussed include free will and determinism, non-metaphysical conceptions of freedom, the concept of recognition, the sociality of reason, and the relationship between naturalism and ethical theory. The course assumes no prior knowledge of subject matter or familiarity with these figures, and aims to provide students with an introductory, working knowledge of German philosophy after Kant. Prerequisites: Philosophy 210 or permission of instructor. Given in alternate years. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 315 - Topics in Continental Philosophy This course examines figures, movements, and philosophical problems in the Continental tradition of philosophy, typically in German and French philosophy of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the past, topics for discussion have included: ideology and mass media, 301technology and disciplinary power, and sexuality and agency. Because topics change from year to year, students may repeat course once for credit, with approval of instructor. Given in alternate years. Can be repeated one time. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 325 - Metalogic A survey of results in the metatheory of first order logic, including consistency, completeness, decidability, and undecidability. Prerequisite: Philosophy 225, Mathematics 210, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 330 - Globalization and Justice This course examines various theories of justice in international relations and evaluates them according to a range of practical problems facing globalization. Typically, we shall start by exploring the tension between universal values and cultural relativism, which underlies much of the theory and practice of international relations. We will then examine this tension in a number of controversies concerning globalization, including war and peace, international political economy and distributive justice, environmental issues, human rights, and terrorism. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 333 - Transnational Justice When we discuss, study and call for 'justice' we often do so in the context of (more or less) stable political institutions. In the contemporary global community we frequently face unstable or non-existent political institutions of the kind assumed in a great deal of our political theory. These transitional contexts often exist in the aftermath of large-scale human rights abuses (such as genocide, apartheid and other crimes against humanity). This raises an important question: what constitutes justice in these transitional contexts? This course explores this foundational question, through more particular topics, such as: the nature and value of truth and reconciliation commissions, reparations, restorative justice, the normative foundations of international criminal law, and the nature of evil and atrocity. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 340 - Philosophy of Law The course covers both analytical and normative jurisprudence and provides students with a comprehensive foundation for study of the law. Analytical jurisprudence examines the nature and justification of the law including alternative conceptions like natural law theory, positivism, critical legal studies, and law and economics. In addition, the course covers the problem of legal interpretation and the role of judicial review in constitutional democracies. Normative jurisprudence concerns the ethical issues raised by the law including freedom of expression and hate speech, freedom of religion and the separation of church and state, civil liberties and rights, theories of punishment and the death penalty, and equal protection doctrine. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 345 - Contemporary Moral Philosophy: Authenticity, Identity, and Freedom 302This course focuses on some issues in moral philosophy that arise for us as reflective and responsible citizens in a multicultural world. Topics for discussion will include: to what extent am I free, and to what extent am I the product of circumstances beyond my control? What is the nature of moral agency and moral responsibility? How can I live authentically and establish my own identity? How ought I to relate to the majority and minority cultures that surround me and of which I may be a part? CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 350 - Contemporary Classics in Political Philosophy: Justice, Liberty, and Equality This course focuses on John Rawls's Theory of Justice , arguably the greatest work in political philosophy since the 19th century. Attention will also be given to two important, but differing, responses to Rawls, in the work of Robert Nozick and Susan Okin. Topics for discussion will include: what is the nature of the just state? Can a just state guarantee both the liberty of its citizens and their equality? Which economic distributions are just? Is there a right to property, and if so what is its basis? What is the best life for human beings, and how far can a just state go in providing that life for its citizens? CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 353 - Ethics and Economics The course investigates the intersection of ethical and economic decision-making. The first part examines some of the core methodological issues at this intersection, including the positive/normative distinction, objectivity, explanation and evidence, and models of rationality. The second part critically examines these methodological issues in three practical areas: crime and firearms policy, prohibition economics and the drug war, and so-called \"freakonomics.\" CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 355 - Philosophy of Space and Time The course will cover such topics as whether space and time exist, how we know what the geometry of space and time is, whether any sense can be made of the claim that time has a direction, and the \"paradoxes\" of time travel. We will examine these questions in the context of both pre-relativistic and relativistic theories. The readings will range from historical figures, such as Newton, Leibniz and Mach, to contemporary work by both philosophers and physicists, including Hawking, Thorne and Sklar. This course does not require previous exposure to Special or General Relativity and will not require as a prerequisite technical skills that go beyond high school mathematics and physics, but the student is expected to be comfortable with algebraic and geometric reasoning. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 360 - Philosophy of Mind A philosophical treatment of consciousness (including sensation, mental imagery, and emotion) and intentionality (including mental representation and \"aboutness\"). Questions to be asked include: \"Is it possible to construct a computer which feels pain?\" \"What is the status of our folk psychological concepts concerning consciousness?\" \"Is intentionality the mark of the mental?\" and \"What is the relation between thought and language?\" Given in alternate years. 303CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 365 - Philosophy of Science We will look at a number of episodes in the history of science. Among the issues that will be addressed will be the following: When should we consider evidence as confirming a theory? What considerations should we use to decide between competing theories? Should we view our best theories as true or merely empirically adequate? Can there be a logic of scientific discovery? We will read works by philosophers and scientists including van Fraassen, Reichenbach, Feyerabend, Newton, and Galileo. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 370 - Philosophy of Language We will examine a number of recently proposed accounts of meaning, truth, and reference. Issues that will come up will be whether there could be a private language, what the role of mental content is, how we should understand metaphor, and whether truth is a redundant notion. Philosophers covered include Frege, Russell, Tarski, Quine, Putnam, Kripke, and Searle. Given in alternate years. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 375 - Theory of Knowledge This course will examine: (1) the theories of knowledge of such philosophers as Price, Russell, and Chisholm (\"Foundationalists\"), (2) some of their critics, such as Sellars and Quine, and (3) recent work in naturalized epistemology. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 380 - Wittgenstein Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) is a central figure in the two most important philosophical traditions of the twentieth century: First, the attempt early in the century to characterize language, thought and the world in terms of the newly available formalism of modern logic, and second, the attempt to show that any such formalization will fail to do justice to the rich complexity of language as a form of life, a form inseparable from the social and historical context from which it springs. We will examine two principal works, the Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus and the Philosophical Investigations . There will also be some treatment of the historical and philosophical context of Wittgenstein's work and life. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 385 - Metaphysics The course will focus on contemporary readings that raise some of the most fundamental issues in metaphysics. The following questions are among those that will be addressed: Can we make sense of the idea that we are free agents? Can we understand the concept of causation? Is there a compelling argument for the existence of God? Is there any sense to be made of the claim that some claims are true by necessity while others are only contingently true? Are there true mathematical claims?

After completion of the program, a physics student will have excellent analytical and problem-solving skills in addition 305to ample hands-on laboratory experience. The Physics major is excellent preparation for professional or graduate work in physics, engineering, and related fields. In addition, a physics major finds that he or she is an attractive applicant for medical, business, or law school, as well as having an excellent foundation for science teaching. In addition to the full spectrum of undergraduate coursework, the department offers many opportunities to participate in research projects both on and off campus. Qualified students may begin research projects as early as their first year. Current research activities in the department include experimental investigations in Astrophysics, Condensed Matter Physics, Plasma Physics, and Materials Science, theoretical investigations in Cosmology and Particle Physics, and theoretical and numerical investigations in complex systems. Departmental resources include well-equipped research and instructional laboratories, as well as laboratory space for qualified students to carry out independent investigations of their own. Many students have also participated in projects at nearby institutions such as the California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Students who wish to do advanced work in physics or engineering should complete the introductory physics sequence (Physics 106, 110, 120) as early as possible. These courses provide a foundation in both classical and modern physics. Fundamental understanding and procedures in analytical physics are stressed throughout. This sequence is recommended to all students who have an aptitude for scientific work and who are acquiring a strong background in mathematics, including an introduction to differential and integral calculus. Students with a strong high school physics background or a high score on the Physics AP examination may wish to consider Course Exemption by Examination, whereby the student can be exempted from some or all of the courses in the introductory sequence. Physics majors typically begin taking courses at the intermediate level by the end of Sophomore year, and are encouraged to complete required 300-level courses by the end of Junior year. This schedule prepares a student for the widest array of 260- and 360-series courses. Of special interest are the three series of physics courses numbered 160-169, 260-269, and 360-369. These courses cover special topics as well as subjects of active research interest within the Physics department. The 160 series is designed for non-science students interested in varying aspects of physical science. These courses have few prerequisites beyond algebra and trigonometry and many are open only to students who have not taken Physics 106, 110/115, 120/125, or their equivalent. The 260 series of courses is open to anyone who has completed Physics 120 or 125. The prerequisites for 360-series courses vary, but generally require physics beyond Physics 120 or 125. Requirements MAJOR: The major is designed to appeal to students who wish to prepare for professional or graduate work in physics as well as those who wish to study physics but have other career goals. The program for physics majors is composed of the Physics Foundation and one of the four Options listed below. Students can also supplement their programs by taking courses at the California Institute of Technology under the exchange program. Physics Foundation: All physics majors must complete a core of five physics courses called the Foundation. In addition to the three-term introductory sequence (Physics 106, 110 or 115, 306120), the Foundation includes a course in Modern Physics with laboratory (Physics 240) and a course in Thermal and Statistical Physics (Physics 250). Accompanying these physics courses must be work in mathematics including Multivariable Calculus (Math 212) and Linear Systems (Math 214). Options: In addition to the Foundation, all physics majors must complete one of the following Physics Options. Upon graduation, the student's transcript will list both the major (Physics) and the chosen Option. Some of the four Options require Physics Selectives, which are courses from the 260 or 360 series, or 300-level courses below 390 not otherwise required for the Option. Physics Option (24 units): Physics 310, 315, 316, 320, 330, 340 and four units of Physics Selectives. This option is recommended for students who wish a thorough background in physics and for those who wish to pursue professional or graduate work in physics or engineering. Mathematics Option (28 units): Physics 310, 320, four units of Physics Selectives and eight additional units from any other 300-level Physics courses below 390. Also required are at least eight units in Math or Computer Science numbered above 300 and below 397 (these courses must be in addition to those required math courses listed in the Foundation). This option is recommended for students who wish a broader mathematics or computer science background. Chemistry Option (32 units): Chemistry 120 or 130, 220, 221, and 240. Also required are Physics 310, 320, 330 and either Physics 340 or Chemistry 305. This option is recommended for students who wish a broader physical science background. Education Option (24 units): Physics 320 and eight units of Physics Selectives. Also required are Education 201, 205, and 340. Education 314 is highly recommended. This option is recommended for students who wish to pursue careers in secondary science education. Physics \"Capstone\": All physics majors must complete the Senior Seminar, Physics 490 and 491. Majors participating in an off-campus program during the Senior year may repeat 490 or 491 to satisfy this requirement. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: The comprehensive requirement for majors is met by completion of the year-long Senior Seminar (Physics 490/491) with a grade of C or better and by passing a comprehensive examination on the material covered in the Physics Foundation. WRITING REQUIREMENT: The Physics Department's portion of the College Writing Requirement can be satisfied with a passing evaluation of a student portfolio. The portfolio will consist of two items: one laboratory report from Modern Physics (Physics 240) and/or Advanced Laboratory (Physics 315/316), and one research report from Senior Physics Seminar (Physics 490/491). Students are encouraged to revise these reports before submitting the portfolio. Typical formats for the required writings will be presented in the related courses. The writing is expected to be clear, precise, and intelligible to someone who has completed the Physics Foundation. Proper spelling, grammar, and organization are essential. A student may submit a portfolio only once. The portfolio will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis by a departmental committee which will meet each semester to consider portfolios received by 307the last day of classes. Failing students may fulfill the departmental writing requirement by obtaining a grade of C or better in Writing and Rhetoric 401, Writing Across the Curriculum. Students who would like to improve their writing skills in advance of taking Physics 240, 315, 316, 490 or 491 may elect to take Writing and Rhetoric 401 in their Junior or Senior year; a grade of C or better will satisfy the Physics Department's portion of the College Writing Requirement. The portfolio is normally submitted at the end of the semester when the student completes the first semester of 490/491. The latest students can submit a passing portfolio is the last day of classes in their penultimate semester. Students who fail to do so must enroll in English Writing 401 in their final semester and pass with a grade of C or better. If English Writing 401 is not offered in the student's final semester, another English Writing course may be substituted with the approval of the department. MINOR: The Physics courses of the Foundation and four units of Physics Selectives. COMBINED PLAN IN LIBERAL ARTS AND ENGINEERING: The program for majors provides for entrance into the Combined Plan Programs (3-2) at Columbia University and the California Institute of Technology. Students interested in engineering should consult the combined plan page for details of these programs. HONORS: Senior physics majors with an overall grade point average of 3.25 are permitted to present an oral and written thesis on their research for College Honors consideration at graduation. See the Honors Program and consult the department chair for details.

Our mission in the department of Politics is to provide our gifted and diverse students with an understanding of politics, government, and public policy to prepare them to become well informed, curious, and engaged leaders in their communities, in their societies, and in our increasingly complex, interdependent, and pluralistic world. Graduates of the department have found this major provides an excellent basis for careers in law, education, business, public service, international affairs, politics, and media. The department strongly encourages each of its majors to pursue a variety of off-campus and community-based learning opportunities. The College has programs in Los Angeles, Sacramento, New York, and overseas. Its students regularly hold internships in all of these locations-in government agencies, in public interest organizations, in the media, in business, and in law. In addition, the department provides financial support for student research during the academic year and summer. The Reath/McKelvey and Anderson Fellowships have supported students working on a wide variety of projects in the United States and abroad. The Politics department also encourages its students to pursue such research opportunities as the Undergraduate Research Fellowships for summer research in partnership with a faculty member and the Research Abroad fellowships through International Programs. Requirements MAJOR: The major consists of one core course (Politics 101); two International Relations courses from Politics or DWA. the Department's course in social science Research Methods (Politics 103); and at least one course (4 units) from each of the following sub-fields: American 317Politics and Public Policy; Political Theory; Public Law; Comparative Politics and Area Studies. In addition, Majors must take two other courses (8 units) in the department for a minimum of ten (40 units). Economics 101, at a minimum, is strongly recommended for all Politics majors and so is Psychology 223 and/or 110 (Intergroup Dialogue). No course will count toward the Politics major that the student takes CR/NC. Majors must also take a Junior Writing Seminar that will focus both on a research paper and the skills of oral presentation and making a persuasive political argument. MINOR: At least five courses (20 units) within the department, or courses accepted by the department in lieu of its own. Of these five courses, three (12 units) must be advanced courses taken from different sub-fields. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Politics will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's writing requirement by successfully completing a writing seminar in their junior year. 300-level Politics, DWA, or UEP courses except 397 have been approved for meeting this requirement. Students should familiarize themselves with the departmental requirement at the time of declaring the major. See the Writing Program for additional information. THE SENIOR YEAR: All politics majors must complete a Comprehensive Seminar in the spring of their senior year. Students read and discuss political science journal articles that raise interesting questions for the field, combine theory with empirical data, and serve as models for their own senior thesis. Simultaneously, each student is asked to develop a senior thesis on a topic in one of the subdisciplines of the major, demonstrating theoretical sophistication, an ability to find and evaluate sources of data, to develop and test hypotheses, and to argue a thesis. Papers are subjected to peer review and to a rigorous drafting process. All seniors are required to submit a proposal for their thesis by the end of September in their Senior year. These proposals should state the research problem, demonstrate a significant command of the relevant bibliography, and include a tentative outline of major components in the study. HONORS: We encourage highly motivated students to pursue Department Honors. They qualify for this program by achieving a 3.25 grade point average overall and a 3.5 grade point average in courses counting toward the Politics major. Only under extraordinary circumstances will the Politics faculty members approve a petition to have this 3.5 grade point average waived. Students interested in pursuing Honors should complete the courses required for the Politics major by the end of Fall Semester.

Courses American Politics and Public Policy 318The following courses are accepted for Politics credit in the American Politics and Public Policy subfield: UEP 204 and 301. 106 - LA Power: Politics, Policy and Justice in the City While we often locate the study of urban politics within the formal governmental arena, examining the elected officials who operate there, other actors hold a great deal of sway over the allocation of resources and power. This course will examine institutional actors who have had and continue to have an impact on politics in Los Angeles in particular. By exploring the role of colleges and universities (eg; Occidental College), museums, non-profit organizations, media outlets, business associations, and trade unions, we will attempt to develop a broader and more comprehensive understanding of how power is exercised and by whom. How have such institutions impacted geography, demography, and land use? What role have they played in electing and defeating political office holders? How do these institutional actors balance, share, and/or compete for power? How much power do they and should they have? Same as UEP 106 202 - Gender and American Politics This course examines how gender roles influence social position, political engagement, and allocation of power and resources in American society. Students will investigate why masculinity is often an attribute of those in power, and why \"femaleness\" correlates with disadvantages in affluence, value in society, and public policies. Students will also determine what changes in the conditions of men's and women's lives might change the gender dynamics of politics. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 203 - American Politics Behavior and Psychology This course will present an interdisciplinary approach to the study of American political behavior. While some material that will be covered addresses older issues and topics, emphasis will be based on more recent developments in the field of psychology, and highlight concepts applicable to political behavior in the United States. The course will draw on recent work in the cognitive neurosciences, behavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology and personality studies to examine existing problems, issues and questions in American politics. The goal is to investigate the extent to which these models and methods can help to further inform or develop the study of American politics. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 206 - Race and American Politics An exploration of the historical and continuing significance of race in the American political system. The relevance and role of race in shaping political institutions, public opinion, political behavior, and public policy will be examined.

Topics include: What factors lead people to participate in social movements and political protest? Why do certain historical periods seem to feature large-scale protest and upheaval, while others do not? How are social and political movements related to mainstream politics, such as elections, political parties, voting, and lobbying? What is the role of leaders, activists, and organizers? What strategies and tactics do movements employ? What does \"success\" mean for a protest movement? Do protest movements make a difference in achieving more social justice and changing public policy?

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 240 - Community Law Internship The goal of the Community Law Internship is to provide students with a practical understanding of public interest law. The Community Law Internship must be taken simultaneously with Politics 241, which integrates theoretical aspects of social change, activism, organizing, and public interest law practice. The Community Law Internship allows students to learn through direct experience about the practice of public interest law in Los Angeles, as well as deeply explore issues of race, class, economic equity, and social justice. Each student will work with a community-based legal organization engaged in public interest law practice for approximately 12-15 hours each week. The unique approach of integrating Politics 240 and Politics 241 takes advantage of Occidental faculty expertise and the wide-range of community-based educational opportunities available in Los Angeles, as well as promotes a high level of engagement in the courses' curriculum. Prerequisite: Instructor permission Corequisite: POLS 241 260 - Work and Labor in America Sooner or later, we all have to work-that is, get a job. Some people even have \"careers.\" And some people are lucky enough to consider the work they do a \"vocation\" - something that is both intrinsically rewarding and useful to society. Work occupies our best waking hours. For most people, the nature of our work determines the quality of our daily lives. This course will 320focus on the varieties of work (in different industries and occupations); how people experience their work on the job; how society shapes the work we do; how work shapes our family lives, our friendships, our health, and our self-esteem; and how the nature of work is changing in our increasingly global economy dominated by large corporations and sophisticated technology. We will look at the future of work in the context of our changing economy, values, and technologies. We will pay particular attention to how organized groups ? labor unions, consumer groups, business associations, and others have influenced the nature of work. We will also explore how government action (public policy) has shaped how our economy works and the rules governing the work we do. These include such matters as wages, hours, flex time, family leave, job security, workplace health and safety, the quality of goods and services, and workplace participation. We will explore such questions as: What makes work satisfying or unsatisfying? How have such have increasing problems of low-wage work and even \"sweatshops\" in a wealthy society? How do such factors as education, skill, race, and gender influence the kinds of work we do and how we experience our work? What are the chances of getting injured or sick because of working in a specific job? How do people balance work/career and family responsibilities? Do people experience work the same way in other democratic countries? What can be done to make the world of work better? CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 261 - Politics and Protest The course will deal with the dilemmas and challenges of engaging in politics both \"inside\" and \"outside\" the system.

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: ASIA and REGIONAL FOCUS Minority Politics in Latin America . This course will examine a wide range of issues regarding race, ethnicity, and gender in Latin America. It will begin by exploring the basic sociological, political and cultural concepts of race, ethnicity, and gender with emphasis on how they are used in the region. Indeed, race and ethnicity have taken on special meanings in Latin America and much of the course will focus on how that came about and how race is manifested. By special meanings, we mean that comparative race and ethnicity are distinct from other regions, particularly the United States, which most students will be familiar with. Thus, comparisons to the United States will be emphasized in the course, as will comparisons across countries within Latin America, in particular Mexico, Brazil, and Cuba. The course will cover populations of African and indigenous origins. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: LATIN AMERICA and REGIONAL FOCUS Everyday Forms of Political Resistance. This course adopts a more expansive definition of the \"political\" to understand the often-overlooked \"politics of the people.\" To understand political behavior among subordinated groups, the course uses the work of political theorists, James Scott and Michael Hanchard, who argue that the politics of subordinated groups is best understood as neither overt collective defiance nor complete hegemonic compliance, but as everyday forms of political resistance. Topics to be considered will include: squatter movements in South Asia, participation in the black market, female artistic expression, and hip-hop movements in the U.S. as manifestations of everyday political resistance. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS Dilemmas of Democracy. Has the \"Third Wave\" of democratization ended? Will democracy 325continue to be the model for the future? This course will look at the dramatic increase in the number of democracies worldwide over the last thirty years, and at case studies that illustrate the political and economic factors behind the increasing number of \"illiberal,\" \"populist\" and semi-authoritarian democracies; the impact of gridlock and corruption in contemporary democratic systems, including the United States; and the challenges democracies are facing in integrating formerly marginalized populations, including women, poor and the indigenous.

It is intended as an introduction for students who already have some background in the field of international relations and are interested in exploring international economic relations at a deeper level. The course covers major theoretical, empirical, and policy perspectives. The theme to be explored in this course is \"National Interest vs. Global Governance?\" - that is, we will explore the theory and history of international political economy as an extension of national interest and an arena for the development of global governance, and the question of whether or not these two dimensions of international political economy are compatible or competitive with each other. The first part of the course will cover the basic concepts and theoretical foundations of IPE. The focus is on core theoretical principles and approaches. The goal is to understand how theory is framed and \"works,\" the potential inferences of this theory, and the issues of contention within the field. The second part of the course draws on the theoretical foundations to examine a set of specific international economic issue arenas, including international trade, finance and economic development. SAME AS DWA 220 233 - International Security This course is an introduction to international security and strategic studies. This field is fundamentally about both the use of force by and violent conflict among states and non-state actors. The course will be guided by general theoretical questions regarding security: How does violent conflict, or competitions shaped by the lurking possibili\u00acty of such conflict, affect international relations and individual societies? How has the role of violent conflict in international politics changed since the end of World War II? What is the nature of security today? These general questions will frame explorations of more specific strategic questions. Such questions will include: How do states and non-state actors use force to persuade their enemies to take (coercion) or refrain from taking (deterrence) a particular action? How can nations best prepare to prevent violent conflicts or to win them if they occur? What has determined success and failure, the intensity, duration, and consequences of military action? We will have a particular focus on emerging transnational security issues, intra-state security, and the relationship among security, development and state failure. Pursuing answers to these questions will require an approach that integrates theory, history and current events. Same as 327DWA 250 235 - United States Foreign Relations This course focuses on the evolution of U.S. foreign policy in recent Administrations, with special emphasis on the post-Cold War period.

Pursuing effective change, particularly in today's complex world, requires creative collaborative efforts to identify and implement solutions to achieve a more radically participatory democracy. Rebellious Lawyering has a unique linked course design between theoretical and experiential academic experiences. Seminar (Politics 241): Students participate in a weekly seminar, where readings related to law, social change, movements activism, and public interest law practice are discussed. Community Law Internship (Politics 240): Students will work weekly as law clerks for community-based public interest legal service organizations. Speaker Series: Rebellious Lawyering will bring rebellious advocates and lawyers from throughout Los Angeles to discuss their work. Prerequisite: permission of instructor. Co-requisite: POLS 240 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 242 - Law and Social Change Lawyers who advocate for the disadvantaged and underrepresented communities for a more equal, sustainable and participatory society are practicing in a new context today. These lawyers use different techniques and play different roles than those of the litigation impact lawyers of the 1960s or 1970s. In this course students will explore the role of law and the legal profession in pursuing broader social causes across the political spectrum, such as the pursuit of civil rights for racial minorities or the effort to create a fundamental right to education. Throughout the course students will be required to assess the diverse ways in which the law and activism can be used in a context for social change. Students will be asked to critically examine the role of lawyers in social change, and question whether and how lawyers have been effective agents of social change in American society. Topics in the course examined may include: the competing definitions of social change lawyering and the relevance of such definitions; the history of American law and social change; the limits of legal tools in social change; progressive/conservative ideologies in social change lawyering; and the role of lawyers in social mobilization. Recognizing the unique laboratory of Los Angeles in movements for social change, the course will pay particular attention to contemporary campaigns and movements in Los Angeles.

Santa Cruz, M.A. Cornell, Ph.D Cornell Psychology Psychology concerns the study and understanding of thoughts, feelings, and behavior. The courses offered by the department are directed toward the study and appreciation of the complex factors that influence behavior and covert experience in people and other animals. Psychology attempts to describe these factors with objectivity and responsibility. Studying psychology has a twofold function: (1) to further the intellectual development of the student; (2) to enhance preparation for such professions as clinical practice, teaching, research, social science, medicine, law, social work, and organizational consulting and leadership. Requirements MAJOR : Students who have successfully completed Introduction to Psychology and Psychological Methods may apply to major in Psychology and receive credit toward the major for upper division coursework. Twelve courses (48 units) are required for the major. Though not strictly sequenced, the major is tiered, with an overview of the field and scientific methods (Departmental Core) preparatory to courses that survey diverse subdisciplines (Fundamentals courses within four Domains) or focus on crosscutting explorations (Specialized and Integrative Themes), which in turn are preparatory to advanced study (a 400-level course in a Domain or Specialized and Integrative Themes). The requirements are: the Departmental Core (Psychology 101or 102, 200 and 201 with grades C- or better); six courses from the four Domains, including at least one course from each Domain (24 units); one of these six courses must be an Advanced Study 400 level course; and three additional courses (12 units). Psychology 200 (Methods in Psychological Science) is a prerequisite for some 300 and 400-level 4-unit classes in Psychology. Students anticipating graduate work are encouraged to take more than the minimum number of required courses to enhance the breadth and depth of their exploration of psychology; they are strongly encouraged to become involved in research and to take Psychology 498 (Practicum). Transfer students and those who anticipate participating in any of the College's abroad programs should plan their schedules with major requirements and their accompanying prerequisites in mind. Majors are expected to select one of the full-time faculty members from the department as an academic advisor and to consult with her or him regarding their course program. NEUROSCIENCE EMPHASIS Psychology majors with a special interest in neuroscience may declare a Neuroscience emphasis. Fourteen courses (56 units) are required for this emphasis. This emphasis combines coursework across the broad domains of psychology with specific courses in the Biological Bases Domain and neuroscience-relevant coursework in other fields. The requirements are: the Departmental Core (Psychology 102, 200 and 201 with grades C- or better); two courses in the Biological Bases Domain (Psyc 322/322L, Psyc 403); one course 335from each of the other three Domains (12 units); an original empirical project (Psyc 497); a Cells-to-Society seminar; and four neuroscience-related courses (16 units) in Biology, Cognitive Science, and Kinesiology. Together, the courses selected outside of Psychology must meet the following criteria: (a) at least one course focused at the cellular/molecular level, (b) Biology 115 or 130, (c) at least one 200- or 300-level course in Biology, and (d) at least two courses at the 300-level. Either Bio 333 or CogSci 320, but not both, will count toward the emphasis. Courses should be selected in consultation with the academic advisor. Students intending to pursue graduate work or health professions should consult their advisor and/or the Health Professions Advisor about relevant course selections in and beyond this emphasis (e.g. in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics). Credit for courses taken elsewhere: The department will apply toward the psychology major most broad-based courses in Introduction to Psychology taken at accredited colleges and universities. Introduction to Psychology will be waived for students with Advanced Placement test scores of four or five on the Psychology examination. In addition the department will accept a maximum of three upper division psychology courses taken at other institutions and passed with grades of C or better toward the completion of a Psychology major. Please consult with your academic advisor and the department chair for course approval. WRITING REQUIREMENT : The Psychology department has elected to take a \"writing-across- the-curriculum\" approach to the third year writing requirement. The department has selected an approach that is both evaluative and educational. Students will submit a portfolio containing writing samples from 300- and/or 400 level courses taken for credit toward the Psychology major to their academic advisor by April 1 of the junior year. The portfolio will include at least twenty finished text pages, including (1) a research paper (empirical or library) of at least eight text pages, and (2) evidence of mastery of APA publication style. One writing sample in the portfolio must be (3) on a topic that required integration of information from two or more subdisciplines, and one writing sample in the portfolio must be (4) on a topic that required understanding of the variation between individuals, groups, or species relevant to social justice and/or wellbeing. The advisor will assess the work. If the portfolio does not pass after an attempt at revision, the student will be informed that s/he will need to take and pass with B- or better a writing intensive course in the senior year (Psych 395A, 497, or 498; other courses by petition). See the Writing Program for additional information. SENIOR COMPREHENSIVE : Senior majors must take and pass a comprehensive examination early in the spring semester of their senior year. Seniors who will have the degree conferred in December may take the exam in the fall. Majors electing the Neuroscience emphasis will in addition complete a comprehensive project focusing on problems in neuroscience (an empirical research project or a literature review culminating with a colloquium presentation); both options require registration in Psychology 497 and an APA-style paper evaluated by two faculty readers. INTERDEPARTMENTAL MAJOR IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE: See Department listing.

To this end, courses explore the literature, history, thought, ethics, institutions, and practices of some of the world's major religious traditions. Special attention is given to clarifying the role that religions have played in the cultural and social worlds of which they are a part, and to the contribution which they make to the development of the intellectual and ethical life of their societies. Attention is also given to the interaction and confrontation between religion and other dimensions of culture. The major in Religious Studies provides a firm grounding in the liberal arts. It is well suited to students who wish to develop skill in critical thinking, and who may anticipate specialized training leading to professional careers in law, medicine, business, social services, government, or religious vocations. It also provides effective preparation for students who intend to pursue graduate work in the humanities, theology, or social science. Requirements 346MAJOR: A total of 40 units in the department of Religious Studies is required for the major. The major in Religious Studies is structured to accommodate the wide variety of interests among students of religion. Students will design a personalized program, working collaboratively with an advisor in the department, to match interests and objectives. Some majors may opt for a program that is broadly conceived, seeking exposure to a variety of religions through a variety of methods and in comparative perspective. Others may choose to specialize in one religious tradition, or in one approach to the study of religion such as the historical, sociological, philosophical, or psychological. All program designs must provide for diversity of content and methods in accordance with the department's curriculum. After working closely with a departmental advisor, each student will present his or her program design to the department for discussion. In keeping with the goals of a liberal arts education, students are encouraged to take courses in other disciplines that have a profound bearing on the study of religion, such as languages, history, and area studies, among others. Seniors enroll in RS 490: Senior Seminar for work on their comprehensive projects. MAJOR WITH INTERDISCIPLINARY CONCENTRATION: Interdisciplinary work in Religious Studies allows a student to pursue the study of religion through the methods and approaches of one particular academic discipline. For example, students may choose to study the presence of religion in literature, drawing upon the resources of faculty at Occidental who teach literature, or some may opt to study religion within the context of philosophy, psychology, or sociology. Students may also choose Occidental's area study programs as their focus, studying religion within the contexts of American Studies, Asian Studies, or Women's Studies, etc. The interdisciplinary major is designed by consultation between the student and his or her advisor, in some cases calling upon faculty in other departments for assistance. 48 units are required for this major, 32 of which are to be taken within the department of Religious Studies and 16 in another department. MINOR: 20 units in Religious Studies which provide for diversity of content and methodology. Courses should be chosen in consultation with the chair of the department and must be submitted in writing for departmental approval. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Religious Studies will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's college-wide writing requirement by successfully completing the Senior Seminar and the comprehensive requirement. Students should familiarize themselves with the departmental requirement at the time of declaring the major. See the Writing Program and consult the department chair for additional information. SENIOR COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: In their senior year, majors in Religious Studies are required to complete a comprehensive research/writing project that studies some dimension of religion in depth. Students participate in a Senior Seminar in the fall semester and are guided individually by faculty in both the formulation and completion of this project which represents the culmination of students' work. HONORS: Department majors may qualify for College Honors. Interested students should see the Honors Program and consult the department chair for details. Courses 130 - Judaism as a Religious Civilization 347A comprehensive survey of Judaism from the earliest times to the modern era. Religious ideas, institutions and practices are studied against the background of the changing historical circumstances which affected the Jewish people. Through analysis of representative texts from the Bible, the Talmud, and medieval philosophical and mystical literature, the dynamic interplay between Judaism and the surrounding cultures is analyzed. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL PRE-1800 and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 140 - Introduction to Hinduism This course introduces Hinduism in its various historical contexts. We will examine in particular the formation and transformation of the tradition--from the ancient Vedic hymns to the mainstream Hindu texts of the early medieval period. Using a variety of genres, we will survey, for example, Hindu notions of divinity, ritual, liberation, identity and authority. This pre-modern textual perspective will be juxtaposed to modern ethnographic accounts, and brought into conversation with the colonial and post- colonial debates that have shaped \"Hinduism\" as a modern \"World Religion\". CORE REQUIREMENT MET: ASIA ? PRE-1800 145 - Introduction to American Religious Movements A survey of twentieth century religious movements in the United States, with a focus on the intersection of religion, culture, and society. Often using primary documents, we will study movements such as the Social Gospel, Fundamentalism, Jewish Reconstruction, Pentecostalism, Zen Buddhism, and the Religious Right for their historical, social, and theological significance. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 150 - Introduction to Islam This course explores basic ideas and practices of the Islamic tradition with attention to the socio-historical context of their articulation and reception. Students will examine the historical emergence of Islam, focusing on the life and example of the prophet Muhammad and the spread of Islam under the early formation of the caliphate. Drawing on this historical work the course will proceed to an investigation of core practices and theological concepts. This, in turn, will serve to ground the study of some ways in which Islamic principles and practices have been articulated and institutionalized in the areas of jurisprudence, philosophy and mysticism, art and architecture, gender and sexuality, and politics - including contemporary Islamist political thought. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 160 - Introduction to Asian Religions This course provides an introduction to the primary religious traditions of South and East Asia. Particular focus is placed upon the religions of India, Tibet, China, and Japan. These include various forms of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, Taoism, and Shinto, among others. Historical, sociological, and philosophical dimensions of each are presented through lecture, film, discussion, and field trips. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND EAST ASIA PRE-1800 348175 - The World of the New Testament Survey of the major books of the New Testament. This course will set the books of the New Testament within their social, political, and religious contexts, considering how such texts represented, as well as shaped, various forms of Christianity. The course will also examine the process and criteria of canonization in light of these diverse beliefs and practices. Moreover, special attention will be paid to the various scholarly approaches to the study of early Christian literature. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL PRE-1800 190 - History of Early Christianity Early Christianity from the first to the fifth century was a complex and variegated phenomenon. We shall investigate the variety of early Christianities in this time period, looking at texts primarily from North Africa, Asia Minor, and Rome. An investigation of the diversity of early Christianity in this time will allow us to think about early Christian struggles over authority and identity, both within Christian communities and between Christian communities and their neighbors, and to challenge categories such as orthodoxy and heresy. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL PRE-1800 197 - Independent Study in Religious Studies Prerequisite: permission of instructor. 2 or 4 units 200 - Turkey: Then and Now An interdisciplinary program that aims to orient students to the significance of Turkey from a range of academic perspectives. In the semester course, students enagage in an historical study of the peoples and culture of the region from antiquity to the present. Specifically, we study the Greeks and Persians of the Classical period, Romans of the Roman period, Christians of Late Antiquity and Byzantium, and Turks from the Ottoman period to Atat\u00fcrk's reform and the modern Republic, paying attention to the ways in which these groups cooperated, competed, and absorbed ideas and traditions from each other. In addition to the historical study facilitated by the instructor, students are expected to conduct independent research projects on an aspect of Turkish history/culture that relates to their major/minor and their unique intellectual interests. At the end of the semester, participants in the program will spend a few weeks in Turkey where they deepen their understanding of Turkish history and culture. Our field study will take us to the ancient capitol of Istanbul, to the modern capitol of Ankara, to the interior of the country (Cappadocia, Konya, Hierapolis, Aphrodisias), then over to the Aegean coast and up the Gallipoli. On site, students will learn from the expert guidance of Prof. Upson-Saia, from a Turkish guide, and from one another as they present their research findings a site related to their topic. Prerequisite: instructor permission; application process CORE REQUIREMENT MET: PRE-1800 ? INTERCULTURAL 210 - Asian Religions and the West The study of religion has deep roots in debates that arose as part of the European encounter with Asia during the early modern and colonial periods. This course focuses on how western 349depictions of Asian religions-especially Hinduism and the varieties of Buddhism in South and East Asia-have both shaped those religions in modernity, and been appropriated by them. It also attends to the transformations and continuities in Western notions of Asian religion, including the recent popularity of Yoga and meditation in modern American culture. The course serves as a critical introduction to some of the key issues in the comparative study of religion, including the definition of \"Religion\" and the discursive relationships between \"religions.\" CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 215 - Pilgrimage and Sacred Space in South Asia This course examines the practice of pilgrimage as a pan- Asian phenomenon. It focuses especially on the religious traditions of India (Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism), but also traces how these traditions have spread, through pilgrimage, to Tibet, East and Southeast Asia, and how their pilgrimage practices have changed in the process. Using premodern and contemporary sources, we will investigate such topics as: relic worship; the role of myth, biography, and landscape in the creation and discovery of pilgrimage sites; pilgrimage networks; sacred spaces and political power; pilgrimage vs. travel; and sacred space in cyberspace. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: ASIA 220 - Karma, Cures, and Misfortune in Hinduism This course uses texts and ethnographic data to examine the practices for alleviating or removing misfortune in medieval and contemporary Hinduism. Covering a range of topics, including popular theories of karma, temple worship, tantra, sorcery, possession, pilgrimage and astrological healing, we will explore the variety of techniques available in modern \"popular\" Hinduism, as well as consider their historical antecedents in medieval narrative and ritual sources. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: ASIA ? PRE-1800 225 - Sufism This course provides an in-depth introduction to the traditions of Islamic mysticism. Students will explore the core teachings and practices of Sufism through the literary, artistic and philosophical expressions of the great saints and masters of the tradition including figures like Rumi, ibn Arabi, Sohrawardi, Mulla Sadra and al-Attar. We will situate Sufi thought and practice within broader Islamic thought and practice while attending to the unique modes in which Islamic mysticism has been institutionalized and transmitted. Prerequisites: RELS 150 or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 230 - Modern and Post Modern Jewish Thoughts A study of the major issues in modern Jewish thought with special emphasis on the impact of modernity on Jewish tradition, faith, and communal life. Major topics will be the ongoing debates about the nature of God, revelation and authority, and the efforts redefine Judaism in the wake of the profound historical transformations of our era. Special consideration will be 350given to the efforts to come to terms with the meaning of the Holocaust, the creation of the state of Israel, and the emergence of feminism. Various religious and secular ideologies will be studied, including Orthodoxy, Conservatism, Reconstructionism, Reform, Zionism, and Jewish socialism. The major thinkers considered include Buber, Heschel, Kaplan, Soloveitchik, Ahad Ha-am, and others. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 232 - Ancient Israel and the Jewish Bible A study of the development of the religion of ancient Israel and its expression in the Hebrew Bible. Special emphasis will be placed on the emergence of the central ideas of Biblical religion which formed the foundation for early Judaism, and, in time, of Christianity and Islam. In addition to close reading of selected Biblical texts in translation, attention will be paid to the historical context in which ancient Israel lived and to the findings of modern critical scholarship and archeology. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA/MIDDLE EAST ? PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 237 - The Holocaust: Historical and Religious Perspectives An exploration of the historical and religious dimensions of the Holocaust, the Nazi attempt to annihilate the Jewish population of Europe during WWII. Historical documents, literature, and film will be used to examine the forces which created the Holocaust, and the responses to it, including silence, denial, and the search for religious meaning by Jews and Christians. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 240 - Religion and Social Reform This course explores the dynamic relationship between religion and social reform in 19th- century and early 20th-century America. We will examine religious traditions as they influenced and were altered by American society and culture in transition and upheaval. The primary focus will be evangelical Protestant traditions, with some attention to American Catholic and American Jewish traditions as well. Four major areas of social reform will frame the course: the abolition of slavery, the struggle for women's rights, labor and industrial conflicts, and the social gospel reforms of the progressive era. We will use a variety of historical, literary and sociological texts to develop new perspectives on this important period of American history. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 242 - Environmental Ethics and Religion An exploration of the relationship between religion and environmental ethics. How do various world religions view the natural world and what role do they propose for human beings in nature? What is the history of environmental ethics and how does religion figure in that history? How are religious traditions such as Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Native American Spirituality and Taoism rethinking their environmental views, especially in light of emergent ecofeminism? 245 - African American Religious Traditions A study of the religious traditions of the African diaspora in North America. We shall investigate 351the role of religion in Black culture, and chart the development of the mainline Black Church. Islam, religious traditions from the Caribbean Islands, and new religions among African Americans will also be studied. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 250 - Interpreting Religion: Multiple Approaches The academic discipline of Religious Studies is focused around a subject of study, rather than a uniform methodology (unlike the disciplines of History, Economics, Sociology, etc.). For this reason, scholars in the field approach their work with many different methodological perspectives and tools; they are historians, sociologists, philosophers, anthropologists, theologians, and ethicists. The purpose of this course is to orient students to this broad landscape of the academic study of religion. By reading and analyzing a range of contemporary books and articles that illustrate the latest trends in the field, students will compare diverse approaches to the study of religion, assessing the value and limitations of each. Prerequisite: one previous Religious Studies course. 251 - What is Enlightenment? This course takes Immanuel Kant's question, \"What is enlightenment?\" as the basis for a cross- cultural, comparative exploration of the highest aspirations, the transformative ideals that have emerged at important moments in human history. We will study the axial age visions of enlightenment in Plato, Buddha, and St. Paul, and place those in relation to modern and contemporary ideals from Kant and Nietzsche to Gandhi and Foucault, continually rethinking and posing the question: Who or what should I/we become? CORE REQUIREMENT MET: GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 260 - Buddhist Thought from India to Japan This course focuses on a variety of interests within Buddhist philosophy, including views on time, space and causality, human understanding and knowledge, the ideals of human life, morality and ethics, as well as overall worldview. The course provides instruction in the practice of reading Buddhist texts in translation from Indian, Tibetan, Chinese, and Japanese originals. Lecture presentations, discussions, field trips, and philosophical research projects are significant components of the course format. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND EAST ASIA PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 270 - Islamic Thought This course is designed to provide an introduction to Islamicate philosophy and theology beginning with its early articluation in the 9th century CE and following its transformations through the 12th century CE. Students will explore the central metaphysical, moral, and political problems of this tradition as elaborated by its foremost thinkers - for example, al Kindi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Rushd (Averros), al-Ghazali, al-Farabi, and Nasr Khosrow. Special attention will be paid to the appropriation of Ancient Persian and Greek thought, as well as to how the Islamic tradition came to influence later Occidental, Christian, and Jewish thought. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND EAST ASIA PRE-1800 352280 - The Concept of Freedom: Issues in the Humanities Our experience of freedom is riddled with contradictions. The effort to reliably predict or causally explain not just the natural world but our every decision and action permeates contemporary life. From physics through the social sciences, the belief in our capacity for mathematical prediction and causal explanation is increasingly dominant, so much so that we simply take it for granted. And yet, the idea of human freedom persists. It too is taken for granted -- not only in our daily lives where we continue to act as if we chose and decide freely, but also in our politics where it is championed and proclaimed. Nowhere is this more true than in the Arts and Humanities where freedom is a fundamental principle. But as Socrates would ask--do we even know what we mean when we say 'freedom'? Have we seriously examined our ideas of freedom in light of our equally strong faith in prediction and determinate causal explanation? This course seeks to carry out that examination and to cultivate a more critical and well-founded concept of freedom. 281 - Religion and Politics This course will explore aspects of the complex theoretical and practical relationships between religion and politics ranging from the most abstract kinds of questions regarding the very ideas of 'the religious' and 'the political' to the scrutiny of very specific, particular practices, statements, and conflicts. Possible themes and questions that may be the focus of the course include: the debates regarding the role of religion in establishing political legitimacy and authority; understanding the theological roots of core concepts of political philosophy. How has violence (war, torture, martyrdom, punishment) been understood, appropriated, deployed, and resisted in religious practice and discourse in relation to politics and the state? What is 'the secular'? CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 285 - Contemporary Religious Thought An examination of religious thought emerging out of the philosophical projects that declared the \"death of God\" and the \"end of metaphysics.\" Following a careful study of key philosophical and theological concepts, students will analyze both the critiques levied against these concepts and formulations of post-metaphysical religiosity ('A/theology,' 'Death of God Theology'). Possible authors to be studied include Heidegger, Bataille, Benjamin Derrida, Robert Scharlemann, and Mark Taylor. Prerequisite: one Religious Studies course. 290 - Banned Books: Apocrypha Survey of early Christian texts that were not included in the New Testament. The modern-day New Testament represents only a portion of the literature-gospels, acts, epistles, and apocalypses-available to early Christians. Although the \"apocryphal\" texts were eventually rejected by church officials, they were quite important in shaping a variety of early Christian beliefs and practices. This course will investigate the role these texts played in early Christian communities and will examine why they were rejected by certain Christians and beloved by others. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL PRE-1800 295 - Topics in Religious Studies 353The contemplative Life and Social Justice Over the course of religious history, some have chosen lives of contemplation and prayer, seeking to explore religion in its depth dimension. This course examines the lives of Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton, who in 20th century America, fashioned new forms of the contemplative life, often characterized as much by engagement with the world as by retreat from it. Day pursued social justice through the founding of the Catholic Worker Movement and the running of Hospitality Houses for the urban poor over several decades. Merton, a Trappist monk, took vows of silence, but voiced concerns for justice and peace through his popular writings as a religious thinker and social critic; he fostered interreligious dialogue among Christians and Buddhists in Asia and elsewhere. We will review the history of contemplation in the Western traditon and ponder the meaning and value of contemplation for post-modern lives. We will read extensive works by and about Day and Merton to understand how they each led lives of contemplation while tending to the world swirling around them. 315 - Hindu Ritual in Theory and Practice This course is an introduction to the study of ritual in Indian Religions. It aims at bringing modern theories of \"Ritual\" (as a cross-cultural anthropological category) into conversation with the primary sources of the Vedic-Hindu tradition-a religious tradition which devoted immense intellectual resources to the generation of rites and language about ritual. The course thus offers an advanced introduction to ritual theory in Anthropology and Religious Studies, while also engaging the central ritual categories of Indian Religion (such as sacrifice, worship CORE REQUIREMENT MET: ASIA 340 - American Religion: Communities and Movements A study of selected religious communities and movements in American history. The social cultural and religious purposes and impacts of groups such as the Shakers, the Native American Church, the Hasidim, Pentecostalism, and Mexican American religion will be explored. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 344 - History of Religion at Occidental College This small advanced course is set to research the history of religion at Occidental. Topics include the College's Presbyterian founding and disaffiliation; the development and activities of campus chaplaincies, ministries and student religious organizations; and the academic study of religion at Occidental. Exploration of the religious climate on campus over time will be a major focus. After instruction in research methods, students will be assigned projects including archival searches, interviews for oral history, and the writing of narratives of various eras of religious history at Occidental. Prerequisite: one Religious Studies course. Open to Juniors and Seniors only. 345 - American Spiritualities This advanced seminar will investigate the meanings and traditions behind the popular American claim, \"I'm spiritual but not religious.\" What is spirituality in the American context? How and why does spirituality overtake religion in appeal and status? What historical features of American culture and society promote contemporary issues of spirituality? Prerequisite: one 354previous Religious Studies course. 347 - Religion and the United States Supreme Court An intensive review of landmark cases concerning the establishment and free exercise of religion clauses of the first amendment. We will study the history and varying interpretation of these clauses. Students will focus on mastering the arguments presented in landmark cases concerning sabbath observance, religion and the schools, ritual animal sacrifice, ritual drug use, and religious displays in public places, among others. Open to juniors and seniors only. 351 - \"Good Sex\": History of Christian Sexual Ethics An intensive review of landmark cases concerning the establishment and free exercise of religion clauses of the first amendment. We will study the history and varying interpretation of these clauses. Students will focus on mastering the arguments presented in landmark cases concerning sabbath observance, religion and the schools, ritual animal sacrifice, ritual drug use, and religious displays in public places, among others. Open to juniors and seniors only. 360 - Philosophy of Religion This course seeks to develop an understanding of religion by thinking philosophically and cross- culturally about religious practices and claims, and by considering what roles religions play in human cultures. Among course topics will be the kinds and status of religious experience, the relation between religion and morality, religious discourse and the kinds of truth claims made in different traditions. Prerequisite: One course in RS 365 - Seminar: Buddhist Ethics A study of moral/ethical thinking in the history of Buddhism. Through a close reading of selected Buddhist texts from India, Tibet, and China, we will examine Buddhist theories of character development and virtue, the ideals of human enlightenment towards which Buddhists aspire, and the practices or disciplines thought adequate to this aspiration. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND EAST ASIA PRE-1800 370 - Death, Dying, and Afterlife in the Ancient Mediterranean Questions about death, dying, and the afterlife plagued ancient cultures-Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Christians. They asked: How does one live a life free of fear and anxiety over one's inevitable and impending death? How can one die with dignity-whether violently or peacefully, whether of one's own volition or at the hands of other humans or God? How should the community structure rituals of death and what should be done with corpses? And, how-if at all- will individuals live on in an afterlife? The central goal of this course is to familiarize students with the diversity of notions about death, dying, and afterlife in ancient cultures by analyzing literature (philosophical, medical, and poetic), rituals, and monuments of the ancient Mediterranean world. We will then contextualize these ideas, noting how and why they developed from driving concerns and circumstances of particular communities, cultures, and historical moments. CORE REQUIREMENTS MET: PRE-1800 ? INTERCULTURAL 355375 - The Moral Life In this course we will seek to understand the critique of religion and certain principles of morality set out in Nietzsche's writings. This means coming to terms with the crisis that arises once the basic values grounding our life conduct have been undermined. We will then examine Nietzsche's efforts to articulate a new ideal of a moral or beautiful life that has no absolute standard for truth or good. In the second part of the course, we will examine how Nietzsche's project is taken up in Martin Heidegger's Being and Time and Heidegger's lecture course on Nietzsche. 380 - Religious Figures A comprehensive study of persons whose religious insight and/or activity has become significant to others. 395 - Topics in Religious Studies Contemporary Islam. Students in this course will examine the writings of 20th-21st century Islamic political thinkers in the broader socio-historical context in which their work was and is produced. In successive years, the course will focus on different regions or countries where these ideas are being articulated - for instance, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan and India, South East Asia, or North Ameria. Beginning with a study of key concepts in Islamic theory and political philosophy, students will then analyze the complex and specific relationship between political, religious, and economic ideas and forces informing the work of authors studied in the course. Special attention will be paid to the ways in which Western and modern ideas and practices, and Western imperialism or colonialism are taken up in their work. 397 - Independent Study in Religious Studies Prerequisite: permission of instructor. 2 or 4 units 490 - Senior Seminar in Religious Studies This seminar is offered in conjunction with Religious Studies majors' ongoing research for the senior comprehensive project. Seminar meetings will be devoted to instruction on research and writing in the discipline of Religious Studies, as well as discussion and critique of individual students' work in progress. Open only to senior Religious Studies majors. 499 - Honors in Religious Studies Prerequisite: permission of department. Faculty Regular Faculty D.

Sociologists seek to understand how societies, institutions, organizations and other social forces shape and are shaped by individuals. One of the department's primary aims is to provide students with the analytical critical skills needed to understand and evaluate social institutions and social change more effectively. The Sociology faculty complement one another in a way that allows them to offer a varied range of courses. Courses reflect a growing interest and focus in the discipline on disadvantaged groups and classes of people and the ways they interact with social institutions. Occidental's proximity to Los Angeles, one of the most ethnically and economically diverse cities in the world, makes this focus all the more appropriate and provides students with the opportunity to observe many of these social phenomena firsthand. Sociology majors will receive excellent preparation for graduate and professional study in sociology, law, social work, journalism, public health, business management, teaching, public administration, and other fields that require the ability to think critically, analytically, and ethically about a wide range of social issues in the search for viable solutions. While the department is committed to providing majors with the best possible preparation for careers in sociology and related fields, it is equally committed to providing non-majors with knowledge of social life as well as evaluative and analytical skills from which they will benefit in their chosen 357field of study and their careers in an increasingly diverse and complex world. Requirements MAJOR: Eleven courses (44 units) in Sociology which must include: Sociology 101; a theory course (200 or 205); Sociological Inquiry (304); a research methods course (305, XXX, or 310); Senior Seminar (490); and six electives chosen from within the sociology department. The Sociology Department encourages students to declare the major by the end of their first year. If you declare at the end of your first year, you should: 1. take Classic or Contemporary Sociological Theory (200 or 205) in your sophomore year. 2. take Sociological Inquiry (304) in your sophomore year. 3. take a research methods course (305, XXX, or 310) in your junior year. 4. enroll in Senior Seminar (490) in the fall of your senior year. If you declare during your sophomore year, you should: 1. take Classic or Contemporary Sociological Theory (200 or 205) as soon as possible. 2. take Sociological Inquiry (304) as soon as possible. 3. take a research methods course (305, XXX, or 310) in your junior year. 4. enroll in Senior Seminar (490) in the fall of your senior year. Students who plan to study abroad should work with their advisor on a plan to complete their major requirements. Classes taken in sociology departments while abroad count towards the major electives. Ten courses (40 units) in Sociology which must include 101, a theory course (200 or 205), a methods course (304, 305 or 310), and senior seminar (490). The remaining six courses are electives that students may select from all the other courses offered by the department. One non-Sociology course cross-listed with Sociology can count towards the major. Students can meet the departmental methods requirement by taking Sociology 304, 305, or 310. 304 and 310, however, will not meet the College Core math requirement while 305 will meet the Core math requirement. For sociology majors, 304 can be taken as a precursor to 305, or as an alternative to 305. The Sociology Department strongly encourages students to take 101 in their first or second year, 200 or 205 in their second year and a methods course before the senior seminar. 358MINOR: Five courses (20 units) in Sociology which must include 101. The remaining four courses are electives that students may select from all the other courses offered by the department.

COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: Students will engage in a major research project that will culminate in a written senior thesis. DEPARTMENTAL HONORS: A distinctive (\"PD\") comprehensive senior thesis based on primary research along with a 3.5 grade point average in the department and 3.25 overall. INTERNSHIPS: The department, in concert with the Career Development Center, keeps files on available internships in law, criminal justice, and various social and community agencies. Courses 101 - Introduction to Sociology This course introduces students to the \"sociological imagination\"-a way of viewing events, relationships and social phenomena which form the fabric of our lives and much of our history. We will examine the ways in which people are shaped, influenced, and controlled by their society and vice versa. In addition, students will be encouraged to think about how sociology helps us understand and interpret the nature of social order and disorder. Open only to freshmen and sophomores or by permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and U.S. DIVERSITY 105 - Immigrant Youth & Youth Cultures This course examines the role of youth cultures in the identity formation of immigrant adolescent youth residing in the Southwest region of the United States. Particular attention is paid to: (1) theories of acculturation and assimilation used to analyze the experiences of immigrant youth; (2) the impact of geographical location, social class, gender, race, sexuality, popular culture, mass media, and technology; and (3) the intersection of youth cultures, home cultures, and mainstream society. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: U.S. DIVERSITY 197 - Independent Study in Sociology Prerequisite: permission of instructor. 2 or 4 units 200 - Classical Sociological Theory 359This course introduces the discipline's formative schools of thought. The course is structured according to sociology's classic paradigms. Marxist, Weberian, and Durkheimian theories are the classical models. They founded the field of Sociology and continue to influence contemporary thought about social relations. In the course we first examine the fundamental presuppositions of their grand theories. Then we critically evaluate the particularities of their more concrete propositions about capitalist development or modernization, the state and social change. A special emphasis of the course is on critical analysis. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. 205 - Contemporary Sociological Theory This course introduces the most influential paradigms of the 20th century. These include the American structural-functionalist paradigm, the rational choice model, the elite school, various neo-Marxist arguments (including the theory of the world system as well as the culturalist Frankfurt school), and the symbolic interactionist paradigm. We conclude the course with an introduction to postmodernist theory. The course emphasizes critical analysis. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 210 - Sport in American Society This course examines the social and cultural factors that influence sport and physical activity. The positive and negative consequences of the way sport is organized in American society will be discussed. We will explore the unifying power of sport, as well as how sport serves to reproduce many of the inequalities present in our society. Topics include: violence, substance abuse, media, gender, race/ethnicity, and social class, and their role within sport and physical activity. Same as KIN 201 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and U.S. DIVERSITY 225 - Masculinities This course examines the construction and reproduction of masculinities, primarily in the United States.

Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and U.S. DIVERSITY 230 - Marriage and Family This course examines the family as a social institution in the United States. The course emphasizes sociological and demographic perspectives on the family, family change historically and contemporarily, and the intersection of the family with social categories such as race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, and class. The course will highlight contemporary changes in marriage, divorce, and non-marital cohabitation in the United States but will also expose students to sociological thinking about family systems around the world. Prerequisite: SOC 101 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: U.S. DIVERSITY 360240 - Sociology of Food This course examines the social relations surrounding the production, distribution, preparation, and consumption of food. In doing so, we will try to understand how the issues and problems of daily life reflect larger social forces, and how our understanding and actions shape the social world. This means that we will treat several major questions facing sociology today, including inequalities and identities based on national, racial/ethnic, class, and gender positions; work and family; the environment; globalization; and, cultural change. By the end of the course, you will be able to critically examine and evaluate the connections between food, culture, and society. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: U.S. DIVERSITY 245 - Social Class and Inequality in the United States This course examines the individual, cultural, and structural explanations for the presence and persistence of income and wealth inequality in the U.S. The impact of inequality on social groups and the social policies developed to curtail poverty are also considered. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: U.S. DIVERSITY 250 - Race and Ethnicity in American Society This course provides a basic sociological understanding of relations among racial and ethnic groups in the United States. A sociological approach includes considering race and ethnicity as social constructs that permeate all social life, are entrenched in social structures and institutions, and shift and mutate over time and place. Such a perspective suggests that (1) race and racism are not merely the 'problems' of/for subordinate racial and ethnic groups, but are reflective of society-wide power relationships that deeply affect all of us on a daily basis, (2) that racial and ethnic categories - including 'white' - can be viewed usefully as the result of historical struggles over economic resources, political access, and cultural identity, rather than as objective measures of biological difference, and (3) the institutional forms of racism, indelibly etched into this nation's past, did not end with civil rights legislation of the 1960s but continue to shape social institutions today. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and U.S. DIVERSITY 255 - Youth Cultures in United States Society This course examines the role of youth cultures in the identity formation of adolescents residing throughout the United States. Particular attention is paid to 1) the impact of geographical location, social class, gender, race, sexuality, popular culture, mass media, and technology; (2) the intersection of youth cultures and mainstream society; and (3) the contention that some youth cultures are \"deviant\". Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: U.S. DIVERSITY 260 - Deviance In this course, we will focus on sociological theories of deviance, with an emphasis on how 361behaviors and identities are socially constructed as deviant (both today and historically). We will then turn our attention to major forms of deviance as typically defined in Western societies: criminal deviance, \"victimless crimes,\" and individuals with stigmatized identities. Throughout the course, we will work to understand the complex relationship between social actors and audiences in defining deviance; the nature of social control in responding to deviance; and the experiences of \"deviant\" individuals. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: U.S. DIVERSITY 265 - Gender and Society In this course we will critically examine the ways gender informs the social world in which we live. Our goals for this course will be 1) to reveal the \"common-sense\" world of gender around you; 2) to consider how we learn to \"do\" gender; 3) to expose the workings of the institutions that shape our gendered lives; and 4) to come to an understanding of the relationship between gender and the social structure. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and U.S. DIVERSITY 280 - Punishment Why does the United States incarcerate more of its population than any other nation in the world? Why does death by injection seem kinder and gentler-and thus, more acceptable-than public hangings of the past? What are the consequences for justice and democracy in an era of unprecedented confinement and correctional supervision? Using various historical, legal, and sociological perspectives, we will focus on questions such as these with an emphasis on: the cultural life of punishment, crime control as a political issue, the racial and class dynamics of punishment and inequality, and contemporary issues surrounding modern penal sanctioning (e.g., mass incarceration) and its consequences. This course is repeatable one time. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: U.S. DIVERSITY 285 - Environmental Sociology The relationship between humans and the non-human environment is complex and problematic. We are part of and dependent upon the natural environment, even while altering that environment for our own needs and purposes. As a way of broadly thinking about these interactions, we will address the social causes, consequences, and responses to environmental disruption. By the end of the course, you will be more adept at understanding how societal characteristics -- including cultures, traditions, beliefs, values, institutions, and the like -- combine with environmental conditions to shape the impact that people have on their environments. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: U.S. DIVERSITY 304 - Sociological Inquiry This course looks at the ways sociologists collect information about social phenomena with a special emphasis on what can be done to yield information that is trustworthy and useful for our theoretical understanding of social life. It assumes no background in research methods or statistics. We will talk about the scientific method, the complexities of applying methods to social research, ethics and bias, and research design. You will be given an overview of major 362\"quantitative\" and \"qualitative\" methodologies, including surveys, interviews, ethnography, experiments, participant observation, or content analysis. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. 305 - Quantitative Research Methods This course introduces quantitative research methods and statistical analysis from a social science perspective. We will address the major components of the research process and will stress the importance of critical thinking in all matters numerical. We will cover measures of central tendency, the normal curve, probability, frequency distributions, correlation, and regression. We will also talk about statistics and statistical reasoning in the media. By the end of the course, you will have mastered basic statistical concepts and techniques, and will be able to critically examine and evaluate the (mis)use of these concepts. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 306 - Qualitative Research Methods This course introduces qualitative research methods from a social science perspective.

We explore the ethics of participant observation, with respect to issues such as role, authority, and power. We learn interview protocols, how to write field notes, how to analyze data, and techniques of storytelling in ethnographic writing. We explore principles of participatory action research and oral history. We will also learn quantitative methods through the analysis of local statistical data from the U.S. Census of Population and Housing. Students will conduct their own ethnographic or field- based study. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor 315 - Sociology of Education This course uses different sociological perspectives to examine social aspects of schooling and educational institutions in the U.S. Specifically, the course focuses on factors that may impede and/or facilitate learning such as social class, gender, race and ethnicity, teacher and parental expectations, and peers. Additionally, the role of education in the acculturation and assimilation process is considered, as are the ways in which schools ameliorate and/or replicate social inequalities. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: U.S. DIVERSITY 320 - Health and Illness This course surveys sociological theories of health, illness, and medicine. Rather than focusing 363on the individual body as the site of disease, the course examines the role of social context in shaping health and access to the healthcare system across population groups. The course focuses especially on medical intervention and the medicalization of disease, social disparities in health, and contemporary healthcare changes and challenges in the United States. Prerequisite: SOC 101 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and U.S. DIVERSITY 325 - Criminology This course introduces the field of criminology. The course is designed to provide a broad understanding of the etiology of crime (i.e., what causes crime?), the measurement of crime, and theories of criminal punishment. We will also discuss a wide range of criminal behaviors, with a focus on violent crime and property crime (e.g., homicide, sexual assault, shoplifting, white collar crime, etc.). The final component of the course focuses on the American criminal justice system. This course emphasizes a sociological approach to understanding crime, criminal behavior, and criminal justice.

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 335 - Democratizing Latin America This course will focus on the changing dynamics of state power in Latin America from the 1960s through the present. We will compare Latin America's hard-dictatorships (dictaduras) to various versions of soft(er)-authoritarianisms (dictablandas) before such states transitioned to electoral democracy. Beyond looking at the changing dynamics between states and their civil societies over time, we will explore legacies of civil wars, revolution, military coups and dirty wars. We will not only look at how ordinary people fought back by struggling for political, human and cultural rights, but how their movements contributed to the recent democratic transitions characterized as \"third-wave\" democratization\". Prerequisite: SOC 101, POLS 101, DWA 101 or HIST 258 or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: GLOBAL CONNECTION 350 - Social Movements and Revolutions This course examines why people protest for social change. We will examine the theoretical debates about the determinants of insurgency by focusing on the following models: the collective behavior, the resource mobilization, the political process, as well as the cultural approach. We will also examine the theoretical debates on the extent to which social movements can be credited with political change. Your study of these theories will expose you 364to several case studies of real social movements in the United States, Europe and Latin America. This is, however, a theory (not a history) course. Prerequisite: Sociology 101, Politics 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 355 - Power and Sexuality This course will consider the role that sexuality plays in the American imagination, especially the way that sexuality is constructed and serves as a mechanism of social control. In doing so, special attention will be paid to the ways in which human sexuality intertwines with axes of power in contemporary America such as race, ethnicity, gender, class, and sexual orientation. Prerequisite: Sociology 101. 360 - Urban Sociology What are the effects of urbanism on human psychology and civic life? How does urbanization structure social and economic relations as well as signifying identities and cultural meanings? Is there a common \"human ecology\" of cities in \"natural areas\" such as the CBD, skid row, the \"Tenderloin\" or the \"zone-in-transition\"? We examine the urban underclass, through case studies of the African American ghetto and Spanish Harlem, with attention to public policy perspectives on urban poverty. Urban futures are considered through gentrification, growth machine boosterism (sports and convention centers), and urban theme parking. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or Politics 101or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: U.S. DIVERSITY 365 - Mass Media and Consumer Society The course will examine how mass communication systems such as radio, television, cinema and the Internet are produced and what they signify and represent of the social world and public life. We consider the relationship of the mass media to big business and the structure of capitalism. The ideological influences of the mass media are interrogated through concepts such as \"mass culture\" and \"subculture\". We examine how contemporary culture and everyday life are increasingly commodified through the systems and spectacles of consumption capitalism. How has globalization affected consumerism and the social construction of the contemporary self? Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: U.S. DIVERSITY 370 - Sociology of (Non)Violence This course examines the social phenomenon of human violence. We first consider classical and contemporary sociological theories on violence and violent conflicts, and the main sociological definitions of violence used over the last century. We then turn to empirical studies that explore the social processes and societal structures that give rise to the various forms of violence\u2014intrapersonal, interpersonal, familial, collective, and political\u2014and nonviolent movements presently observed throughout the world. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 375 - Globalization 365This course examines the political, economic, and cultural changes that occur as societies shift from the traditional to the modern. Why are some nations mired in debt and dependency while others have become successful \"newly-industrializing countries?\" We consider leading intergovernmental organizations of the global economy such as the IMF, World Bank, and WTO. We investigate scenarios in cultural globalization, including Americanization, hybridization, and fundamentalism. We consider intersectional social dynamics that disenfranchise the most powerless including women, children, indigenous and stateless peoples. Prerequisite: Sociology 101 or Politics 101 or permission of Instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 395 - Special Topics in Sociology This course will function as an advanced seminar focusing on the research interests of the Sociology Department's faculty.

Spanish & French Studies The study of a culture through its language offers insights into unfamiliar worlds which cannot be realized in any other way; such study is one of the distinguishing features of a liberal arts education. Moreover, competence in a language other than English can provide a decided advantage for any post-graduate education or career objective. 367The Spanish and French Studies program at Occidental is designed to provide the student with an analytical grasp of the traditions and complexities of the Spanish and/or French-speaking world. The rich cultural and literary expressions of Spain and Latin America provide the context for a classroom environment that builds strong conversational skills and immerses the student in intensive language use. Similarly, the department introduces students to the rich intellectual, literary, cultural, and political traditions of the Francophone world through the study of works from Africa, Canada, the Caribbean, and Europe. Classroom instruction and discussions take place entirely in Spanish or French, and students benefit from a state-of-the-art language studio (featuring computerized instruction, video programs, and daily newscasts from around the world). Occidental College's strategic position in Southern California also provides students with numerous opportunities to use the Spanish language interactively. The department strongly encourages all students, whether considering a major in the department or not, to investigate Occidental's opportunities for study abroad (see Off-Campus Study). In recent years, students from a wide variety of departments, including the sciences, have taken advantage of these programs, greatly enhancing their education and future opportunities. These programs exemplify Occidental's ideal of a liberal education that increases sensitivity to and appreciation of other cultures. Finally, the department also invites students to engage in community-based learning through the different activities available in the intermediate and advanced Spanish language classes. Linguistics at Occidental College is housed in the Department of Spanish and French Studies. Linguistics is the scientific study of language as a type of human activity: how languages are constructed and why, where they came from, and how they got that way. It also delineates the breadth and limitations of language's usability. Thus linguistics straddles the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. As an applied field, it is highly useful to anyone learning another language, to those intending to teach English or any other language, to people studying other cultures (since culture is encoded and transmitted largely via language structures), and to those studying human cognition or child development (since language structure plays a central role in both). Requirements FRENCH MAJOR: The French major may choose either a literature or a culture concentration. French Literature concentration: particularly recommended for students interested in further study of French language and culture, the literature concentration requires French 202, six courses (24 units) above 202 and one course (4 units) in literary theory or linguistics. Students must take one pre-19th Century literature course and are encouraged to take one non- European literature course. French Culture concentration: recommended for students with near-native language skills in speaking, writing, and reading French. This concentration requires French 202 and four courses (16 units) above 202 (including two numbered above 350), taught in French by professors of the French section at Occidental, and one course (4 units) in literary theory or linguistics. Students may choose two additional courses (8 units) from Art, ECLS, History, or 368Politics. A student interested in francophone African literature, for example, might choose courses in African History or Politics. For both the literature and culture concentration, majors must enroll in at least one French course in the department during their senior year. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in French will satisfy the final component of Occidental's college-wide writing requirement with the submission of their translation portfolio (see Comprehensive Requirements below) which consists of two essays in English and one in French. Students should familiarize themselves with the departmental requirement at the time of declaring the major. See the Writing Program and the department chair for additional information. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: The comprehensive requirements in French are spread out over the senior year and consist of the following: translation, a grammar proficiency test (exempted by a score of 85% or higher on the grammar examination of French 202), a textual analysis (commentaire compos\u00e9, exempted by satisfactory work in French 202), a written essay (dissertation en temps limit\u00e9), an oral presentation, and a grade of B in linguistics, should the student take linguistics for the literature concentration.

Students will explore a number of topics that are at the core of linguistics. We begin with a theoretical background in subfields such as syntax, morphology, phonology, and phonetics. Then we move to broader issues such as sociolinguistics, language acquisition, psycho/neurolinguistics, and historical linguistics. Not normally open to first-year students. Prerequisite: one year of a modern language or permission of instructor. 350 - Psycholinguistics Traditional linguistics has revealed how complex and ambiguous natural language is. Despite this fact, people are able to effortlessly and accurately produce and understand language. At the crossroads of linguistics, psychology, and neuroscience, psycholinguistics is concerned with providing an explanation of how the human language processing system works. This course introduces students to the main goals, theories, and experimental methods of psycholinguistic research. We discuss the current state of our understanding of language learning and processing, as well as the experimental and analytical techniques that have been used to examine these issues. Prerequisite: An introductory course in linguistics (301), Cognitive Science (101), or Psychology (102), or by permission of the instructor.

Many of the narratives, films, and other cultural works studied treat significant contemporary issues (e.g. the representation of history, questions of identity and alterity, questions of race and ethnicity, globalization, authority, the construction of class and gender in society) that Los Angeles faces as an emblematic socio-cultural space that continuously shifts as consequence of new arrivals to the city. Emphasis will be placed on studying narratives and films within the social, historical and cultural contexts of the material they treat, and current critical theories. Specifically, this course presents a critical view of the representation of migrations to Los Angeles in order to understand how these migration stories function as a socio-cultural medium that document and occupy many geographical spaces that establish Los Angeles as a heterogeneous cultural place and space. 151-152, 251-252 - Intermediate and Advanced Conversation in Spanish Oral practice in an informal setting; includes at least one viewing of a Spanish feature film.

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 377 - Magical Realism in Latin America Although magical realism remains a difficult term to define, there is some consensus that Miguel Angel Asturias (from Guatemala), Alejo Carpentier (Cuba), Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (Colombia), and Isabel Allende (from Chile) are the most renowned practitioners of this literary genre. Pre-Columbian mythology, peasant folklore, popular Catholicism, European surrealism, the genealogical novel, and an ethical pressure on Latin American writers to represent their national cultures all play a part in the development of magical realism in Latin America. The course explores why Men of Maize (Asturias), The Kingdom of This World (Carpentier), One Hundred Years of Solitude (Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez) and The House of the Spirits (Allende) are considered paradigmatic works of magical realism. Throughout the course students will be asked to reflect upon the contested meanings and history of the term \"magical realism\" as the term is applied to different works of Latin American fiction.

Each student experiences the essentially collaborative nature of theater through participation in theater productions. Our curriculum enables students to develop a rich 383understanding of both the enactment of the written word and the essence of theatrical expression. In addition to preparing our students for further study and related careers in theater or film, we encourage each student to explore ideas of self and community and to express these discoveries through one or more aspects of theater. Because the development of a theater artist is enhanced by time as well as training, we encourage students considering a Theater major or minor to consult with department faculty and begin taking courses in the first year. (The curriculum, however, is structured to enable an industrious student to begin at a later time and complete the major by the end of the fourth year.) Students are encouraged to broaden their self-discovery through opportunities for Community Based Learning and through internships. The Department has rich, ongoing relationships with Los Angeles theater companies, providing opportunities for internships and independent study. Artists from these companies are frequent and regular guest artists for productions and as guest instructors. While the major is designed to prepare students for successful careers in theater and film, it provides also, in conjunction with study in other areas of the liberal arts, unique and effective preparation for success in such diverse fields as business, law, communications, arts administration, education, and social service. Requirements MAJOR: The major consists of 44 units. A minimum of 2 units must consist of two semesters of Production Lab (Theater 121 or 122) in two different areas (one must be a running crew.) The 121/122 requirement must be completed by the end of the junior year. Another 2 units may consist of two semesters of Performance Lab (211). The Department has established standards of excellence in theoretical analysis, performance, and production that our students meet by completing a comprehensive project in the senior year. Information concerning all phases of the senior project can be obtained from the Department Chair. The Department welcomes interdisciplinary programs and double majors, and will work carefully with students interested in such programs. Up to 8 units of select courses from Film, Music, Studio Art, Art History, and Dramatic Literature may be applied to the Theater Major in consultation with the department chair.Students who major in the Department of Theater pursue the following program of study: Theater 101; Theater 110; Theater 120; two semesters of Theater 121 and/or 122; Theater 175; Theater 210; Theater 301; four units of coursework in design or technical theater selected from Theater 225, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 250, 275, 320, 325, 330, 335, 346, 370 and 375; and at least 16 units from other Theater or approved interdisciplinary courses.

UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 202 - Shakespeare's Scripts Designed to look at a number of Shakespeare's scripts from the vantage of actor, director, or playwright, this course examines the unique and complex relationship between Shakespeare's literary constructions and their possible performances. With four plays from different periods of Shakespeare's career, we attend to elements of immediate interest and concern to those who wish to understand how Shakespeare as playwright shaped his scripts for performance: how through language and structure he develops characters of psychological complexity; how he develops stories from extra-theatrical material; how his scripts, over time, reveal his development and changing interests as a playwright; and how, in style and subject matter, the scripts relate to one another. The course offers a bridge between literary study and theatrical enactment: looking closely at Shakespeare's designs from the perspective of the theater practitioner--from, in most ways, Shakespeare's own perspective. Prerequisite: 186, 205, 220. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: FINE ARTS ? PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 203 - Productions in Times of Crisis In this course, students will investigate a variety of 20th and 21st century theatrical productions - both in the US and abroad - staged during times of conflict and crisis. From the amateur stages in restaurant back rooms, in workers clubs and cafes to professional and Broadway theaters, we will look at how access to resources and government support influences 389strategies of production. From the 1920's agitation trials (Agitsudy), mass spectacles, and agitprop theater during the Russian Revolution to contemporary theatrical responses to disease, war, racism, and social oppression, the course will examine how artists and activists use theater to respond to social and political unrest, as a tool to fight oppression (or a tool to encourage obedience and propagate national political ideals), and as an escape from the realities of everyday life. We will look at the performance theories and strategies that emerged during these theatrical moments, and we will read seminal plays that were written and staged during these periods. In addition to the historical and theoretical work, students will develop projects that respond to a contemporary crisis, taking into consideration how access to resources influences the methods and products of theatrical production, and how restrictions can often open doors to new and inventive performance technologies.

California Institute of the Arts Urban & Environmental Policy 399Occidental's Urban and Environmental Policy (UEP) major is an interdisciplinary program for students who want to change the world. It combines politics, planning, environmental policy, public health, urban studies, economics, sociology, and other disciplinary approaches. The UEP program recognizes that \"urban\" and \"environmental\" are very much interconnected and that issues of economic and environmental justice are integrally linked to where and how we live, work, play, eat, and go to school. Topics covered in the program include housing and community development, public health, land use and transportation, environmental health, food and resource issues, education, environmental justice, immigration, climate change, air and water quality, water and energy supply, poverty and social welfare, criminal justice, race and gender and class relations, globalization, and other topics at the local, state, national and international levels. Students interested in the UEP major should have a strong commitment to public service and social change, be interested in working on group projects with other students, and be available to become involved in community activities and internships. The UEP major is a unique combination of classroom learning and hands-on experience in the field of public affairs and civic action. Students learn the skills of social science and public policy analysis with special emphasis on applying those skills in the real world. It is an intensive major designed for students with a strong interest in public service careers such as government, law, human services, urban and/or environmental planning, public health, community organizing, social work, journalism and communications, socially responsible business, or academia. The goal of Occidental's UEP program is not simply to produce policy experts, but to educate students to think and to act critically in the realm of public affairs. The program includes careful consideration of ethical issues that arise in the formulation and implementation of public policy. It trains the next generation of change agents and future leaders how to think critically and creatively and act effectively to solve problems and improve society. A major dimension of UEP's problem-solving and social change-related work is its connection to the research, education, and community-based activities of the Urban & Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI). UEPI is the research and advocacy program arm of UEP and a key component of Occidental's focus on community engagement. UEPI's mission is to connect ideas and action to create a more just and livable region, nation and world. UEPI frequently partners with grassroots community, environmental, and labor organizations as well as the public sector. It serves as the umbrella for a variety of affiliated programs addressing food justice, public health, the built environment, and transportation, and includes programs and internship opportunities around these issues. UEPI staff has helped facilitate College-wide initiatives such as programs in Public Health and a China-Environment program that links students to universities and NGOs in Hong Kong, Nanjing, and other partners in China. UEPI provides opportunities for students to participate in real-world research, community action, and policy arenas. Information about UEPI is available at www.uepi.oxy.edu . Through a range of classroom-based and independent internships, students engage in the real world of urban and environmental policy through government agencies, political campaigns, grassroots community and environmental organizations, public interest groups, social service agencies, labor unions, health organizations, food justice groups, and other settings. Students also learn how to conduct practical applied research by working with and for community partners in the Los Angeles area and across the country and abroad under the supervision of faculty as well as the UEPI program staff. 400The UEP major coursework includes a series of intensive seminars in the junior and senior years, with introductory courses available in the frosh and sophomore years. The course of study includes developing skills in public policy analysis, internships, community participation, a research project with an applied policy focus, and leadership training. In addition to the prerequisites and the core seminars, students are encouraged to take electives in a variety of disciplines to sharpen their expertise in different policy areas and approaches. Another important part of the program will be attendance at meetings with visiting public policymakers, journalists, and other practitioners in addition to regular course work. Some students may choose to spend a fall semester in the Campaign Semester program (offered in alternate Presidential and Congressional election years); summer research and/or internships in Los Angeles or abroad (e.g., through the China-Environment program), through the Occidental-at-the-United Nations program, or in one of the fall or spring semester abroad programs sponsored or approved by the college. During their senior year, students will design and complete a policy-oriented comprehensive project that has an applied focus and includes original research. This project may take several forms. It be a traditional research paper, a hands-on policy research report, a project in collaboration with other students,, or a study conducted for a community-based \"client\" group.

Courses 101 - Environment and Society This is an introductory course on environment and society, designed for students with an interest in urban and environmental issues who might want to pursue further studies in Urban and Environmental Policy. It is also offered for those who are interested in the topic even though they will be pursuing another major. The course will include lectures and presentations in several different topical areas; films and speakers that provide insight into the environmental problems and alternative solutions, including those based here in Los Angeles; and class discussions and presentation sessions on the readings and topics. There are various topical areas for the class such as: water issues (where our water comes from); wastes and hazards issues (sources and impacts of pollution); transportation and land use issues (where we work 403and live and commute); nature in the city (the urban environment); and food system issues (where our food comes from and how it is manufactured and sold), the intersection of science and policy, and others. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 106 - LA Power: Politics, Policy and Justice in the City While we often locate the study of urban politics within the formal governmental arena, examining the elected officials who operate there, other actors hold a great deal of sway over the allocation of resources and power. This course will examine institutional actors who have had and continue to have an impact on politics in Los Angeles in particular. By exploring the role of colleges and universities (eg; Occidental College), museums, non-profit organizations, media outlets, business associations, and trade unions, we will attempt to develop a broader and more comprehensive understanding of how power is exercised and by whom. How have such institutions impacted geography, demography, and land use? What role have they played in electing and defeating political office holders? How do these institutional actors balance, share, and/or compete for power? How much power do they and should they have? Same as POLS 106 201 - Environmental Health and Policy This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the environmental factors impacting human and ecological health, including consequences of natural and human-made hazards. Environmental health is a rapidly growing and interdisciplinary field that involves both science and public policy. It is integrated into numerous aspects of our lives, both directly and indirectly. Topics to be covered include food safety, water access and equality, pesticides, air quality, the identification of environmental hazards, the assessment of various risks (including exposure to dangerous chemicals used in toys, food, workplaces, and other activities), and the social and biological causes of disease (epidemiology), Students will gain an understanding of environmental health analytical and scientific methods. We will also explore ways that communities and policy-makers seek to address environmental health challenges. A common thread running through the course will be an examination of how exposure to environmental and health risks vary among different population groups, in the Los Angeles area, in the United States, and around the world. We will also explore the role of science in environmental policy-making, the enforcement of regulations, and the efforts of community groups to influence public policy. (Students are encouraged to enroll in Geology 150, a laboratory science, that explores the spatial and geographic dimensions of environmental health) Prerequisite: UEP 101 or UEP 106 or Politics 106 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 203 - Public Health: Community and Environment This course explores the nation's public health challenges, the epidemiological basis of public health, and ways that public health functions as a combination of science and politics. The course examines the special vulnerabilities of low income and medically underserved populations who often work, reside, attend school, and play in neighborhoods with disproportionate exposures and poor quality medical care. The goal is to acquaint students with current public health issues, especially as they concern community, societal, and 404environmental influences on health and well being. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 204 - Environmentalism: Past, Present, and Future The course presents a broad view of the roots of environmentalism, including the relationship of environmentalism with respect to issues of class, race, gender and ethnicity. It situates the history, present day circumstances, and future direction of the environmental movement within the broader study of environmental topics and methods. It also provides the background to understand better the significance of this crucial social movement and how it has addressed the complex relationships between urban, industrial, and natural environments. 209 - Public Health & Human Rights: Global and Local Practices This course explores core concepts in global public health, the development of human rights' instruments, and how these two fields have increasingly intersected in global and local public health work. Specifically, we will review public health methods of measurement and analysis -- spanning epidemiological, economic, and political approaches -- to understand if and how a rights-based approach to health can inform more critical and more productive approaches to issues such as HIV/AIDS and other sexual and reproductive health concerns. Finally, this course examines how global public health issues have generated dramatically different responses across and within regions and countries and communities. We will particularly focus on the experience of Brazil given its changing role in the global economy and its progressive public health approach. 210 - Transportation & Living Streets Transportation and Living Streets is a class about streets: how streets influence the built environment and community life and how the use and design of streets embody competing visions of urban futures. Streets are like the DNA of a city or neighborhood. The ways that streets are designed, regulated, maintained and used impact more than traffic patterns. Streets exert influence over the buildings that line them. Streets and sidewalks affect how it \"feels\" to spend time in a community-whether people want to be out and about in a neighborhood; how they impact health and the local economy; how they determine mobility, walkability and bikeability; and how they shape daily and civic life and the diversity and openness of public places. This course will be taught in the classroom and on the streets of Los Angeles. Students will read and learn about the history of streets, policy debates on how to use and change streets, and social movements advocating for living streets. Students will also perform street observations and engage in community based learning by assisting community efforts to re- envision local streets. Prerequisite: UEP 101 or UEP 106 or Politics 106 (may be taken concurrently) CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 211 - The Los Angeles River and the Politics of Water This course will examine issues related to the changing dynamics regarding the Los Angeles River as well as the broader politics of water.

The seminar will then engage in discussions about the topics explored in the Panel discussions on the major controversies in Education, and identify research topics related to the current policy debates within LAUSD as well as some of the broader debates within Education policy. Co- requisite UEP 212. 2 units. 214 - Education Policies and Politics Practicum This 4 unit course provides students with an opportunity to engage in major research and internship opportunities around key Education Policy and Politics issues. UEP 212 and 213 are not prerequisites for UEP 214 but those courses are strongly recommended. 246 - Sustainable Oxy: Campus Greening This course is designed to assess and develop recommendations regarding environmental issues related to the Occidental campus. Students will evaluate the College's current practices, such as energy and water use, transportation and parking, building construction and maintenance, landscape and grounds maintenance, hazardous and solid waste generation and management, educational and outreach strategies, and how the College's environmental issues relate to the larger Northeast Los Angeles community. Students will then assess potential best practices that can be developed and introduced at Occidental and that have been introduced at other College campuses to reduce resource use and the College's overall ecological footprint, while also seeking to identify how the College can itself play a positive role in increasing the environmental sustainability of its neighboring community. The course is also designed to develop environmental leadership skills among those who are assigned a leadership role in the class as well as all the student participants. The course will have student leaders helping develop key campus sustainability targets and strategies for change. 406Graded CR/NC 2 units 247 - Sustainable Oxy: Food Growing and Preparation This course is designed to develop knowledge and skills about food growing and preparation, with a focus on the continuing development of the Occidental FEAST garden and related initiatives regarding increasing awareness about how to prepare food (cooking skills) and its importance in relation to food sourcing, health, and quality of life. The course is designed to increase student literacy about food issues and help develop the technical skills and leadership capacity regarding campus and community food system change. The course will also have student leaders helping shape the projects related to the development of the growing and preparing food skills. Graded CR/NC 2 Units 260 (POLS) - Work and Labor in America Sooner or later, we all have to work ? that is, get a job. Some people even have \"careers.\" And some people are lucky enough to consider the work they do a \"vocation\" - something that is both intrinsically rewarding and useful to society. Work occupies much of our waking hours. For most people, the nature of our work determines the quality of our daily lives. This course will focus on the varieties of work (in different industries and occupations); how people experience their work on the job; how society shapes the work we do; how work shapes our family lives, our friendships, our health, and our self-esteem; and how the nature of work is changing in our increasingly global economy dominated by large corporations and sophisticated technology. The course will look at the future of work in the context of our changing economy, values, and technologies. We will pay particular attention to how organized groups - labor unions, consumer groups, business associations, and others have influenced the nature of work. We will also explore how government action (public policy) has shaped how our economy works and the rules governing the work we do. These include such matters as wages, hours, flex time, family leave, job security, workplace health and safety, the quality of goods and services, and workplace participation. We will explore such questions as: What makes work satisfying or unsatisfying? How have such have increasing problems of low-wage work and even \"sweatshops\" in a wealthy society? How do such factors as education, skill, race, and gender influence the kinds of work we do and how we experience our work? What are the chances of getting injured or sick because of working in a specific job? How do people balance work/career and family responsibilities? Do people experience work the same way in other democratic countries? What can be done to make the world of work better? CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 295 - Global Public Health The course will examine major global public health problems and the range of responses from international organizations, transnational networks, and domestic and community-based institutions. Despite improvements in the health status of low- and middle-income countries over the last half-century, the challenges to advance global public health remain daunting. 407What are the sorts of strategies these actors have used in addressing such health issues as HIV/AIDS, malaria, unsafe food and water, tobacco use, and others? What is the role of human rights in addressing the underlying determinants of ill-health? The course will present basic concepts for understanding global public health, including morbidity, mortality, demography, epidemiology, and the political, social and economic determinants of health. We will utilize a case study method to examine successful and less successful efforts to improve global health and to debate enduring political, economic, social and cultural controversies in the arenas of global health. Students can expect to gain knowledge of the major issues and actors in global public health and an introduction to the analytic and quantitative skills needed to monitor and evaluate evidence used in formulating policies and programs. Same as DWA 295 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 301 - Urban Policy and Politics This seminar focuses on the origin and development of cities, suburbs, and urban areas. It explores the causes, symptoms, and solutions to such urban problems as poverty, housing, transportation, crime and violence, pollution, racial segregation, and neighborhood change. It also examines how power is exercised by different groups,, including business, citizens' groups, community organizations, unions, the media, mayors and other government officials. The course will also examine the role of city planning and planners, conflict and cooperation between cities and suburbs, problems of urban sprawl, loss of open space, water and energy resources. Students will learn about federal urban policy and the role of cities in national politics. The course will also compare American cities with cities in Europe, Canada, and the developing world. Public policies to solve urban problems. Prerequisite: UEP 101 or UEP 106 or Politics 106or permission of instructor. Same as POLS 301 302 - Housing Problems and Policy This course examines how societies provide people with shelter - through market forces, government policy, and self-help efforts. The course will focus on the United States but will also look at other societies to help understand the strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. approach. Students will examine such housing problems as homelessness, slums (substandard housing), the shortage of affordable housing, racial segregation, foreclosures, and other topics. It will examine the pros and cons, and different forms, of rental housing and homeownership. It will look at the connection between housing issues and the environment, public health, education, transportation, suburbanization and sprawl, poverty and inequality, and racism. Students will explore housing as an aspect of our culture, such as homeownership as the \"American dream\" and housing as a \"haven.\" The course will explore the history of housing problems and housing policy, including zoning, racial discrimination, finance, public housing, different government subsidies for housing, and taxes. We will debate whether decent housing is a \"right\". We will look at housing problems and policies at the local, state, and national levels. Students will explore the politics of housing in terms of the various interest groups - including developers, banks, tenants, community organizations, landlords, contractors, unions, and others -- involved in shaping housing policy. Students will also learn about housing as part of the \"built environment,\" architecture, land use, urban design, as a component of urban planning, and as a part of \"livable\" cities. They will also examine housing as a component of real estate development and explore what housing developments ? whether for-profit or non-profit ? do.

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 304 - Research Methods for Urban & Environmental Policy This course trains students in research methods and analysis to understand environmental, economic, social, and political issues relevant to urban planning, environmental studies, and related policy areas. Students will learn quantitative and qualitative methods with a particular emphasis on community based research methods. Through class lectures, discussions, field work, group presentations and computer lab exercises, students learn and apply the most commonly used strategies for collecting, analyzing, and presenting data used in urban and environmental policy research and analysis. Students will learn to understand decision-making tools such risk assessment, environmental impact assessment, and exposure assessment. They will work with commonly used data sets such as the Census, data sources for health, property ownership, toxic releases, campaign contributions, and other information used in urban planning, environmental, and public policy research. Students will also learn qualitative research methods including survey construction and analysis, participant observation, case studies methodology, and interview techniques. The course will also address ethical challenges raised during collaborative research alongside community-based partners andadvocacy groups. The course provides the research fundamentals for the comprehensive research projects in the UEP major. Prerequisite: UEP 101 or UEP 106 or Politics 106 or permission of instructor. 306 - Food and the Environment This course will examine the range of issues associated with the food system, including environmental, economic, health, cultural, and social impacts related to how food is grown, processed and manufactured, distributed, sold, and consumed. This will include how the restructuring of the food system has led to such impacts as obesity (e.g., portion size, proliferation of certain products and fast food restaurants, trends towards eating out rather than eating in); enormous water quality, air quality, occupational health, and loss of biodiversity outcomes; the rise of functional foods, genetically modified products, and globally sourced and 409produced foods, at the same time that food as a core cultural experience is undermined or flattened; and, the global reordering, concentration, and industrialization of each component of the food system that affects the food experience. The geographic focus of the class will include both domestic and global aspects of the food system as well as issues that will be explored in the Los Angeles context. There will also be a Community based Learning component to the class, based on major research projects associated with the ongoing research, policy, educational, organizing, and program work of the Center for Food & Justice, which is a division of UEPI.

Students will be supervised jointly by the faculty member and a staff person for the community organization. Must be taken simultaneously with UEP 310. 395 - Topics in Urban and Environmental Policy Transportation and Place in American History . How have our ways of moving through the world affected our understandings of familiar spaces around us? Can we think of transportation technology as a form of mass media that has changed over time, thus altering perceptions of even the most familiar landscapes? In this course, we will explore several historical modes of 410perceiving and navigating the landscapes of American cities, and particularly greater Los Angeles, ranging from the pedestrian city to the metropolis of railroads and streetcars (including the famous Pacific Electric system) to the sprawling megalopolis of automobiles and freeways. We might even speculate what a transit and pedestrian Los Angeles of the future might look like - will it be a return to the past, or betoken new ways of understanding, and organizing, our everyday urban spaces? Central to this exploration will be extensive research in the college's John Lloyd Butler Special Collections archives on railroads and their history and on Southern California in the twentieth century. In this process, students will carry out original archival research, culminating in a significant paper reflecting both their own research discoveries in the archives as well as their new perspectives on American urbanism in Southern California and elsewhere.

Course work explores the structure of exposition and develops critical interpretations of texts. All courses require a substantial amount of critical reading, writing, and revision. All classes provide considerable guidance in the writing process and extensive feedback on papers: through student-professor and student-student conferences. Since not everyone writes the same way, and not all writing tasks have the same requirements, diverse approaches to writing are emphasized in the course work: imitation of models, paradigmatic schemes, and behavioral strategies. Course content draws from the related fields of cultural studies, cognitive and social psychology, rhetoric, literature, and linguistics. English Writing classes present effective writing and close reading as complementary, enabling behaviors developed throughout the college years, and as the foundation of life-long learning.

Not open to frosh. 250 - Writing with the Community This course encourages an engaged and dynamic approach to writing studies, as it places writing in real-world contexts by partnering Oxy students with community organizations (in Los Angeles and Pasadena). Through these partnerships, students will identify local cultural and social concerns\u2014specifically on the topics of homelessness, poverty, and immigration, which represent the interests of our particular community groups\u2014and will use writing and rhetorical 414tools for analyzing and addressing these issues. In this class, we will explore a wide range of research and writing strategies common to both academic environments and the work place situations of our community partners, such as: primary or field research, secondary or library- based research, and both individual and collaborative writing projects. This course will allow students to see community nonprofit organizations, plus the cultural, social, and political issues and rhetoric surrounding them, from the inside out. The work of this class is thus both scholarly and practical, motivating student learning by enlivening and enriching students' approaches to academic work. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 275 - Rhetoric in the Health Professions This course emphasizes analytical reading and critical writing for students interested in the health professions.

Tuition Adjustment Policy Since faculty engagements and other commitments are made by the College for the entire year in advance, the foll owing tuition adjustment schedule has been established in order that the College and the student may share the cost equitably when it is necessary for a student to drop a course or withdraw from the College. Status Change From Full -Time To Part -Time : The C ollege refund policy for students dropping from full -time status to part -time status is effective only for the first five weeks of the semester. Students who register at the beginning of the term as full -time and elect to drop to part-time status will be b illed on a per -unit basis (eleven or fewer units) in addition to the following assessment fee: At the end of the second week of classes \u2014$670 During the third, fourth, and up to the end of the fifth week of classes \u2014$1,780 After the fifth week of classes, no adjustment will be made and the student will be billed at the regular full -time rate. Part-time Status : To be considered part -time, a student must petition the Registrar's Office and be approved. Attending courses with 11 or fewer units without an approve d petition from the Registrar does not constitute part -time status and the student will be subject to full -time tuition and fees. Withdrawal from the College : Students who withdraw during the semester may be eligible for refunds, depending upon the time of the withdrawal. Students must give written notification to the Registrar of their decision to withdraw and complete all withdrawal procedures to be eligible for any refunds (see tuition insurance plan ). 423Eligibility for tuition refunds is as follows: Withdrawal During Amount of Tuition Refunded First five days of classes* 90% Sixth through 10th day of classes* 80% 11th through 15th day of classes* 70% 16th through 20th day of classes* 60% 21st through 25th day of classes* 50% After 26th day of classes* 0% *Days of classes are defined as any business day when any classes are held.

Graduate Programs : Graduate students officially accepted into the Education Credential or M.A.T. programs must confirm their enrolled units with the registrar by publi shed deadlines. Students will be billed on a per -unit basis for the units for which they register at the beginning of the semester. After the fifth week of classes, no adjustment other than assessing additional units will be made. If the enrolled units for m is not completed, the student will be charged full - time tuition at the graduate education rate. Financial Aid Occidental College has a long history of providing educational opportunities to qualified students from various economic backgrounds. More than 70 percent of the Occidental student body receives some form of financial aid. Varying amounts of financial aid are awarded to qualified students. Financial aid is given in the form of grants, scholarships, loans, and on -campus employment. Awards are base d upon a family's calculated need and the resources available from endowment, annual gifts and the general funds of the College, as well as federal and state sources. 424With the exception of a small number of merit programs, financial aid is awarded to students who demonstrate financial need based on federal, state, and institutional policies. The College evaluates family resources in a consistent and equitable manner. Th e general principle of these policies is that parents and students are the primary source of funds for post -secondary education and both have an obligation to finance educational expenses to the extent that they are able. Financial need is considered to be the difference between the cost of attendance and the family's expected family contribution (EFC), as determined by the Financial Aid Office. Students are expected to contribute toward their educational expenses. All student are expected to contribute at least $2,600 from summer earnings to assist in meeting costs of education in addition to 35% of their net assets per year. Financial assistance for international students is extremely limited. Additional information and special financial aid applications a re available from the Office of Admission. New international student financial aid applications should be returned to the Office of Admission. International scholarships are renewable for four years as long as the student maintains satisfactory academic pr ogress. International students are only considered for institutional aid at the time of admission. Need-based Application Process Students seeking need -based financial aid are required to file all financial aid applications on time. Deadlines also pertain to Occidental students who are returning after having left the College. This application process allows the student to be considered for Occidental scholarships, Federal Grants, Cal Grants, work programs, Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Direct Student Loan s, and other Occidental loans. Deadline for entering students: February 1 Deadline for returning students: March 2 Deadline for all students to submit tax documents: April 19 All students must follow the instructions outlined to apply for need -based sch olarships, grants, loans, and work awards. Entering freshmen who apply for admission to the College are automatically considered for merit -based scholarships. The College does not require a student to apply for financial aid to be considered for merit -base d scholarships. All students must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and list Occidental College (Code #001249). The FAFSA is available online at www.fafsa.ed.gov. The FAFSA is due by February 1 for all first -year students, by Marc h 2 for all returning students, by March 2 for fall transfer students, and by November 15 for spring transfer students. All students must submit copies of their and their parent's federal tax returns with all supporting documents including W -2s, 1099s, all schedules (A, B, C, D, E, F, K -1, etc.), and statements.

All students must submit any additional documents requested from the Financial Aid Offi ce in a timely manner. First-time applicants must also complete the CSS PROFILE and list Occidental College (Code #4581). You must pay the appropriate fee as explained in the instructions for your CSS PROFILE to be forwarded to Occidental. First -time appl icants who do not complete the CSS PROFILE will not be considered for institutional aid.

Returning students who do not submit the two supplemental applications will not be considered for institutional aid. If you do not submit the two supplemental applications but you list Occidental College on your FAFSA application, you will be considered for federal and state aid only. The Parent Supplement is available for download online at www.oxy.edu/financial-aid/forms and is due by March 2. The Student Online Supplement is available online via the Oxy student's My Oxy portal at my.oxy.edu and is due by March 2. Graduate Students are encouraged to file and sign their tax returns and to submit them to our office as early as possible, but not later than April 19. Files completed after this date will be considered late and will not receive priority processing. Scholarships Occidental need -based scholarships are awarded each year on an individual basis in proportion to the degree of financial need and the student's academic and co -curricular record. Less than full- time students will have their need -based scholarship prorated. There is no scholarship assistance for students enrolled in less than six units. Occidental scholarship recipients may be asked to write a thank -you letter to a specific donor durin g the academic year. The College also offers a limited number of merit scholarships to entering students at the time of admission. Scholarship awards are based on academic ability, achievement, motivation, and promise. Merit awards are renewable for up to three additional years (8 semesters total) provided that the student continues to maintain the required cumulative grade point average of the scholarship. See the Financial Aid Policy Guide for GPA requirements of specific scholarships. Scholarship amounts are prorated if you do not attend the entire academic year or are enrolled less than full -time. Students enrolled in less than six units are not eligible for merit scholarships. For pro -rating calculations please contact the Financial Aid Office. Grants All students applying for financial aid at Occidental are required to apply for the appropriate state and federal grant programs. California residents apply by completing the FAFSA and the GPA Verification Form. All grant awards are combined with other res ources to meet financial need. The Federal Pell Grant is a federal student aid program for undergraduate students with exceptional financial need. The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) is a federal program that helps undergraduate students with the greatest financial need. Priority is given to Federal Pell Grant recipients. The California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) awards Cal Grants A and B to California residents as determined by eligibility requirements set by the State of Ca lifornia. 426Campus Employment Opportunities Part-time employment is supported by the Occidental Work Award (OWA) program and the Federal Work Study (FWS) program. Occidental Work Award and Federal Work Study are normally offered as part of the financial aid award to students who demonstrate need. Loans Loans are an invaluable resource to college students and their parents in financing a college education. Loans are generally repaid within 10 years after graduating or withdrawing from school (consolidation pr ograms can extend the number of years a student has to repay their loans). Loan obligations and interest rates are outlined in the promissory notes you are required to sign. The Occidental Low Interest Loan is administered by the College using institutiona l funds. Occidental Low Interest Loans (5%) are awarded up to $5,500 per year for undergraduates. The Occidental No Interest Loan is a student loan originally funded by the Weingart Foundation that awards up to $10,000 per year for undergraduate students. This generous, interest -free program was established to benefit U.S. Citizens who are graduates of California high schools. The Federal Perkins Loan is administered by the College utilizing federal and institutional funds. It is typically awarded to studen ts with high -demonstrated need. Federal Perkins Loans (5%) are awarded up to $4,000 per year for undergraduates. The Federal Subsidized Direct Loan is a low -interest loan offered by the U.S. Department of Education. The interest on this loan is subsidized by the federal government while the student is enrolled. Occidental College students may borrow Federal Direct Loans based on their need, year in school, and satisfactory academic progress. The Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan is available for students who do not demonstrate financial need or students who need assistance with their expected family contribution. The interest rate is fixed at 6.8% and interest accrual is immediate. Students may choose to pay interest while in school or have it capitalized ont o the principal balance. The Federal Direct PLUS Loan is designed to provide long -term competitive rate financing for parents of dependent students to assist in meeting the expected family contribution. Federal PLUS loans may not exceed the student's cost of attendance less any financial aid a student is eligible for per year. The current interest rate is fixed at 7.9%. Satisfactory Academic Progress To remain eligible for financial aid, a student must be in good academic standing as defined in the Academic Policies section of this catalog. No Occidental funds are available to a student on a leave of absence or study abroad at another institution. Students may, however, in some cases, receive federal or state aid to study abroad at another institution. The a cademic year at Occidental consists of two 15 -week semesters. Full -time students may register each semester for a maximum of 18 units. Students enrolling in less than 12 units each semester are considered to be part -time, and aid is prorated. Since institu tional financial aid eligibility extends for only four years and graduation requirements are based on satisfactory completion of 32 units each year, it is to a student's 427advantage to complete 16 units each semester. Financial aid eligibility for transfer s tudents is prorated based upon the grade level determined at the time of admission. Students who are eligible to graduate prior to exhausting financial aid eligibility are not eligible to continue to receive financial aid. Repeated courses do not count as courses completed and do not contribute to maintaining satisfactory academic progress. Qualitative and Quantitative Requirements : For Occidental students to maintain eligibility for financial aid, applicants are required to make satisfactory academic progr ess toward their degree. The Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (SAP) also requires students to complete a certain number of units and maintain a certain grade point average after each year of college attendance. Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy fo r Financial Aid Recipients Federal regulations require Occidental College to monitor the academic progress of students receiving financial aid. When we disburse aid to your student account, we are certifying that you are making satisfactory academic progre ss (SAP) toward your degree. Occidental students must make quantitative (time -based) and qualitative (grade -based) progress towards their degree. The time -based requirement is the pace at which you must progress toward your degree. The grade -based require ment is measured by your GPA. Maximum Time Frame (Pace): At Occidental, if you are a full -time, first -year student you are eligible to receive institutional and state financial aid for 8 semesters of full -time study. Students who require additional semesters to complete their degree are only eligible for federal assistance for no more than 4 additional semesters as long as they meet other progress standards and remain federally eligible. Financial aid eligibility for transfer students is prorated bas ed on the number of units transferred from previous institution(s). This determination is made at the time of admission by the Registrar. As a full -time student at Occidental you are considered to be making adequate progress toward your degree if you compl ete a minimum of 12 units each semester and earn a total of 128 units by the end of your 8th semester. You are expected to complete 16 units per semester to graduate in four years. For federal eligibility, you must complete a minimum 12 units per semester and 128 units by the end of your 12th semester. Attempted courses are those for which you are officially enrolled after the last date to drop courses. Withdrawals showing as a W on your academic transcript are counted as attempted courses. All courses coun t in calculating a student's academic progress, including any for which the student did not receive financial aid. Grades of W are counted as courses attempted and count toward the maximum time frame. Audited courses do not count in the calculation of atte mpted courses as no units are earned. Academic policy at Occidental states that if a student does not receive a passing grade for a course, the course may be repeated for credit. Repeating a course does not remove the original course from the academic tran script. Both the grade for the original course and the repeated course will be posted and will calculate into the student's grade 428point average. Both the original course and the repeated course will be considered as attempted in the calculation of \"attempt ed courses\" for purposes of determining SAP. Courses taken on a pass/fail basis count toward the total of attempted and completed courses. Transfer credits from another institution accepted by Occidental College are counted when measuring the maximum time frame to complete the degree. Occidental does not accept for credit any transfer grades lower than 2.0. Consult the Occidental Catalog for information about how transfer credits are evaluated. Students who pursue a double major or a minor are expected to c omplete all degree requirements within the 128 unit time frame. Your academic records will be reviewed at the end of each semester to determine that you are making SAP. Making SAP means you must have at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA by the end of each semeste r and you must have made progress toward you degree as outlined below: Minimum of: End of first semester 16 Units End of second semester 32 Units End of third semester 48 Units End of fourth semester 64 Units End of fifth semester 80 Units End of sixth semester 96 Units End of seventh semester 112 Units End of eight semester 128 Units Failure to meet SAP If you do not earn at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA and/or fail to earn the required minimum units, you will receive a warning notification from the Financial Aid Office that you are at risk of losing eligibility for aid. If you do not earn at least a cumulative 2.0 and/or earn the minimum required units by the end of your \"warning\" semester you are no longer eligible for institutional, state, or federal financial aid. Right to Appeal If you lose your financial aid eligibility at the end of your \"warning\" semester (and the Academic Standards Committee permits you to enroll) you have the right to appeal for an additional semester of aid. 429The appeal m ust be made in writing to the Director of Financial Aid. The appeal may not be based on your need for financial assistance or your lack of knowledge on the SAP policy. It should be based on some extenuating situation or condition which prevented you from m aking progress. Your appeal must include a written academic plan which outlines how you plan to restore your GPA to a 2.0 or better and/or meet the minimum unit requirements. Appeal Denied If your appeal is denied you may still be able to regain eligibility for future semesters by enrolling at Occidental (at your own expense), earning a 2.0 or better GPA, and bringing all cumulative units up to required standards. It is also possible to take a Leave of Absence from Occidental and pursue transferab le coursework at another institution. This will allow you to bring your required units up to date and show academic improvement by attaining a minimum GPA of 2.0 or better (a GPA earned at another institution will not affect your Oxy GPA). You are required to speak with the Registrar to ensure units completed elsewhere are transferable to Occidental. Appeal Granted If your appeal is granted, you will be placed on Financial Aid Probation. During probation, you must follow your academic plan and resolve all i ncomplete grades before the Financial Aid Office can make a final determination that you have met the SAP guidelines. Student Eligibility To receive aid from the programs discussed in this catalog you must: be a U.S. citizen, a permanent resident, or an eligible non -citizen have a valid Social Security number have a high school diploma or a General Education Development (GED) certificate be enrolled at least half -time (at least 6 units) maintain satisfactory academic progress be admitted as a degree seeki ng student demonstrate financial need register with Selective Service, if required meet other eligibility requirements as required by state and federal law To be eligible for financial aid, a student must be admitted as a regular student. Students admitted as a limited graduate or as an advanced or limited special undergraduate are not eligible for financial aid. Payment and Financing Options In addition to the traditional need -based financial aid programs, Occidental offers short - and long-term payment al ternatives. These programs are available to all families regardless of financial need. The application process is separate from the need -based application process.

Key Policies Students of Occidental College strive for high standards of excellence, equity, community and service. This endeavor requires an environment in which each individual is able to flourish. Since the Occidental student body is diverse and passionate, maintaining this community is a process that is as constant and challenging as it is rewarding. The Occidental Community is a community of difference. D ivergent opinions and beliefs are not simply necessary to the community \u2014 they constitute it. Oxy students confront the possibility of disagreement, opposition and conflict in each day's activities. This can be a trying and difficult endeavor. Oxy students are united in their agreement that they are enriched by these engagements. They assert that the constructive and critical examination of their beliefs leads to intellectual, personal, and social fulfillment. Therefore, protecting the integrity of their discourse is a matter of collective concern. This principle of honor stems from a common agreement to adhere to standards of engagement that preserve the graciousness of our exchange. This requires that students engage one another honestly, but also responsi bly and respectfully. The students of Occidental College define community standards and agree to advance this principle. These standards are neither static nor imposed on them; rather, they are determined by students. It follows that they continuously defe nd, implement, and revise this principle themselves. They mutually recognize that their principle of honor serves to preserve the passion and difference that is the Occidental Community. Student Conduct Please see the Student Handbook for college policies, including the Code of Student Conduct . Alcohol and Other Drugs Students are encouraged to review the Alcohol and Other Drugs policy , which is outline in the Student Handbook.

New students are assigned housing based on the information they provide on the Residence Information form. In recognition of the specific needs of first - year students, first -year students will be ho used together in a community that offers a comprehensive program of support and education for life outside the classroom. Housing agreements are for the entire academic year (two consecutive semesters), and students who move out of their residence hall roo m before the conclusion of the academic year are still responsible for room rent for the entire year. Students previously matriculated apply for residence during room draw through the Office of Residential Education and Housing Services.
