And that's why vaccine detox for dogs is essential. What Is Vaccine Damage In Dogs? Vaccine damage isn't just when your dog's head swells up five minutes after the vaccine. Typically, vaccine damage happens slowly, over weeks or months. That's because there are toxic ingredients in vaccines that accumulate in the body. Eventually, they can cause: - Immune disorders - Allergies - Inflammatory conditions - Cancer The good news is, researchers have shown that the core vaccines (like rabies, parvo and distemper) can protect dogs for at least 7 years ... and probably for life. This means you don't have to vaccinate our dogs every year or even every three years. And limiting vaccines will go a long way to limiting your dog's risk of vaccine damage. But the bad news is, most states require rabies vaccination every 3 years - which is way too often. [And way too dangerous](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/65-ways-rabies-vaccination-can-harm-your-dog/). When it comes to the core vaccines (like parvo, distemper and adenovirus), your vet, daycare or boarding facility might want your dog vaccinated too. Often, there's just no way to get out of over-vaccination. Besides, even just one vaccine has the potential to set your dog up for health issues down the road. Vaccine toxicity in dogs can happen if you vaccinate just once or a bunch of times ... so dog vaccine detox is critical. Why Dog Vaccine Detox is Important Vaccines don't just contain virus. They need chemicals and other additives to work. These additives typically serve one of two purposes: They Exaggerate The Immune Response These chemicals are called adjuvants. Vaccines can only contain a small amount of virus ... so that your dog doesn't get the disease from the vaccine. Adjuvants force the immune system to over-react to the tiny amount of virus in vaccines, to help your dog develop immunity. They Act As Stabilizers Chemicals and substances (such as gelatin) are added to vaccines to keep the virus alive during storage. Surprisingly, the unwanted side effects from vaccines don't usually come from the virus itself. Vaccine reactions are caused by the substances added to vaccines. Let's take a look at the most dangerous additives ... Aluminum Aluminum is the most common adjuvant in veterinary vaccines. Adjuvant means it exaggerates an immune response. And aluminum targets the brain and endocrine (hormonal) system. This can cause brain and nervous system degeneration, vaccine-associated cancers, seizures and behavior issues. Thimerosal Thimerosal is a mercury-based vaccine additive that's used as a preservative. In 1967, a study found Thimerosal killed mice when added to vaccines. In 1972, Thimerosal manufacturer Eli Lilly found Thimerosal to be \"toxic to tissue cells\" in concentrations as low as one part per million (PPM). This is 100 times weaker than in a typical vaccine. Pittman-Moore wrote to Eli Lilly: \"We have obtained a marked local reaction in about 50% of the dogs injected with serum containing dilutions of Merthiolate (Thimerosal). Merthiolate is unsatisfactory preservative for serum intended for use on dogs.\" Since then, repeated studies show the dangers of Thimerosal. In 1982, the FDA proposed a ban on over-the-counter products containing Thimerosal. And 1991 the FDA considered banning Thimerosal from animal vaccines. Finally, in 2006, researchers at UC Davis published a study showing that Thimerosal may make the immune system vulnerable to bacteria and other pathogens. Despite these safety warnings, most veterinary vaccines still contain Thimerosal (even \"Thimerosal-free\" vaccines). Animal Proteins Vaccines are made by allowing the virus to grow on animal tissue. So vaccine manufacturers grow your dog's vaccine on chicken embryos, cow fetuses, etc. When they make the vaccine, that animal tissue gets ground up with the virus and injected into your dog. Foreign animal proteins aren't supposed to enter the bloodstream directly ... and this sets the immune system on high alert so it can destroy the foreign invaders. But if the foreign invader looks like the body's own cells, then the immune system can start attacking the body's own cells. This is called auto-immunity. And nearly all common diseases in dogs today are linked to auto-immunity, including: - Cancer - Hypothyroidism - Allergies - Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) - Addison's disease - Autoimmune hemolytic anemia - Diabetes - Immune mediated arthritis ... and many more. Larry Glickman DVM et al looked at this in the Purdue Study, Vaccine-induced autoimmunity in the dog ... \"Our ongoing studies of dogs show that following routine vaccination, there is a significant level of antibodies dogs produce against their own tissues ...Some of these antibodies have been shown to target the thyroid gland, the connective tissue such as that found in the valves of the heart, red blood cells, DNA etc.\" Contaminants In Dog Vaccinations Contaminants found in vaccines are also behind many of the adverse reactions we see in dogs. \"Contaminant\" means anything impure or unclean, toxic or poisonous, or that can create disease. Vaccines contain contaminants that can cause cancer, leukemia, autoimmune diseases and a myriad of other unwanted conditions. How long do vaccines stay in a dog's system? There's no set time for how long vaccines stay in a dog's system ... but dogs can experience symptoms caused by vaccine contaminants for years ... even for life. So I hope by now, you're seeing the value in helping your dog rid his body of these unwanted ingredients that are an unfortunate part of vaccination. Let's get to the detox! RELATED: [Find out what other toxins are in your dog's vaccines ...](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/whats-in-your-dogs-vaccine/) Vaccine Detox For Dogs If you're wondering how can I detox my dog? ... well, there are several home remedies to detox dog vaccines. They'll help your dog rid his body of unwanted chemicals and side effects, but they won't interfere with the vaccines themselves. You'll want to use these as soon as your dog is vaccinated. So don't wait for symptoms to appear, start your dog vaccine detox right away! Here's how to detox your dog after vaccines. Probiotics Vaccines can disrupt the delicate balance of bacteria in the gut. This community of bacteria helps your dog manufacture and absorb vitamins. And probiotics are the core of your dog's immune system. You never want to damage this delicate community! Adding probiotics plus their food, prebiotics, will help restore the delicate balance of bacteria in the gut. You'll also want to make sure you add plenty of prebiotics ... these are foods that feed the beneficial bacteria in your dog's gut. You can buy a pre-made prebiotic and probiotic blend ... they're easy to find. Soil-based probiotics are especially helpful in getting rid of heavy metals and other vaccine contaminants. DNM RECOMMENDS: Four Leaf Rover offers Protect, a veterinarian-formulated daily soil-based probiotic with prebiotics plus ingredients like chlorella, Bentonite clay, humid and fulvic acids to help remove toxins from your dog after vaccination. [Buy Protect now >>](https://thenaturaldogstore.com/collections/prebiotics-and-probiotics/products/four-leaf-rover-protect) Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids help control inflammation and are an important part of the process of vaccine detox for dogs. While fish oil is popular as a source of omega-3, it can oxidize fast and harm your dog. It's also it's environmentally unsustainable as the oceans are depleted of fish. The same is true of krill oil. A better omega-3 choice is sustainably grown green-lipped mussel oil. Chelators Some foods and nutrients bind to heavy metals. This helps remove them from the body before they accumulate in the organs and do harm. Chlorella is a micro-algae that loves to bind to heavy metals. It also acts as a prebiotic and contains plenty of antioxidants, which help with detoxification as well. Special soils can also bind to heavy metals. Humic and fulvic acid, as well as Bentonite clay can bind to aluminum and especially mercury and exit them out of the body. Garlic and Leafy Greens Garlic is very safe for your dog in the right amounts. It naturally contains sulphur, which helps the liver detoxify from heavy metals. Dark leafy greens like kale, parsley, and cilantro can help reduce the buildup of heavy metals like mercury in the body. Give a half clove of garlic per 10 pounds and add dark leafy greens to your dog's meals daily Homeopathy Homeopathy has a great track record for helping with chronic problems that stem from vaccination. If your dog shows any symptoms of vaccine damage, you can consult with a homeopathic vet. Find one at theavh.org. A homeopath can review your dog's history and help you find the right remedy to get your dog back on track. Be Prepared For Detox Symptoms Vaccine detox for dogs can flush out some really nasty junk! He might seem off for the first day or two or might have loose or mucusy stools. Detox can feel a bit like having the flu ... so if he doesn't feel well, slow down. There's no need to rush. Try adding just one of the above detox foods at a time to keep your dog comfortable. Find a holistic vet to work with so you can make sure your dog never receives any unnecessary vaccines. They'll also help you detoxify your dog from past vaccinations to keep him healthy. References D\u00f3rea, J.G.
