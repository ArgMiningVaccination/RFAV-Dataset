Its become clear that we will probably never know. Last May, Michael Rogers, director of the Division of Field Investigations for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said in a telephone conference that the agency received as many as 18,000 calls about the recalled foods, with as many as 50 percent alleging an animal death. Certainly as part of a longer-term process, the agency is going to be evaluating this data, and well certainly come out with a final characterization of in total the number of confirmed deaths associated with these recalled products, he said. However, our efforts to determine how many people are investigating the reports that FDA received or whether there are actually any people currently working on those reports at all led nowhere. Every FDA spokesperson we encountered told us, Well release the number as soon as we know it. Information released by other sources suggests that the final number will be much higher than the 17 or 18 cases that FDA accepts as positively confirmed. The Oregon state veterinarian, Dr. Emilio DeBess, states that he has received reports 127 suspect cases of dogs and cats who experienced an adverse response to eating contaminated food; this number includes reports of 49 deaths 20 dogs and 29 cats. Also, the 20,000 members of Veterinary Information Network (VIN, an online, subscription-based education and communication forum for veterinary professionals) reported almost 1,500 cases of dog and cat injuries and deaths related to contaminated pet food. VIN plans to investigate as many of these reports as they can, in an attempt to independently confirm links between contaminated foods and illness.There is a silver lining to this cloud. Pet food companies are doing more than theyve ever done to secure better ingredients, establish or enforce traceability of those ingredients, monitor their contract manufacturers (if they use one), and communicate with us, the people buying their products. Of course, in some cases, more than theyve ever done isnt much. Makers of low-cost, low-quality foods will still buy bargain ingredients; theyll just be a tad more certain of the ingredients origin. But the companies who make products aimed at the top end of the market the so-called super-premium foods are pulling out all the stops to accomplish these tasks and earn consumer confidence. On page 14, seven executives from companies that meet the latter description discuss what they are doing (and what they had already been doing) to make top-quality, safe foods. Many owners who have lost confidence in all commercial pet food makers have found comfort in our series on home-prepared diets, which concludes in this issue. Weve received many letters from owners who have made the switch to home-prepared diets for their dogs and couldnt be happier. [A Homemade Dog Food Diet](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/food/a-homemade-dog-food-diet/) When we first planned a series of articles for Whole Dog Journal on homemade dog food diets, Whole Dog Journal Editor Nancy Kerns and I had no idea that massive pet food recalls would erupt almost simultaneously with the publication of the first article, and continue to expand over the following months. Throughout the aftermath of the recall, I saw a variety of recipes for home-prepared pet food diets, to be fed as a safer replacement for potentially contaminated commercial foods. Presented in newspapers, magazines, and online, most of these diet recipes provided incomplete nutrition, lacked any source of calcium, offered no variety, and were heavily laden with carbohydrates rather than the protein that dogs require to thrive. As more and more owners made the decision to switch to homemade diets rather than risk feeding contaminated food to their dogs, I grew increasingly aware of the importance and urgency to supply appropriate guidelines that could help people create homemade diets that would meet the nutritional needs of their dogs. Over the past five months, I've presented information on homemade diets, cooked and raw, with whole bones, ground bones, or boneless. During that time, I've learned about some new products, read a great new book, tried out some sample pre-mixes and freeze-dried foods, and responded to questions from people about issues raised in my articles and points that would benefit from clarification. I'll discuss these topics in this final installment of our series. New cooked diet book There are an infinite number of cookbooks with recipes for human diets, and lately I've seen quite a few of them for dogs, too. But I just finished reading the first cookbook I've found with recipes for people to share with their dogs. Carol Boyle, who discussed the diet she shares with her husband and her two Great Pyrenees in \" [Home Prepared Dog Food Recipes](/issues/10_7/features/Home-Prepared-Dog-Food-Recipes_15944-1.html)\" (Whole Dog Journal July 2007), has published a book on the topic. Natural Food Recipes for Healthy Dogs: Everything You Need to Know to Make the Greatest Food for Your Friend is delightful, easy to read, and filled with recipes for dishes you can share with your dogs. Boyle's simple but thorough guidelines for how to feed a healthy diet to your dogs, as well as to the humans in your household, made me begin to think that maybe even I could learn to cook! While I haven't yet gone that far, I have found myself making larger portions and sharing them with my dog when I feel the meals I'm eating are appropriate, rather than just offering a few tidbits as I've done in the past. Be sure to get the newly revised version available from naturaldogfood.com (or 908-728-0010), not the older edition found elsewhere. Supplements for limited diets Two new supplements designed to balance out limited homemade diets were introduced to the market since I wrote about them, also in July's article. Steve Brown, the creator of Steve's Real Food for Dogs, has developed a new product called See Spot Live LongerTM Homemade Dinner Mixes. Designed to balance a meat-based diet, this product can be used by owners who are unable to feed their dogs the variety needed to create a complete diet, or those who simply feel more comfortable using a supplement to ensure that AAFCO (American Association of Feed Control Officials) and NRC (National Research Council) nutritional guidelines are met. A second product, Vitamins & Minerals for Home-Cooked Dog Food made by Furoshnikov's Formulas, is designed to balance out a diet that is higher in carbohydrates. This product is also guaranteed to make a diet meet the AAFCO guidelines for a canine diet when used according to directions. Both of these new products, as well as the two mentioned in previous articles, Wysong's Call of the Wild (designed for meat-based diets) and Balance IT (designed for high-carbohydrate diets), supply calcium as well as other needed vitamins and minerals, so there's no need to add a separate calcium source when using any of them. Because of this, they are not appropriate to use with diets that include edible bone. Green beans not toxic Also in July's article, I said, \"Legumes (including green beans) should always be cooked due to a toxin they contain while raw (though small amounts would not be harmful).\" Correction: This warning does not apply to green beans after all. It is only the mature beans, such as kidney, lima, and fava beans, that contain significant amounts of toxin prior to cooking. Green beans (also called string beans, snap beans, and French beans) are immature and are fine to be fed raw. Grinders I've discovered three new sources for electric meat grinders since writing about them in Whole Dog Journal's May article on raw diets, \"A Raw Deal.\" Several raw feeders have recommended stainless steel grinders made and sold by Cabela's, especially the 1 and 1\u00bd horsepower models. \"My 1 HP Cabela's meat grinder will grind up veggies, whole chicken parts, and turkey wings and backs (I haven't tried legs as their bones are quite thick),\" says Cary Branthwaite of Durham, North Carolina. \"We grind and butcher quite a bit of venison, so we needed the 1 HP capacity, but a \u00bd HP grinder would be adequate also.\" Mary Waugh Swindell of Boyd, Texas, had a mechanical problem with the larger 1\u00be HP model that she bought at Cabela's in Fort Worth, but raved about the store's customer service and willingness to take it back with no questions asked. She exchanged it for the 1\u00bd HP model, which both her best friend and her dad have been happy with, and says, \"It works like a dream. I needed something big and fast, as I'm feeding six large dogs. I would wholeheartedly recommend their grinder.\" These Cabela commercial-grade stainless steel grinders run $400 to $600, plus shipping (which is expensive on these heavy items) if you can't find them locally. Cabela's also sells lower-priced models, but I've heard no feedback about them. Heather Smith, of Fayetteville, Pennsylvania, recently purchased a \u00be HP LEM stainless steel grinder from Bass Pro Shops (they're also available directly from the manufacturer), and says, \"It was about $350 and has worked great on chicken quarters, chicken wings and necks, turkey wings and necks, and oxtails. If you can fit it down the chute, this grinder will grind it.\" LEM also makes smaller grinders, but I've not heard feedback about them. Another recommended grinder is the 1.35 HP grinder from Gander Mountain, which costs about $150. Check with local stores specializing in outdoor gear and hunting and fishing equipment to see if any offer electric meat grinders, often used by hunters to process wild game. In the past, many people recommended the Tasin grinders sold by Northern Tool, but, according to reports I've heard from dog owners, the quality of those has declined in recent years, so if you're thinking about a grinder, you may want to try one of those listed above instead. Commercial alternatives My dog, Piglet, volunteered to test samples of the four different varieties of dehydrated diets made by The Honest Kitchen, and gave them high marks. I've been integrating them into her diet as part of her breakfast every three days, for variety and because she likes them so much. Laura Fulton, who told us about the diet she feeds her two Weimaraners in last month's article, \"Reality Cooks,\" also offered some samples from The Honest Kitchen to her dogs and reports that they love it. Her dog Violet, who is prone to gassiness and digestive upset, has had no problems with these foods. Fulton has fed all but the Verve variety, which is beef-based, as Violet is allergic to beef. Another friend, Sheryl Matzen, of Gold River, California, tried Embark, the variety approved for puppies, mixed half and half with fresh foods, to feed her new German Shepherd moose . . . uh, puppy, Apollo, and she, too, reports that he loves the food and is doing extremely well with it. She wanted to feed him a homemade diet, though she was worried about getting it right for a large-breed puppy; happily, she feels comfortable using the pre-mix. Matzen was cooking the added meat, but a recent heat wave convinced her to try feeding raw instead. In fact, she even gives him meat that is still frozen, as he enjoys chewing on it, and it helps to distract him from the rocks that he otherwise wants to eat. Piglet also tried some samples of Stella & Chewy's Freeze Dried Steaks. This is a complete diet, which comes in both frozen and freeze-dried form. It is available in beef, chicken, and lamb flavors, using free-range meats and human-grade ingredients. The company recently opened its own processing plant in order to maintain control and ensure the safety of their products. I rehydrated the patties with warm water before feeding, and Piglet whimpered pathetically while waiting for them to be served. The result was a complete success: she ate with enthusiasm and tried to convince me I had not fed her enough. Complete packaged raw diets are too expensive for most people to serve all the time, unless you have very small dogs, but they can be handy to have on hand for quick and easy meals, and freeze-dried foods can be great for traveling, especially camping and backpacking. Elemental calcium A question was raised about the amount of calcium in eggshells due to the difference between calcium carbonate and elemental calcium. \"Elemental calcium\" is just a way of saying pure calcium, and this is what you will find listed in the nutritional analyses of most supplements. Eggshells are 95 percent calcium carbonate; calcium carbonate is 40 percent elemental calcium. A large eggshell provides about 5,500 mg (about 1 teaspoon) of ground eggshell. So, 1 teaspoon of ground eggshell provides about 5,225 mg of calcium carbonate, or 2,100 mg of elemental calcium. Thus, the recommendation to add \u00bd teaspoon ground eggshell per pound of food (when you do not feed edible bones) supplies about 1,000 mg of elemental calcium. If a supplement says it contains 500 mg calcium, that means 500 mg elemental calcium, though the amount of the calcium compound used to make the supplement, such as calcium carbonate or calcium lactate, will be greater. That's why it doesn't matter what form of calcium you use, as long as you give the proper amount of elemental calcium as shown on the label. Vitamin A One of the sample diets described in July's article mentioned limiting the amount of liver in the diet due to concerns about vitamin A, and this is a worry I've heard voiced by many other people as well. Vitamin A is fat soluble, so an oversupply of this nutrient can be toxic. The reality, though, is that you would have to feed huge amounts of vitamin A for many months in order to cause toxicity. A diet that was all or mostly liver could lead to vitamin A toxicity over time, but a diet that includes small amounts of liver on a daily basis will not. Liver is one of the most nutrient-dense foods you can feed, providing not only vitamin A, but also all the B vitamins, choline and inositol, vitamins D, E, and K, and the minerals iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and potassium, as well as essential fatty acids and high-quality protein. Don't skimp on this nutritious food due to an unreasonable fear of too much vitamin A. Around five percent of the total diet should be liver, if possible. Whole food versus synthetic supplements Whole food supplements use beneficial foods and herbs rather than synthetic vitamins. Examples include nutritional or brewer's yeast (source of B vitamins, chromium, selenium, and trace minerals), cod liver oil (source of vitamins A and D), organic apple cider vinegar (provides some trace minerals), and garlic (offers numerous health benefits). Green blends are whole food supplements that include primarily green foods, such as kelp, alfalfa, and spirulina, which provide trace minerals and other nutrients. It is hard to quantify the benefits of whole food supplements, as little in the way of measurable nutrients will show up on a nutritional analysis. Synthetic supplements generally offer much higher amounts of vitamins. If you want to give megadoses of vitamin C, for example, you will have to rely on synthetic supplements to do so. Whole foods may offer superior nutritional value due to the combinations of nutrients, which may act synergistically and which the body may be better able to utilize than isolated nutrients, and their structure, which may be more bioavailable than synthetics. As with foods, it can be helpful to rotate among different whole food supplements rather than always using the same one. Different brands, even those with similar ingredients, each offer their own unique combinations of nutrients, so once again variety can help to ensure that all nutritional needs are met while nothing is given in excess. Recipes versus diets One criticism of my raw diet guidelines provided a spreadsheet analysis of a single recipe, and stated that it was incomplete. I don't doubt that any single recipe derived from the guidelines I offered may be incomplete, due to the fact that the diets I recommend strive for balance over time, not in every single meal. I cannot stress enough the need to feed variety, rather than feeding the same foods all the time. A diet that is half chicken wings will not meet all of your dog's nutritional needs, and will be higher in fat than is desirable. A diet that includes meals of chicken wings rotating with meals of other types of raw meaty bones will have a reduced amount of fat and provide additional nutrients. In addition, of course, the other half of the diet should also include a variety of different foods such as muscle meat and organ meat of various kinds, along with eggs and dairy. While fat is a good source of energy for dogs, too much can lead to weight gain, reduced nutrition (if the amount of food has to be limited to keep your dog at the optimal weight), and digestive upset in some dogs. Unless your dog is quite active and has trouble keeping weight on, the diet you feed should not contain an abundance of fatty meats and skin. Menadione There has been a lot of concern lately about the use of menadione, a synthetic form of vitamin K, in pet foods. Menadione has been banned for use in human over-the-counter supplements because it is toxic at excessive dosages. This problem was seen primarily in human infants when they were injected with vitamin K to prevent deficiency. Since synthetic vitamin K has double the potency of natural vitamin K on a per weight basis, this resulted in toxicity. One nursing encyclopedia says that \"prolonged consumption of megadoses of vitamin K (menadione) results in anemia,\" and that \"a daily injection of 10 mg of menadione into an infant for three days can kill the child.\" It was this tragic discovery that led to its use being banned. In comparison, the amount of menadione in commercial dog foods is extremely tiny. The Balance IT supplement, which is meant to supply nutrients at AAFCO recommended levels, contains 0.0774 mg menadione per scoop. One usage recommendation I've seen is to use 3 scoops for 900 calories (for a 35 lb dog), which would be 0.2322 mg daily. This amount is just over 2 percent of the dosage that would be considered toxic to a much smaller infant. Many substances, even water, are safe in recommended amounts but toxic when excessive amounts are ingested. While I agree that the natural forms of vitamin K, phylloquinone (vitamin K1), and menaquinone (vitamin K2), would be preferable to the synthetic form, my feeling is that the risk presented by feeding foods or supplements that use menadione (vitamin K3) is minimal, and I would not avoid a food just because it contains this ingredient. Fish and fish oil concerns Many people worry about the amount of salt in canned fish. It is true that canned fish is salty, but dogs require a certain amount of salt, and a homemade diet is naturally low in salt, so the amount in canned fish that is fed once or twice a week should not be a concern. If your dog suffers from heart disease or needs a low-sodium diet for some other reason, you can rinse the fish to remove most of the salt. Concerns also arise over possible contaminants in fish and fish oils, such as mercury, PCBs, and dioxin. Mercury contamination is mostly a concern in larger fish, such as tuna, swordfish, and king mackerel. Salmon, jack mackerel (not the same as king mackerel), and sardines are all low in mercury. Farmed salmon is much more likely than wild-caught salmon to be contaminated with PCBs and dioxin. Canned salmon is almost always wild-caught Pacific (Alaskan) salmon. Check the label if you're unsure. Both Consumer Reports and ConsumerLab.com have conducted tests on a variety of fish oil supplements and found that none contained a significant amount of mercury, PCBs, or dioxins. They also found that almost all, including the less expensive brands, were fresh and contained the amount of omega-3 fatty acids promised on the label. If you're still concerned, look for pharmaceutical-grade oils, as they are guaranteed to be free of all impurities. Chicken, arsenic, antibiotics Arsenic and antibiotics are fed to some chickens to encourage rapid growth. While the residual amount of arsenic left in the meat was considered too low to be a concern for human consumption, recent studies have shown that levels are higher than previously acknowledged. Adding arsenic to chicken feed also contributes to environmental contamination, while the indiscriminate use of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. There are many brands, including supermarket brands, that do not contain arsenic or antibiotics. Organic chicken contains neither arsenic nor antibiotics as well. Check with the supplier to verify that the brands you use are both arsenic- and antibiotic-free. Food weights There is often confusion between different ways of expressing amounts, such as cups vs pounds. While a cup is a measure of volume and a pound is a measure of weight, the general rule of thumb (and the way to remember it) is, \"A pint's a pound, the world 'round.\" A pint is 16 ounces, which is two cups, so a cup of food will weigh around 8 ounces. This will vary depending on density, but it should give a good approximation for fresh food, which has a high moisture content. Other measurements and conversions that may be helpful: A large egg weighs about 2 ounces, of which 2/3 is the white and 1/3 the yolk 1 fluid ounce is 6 teaspoons (2 tablespoons) There are about 28 grams per ounce, and 454 grams per pound. To convert ounces to grams, multiply by 28. To convert pounds to grams, multiply by 454. To convert grams to ounces, divide by 28. To convert grams to pounds, divide by 454. Cutting up raw meaty bones A few people objected to my advice to owners who are concerned about the risk of their dogs choking on raw meaty bones. I said that owners could cut up raw meaty bones into bite-sized pieces. Some argue that the way to prevent choking is to feed large pieces that are too big to be swallowed whole. They feel that cutting up raw meaty bones actually makes it more likely that dogs will choke. In my experience with two dogs who have had problems chewing raw meaty bones, feeding large pieces doesn't always help. If your dog's teeth are too worn to be able to slice off pieces to swallow (as was the case with my dogs), it doesn't matter how long they chew on the piece, eventually they still try to swallow it whole. Even if your dog is able to chew off pieces, that large piece then becomes smaller, and your dog may still try to swallow it when it is large enough to cause choking, particularly if you have a dog who tends to gulp his food. It is important to cut food up into chunks that are too small to cause choking, even if swallowed whole. For example, turkey necks (or chicken necks for small dogs) need to be cut lengthwise rather than or in addition to crosswise, so that you don't end up with short pieces that are still too thick to go down comfortably. When I cut up raw meaty bones for my dog, Piglet, she still chews the pieces, but has no problem swallowing them despite the fact that her teeth are too worn to chew a large piece into smaller pieces. Another objection is that pieces of bone that are swallowed whole without being crushed by chewing are more likely to cause obstruction. In my experience, obstruction from raw bones is quite rare, and dogs have no problem digesting them, even if the bones are not crushed. However, if your dog swallows pieces whole and you see pieces of bone in his stool, you may want to invest in and use a grinder. For those who do want to cut up their dog's food, I'll say once again that my Joyce Chen Unlimited Scissors work far better than any of a number of poultry shears that I've purchased over the years. They're also great for cutting up gristly meat that is otherwise almost impossible to saw through. Q and A: The following are questions that I received from readers about earlier installments in this series. -Eden Le Bouton of Cleveland, Ohio, writes, \"In May's article on raw diets, you say, 'RMBs should make up 30 to 50 percent of the total diet.' Later in the same paragraph you say, 'While a reasonable amount of raw bone won't harm an adult dog, more than 15 percent is not needed and reduces the amount of other valuable foods that can be fed.' My confusion is: should RMBs make up 15, 30, or 50 percent of the diet and is that the daily diet?\" The confusion lies in the difference between \"bone\" and \"raw meaty bones\" (RMBs). Raw meaty bones are, by definition, at least half meat, and so therefore no more than half bone. If you feed a diet that is 30 to 50 percent RMBs, the amount of bone in the diet will be 15 to 30 percent or less, depending on the ratio of meat to bone in the parts that you feed. Dogs need no more than 15 percent bone, so if you feed the higher percentage of RMBs, you should try to use parts that are more than half meat. There is no need to feed an exact percentage of bone on a daily basis, though this is one ingredient that often works best when similar amounts are fed daily, as too much bone at one time can cause hard stools and constipation, while feeding no bone at all one day may lead to looser stools the next. -David Logue of Allen, Texas, writes, \"My wife and I have three rescued Maltese who have no teeth. We feed the dogs a home-prepared diet, but with little variety. What suggestions could you offer us?\" Most foods can be fed to dogs who lack teeth. The only real exception is whole bones. You can purchase products that include ground bone, or buy an inexpensive grinder that will grind softer bones, such as from chicken and rabbit, and do it yourself. Or you can feed a diet that doesn't include bone, and use a different calcium source instead. Remember that no more than half the diet should be raw meaty bones, so even if you can't provide much variety in that area, you can still feed lots of different kinds of meats, organs, and other foods, including eggs, cottage cheese, yogurt, canned fish with bone (jack mackerel, pink salmon, sardines), and healthy leftovers in the other half (or more) of the diet. -Brenda Stoner of Henderson, Arkansas, asks, \"What is your opinion on giving vitamin supplements made for humans to dogs? Is it okay to use yogurt or cottage cheese and eggs every day as long as I use a variety of meats?\" Human supplements are okay to use, as long as the amounts are appropriate. Adjust as needed for the size of your dog. For example, a large dog could take an adult human dose, while a medium-sized dog would take half that much, and a small dog one quarter or less. It is fine to feed yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs, or any other food on a daily basis, as long as the rest of the diet provides adequate variety. No one food should ever be more than half the diet, but there's no problem adding the same healthy foods daily, particularly in small amounts. A medium- or large-breed dog could eat an egg every day with no problem, but a whole egg every day would be too much for a toy breed, as it wouldn't leave enough room for a variety of other foods. -Gerda Alexander of Newville, Pennsylvania, asks, \"Can I use eggshells from boiled and uncooked eggs?\" Yes, eggshells from either cooked or uncooked eggs can be used. Just rinse them out and let them dry overnight before grinding in a clean coffee grinder. Ground eggshell will keep a long time if you remove the inner membrane before grinding. There's no need to refrigerate it, as ground eggshell is just minerals. -Winnie Laning of Toronto, Ontario, writes, \"If I feed a home-cooked diet and add canned salmon, will this take care of the calcium requirement so that I don't need to add a supplement? Also, is it beneficial to add sunflower oil to the diet?\" No, you can't use a single form of meat with bones to provide all the calcium your dog needs. You would end up feeding too much canned salmon (not enough variety), and too little calcium. Canned fish with bones has far more calcium than plain meat, but it actually has more phosphorus than calcium, so it can't be used to balance the phosphorus in the rest of the diet. It's easy to add ground eggshells or any other calcium supplement when you don't feed edible bone, at a level that provides around 1,000 mg calcium per pound of food. It's fine to feed canned salmon some of the time, maybe once or twice a week, but don't feed it daily, unless you feed very small amounts. I don't recommend adding vegetable oils to dog diets, especially in large amounts. Vegetable oils such as safflower, corn, and sunflower oil are high in linoleic acid (LA), a form of omega-6 fatty acids that is usually plentiful in the diet, and that can lead to inflammation when too much is given. Fish body oil is high in the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are anti-inflammatory and hard to find in food (other than fatty fish). Note that flaxseed oil and carmelina oil are not good choices to replace fish oil, as the form of omega-3 fatty acids found in plant oils (alpha linolenic acid, or ALA) must be converted in the body to the forms that dogs can utilize (EPA and DHA), and dogs are not able to make this conversion very well, if at all. If you do add plant oils, the best kinds to use are borage oil and evening primrose oil, as the gamma-linoleic acid (GLA) they contain is preferred over the LA found in vegetable oils. Olive oil, which provides omega-9 fatty acids, is also okay in small amounts. Remember that you need to add some vitamin E when you supplement with either plant or fish oils (the tiny amount of vitamin E included in most supplements is not enough). Note that some of the oil supplements sold for dogs are mostly vegetable oil. For example, Derm Caps are mostly safflower oil (up to 72 percent linoleic acid). Check the label before making a selection. Final note I hope that the guidelines in this article series help you start feeding healthy foods to your dog, whether you feed a raw diet with bones, a raw or cooked boneless diet, a diet based on pre-mixes, or just a commercial diet with fresh foods such as eggs, meat, and dairy added. It's important to realize that it is no more difficult to feed your dog a healthy diet than it is to do the same for your family, though there are differences in their nutritional needs. It's not necessary or desirable to feed only \"complete and balanced\" commercial foods, nor that every meal be complete and balanced, as long as balance is achieved over time. Just as with our own diets, fresh, wholesome, species-appropriate foods offer superior nutrition to processed, packaged foods. Remember the three basic rules - variety, balance over time, and calcium in appropriate amounts - and open the door to improving your dog's health in the most natural way possible.

[Get Your Puppy Enrolled Into Puppy Training School As Early as Possible](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/puppies/get-your-puppy-enrolled-into-puppy-training-school-as-early-as-possible/) What's the best age to start training? For most puppy owners, the answer is \"Yesterday!\" In fact, the optimum time to start a puppy's education is as early as possible: about eight weeks of age. It's hard to fathom that at one time many trainers insisted that puppies be at least six months old in order to enroll in a training class. Today's positive trainer - and educated, progressive veterinarian - knows that the first four months of your dog's life are the most important time for socialization, to lay the foundation for learning that will serve him (and you) for the rest of his life. Of course, in \"those\" days we all trained with choke chains, using solid yanks on the leash (\"corrections\") to get our training message across. And because choke chains can damage (or even collapse) a dog's trachea, trainers were wise not to inflict that harsh punishment on the tender throats of eight-week-old puppies. Today, with food treats and clickers as the primary tools in our training arsenal, puppy tracheas are safe, and we can help owners start educating their youngsters at a much more optimum training age, before pups have had several months of reinforcement for unwelcome and inappropriate behaviors. Paradoxically, some veterinarians still counsel owners to wait until their new puppies are six months old and \"fully vaccinated\" to take them to training class. Unfortunately, this advice is just as outdated as the use of choke chains in puppy classes! It's true that you shouldn't want only to expose your pup to high-risk dog populations; you should never take him to a dog park, or let him play with stray dogs on the street. But the risk of contracting an infectious disease in a controlled setting, with other healthy puppies, is quite low. In fact, there is probably a much greater risk of a dog meeting a tragic end due to behavior problems from lack of early training and socialization than from exposure in a well-run puppy class to some deadly disease. The well-run puppy class The caveat is that you find a \"well-run\" puppy class. You want an experienced trainer who uses gentle, effective training methods on her human clients as well as the dogs, and who conducts her classes in a safe and clean environment. She should have a good understanding of dog body language and social behavior, and know when to intervene if a puppy is being inappropriate with his playmates. She should also have knowledge of puppy diseases and parasites and require presentation of health records upon registration for class. Ideally, you'll find an instructor who teaches good manners behaviors in her puppy classes as well as providing puppy socialization (play!) time, and who will also address questions you may have about other topics, such as housetraining, crating, and puppy biting. Sadly, there are still plenty of old-fashioned trainers who are apt to administer a physical correction to your puppy for perceived transgressions. Avoid those trainers at all costs. These trainers may call themselves positive, and in fact may be more positive than they used to be, but if they still use leash corrections, loud verbal reprimands, any kind of physical punishment, or restraints such as pinning a puppy on his side, they're not positive enough! You can find trainers from a variety of sources: the phone book, referrals from dog-owner friends or your veterinarian, dog clubs, business cards on pet supply store bulletin boards, the Internet . . . and any of these might be great - or not. (See \"Internet Resources for Finding a Trainer,\" below.) To be on the safe side, arrange to sit in on a class or two and watch the trainer in action. If the trainer doesn't allow this, find another trainer. When you are watching a prospective training class, look for these things: The trainer appears friendly, confident, and competent. She allows time for questions, and answers them willingly and thoroughly. Canine and human students appear to be learning, enjoying themselves, and succeeding at assigned exercises. Students receive individual attention and coaching. There is adequate concern for dog and human health and safety. The facility is clean, with no strong odors, and the floors have non-slip footing. The environment is well controlled to promote calm - no running children, loose dogs (except during playtime), loud noises, excessive barking, etc. Dogs are handled gently - without physical force, punishment, strong verbal reprimands, or forcible restraint of a struggling or vocalizing puppy. Trainer doesn't do or require owners to do anything that conflicts with the owner's training and dog handling philosophies. During playtime, puppies are separated into appropriate playgroups where they are closely monitored and inappropriate play is interrupted. The trainer is respectful of dog and owner individual needs and training goals. What to expect You've researched and selected the right class for your pup. If you've watched a class or two in session, you already have some idea of what to expect from the trainer you've chosen. What you encounter in the actual classes you've signed up for will vary, depending on the trainer's or training school's puppy class curriculum. Some puppy classes focus primarily on socialization. A good part of the class may be dedicated to puppy play, with other activities included. A trainer might have owners encourage their pups to encounter new surfaces - walking across a board on the ground, stepping through scattered hula hoops, crossing a blanket, a box filled with sand or gravel, or a crinkly substance like aluminum foil. There might be some time spent with gentle restraint, helping puppies learn that being held makes good things happen, and playing \"pass-the-puppy\" so baby dogs have good experiences meeting a variety of people. Pups might come nose-to-nose with nail clippers, hair dryers, vacuum cleaners, crutches, and other real-life potentially scary stimuli for the first time. Puppies aren't forced, of course, but rather given a positive association with all these things, and are reinforced for any willingness to be brave. Other classes may have a stronger emphasis on actual training. Since 8-week-old puppies are perfectly capable of learning all the behaviors that older dogs do, there is huge value in teaching them what to do at an early age, well before they have a long history of practicing and being reinforced for behaviors you want them not to do. Some training schools offer both. Legacy Canine Behavior and Training in Sequim, Washington, is operated by longtime positive trainer Terry Ryan. Legacy's Puppy HeadStart class includes socialization, confidence building, leadership exercises, and information on housetraining and other family living skills. The class is free with paid registration for Ryan's \"Pet Dog Manners\" class, where pups 16 weeks and older (and their owners) learn important life skills such as walking on leash, polite greetings, coming when called, and more. Many classes, including the ones at Legacy, require owners to come to an initial orientation class without pups, so course goals and expectations, training philosophies, equipment, training center rules, etc. can be discussed and questions answered without concern for restless puppies. This helps ease owner concerns about what to expect, and gives them and their pups a training head start. This way, they've already practiced and had success with some of the training exercises before they arrive in a new, sometimes overwhelming, environment the following week. The traditional format then follows with six to eight weeks of classes. Often the last night of class is a \"graduation\" celebration of some sort, with certificates handed out to those who successfully complete the class. A new format gaining in popularity is the \"Levels\" class. Each level covers only a few exercises, and when pup and human are competent at those, they move on to the next level. Level 1, for example, might include name recognition, sit, and down. One training team might master those in one short week and immediately move on to Level 2, while another may find the down to be challenging and take three weeks to reach Level 2. Level 2 might consist of stand, polite leash walking, and targeting. The value of this format is that each team can move ahead at its own pace. Dogs and owners don't become overwhelmed when new exercises are introduced each week (especially if they haven't yet mastered the prior week's assignments). Plus, if at any time the team needs a refresher on a previous level behavior, they can drop back and work there until they're ready to move forward again. This format also allows owners who have missed classes to pick up right where they left off, rather than feeling that they're way behind. Attending class Nervous, you arrive at class with your puppy in tow. You've purchased the equipment and books recommended by your trainer, and diligently practiced the first week's exercises. Now what? Expect chaos. If your trainer hasn't already suggested it, you should have treats in hand as you walk into class, and use them to keep your pup focused on you instead of trying to greet other pups. This is a good time to teach your pup that just because he sees other dogs doesn't necessarily mean he gets to go say hi. By the same token, if another owner allows her pup to rush up to yours, politely ask her to keep her pup away until a more appropriate greeting time. Some pups are so overstimulated by all the other dogs and people that they bark, or act afraid. Your trainer should understand this arousal behavior, and prepared to help you manage it with high-value treats, and some kind of barrier (if necessary) to block visual stimuli and allow your pup to relax. It may take 5 to 15 minutes (or more) to get all the excited dogs and humans settled enough to begin class. Mammals who are highly aroused don't think well, so there's no point in asking your pup to respond to cues until you're both ready to learn. From there, class should progress more smoothly. Your pup will learn to focus on you and perform the behaviors he does so well at home, even in the presence of distractions. A good trainer will be patient with her students, willing to answer your questions, and able to help you and your dog progress in your training. Remember this exceedingly important point - training should be fun! As the weeks go quickly by and you're astounded by your pup's ability to learn - and your own ability to teach her - you should look eagerly forward to going to class each week because you both enjoy learning new behaviors and showing off your accomplishments.

[How Dog Food Has Changed Due to The Pet Food Recall](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/food/how-dog-food-has-changed-due-to-the-pet-food-recall/) There have been pet food recalls before, and there will be recalls in the future, but the event of early 2007 will probably be recorded as the costliest pet food recall in history. However, it's my hope, and the opinion of many, that the lessons learned from this infamous event should prevent any similar large-scale pet food disaster from happening ever again. Note that none of the companies whose executives are quoted below had products involved in the recalls. But every pet food company in the country was affected by the firestorm of inquiries from terrified pet owners who sought information about their pet foods. I appreciate the seriousness, honesty, and commitment to providing quality foods that these executives exhibit here. Phil Abreo, Breeder's Choice The recalls put the pet food industry on alert; we must be more diligent in assuring that all companies involved in the ingredient-sourcing chain are the most reliable and follow the highest food safety procedures. Peter Atkins, Natura Consumers are interested in more than just a pretty bag and are now reading - more accurately, scrutinizing - labels like never before. There is obviously a heightened state of consumer awareness about pet foods, pet food companies, and the ingredients that go into pet foods. Customers have a new expectation for transparency - where their food is manufactured, where ingredients come from, and the types of testing employed by the manufacturer to assure safety. Based on the dramatic spike in our sales, customers are obviously seeking products from smaller suppliers of holistic, organic, and natural products. Brian Connolly, Castor & Pollux There have been several outcomes. One is the need for pet food companies to be more forthcoming with information as to where their products are made and where ingredients are sourced. From the first day of the first recall, we provided pet parents with information on who made our custom formulation canned products for us. This was done via our website, in the thousands of e-mails that Shelley (my wife and co-founder) personally answered and on the phone with our customer service team. Even though we are a small company (just 17 people), we are committed to being as transparent as possible - unlike some other companies that chose to hide behind automated answering services and answers like \"I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to release that information.\" The other outcome has to do with overall pet food safety. All manufacturers are paying much more attention to where ingredients come from and the quality/safety associated with those ingredients. You can't test your way to safety; you need to know that the ingredients are safe from the time the seeds are planted in the field, through the growing, handling, processing, storage, transportation, and manufacturing process. With our Organix food, pet owners have the benefit of knowing that an independent third-party organic certifying agency under the mandate of the USDA's National Organic Program has the responsibility of doing this. Each and every ingredient in Organix must be reviewed and approved for inclusion in our formula by the organic certifying agency. This third-party review and approval process does not apply to \"natural,\" \"holistic,\" or \"human grade\" pet foods. Certified organic pet foods and treats take safety to another level. Deborah Ellinger, Wellness The recall taught consumers how important it is to focus on the ingredient choices and quality standards of the brands behind the products. A positive outcome of the recall is that consumers are more aware of what is in their pet's food, and are reading labels and asking more questions. The industry as a whole is responding, and this will ultimately improve all products. John Marsman, Eagle Pack The events made both pet food and human food companies more aware of food safety vulnerability. Companies have become more aware that the recalls have heightened pet owner awareness about ingredient quality, ingredient country of origin, where the brand is made, whether they make their own food in their own plant, best manufacturing practices, quality control, and company integrity. It is no longer good enough (and it was never right), for a company to say ingredients are purchased from US companies when that company is a broker that may be importing, or is an importer. The brand should know the origin of ingredients. (Eagle Pack is EU certified, which requires disclosure of the country of origin of the ingredients.) Lucy Postins, The Honest Kitchen The industry has been forced to take a very close look at its ingredient-sourcing and manufacturing practices. Above all, pet food manufacturers (as well as the companies who are actually named on the labels) have been forced to become more accountable for their products and the ingredients that go into them. Ignorance and naivet\u00e9 will no longer be tolerated. Ultimately, the company whose name is on the bag is responsible to the customer. Contract manufacturers are accountable to their clients but it should be the responsibility of the company that takes the public's money, to ensure their products are safe and that their labels are truthful. Ron Rompala, Blue Seal Pet owners [now] have a lower degree of confidence in commercial pet food. Owners are more likely to blame the food for problems that their pets may encounter and are less likely to hesitate to find alternative foods. Have you changed anything about the way you operate your business since the recall? -For example, have you changed the way you source or test ingredients? -Made changes to the manner in which you utilize or oversee contract manufacturers? -Developed a consumer-response plan in case of any future problems? Phil Abreo, Breeder's Choice We continue to test all ingredients and have minimized the few ingredients we source from outside of North America. We continue to require that every vendor certify all ingredients and provide us with a guaranteed analysis. We also test ingredients in our quality control lab and confirm results prior to being utilized during production. We now require the contract manufacturers that make our wet foods to provide us with manufacturing records for all production runs of our wet products. Also, we have reviewed and updated our recall procedures and established a crisis management team to ensure 100 percent implementation of the plan. Peter Atkins, Natura We've always had quality management programs, validated by third-party certifications, that have enabled us to supply our customers with the highest quality and safest products in the industry. Because of the recall we have made a huge investment in new testing protocols for melamine and cyanuric acid. We have also directed our buyers to source ingredients from domestic sources and, in the few cases where an ingredient is only available offshore, we have instituted an elevated level of control and testing. We did make changes to the manner in which we utilize or oversee contract manufacturers [currently, Natura's wet products are made by a contract manufacturer]. We have a heightened presence at their manufacturing facility and have instituted a rigorous quality management program which requires the contractor to prove their quality controls with detailed reports on each production run. We have always had a consumer-response plan as part of our quality management program. Brian Connolly, Castor & Pollux The recalls caused us to really step back and evaluate all aspects of our business from ingredients to providing more information to pet parents. The battery of tests that we run on all of our Organix and Natural Ultramix production has increased to include tests for melamine and cyanuric acid. We have established even tighter quality control standards and are working to augment our staffing in this area, too. We are posting even more information on our website to allow pet parents to make informed purchasing decisions. And we have changed a number of ingredient suppliers and have more detailed protocols related to our expectations of them. Even though this was our first experience with a recall, we already had a consumer-response plan in place but were able to improve upon it as a result of this experience. Most important to us was staying accessible to pet parents and retailers that carried our products. Deborah Ellinger, Wellness We performed a full review of all of our practices, even though we were not impacted by the recall. We already had human-grade auditing processes and controls in place for our manufacturing, along with a robust ingredient sourcing approach, so we did not need to make significant changes to our processes or our manufacturing relationships. However, like most others, we added testing for melamine and other contaminants that were identified in the recall, and we continue to look for improvement opportunities. We also expanded our phone center and added more product information on our website to help consumers get answers to their questions. Since our products were not affected by the recall, we have attracted a lot of new consumers. We have had to step up our production dramatically, and are now spending a lot more time forecasting demand and trying to meet our customers' increased needs. John Marsman, Eagle Pack Naturally we started testing ingredients and both dry and canned food for melamine (everything was negative) and reviewed our \"best manufacturing practices\" plan. Fortunately, due to our program and our EU certification, all safety procedures were in place. While it reaffirmed the way we do business, we also enhanced testing and reviewed sourcing procedures with quality-certified long-term suppliers. We looked to eliminate any China-sourced ingredients, but this is not possible for taurine, glucosamine, and at least one vitamin. Virtually all brands must buy these ingredients from China; I strongly question any brand that states otherwise. Vitamin premixes are comprised of at least 13 vitamins. Of the two biggest vitamin makers in the world, neither one makes all of its own ingredients. They, too, outsource. A responsible pet food maker must know this if it is to be in control. We make all our dry food here in Mishawaka, Indiana. For our contract can manufacturing, we specify high quality ingredients. We did review all procedures and ingredient sourcing with the maker. They will not add or substitute ingredients without asking, and we rejected substitution the times they asked. Lucy Postins, The Honest Kitchen Since our products are made in a human food plant - not in a pet food plant - many of the measures that conventional pet food manufacturers are now adopting were already part of our procedures and protocol. Our production is all under human food standards so ingredient substitutions and formula changes are simply not allowed. That is precisely why we chose a human food plant to make our products. So, we have not really had to change much ourselves in the way of operations. Our company already takes responsibility for directly sourcing, ordering, and paying for 100 percent of its own ingredients; we do not allow the facility that makes our diets to buy ingredients on our behalf. We know our vendors directly and take direct responsibility for what goes into our foods. Although we don't buy or use any of the ingredients that were found to be contaminated (we use meats, not plants, as sources of protein), and we had no reason whatsoever to suspect that there was any risk to our products, we did realize that amid the state of panic that ensued, no company's word alone was good enough. Therefore we decided to implement melamine testing immediately on all finished products. We paid for overnight testing so that we could offer the peace of mind of melamine-free certificates to customers right away (and found it curious that FDA repeatedly stated they would not have results for two weeks). We also put new measures in place to have each of our raw ingredients screened for melamine prior to production. Going forward, melamine screening has been added to the list of routine screens we run on all finished products. Ron Rompala, Blue Seal We have increased our efforts to better know our suppliers. More stringent requirements are in place for new suppliers. We have accelerated establishing HAACP (hazard analysis and critical control points) plans and having plants in condition to be approved by AIB (the American Institute of Baking). We also have performed spot checks for melamine and increased the number of assays for other contaminants such as heavy metals and PCBs. We have increased the size of our customer service department. We did not have any products affected by the recall but we were inundated by phone calls from current customers with concerns and from pet owners that had used products that were recalled and looking for alternatives. We increased the number of people attending the phones and e-mail responses. We established an auto-reply to provide information via e-mail or telephone immediately to concerned customers. I met daily with the people in customer service to keep them updated on the situation and provide information to better answer questions. I also spoke directly with several customers to alleviate technical issues. As I mentioned earlier, pet owners were not hesitating to voice concern and wanted reassurances if their animals exhibited any perceived problems. In your opinion, did consumers overreact? What do you think consumers should do differently in case of future recalls? Phil Abreo, Breeder's Choice The consumer's first concern or priority has to be the safety of their pet. Consumers diligently sought out information through the media, Internet, and in many cases, contacted the manufacturer for information. Consumers acted in a very responsible manner to seek out as much information as possible in order to protect their pets. Peter Atkins, Natura Absolutely not. Perhaps the media can be blamed for creating a panicked frenzy by running constant fear stories without a lot of specific substance in many cases. But one can't really fault pet loving families for responding aggressively and seeking the truth for the health and safety of their companions. And if the end result is that hundreds of thousands of consumers have abandoned formerly trusted products that were perceived as \"premium\" for healthier and safer alternatives, can one really say that is an overreaction? In my opinion, it is an appropriate adjustment to the new realities of the market. God forbid that there is another recall. But should it occur, consumers should gather good, accurate, and truthful information from trusted sources. They should measure very carefully all the information made available and apply this information rationally, without painting every pet food company with the same soiled brush. And consumers should not throw away food packaging until the food has been consumed so that if there is an issue, the proper date code numbers are accessible. Brian Connolly, Castor & Pollux I don't think consumers overreacted at all given what they knew about pet food manufacturing, and given this entire experience was truly terrifying for them. Rolling recalls like these had never occurred before, and there was so much uncertainty as to what the problem was, what brands were affected, and what might be coming next. Certainly some of the misinformation on the Internet blogs didn't help consumers at all. Most assumed that all pet food manufacturers had their own plants; even though this isn't even true of human food producers, it was a shock to many to learn this. I also don't think that most people understood that you can't run \"one test\" to prove something is safe. You need to know what you're testing for and then run the test that is specific to that. And, I think the extent of our global economy was not fully understood. The fact that some ingredients in pet foods just aren't available in this country came as a real surprise to many, too. Our advice to consumers in the case of future recalls: Get to know - now - what the brand stands for that you are feeding your pet. Send the company an e-mail or give them a call to ask questions. Get a sense for how open and honest they are and how quickly they respond to you. See if they have a list that you can be added to for future notification. Deborah Ellinger, Wellness No, consumers did not overreact. They did everything they should have done, like watch the news, check the Internet, and call the 800 numbers. Our animal companions are an important part of our lives and they can't advocate for themselves. Consumers did the right thing by looking out for the pets that depend on them. John Marsman, Eagle Pack No way. They had every reason to react quickly and strongly. They were fed misinformation. Correct information was delayed. And the recalls kept snowballing. Pet owners kept wondering if their food was next. This is a \"perfect storm\" scenario to generate concern and fear among pet owners. Consumers should not wait for another recall. Just as manufacturers must establish ongoing trust with their suppliers, pet owners must establish trust with a pet food brand. Why ever do pet owners keep coming back to a brand that won't tell you where it is made, or another that lies about it three consecutive times? If another recall were to occur, pet owners should get a vet report stating that whatever caused the recall issue was directly related to the problem with their pet, and send it to FDA. Here are questions pet owners should ask in an effort to establish confidence and trust in a brand now, not when the next recall happens: Who makes your food? Will you disclose the country of origin of any ingredient or component? And include every vitamin and nutrient, including taurine and glucosamine? Will you disclose the level of any nutrient in your food if that nutrient is listed in the AAFCO nutrient profiles? Lucy Postins, The Honest Kitchen I don't think it was an overreaction at all. Particularly as things escalated, people just didn't know where to turn next. I don't think any industry has ever seen a recall of that magnitude and scope, with brand after brand being added to the list. People were shocked and disillusioned that the products they were buying were made with the same low-grade ingredients as many generic grocery brands - and then shocked all over again when other companies announced they didn't even know what ingredients were being put in their diets. People found that absolutely absurd, and rightly so. If I didn't have my own brand of pet food to feed my dogs and complete confidence in my finished products, I think I'd have been in tears, too. In the face of a future recall, the most important thing is to know your dog. That way, it's so much easier to spot when something's up. Tune in to how he behaves at meal times. Does he have a voracious appetite or is it usual to eat more gingerly? What do his eyes look like when he's healthy and happy? How do his eyes change when he's under the weather? What are her normal urination and defecation patterns? Pick up poop frequently so you can identify any abnormalities right away; a weekly pickup routine might not reveal blood in the stool quickly enough. The most important thing where the food itself is concerned, is to hold on to lot codes and manufacture dates. We'll be launching some exciting packaging options that address this, in the fall. We have never been proponents of feeding one diet exclusively; feeding a variety of brands and incorporating home-made food into your dog's daily ration may possibly lessen the effects of consuming a contaminated product in the worst-case scenario. The sheer volume of recalled products made this disaster almost impossible to keep up with. Make use of the Internet. Sites like Itchmo and Pet Connection may have saved thousands of lives with their up-to-the-minute recall info. Sign up for alerts right away if a recall strikes and please take responsibility for helping elderly relatives or neighbors, or others without Internet access, keep up to date on which brands are affected. Ron Rompala, Blue Seal Given the situation, owners did not overreact. The media did overreact and hyped the story. You couldn't blame the customers for their concerns considering that they heard that pets were dying and a large number of companies recalled their foods for unknown reasons. To make things worse, the number of products and companies involved with the recall grew daily. I don't believe owners will act or are expected to act any differently if the situation presents itself again. However, you'll see a difference in the response of pet food companies; they will be sensitive to complaints and not make any assumptions. Investigations concerning multiple complaints will be taken very seriously and handled more thoroughly and swiftly. I'm sure that pet food companies that did not have a team to handle situations of this nature before, do now. Phil Abreo, Breeder's Choice While no Breeder's Choice products were involved in any of the recalls, it is troubling that any pet would be exposed to harmful food. Our team of pet nutrition professionals continues to work hard and give maximum effort to provide our customers with the best nutritional and safe products that will provide their pets with a long and healthy lifestyle. Peter Atkins, Natura To buy or build a canning plant so that we can have control over all of our manufacturing. And to keep doing what has made us successful and kept us out of the recall mess - maintain the highest standards for ingredients, processing and quality control. Test, test some more, and then test again. Brian Connolly, Castor & Pollux Continue the work we started as listed above. We've further developed a program related to ensuring our products are safe. Although we're a small, family-owned company, we're committed to producing safe, healthy, natural, and organic products for dogs and cats. We're all pet parents ourselves and take this commitment very, very seriously. Deborah Ellinger, Wellness To continue to raise the bar on all aspects of formulation, ingredient choices, ingredient sourcing, quality control, and doing whatever it takes to help pets lead longer, healthier lives. We want to continue to be a company that consumers trust because they know we will always do whatever it takes to provide excellent natural nutrition for their pets. John Marsman, Eagle Pack We have made a quality food and have been totally forthright with consumers. We have dedicated ourselves to continue on that path to earn the pet owner's trust. Lucy Postins, The Honest Kitchen We have strengthened our resolve to be 100 percent accountable for everything we produce. We always try to put ourselves in the shoes of the customer, and going forward, every decision we make will be influenced by the question, \"How would I feel if I were buying this food, and The Honest Kitchen did this . . . ?\" We want to do only things we can be proud of. < Never take anything for granted. Test, test, test. Partner even more with our vendors to ensure they continue to be committed to our values. Make lots of spot checks and have regular meetings at the manufacturing plant. Ron Rompala, Blue Seal Never feel that a company can do too much quality assurance. Although we did not have any products recalled, you can't feel safe and think that it can never happen to you. [Bee Products Have a Special Meaning for Dogs](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/care/bee-products-have-a-special-meaning-for-dogs/) Bees may sting, but they create some of the world's most valuable, versatile products. Honey, bee pollen, royal jelly, beeswax, propolis, and even the venom from bee stings are all touted for their human health benefits - and many experts say that dogs derive the same advantages. Feeding honey to dogs is nothing new. Juliette de Bairacli Levy, whose [Natural Rearing philosophy](/issues/9_7/features/Holistic_Pet_Care_15822-1.html) has offered alternatives to conventional treatment for over 60 years, recommends honey in all of her animal care books. \"I believe I could not successfully rear domestic dogs without this remarkable antiseptic food,\" she says in The Complete Herbal Handbook for the Dog and Cat. She adds that while honey is not a normal item of diet for carnivores, lions in the wild enjoy honey and it is considered a staple food of the omnivorous bear. \"Honey is the greatest of the natural energizers,\" Levy writes, \"a nerve tonic and a supreme heart tonic . . . Predigested by its makers, the bees, it is absorbed immediately into the bloodstream of the consumer. A diet of only milk and honey can sustain life for months in humans and animals. It has been well and longtime proved that honey is also highly medicinal and will inhibit growth of harmful bacteria in the entire digestive tract and destroy those of a toxic nature.\" Levy recommends fasting animals who are ill to let their digestive organs rest and the body to heal quickly. In addition to water, the only food she recommends for fasting animals is honey. An invert sugar, honey contains mostly glucose and fructose, which are monosaccharides or simple sugars. Monosaccharides are more easily assimilated than the disaccharides and polysaccharides found in table sugar, milk, grains, legumes, and starchy vegetables. A tablespoon of honey supplies 63 calories. Honey does not require refrigeration but keeps best in tightly sealed containers stored away from heat and light. Honey thickens when refrigerated. Depending on the flowers harvested by the bees, honey is light or dark in color, and its flavors vary from delicate to complex. Raw honey contains vitamins A, B-complex, C, D, E, and K, plus calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, potassium, manganese, copper, and iodine, with darker varieties such as buckwheat containing higher mineral levels. Vitamin C levels vary; some honey contains up to 300 milligrams of vitamin C per 100 grams (about 3\u00bd ounces or 7 tablespoons). Honey has been a medicine as well as a food for millennia. Ancient Greek, Assyrian, Chinese, and Roman physicians routinely prescribed it for health and longevity and for conditions such as indigestion, diarrhea, fevers, coughs, colds, flu, asthma, allergies, and ulcers, and as a revitalizing food for athletes, soldiers, and those recovering from illness or injury. Honey is said to increase the absorption of calcium consumed at the same time, help treat or prevent anemia, reduce arthritis pain, and work as a gentle laxative to help prevent constipation. It was also applied topically to treat open wounds, burns, cuts, abrasions, and skin infections. Honey for Dogs Most dogs love the taste of honey, so it's usually easy to feed. Some dogs eat it right off the spoon, some get it in their dinner, and quite a few enjoy their daily honey on toast with butter. In Denison, Texas, 50 miles north of Dallas, beekeeper and companion dog trainer Michele Crouse considers honey the best medicine for her dogs Bonnie, a four-year-old Staffordshire Terrier, and Cracker, a five-year-old yellow Labrador Retriever. \"Bonnie has always had a hard time with allergies,\" Crouse says. \"Her symptoms used to be worst in the spring and early summer, but they continued through the fall ragweed season. She rubbed her face, licked herself, especially on her feet and the inside of her thighs, and scratched on her stomach like crazy, creating dime-sized sores. She itched so much that the vet prescribed [Benadryl](https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/is-benadryl-safe-for-dogs) and prednisone.\" To prevent these attacks, Crouse feeds her dogs a tablespoon of honey twice a day. \"I mix it with their food or feed it directly,\" she says. \"Sometimes I'll give them berries as a snack, with the honey mixed in. Both Bonnie and Cracker love the taste. Otis, our mixed-breed, isn't interested in honey or anything sweet. Fortunately, he doesn't have allergy symptoms.\" Crouse uses raw honey which she strains through a single filter to remove debris. \"Otherwise,\" she says, \"it's straight out of the hive.\" As long as Bonnie receives her daily honey, she remains free of allergy symptoms. \"But if I forget for a week or so,\" says Crouse, \"the symptoms come right back. I know several other dogs who have had the same response. They react to seasonal allergens until their owners put them on honey, and then they're fine.\" Crouse agrees with beekeepers and health experts who have observed that local raw honey works best on allergy symptoms. \"It makes sense,\" she explains. \"When you eat the honey, you ingest minute amounts of local pollen, and after your body adjusts so that it doesn't react to the pollen, you can be exposed to larger amounts, such as when plants or trees are in bloom, without being affected.\" In addition to using honey as a food, Crouse washes her dogs with it. \"I start with a clear, natural shampoo base from an organic supplier,\" she says, \"and mix it with an equal amount of honey to which I've added aloe vera and essential oils like lemon grass, orange, lemon, lavender, tea tree, citronella, and the Asian herb May Chang (Litsea cubeba). All of these plants have disinfecting, deodorizing, or insect-repelling properties. The essential oils make up about 5 percent of the formula, so it's safe for adult dogs and older puppies. To dilute the shampoo and make it easier to use, I add about 25 percent water.\" Crouse says that the resulting shampoo doesn't lather much, but it cleans the dog well and soothes the skin. \"I let it stand for a minute or so, rinse it off, reapply, and then give a final rinse. I board dogs, and if a visiting dog is scratching and itching, I'll give him a bath in honey shampoo, and that always helps.\" In Jacksonville, Oregon, Natural Rearing consultant Marina Zacharias feeds her dogs honey and applies it topically to cuts and wounds. \"The high sugar content of honey is one of the factors that makes it such an excellent infection fighter and wound healer,\" says Zacharias. \"Glucose oxidase, an enzyme in honey, produces hydrogen peroxide, which helps kill harmful bacteria. In addition, there are yet-unidentified substances which bees collect from flowers that give their honey antibacterial properties. For best results, it's important to use raw honey that hasn't had its effectiveness destroyed by processing.\" Clinical trials of burn and injury patients show that the application of honey as a wound dressing rapidly clears infection, inflammation, swelling, pain, and odor while speeding the sloughing off of necrotic tissue (dead skin) and the growth of new skin cells. It remains moist, seals wounds - including skin grafts - and protects them from exposure to air, absorbs pus, reduces scarring, and prevents wounds from sticking to bandages. Unlike other topical antiseptics, honey prevents microbial growth without causing tissue damage. Raw honey eventually crystallizes or solidifies, making it difficult to apply. In addition, honey crystals can feel sharp on tender or inflamed skin. For best results, apply soft or liquid honey. To liquify crystallized honey, stand the jar in hot water until it can be stirred or poured. Microwaving is not recommended because in addition to destroying enzymes and other nutrients, heating honey in a microwave increases its hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content, which adversely affects its flavor. In addition to applying honey to wounds, Zacharias has successfully treated wart-like growths with honey. \"When honey is applied daily, they eventually soften and disappear,\" she says. \"Juliette recommends honey as a treatment for burns. I have personally seen this work, and the healing is remarkable. In one case, a young mixed-breed toy dog tripped his owner and the scalding hot coffee she was carrying burned his back. The skin did not blister but it was very painful and angry looking. Thanks to honey, the dog healed very well, and his hair grew back beautifully.\" The procedure Zacharias recommends is to wash the burned area with vinegar and apply honey thickly every 10 minutes until the pain subsides, then apply light bandages over the area. \"Unfortunately, the hair will need to be clipped away,\" she says, \"and if the dog wants to bother the bandage, you will need to use an Elizabethan or cervical collar.\" On other wounds, Zacharias says, you can apply honey directly without bandaging. If the dog wants to lick it off, try distracting him for 20 minutes or so and give the honey time to be absorbed by the skin. You can reapply it this way three or four times a day. \"Honey applied twice a day healed an open cyst that wouldn't close in one of my older Basset Hounds, Savannah. As soon as I started applying honey, her skin closed over the wound, it healed fast, and we avoided surgery.\" Herbal Honey for Dogs Most dogs enjoy the taste of honey, which simplifies the administration of fresh or dried medicinal herbs. \" [Canine Allergies and Your Dog's Health](/issues/10_5/features/Dog_Skin_Problem_15932-1.html)\" (May 2007) described how the herb cleavers (Galium aparine) helped cured a dog's allergy-related sores on its legs. Several readers who began feeding their dogs cleavers tea reported that the strategy worked for them as well. Brewing tea is one way to add cleavers to your dog's diet, but another is to make an herbal honey. Start by coarsely chopping enough fresh lemon balm, thyme, sage, oregano, lavender, basil, or other herbs to loosely fill a glass jar. Alternatively, fill the jar half full with loosely packed dried herbs. Fill the jar with honey, covering the herbs. If the honey is too thick to pour easily, warm it by placing the honey jar in hot water or heat the honey gently in a saucepan or double boiler just until it is liquid. Seal the jar of herbs and honey and leave it in a warm location, such as a sunny window, for at least two weeks. For a double-strength herbal honey, wait a month or more, then fill another glass jar with herbs, pour the contents of the first jar into the second jar, and let the honey stand another month. If you're in a hurry, heat the honey until it's almost boiling and the pour it over the herbs. The honey won't be raw any more, but it will still contain significant healing properties, and it can be strained and used the same day. Before using herbal honey, filter it through cheesecloth or a strainer to remove plant material and store it at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Add the medicated honey to your dog's food. In addition, keep a small jar of honey (herbal or plain) in your first-aid kit or backpack for use in emergencies. Honey infused with the herbs mentioned above is an effective dressing for cuts, surgical wounds, burns, lick granulomas, abrasions, hot spots, and infected wounds. It can be given orally to prevent infection from viruses or bacteria, soothe a sore throat, help an anxious dog relax, improve sleep, and speed recovery from illness. Added to food, herbal honey helps reduce gas and other symptoms of indigestion. Another way to feed herbs is to mix them with thick raw honey (refrigerate honey for a thicker consistency if necessary) and shape it into small balls that are easy for the dog to swallow. Use the same technique you would to pill a dog. All honey, especially organic raw honey, has medicinal benefits, but the honey best known for its antimicrobial properties is manuka honey from New Zealand. More than 20 years of research have shown it to naturally destroy harmful bacteria such as Staphaureus and Streptococcus (including drug-resistant and Pseudomonas. The veterinary use of manuka honey includes its application as a dressing for burns, amputations, and wounds, and its internal use for gastrointestinal and digestive problems. Can honey be given to dogs with diabetes? Experts disagree as to whether honey has all of white sugar's harmful effects or has a slower blood sugar absorption rate, putting it lower on the glycemic index and making it less likely to disrupt the patient's blood sugar levels. Some tests have shown honey to cause a significantly lower rise in blood sugar, but results vary according to the type of honey used. Discuss this with your holistic veterinarian. Also, consider feeding dark raw local honey or raw organic honey. The safest way to feed a therapeutic tablespoon once or twice a day to dogs with diabetes is to start with smaller amounts and always feed it in combination with fats, which by itself lowers a food's glycemic index. Coconut oil and butter are excellent honey partners. Observe your dog's reaction before increasing the amount and discontinue use if he displays any adverse symptoms. Bee Pollen for Dogs As they collect nectar from flower blossoms, bees also gather pollen, a high-protein food, to carry back to the hive. While doing so, they spread pollen from flower to flower, fertilizing plants so that they produce berries, fruits, nuts, and vegetables. More than 100 crops grown in the US are pollinated by honeybees. Bee pollen, which is collected from hives and sold as a health supplement, has long been prized for its proteins, amino acids, vitamins, enzymes, and other nutrients. Approximately half of its protein is made up of free-form amino acids, which require no digestion; they are immediately absorbed and utilized by the body. It is unusually high in the bioflavonoid rutin, which strengthens capillaries, protects against free radical damage and has anti-inflammatory effects. Proponents claim that bee pollen improves energy, endurance, and vitality, speeds recovery from illness or injury, helps convalescents gain weight, helps the overweight lose weight, reduces cravings and addictions, fights infectious diseases, boosts immunity, improves intestinal function, increases fertility, and helps prevent cancer. Bee pollen is also a widely used remedy for hay fever and allergies. As with raw honey, which contains small amounts of bee pollen, it is said to be most effective when derived from local hives and taken for several weeks prior to allergy season, then continued through the year. This desensitization process begins with tiny amounts, such as a single pollen grain or pellet, and continues in gradually increasing amounts until the maintenance dose, as much as a tablespoon per day for human adults, is reached. Some canine athletes are fed bee pollen to improve their strength and stamina; some owners give it to their dogs as an all-purpose supplement or to prevent allergy symptoms. For best results, avoid inexpensive imported heat-processed pollen in favor of raw, unprocessed pollen from local beekeepers. Fresh bee pollen is slightly moist and requires refrigeration. Like people, dogs can have allergic reactions to bee pollen, including wheezing, breathing problems, and even anaphylactic shock. Start with a single grain of bee pollen and carefully check your dog's response. If he shows no symptoms of discomfort, give two grains the next day, and slowly increase the amount over several weeks to a maintenance dose of 1 teaspoon per 30 pounds of body weight per day, mixed with food. Bee pollen is often blended with honey. Using Royal Jelly on Dogs To appreciate the nutritional value of royal jelly - for bees, at least - consider that all queen bees begin life as worker bees. It is only because they are fed royal jelly and nothing else that they grow larger than worker bees and live far longer. While the average worker bee lives for five to six weeks during summer, queens live for three to six years, laying 2,000 eggs per day. The queen bee's longevity and fertility gave rise to royal jelly's reputation as a miraculous rejuvenator, fountain of youth, and energy enhancer. Modern researchers have substantiated at least some of these claims, describing royal jelly as a metabolic catalyst, a substance that combats fatigue, increases energy, and supports the adrenal glands. Some of royal jelly's components are natural antidepressants. Royal jelly has become a popular supplement for humans and for some canine athletes and breeding dogs. Organic royal jelly is available in natural foods markets. Highly perishable, it requires refrigeration. Most labels recommend taking small amounts, such as \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon once or twice per day between meals on an empty stomach. Adjust the label dose for your dog's weight, dividing it in half for dogs weighing 60 to 80 pounds. Because of its slightly sharp, bitter, biting taste, dogs may not care for royal jelly. Blends of royal jelly and honey, which are also popular, may be more to their liking. Try mixing your own by blending 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) organic royal jelly with 6 ounces (\u00be cup) of local raw honey. Keep refrigerated. Give your dog \u00bd to 1 teaspoon of this blend twice per day, morning and night. Some manufacturers of human and canine grooming products add royal jelly to their shampoos and conditioners, claiming that it enhances hair color and increases volume. Those claims have not been scientifically tested, but royal jelly is certainly a luxury ingredient. Propolis for Dogs Few substances are as antiseptic as propolis, a sticky, resinous material also known as \"bee glue,\" which is gathered from the buds, bark, and leaves of deciduous trees. Bees seal cracks and holes in their hives with propolis to prevent the entrance of intruders and to disinfect or sterilize bees brushing against it. When a mouse or other invader is stung to death in the hive, bees seal the body in propolis, preserving it while keeping the inside of the hive sanitary. Although propolis has been used for millennia to fight infection and improve health, it is unfamiliar to most Americans. However, it's gaining popularity as a natural antibiotic that doesn't disrupt beneficial bacteria or cause other side effects. Propolis, which is rich in bioflavonoids, is effective against viruses, harmful bacteria, yeasts, and fungi. It also has anti-inflammatory properties, helps prevent allergies, and speeds the healing of ulcers and skin problems such as acne, eczema, wounds, cuts, and burns. The only down side of propolis, especially when it comes to treating dogs, is its awful taste. Freeze-dried propolis is sold in capsules, which can be hidden in food, and small amounts of propolis tincture (liquid extract) can be placed in empty two-part gel caps, which are sold in health food stores, just before using. Propolis tincture can help protect dogs from canine flu, kennel cough, and other infectious illnesses. It can be applied to cuts, wounds, burns, bites, stings, hot spots, and lick granulomas (its bitter taste helps deter licking). However, its stickiness can complicate topical application. Mix propolis with a small amount of olive oil to create a less sticky disinfecting salve. Mix it with honey to help heal gum disorders. Beeswax for Dogs Bees produce wax to construct the combs that store honey. Beeswax contains more than 300 different chemicals. It's best known for its use in candles and as an ingredient in cosmetics, floor wax, furniture polish, and salves. The makers of herbal salves often use beeswax as a thickener. Michele Crouse makes body bars by combining beeswax from her hives with coconut oil, avocado oil, cocoa butter, and mango butter. \"They're the consistency of a ChapStick,\" she says, \"and they do a great job of healing sores, moisturizing dry skin, and soothing cracked paw pads.\" Bee Venom Some people pay to get stung by bees or injected with bee venom in medical clinics. Apitherapy, or bee sting therapy, is common in China and gaining popularity in Europe and the US. It is said to alleviate arthritis, other symptoms of inflammation, and allergic reactions to bee stings. Now dried bee venom is being added to some New Zealand honeys and topical creams to provide the benefits of apitherapy without the pain. The theory is that venom that is ingested or applied externally has the same health benefits as venom that's injected. Large-scale venom collection is made possible by a technology developed in Russia and New Zealand in which a bee venom frame is mounted on top of a hive's honey frame. Bees receive a mild shock from the frame's electro-stimulator and in response sting a glass collection sheet. Venom dries on the glass, which is taken to a nearby laboratory for processing. The dried venom is removed from the glass and mixed with honey or used in other bee products. Arthritis is the human condition for which bee venom honey is said to be most effective, but bee venom honey success stories include the treatment of auto-immune disorders, shingles, tennis elbow, bursitis, lower back pain, ligament injuries, premenstrual syndrome, and other conditions. Bee venom honey is said to support the body's natural coritsol levels, increase blood flow through affected joints, and inhibit the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that increase inflammation. New Zealand honey producers have received testimonials describing dogs whose arthritis, hind end weakness, torn ligaments, and even hip dysplasia improved as a result of using bee venom honey. Bees Are in Serious Danger... For the past two decades, Juliette de Bairacli Levy has asked her followers not to use honey or other products from honeybees because these helpful insects are under so much environmental stress. Between pesticides, mite infestations, foulbrood disease, hive-damaging moths, and other problems, bee populations have dramatically fallen across North America. Now Colony Collapse Disorder is destroying entire hives. Bees look healthy one day and disappear the next, becoming too weak to return to their hives. In most cases, the victims have been raised for commercial crop pollination, given supplemental feedings containing white sugar, and exposed to chemical pesticides. At the same time, organic beekeepers and beekeepers who feed their bees disinfecting essential oils report that their hives stay healthy even in areas where Colony Collapse Disorder has become common. In her many years as a beekeeper, Levy prevented bee diseases by growing disinfecting herbs near her hives. \"The bees themselves are natural herbalists,\" she wrote, \"and will gorge themselves on bitter rue or pungent lavender and rosemary. My bees enjoyed excellent health and possessed complete resistance to the many diseases afflicting the local white-sugar-fed bees.\" Local organic honey, if you can find it, can be an excellent addition to your dog's diet and health care. A good second choice is organic honey from nearby states. CJ Puotinen is author of The Encyclopedia of Natural Pet Care, Natural Remedies for Dogs and Cats, and other books.

[Canine Lipomas](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/canines-and-lipomas/) Lumps, bumps, canine fatty tumors - call them what you will, but nobody likes to see her dog develop lipomas, those persistent little foothills that can sprout up on older dogs - and sometimes, not so-old ones. Often soft and squishy to the touch, benign fatty tumors are not a threat to your dog's health. (The exception is infiltrative lipomas, which can invade muscle tissue, but these are relatively rare.) While lipomas can be unsightly, many vets opt not to remove them unless they are in a location where their growth impedes a dog's mobility. But many holistic veterinarians see lipomas as far from innocuous. Instead, they stress, lipomas are symptoms of a bigger problem. Holistic view \"For conventional veterinarians, lipomas are just something that happens, just like cancer happens,\" says Marty Goldstein, DVM, of Smith Ridge Veterinary Center in South Salem, New York, author of The Nature of Animal Healing: The Definitive Holistic Medicine Guide to Caring for Your Dog and Cat. \"What they don't get is that lipomas are a result of what we've done to depress the metabolic functions and immune system of the animal.\" Dr. Goldstein believes that lipomas are a sign of improper fat digestion and a haywire metabolism, and that they often result from the unnatural commercial dog food diets that have become the norm today. \"We've laden dog food with 50 to 65 percent carbohydrates, even though in nature wolves eat perhaps 1 to 3 percent grains.\" While few (if any) conventional veterinary practitioners would agree with this assessment (see \"Conventional Medical Opinion,\" next page), consider the case of Tembo, a Rhodesian Ridgeback who had his first lipoma before the tender age of one. Fed kibble and then a homemade diet heavy in grains and carbs, Tembo had constant allergies - corn gave him hives, and wheat summoned forth blistering yeast infections on his feet and in his ears. \"For the first seven years, the lipomas popped up like mushrooms,\" remembers his owner, Elizabeth Akers of Concord, California, who had about 20 lipomas surgically removed from Tembo's rib cage, legs, and chest. Some of the growths were small, others were tangerine-sized. \"One on his groin was growing faster than the speed of light.\" Then, at age 7, Akers switched Tembo to a raw diet - and the lipomas responded as if she had flipped an \"off\" switch. \"By the time he died at age 12, the only lipomas he had were in four places where they had been removed and had grown back again,\" she remembers. \"He had no new ones.\" Holistic veterinarians are quick to note that diet changes are not miracle cures: As in Tembo's case, they may slow or even stop the growth of existing lipomas, or cause them to \"organize,\" or shrink. But expecting a wholesale disappearance of them is likely unrealistic. Success is relative, Dr. Goldstein says. \"If a lump is growing three inches every six months,\" and after you make modifications in your dog's diet and lifestyle, \"it still gets bigger but it's only growing one inch in that time frame, then you're moving in the right direction.\" Holistic medicine doesn't see diseases as unrelated entities that swoop in to disrupt health like so many flying monkeys at Oz. Instead, disease - or any disruption of the body's functioning, no matter how seemingly mild, like lipomas - is a manifestation of a weakness with the body itself. In other words, there's a Wicked Witch of the West lurking in the backdrop acting as dispatcher. Simply put, lipomas are a sign that there are deeper issues behind the scenes. Many systems of healing have a name for the life energy that flows through the body and maintains good health. In homeopathy, for example, it is called the vital force. But no matter what you label it, what's clear to holistic vets is that lipomas are evidence of the fact that the vital force is weakened and perhaps blocked - and likely has been for some time. \"One sign of vitality is the expression of symptoms, because that's the body's attempt to bring itself into balance,\" explains classically trained homeopathic vet Michael Dym, VMD, of Morristown, New Jersey. By contrast, \"lipoma patients have very weak symptoms,\" as the body struggles to externalize its internal conflict in a kind of slow boil. In this scenario, \"the patient has been ill on a deeper level for some time - it's just that they don't have adequate reactions, and have a very weak development of symptoms.\" For that reason, lipomas are not easy to treat, because making changes on that deep and profound a level doesn't happen overnight. \"From a homeopathic perspective, any sort of lump or growth is generally thought to be an outcome of vaccinosis,\" or the adverse effects of vaccination on the body, Dr. Dym continues. \"Animals that are ill from prior vaccinations can have chronic warts, skin tags - and fatty tumors and lipomas.\" That's not to say that you will be able to draw a direct line from last month's rabies vaccine to your dog's new growths. Instead, \"we look at them as an outcome of weakness in a patient who's not in the best health,\" Dr. Dym says, because the life force has been affected by vaccines or toxins such as pesticides. You're outta here - not! Lipomas can be unsightly, and some owners might be tempted to remove them for pure aesthetics. But because surgery only treats the symptom of the problem, not its root, most holistic veterinarians avoid it, except for lipomas that are so large or awkwardly placed that they impede a dog's quality of life. \"The risk of removing the growth surgically is that it leaves the uncured disease to manifest at a deeper level, in a different form,\" Dr. Dym warns. And from a homeopathic perspective, \"when you remove a growth, you stimulate the vital force to greater activity. You can't cure an apple tree of growing apples by cutting off its branches.\" In fact, you might spur it to blossom even more profusely. And most lipomas tend to recur anyway. While Dr. Goldstein agrees, he has had to remove lipomas that were in a compromising position, such as behind the nasal cavity, where they could obstruct breathing. \"Lipomas have their own finite capsule - you just scoop them out,\" he says. A technique he employs during such surgeries is to roughen the tissue area around the lipoma, creating an inflammatory response. \"This creates scar tissue that prevents the lipoma from growing back\" - on that spot, at least. Individualistic treatment The classic homeopathic remedy used to treat tumors - and, while they are benign, lipomas are tumors - is Thuja, which is also often used for vaccine reactions. But Dr. Dym cautions against such a paint-by-number approach: Because lipomas are a symptom of a deep-seated imbalance in the body, he suggests a consultation with a homeopath to find the proper constitutional remedy - one that takes into account your dog's own individuality - and treat the dog over time. Taking the wrong remedy - even one that might seem to fit the picture - \"might stimulate a reaction that could highlight or activate\" the very things you are trying to resolve, he warns. Traditional Chinese medicine has a different name for this life force that animates us all: chi. But that ancient modality also interprets lipomas as symptoms of a deeper imbalance. \"In Traditional Chinese veterinary medicine, lipomas are a type of 'dampness' called 'phlegm' that has stagnated in a particular area, usually an acupuncture channel such as the Gallbladder channel,\" explains veterinarian Bruce Ferguson, DVM, MS, a practitioner and instructor in traditional Chinese veterinary medicine based in Perth, Australia. \"Issues of 'damp' are usually, in the case of lipomas, caused by improper diet leading to a damage to the gastrointestinal system,\" which is governed by the Spleen/Stomach meridian. In traditional Chinese medicine, this channel \"is responsible for moving a type of post-ingestive fluid around the body,\" Ferguson continues. When a dog is fed a grain-based diet high in refined carbohydrates - as opposed to a more natural, meat-based diet - the channel gets clogged, and \"gooey.\" In addition to dietary change, Dr. Ferguson says lipomas can be addressed with herbal formulas that tonify the spleen and resolve phlegm and dampness; acupuncture to help restore the movement of chi through the body, particularly the Spleen, and reverse stagnation; and occasionally gentle, non-traumatic massage such as Tui Na. For his part, Goldstein sometimes prescribes Chi- Ko/Curcuma, a Chinese-herb formula indicated for resolving masses, specifically lipomas. He also considers nutritional supplements such as L-carnitine and chromium picolinate, which assist in fat metabolism, as well as a product called Mega Lipo-Tropic, which helps digest and burn fat. Ditto for digestives enzymes that contain ox bile, a powerful fat emulsifier. Improve basic health No matter what modality you choose to deal with the underlying imbalances that might cause your dog's lipomas, all dogs will benefit from these commonsense basics: good nutrition in the form of a biologically appropriate diet; good mental health, with a lifestyle that provides stimulating play, problem-solving, and social interaction; and no exposure to unnecessary vaccinations or toxins such as pesticides. And don't forget exercise, Goldstein adds. \"The only way to burn fat is to get your body - and your dog's - up to its aerobic potential,\" he says. In the end, then, the good news about lipomas is that they aren't life-threatening. But they are a signal that something is askew in your dog's body. \"When I was in veterinary college, lipomas were described as benign masses that merely had a statistical rate of occurrence and did not 'mean anything,' \" Dr. Ferguson says. By contrast, traditional Chinese medicine teaches that \"anything out of the ordinary has meaning, and usually indicates some type of imbalance.\" The task of the practitioner - and the observant, committed owner - is to discover and correct it.

[Heat Stroke in Dogs](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/care/heat-stroke-in-dogs/) [Updated July 16, 2018] DOGS AND HEAT STRESS: OVERVIEW 1. Never leave your dog in a car parked in the sun. 2. Watch for symptoms of heat stress and if they occur, give immediate first aid and go to the nearest veterinary clinic. 3. When temperatures climb, provide extra drinking and splashing water. 4. Plan exercise and outdoor play when temperatures are coolest. Hot weather spells trouble for dogs. Because they can't release heat by sweating the way humans do, heat and humidity can raise canine body temperatures to dangerous levels. Heat stroke kills, and heat stress (a less severe condition) can take a serious toll on a dog's health. Unfortunately, heat-related problems are among the most common summer canine ailments. Conscientious caregivers plan ahead and do everything they can to keep their dogs safe in the heat. Here are some strategies and products for helping hot dogs chill out. To reduce canine summer heat stress, let your dog become accustomed to climate changes naturally and gradually, the way animals adapt in the wild. Schedule long walks for the coolest time of the day but spend a few minutes outdoors during warmer hours, too. Unless your climate is dangerously hot, your dog can be comfortable for short periods. Summer daytime temperatures are coolest at dawn and dusk. Just after sunrise and just before sunset are the best times to take your dog for a run or a long walk. Humidity matters as much as temperature; in fact, a combination of high humidity and moderate temperatures can stress a dog as much as mid-day sun. Always watch for signs of stress. Dogs pant to release heat, so if your dog pants more heavily than usual, slow down, stop, find shade, offer water, and rest for a while. Ideal dog exercise locations are shaded parks or lawns near a pond, river, creek, or pool. Beaches are usually cooler than inland areas, and both lakes and oceans (assuming conditions are safe for swimming) allow dogs to cool off whenever they like. Whether your dog is a wader or swimmer, let him rest in the shade after playing in water. At home, a plastic wading pool can be a perfect place to dip and chill. Whenever temperatures climb, provide extra drinking water. Your dog's panting cools him by releasing body heat, but this process also can dehydrate his body. To encourage a hot dog to drink on hot days, resupply his cold water. Some people fill a dog bowl or bucket and freeze it overnight. As it melts during the day, it provides a steady supply of refreshing, cold water (check to make sure it melts quickly enough to provide as much water as he might wish to drink). Alternatively, or in addition, freeze or simply chill water in the refrigerator in a plastic water bottle and add the melting or chilled contents to your dog's water periodically throughout the day. Change your dog's water more often during hot weather and add ice cubes to your dog's bowl. Many hot dogs enjoy curling up with a nice cold ice pack. A frozen plastic water bottle stays cool for hours. Dogs who use frozen water bottles as pillows cool down quickly, since blood circulates close to the surface at the neck and throat. For summer comfort, nothing beats the shade of trees, so as you plan the day's activities, look for parks, play areas, picnic tables, and hiking trails that are sheltered from direct sunlight. At home, if your dog doesn't have a dog door or easy access in and out, be sure he has shade to rest in and ample water supplies. The sun's angle changes with the seasons, so be aware of shifting shade patterns. Providing shade is most important between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Ventilation and air circulation are crucial when dogs are confined to pens, crates, and kennels. Solid walls interfere with air circulation while chain link fencing, screens, or mesh fabric allow the air to move. Shade covers help reduce heat loads, and fans that circulate air have a cooling effect. Study the forecast as you schedule play dates and outdoor events. When heat and humidity are high, save outdoor activities for breaks in the weather or days with lower humidity. As all Whole Dog Journal readers know, it's never safe to leave a dog in a parked vehicle. The inside of a car parked in the sun, even with its windows down, can increase by several degrees per minute, quickly reaching 125\u00b0F or even 150\u00b0F. Keep your dog well groomed, with frequent brushing to remove dead hair, especially the undercoat. Some long-haired or heavy-coated dogs feel much more comfortable with short summer cuts, keeping in mind that dogs whose coats are shaved or cut very short are at risk for sunburn. Heat Stress Risks to Dogs Heat stress, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke or heat prostration are increasingly severe levels of the same basic condition. Any dog can suffer from heat stress, but dogs who are most susceptible include the very young and old; any dog with a history of heat stress; breeds with flat faces or short noses; and dogs who are overweight, physically inactive, have cardiovascular disease, or respiratory problems. Some prescription drugs may increase the risk. Though dogs cannot sweat and humans do sweat, [heat risk factors between us are quite similar](/issues/10_8/features/Canine-Heat-Stroke-Prevention_15954-1.html). The symptoms of heat stress include profuse panting, salivation, an anxious expression, staring without seeing, failing to respond to commands, skin that is warm and dry, fever, rapid pulse, fatigue or exhaustion, muscular weakness, and physical collapse. The symptoms of heat stroke or heat prostration can include a warm nose and foot pads, glazed eyes, heavy panting, rapid pulse, a dark red tongue, fever, dizziness, vomiting or diarrhea, immobility, and unconsciousness. Brain damage occurs when the body's temperature reaches 106\u00b0 to 107\u00b0F. A dog's normal temperature is 100.5\u00b0 to 101.5\u00b0F. If your dog experiences any of the above symptoms, provide immediate first aid. Your rapid response may save your dog's life. Reduce your dog's temperature by moving her into shade and immersing her gradually into cool water, such as in a stream, pond, fountain, horse trough, bath tub, or wading pool. Otherwise, wet the dog thoroughly, pouring a continuous stream of cool water over her body, beginning with the head and extremities, from a hose, watering can, bottle, or pan. If possible, apply ice packs to her head and neck. Apply wet towels to her abdomen, groin, legs, head, and neck. If you can, take your dog's temperature and continue applying cool wet towels until it returns to normal. As soon as possible, take your dog to a veterinary clinic. Even if she seems to have recovered, her body temperature could increase again; heat stress always carries a risk of brain damage; and depending on the dog's age, physical condition, and the amount of time spent with an elevated temperature, complications can occur. Cooling Vests for Dogs Available There's no shortage of special equipment to help keep dogs cool. Pet supply catalogs and websites sell everything from cooling crate pads to water-retaining scarves, battery operated or solar powered fans, mesh beds, solar shade sheets, special hats, and cooling mats. Now cooling vests are becoming popular. Made from different materials and operating on different cooling principles, these garments are designed to keep dogs from overheating. Do they work? To help us find out, we recruited Bridgeport, Connecticut, dog trainer Deborah Lee Miller-Riley and her Portuguese Water Dog, Skyler, to test some popular models. Miller-Riley competes with her dogs in water sports and runs Splash Camps and Splash Workshops across the country (see k9watersports.com for more information). Skyler is an 11-year-old male who weighs 61 pounds and had a 3-inch-thick wavy coat until we finished our tests, when he got a short, cooling summer cut. Each vest was tested on a sunny, warm day with some cloud cover, in temperatures ranging from 83 to 85\u00b0F, humidity near 45 percent, and very mild winds. The walks lasted 30 to 35 minutes for each vest tested, ending at a stream where Skyler cooled his legs before returning by the same route. All of the vests come in different sizes, with size charts based on weight and measurements such as girth (chest at its widest part), neck, back length, or length from front leg to back leg. Skyler's correct size, depending on the manufacturer, was medium, large, or extra large. Because his measurements often fell near a size change, we supplied all of his statistics when ordering, asking the seller to send his best size. Two had to be returned for size replacement, and one more should have been. Miller-Riley's observations apply to Skyler's experiences with the vests. Several of the vests reviewed here were designed for or are used by military, search and rescue, police, and working dogs. Results may vary for smaller or larger dogs, dogs of different breeds, engaged in different activities, or in other climates. [RPCM Cooling Vest](http://www.glaciertek.com/shop-by-use/chilly-dog/) RPCM stands for Glacier Tek's Renewable Phase Change Material, which is made from food-grade fats and oils. RPCM cool packs recharge in 20 minutes in ice water. Inserted into the Vest, they are said to maintain a steady 59\u00b0F temperature for two to three hours, even in 100-degree weather. Glacier Tek also offers a Chilly Pad for dogs to lie on. According to its manufacturer, the vest was developed for firefighters and adapted for military working dogs in Iraq. The black nylon vest comes in two sizes, Chilly Dog ($159) and Chilly Pup ($129). Skyler wore the larger size, which adjusts for chest girths of 28 to 46 inches. Miller-Riley reports, \"We tested this vest when the temperature was 82\u00b0 and the humidity 56 percent. The cool packs cover the abdomen, and the vest is held in place with straps over the chest and back. There was no change in Skyler's panting from start to finish. He did not go for a swim, just got his feet wet. His skin stayed cool under the rib cage covered by the vest. \"This product, which seems to be designed only for large dogs, is medium-weight and simple to use, but you have to cool or refrigerate the gel-like cells. I didn't like its large plastic snaps resting on my dog's spine, though he didn't seem to care.\" [Chillybuddy](http://www.chillybuddy.com/) A light-weight mesh jacket made of woven plastic with an aluminized finish (a fabric originally designed for greenhouse shade cloths), this highly reflective vest is lined with breathable cotton mesh. Chillybuddy comes in seven sizes, from petite to extra-extra large. Using Skyler's neck and girth measurements, we ordered size medium, which cost $33. We should have used the third measurement that Chillybuddy uses to determine size; the length of the dog's back. As you can see in the photo above, the size we ordered was too short to cover Skyler's back, and we ran out of time to return this and order the correct size. A company representative belatedly suggested using the back length as the critical measurement, as the neck and girth straps are highly adjustable. According to Chillybuddy's maker, the vest can reduce a dog's coat temperature almost 30 percent on a 90-degree day. Soaking it before use dampens the cotton lining, which holds water for evaporative cooling. Miller-Riley says, \"It was slightly cooler (72 degrees) when we tested this product, so we walked for an hour rather than our usual 30 minutes. Skyler stayed comfortable throughout. \"This coat is easy to use, lightweight, and it folds up and packs well. The shade cloths I use for my tent and car are made of the same kind of fabric, which really reflects heat, and the mesh circulates air well. A full strap goes around the belly, anchored with belt loops, and Velcro strips allow further adjustment. \"However, both the front and back kept flipping up and always seemed to need adjusting. Perhaps this would not be the case if we had ordered the correctly sized coat.\" Beware of Cooling Your Dog in Bodies of Water: Blue-Green Algae Can Kill Water is wonderful, but not if it's toxic. When conditions promote the growth or \"bloom\" of toxic blue-green algae in lakes and ponds, animals can die. In the U.S. and Canada, blue-green algae blooms have claimed the lives of deer, elk, livestock, and dogs soon after drinking algae-infected water. [Get the full scoop on blue-green algae here](/issues/10_8/features/Algae-Blooms-Can-Kill_21260-1.html). Conclusions on Cooling Your Dog At the end of their research, Miller-Riley concluded, \"All in all, Skyler seems to be cooled best by jumping into a body of water or having a gallon jug of water poured over him. I am not sure I would put my money down for any of these coats. However, the Radic vest from Japan was affordable, easy to use, provided some cooling, and my dog didn't have to get wet for it to be effective. \"Most wild canines do not venture forth in the hottest part of the day. They seek cool spots in the earth or under vegetation until the sun goes down. It's wonderful that so many products are being developed to help working dogs in adverse conditions, but where pets are concerned, keeping them cool involves a certain amount of common sense. Why drag a dog out into the heat unless it's to go for a swim or a wade?\" CJ Puotinen is author of The Encyclopedia of Natural Pet Care, Natural Remedies for Dogs and Cats, and other books.

[Dogs and Puppies Chew For a Number of Reasons, Learn to Properly Channel This Activity](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/behavior/dogs-and-puppies-chew-for-a-number-of-reasons-learn-to-properly-channel-this-activity/) Puppies are notorious for their ability to chew on anything and everything. If you're at all dog-savvy you know when you get a new puppy that despite your best efforts to manage and supervise, you're likely to lose at least one valuable personal possession to the razor-sharp implements known fondly as puppy teeth. Puppies chew to explore their world as well as to relieve the pain and irritation of teething. What many dog owners don't seem to realize is that while puppies sooner or later get beyond the stage where they feel compelled to put their teeth on everything they see, mature dogs also need to chew to exercise their jaws, massage their gums, clean their teeth, and to relieve stress and boredom. It comes as an unpleasant surprise to many owners that chewing doesn't end at the age of six months when all of the dog's adult teeth are grown in. The wolf, ancestor and cousin to our dogs, chewed to survive. His meals weren't served to him as measured rations of kibble in a stainless-steel bowl. Long ago, as a member of a canine social group he used his strong teeth and jaws to bring down his prey. He chewed through tough moose hide to consume the life-sustaining flesh beneath. He crushed elk leg bones with powerful jaws and teeth to slurp up the rich, tasty marrow inside. He chewed to eat, to live. Neither tens of thousands years of domestication nor a recent switch to processed foods have extinguished the adult dog's need and desire to chew. Many dogs continue a significant amount of vigorous adolescent chewing until the age of 18 to 24 months as those teeth continue to mature, and then still chew, but with somewhat less intensity, as they age. Chewing is as basic a behavior to a puppy as a human baby sucking on a pacifier. Humans, as they grow, transition to sucking on thumbs, then lollipops, straws, sports bottles, and perhaps cigarettes. Dogs, like us, can learn to transition to appropriate objects for mature oral attention, but they never completely outgrow the need to gnaw. Given the opportunity, mature dogs will chew for as long as they live and have teeth to chew with. Case in point: Katie, our 15-year-old Australian Kelpie who can barely hear, has difficulty walking, and whose vision is failing, still happily chews raw bones and chicken wings right alongside her younger packmates. How to build good chew habits Puppies develop substrate preferences for elimination in the early months of their lives, and they similarly develop chew-object preferences. Hence the inadvisability of giving your old shoes or socks as chew toys. If you give your baby dog the run of the house and he learns to chew on Oriental carpets, sofa cushions, and coffee table legs, you will likely end up with a dog who chooses to exercise his jaws and teeth on inappropriate objects for years to come. You'll find yourself crating him frequently even as an adult dog, or worse, exiling him to a lonely life in the backyard, where he can chew only on lawn furniture, loose fence boards, and the edges of your deck and hot tub. Instead, focus your dog's fangs on approved chew toys at an early age and manage him well to prevent access to your stuff. In this way, he'll earn house privileges much sooner in life. By the end of his first year, you'll probably be able to leave him alone safely while you go out to dinner or shopping - or even while you're away at work. As long as he still snags the occasional shoe, knick-knack, or other off-limits possession for a mid-day gnaw, it's too soon to give your dog unfettered freedom. When you're home, he needs to always be under your direct supervision. You may need to keep him on a leash or a tether, or simply close the door of the room you're in so he's shut in with you and can't wander into the parlor to shred your grandmother's antique lace doily while your back is turned. If you're otherwise too occupied to supervise, put him in his crate or exercise pen to keep him out of trouble. At the same time, supply him with \"legal\" chew objects to keep his needle-sharp puppy teeth appropriately occupied. Stuffed Kongs, Buster Cubes, and Busy Buddies are just a few of the many interactive toys available that can keep your dog's teeth and mind acceptably busy. If you consistently supply him with desirable and acceptable chew objects, he'll eventually develop a strong preference for chewing on those same objects. He will seek these items out when he feels the need to gnaw, and ultimately your personal possessions will be safe, even when your back is turned. Select an individually appropriate chew product Because different dogs chew with different levels of intensity, it is impossible to make definitive statements about which types of chew products are appropriate for your particular dog. The safety of chew objects such as rawhide, various bones, pig ears, and cow hooves is a hotly debated topic. Rope tugs are wonderful chew toys for some dogs, but others chew off and ingest the strings and risk serious gastrointestinal complications, even death. Check with your own veterinarian and follow his/her recommendations regarding the use of these and other chew items for your dog. Regularly check the condition of any chew toys you do give your dog, and discard them when they begin to show signs of wear and tear. One of the basic tenets of positive dog training is that it's much easier to teach the dog what to do rather than what not to do. If you program your dog's chew preferences early in life by consistently directing his attention - and teeth - to appropriate objects and preventing his access to inappropriate ones, you won't have to constantly tell him he's chewing on the wrong things. Interactive toys can help here too. A stuffed Kong suspended just out of your dog's reach can keep him occupied and work off excess energy as he jumps and grabs at the tempting prize. Instead of giving him his bowl of food in the morning, fill the Buster Cube with his kibbles and make him work for his meal by pushing cube around to make the food fall out. He won't have the time, energy, or desire to shred your grandmother's antique afghan if he's out \"hunting\" for his breakfast! Note: Some destructive chewing and other related inappropriate behaviors are a result of isolation distress or separation anxiety rather than \"normal\" chewing. Such chewing is often - but not exclusively - directed toward door and window frames, and occurs only outside of the owner's presence, by a dog who shows signs of stress at the signs of his owner's pending departure. Separation anxiety dogs often don't crate well either, which makes managing the destructive behavior even more challenging. If you think your dog's chewing is related to separation anxiety or isolation distress, you'll need to work with a qualified, positive dog training professional to modify the behaviors. Teach your dog to trade You can reduce the risk of damage to occasional ill-gotten items by teaching your pup to exchange toys for treats, using something he loves that he's allowed to have, such as a favorite chew toy or a food-stuffed Kong. The key to this game is he learns that if he gives something up, he gets something better in return and he gets the original thing back as well. Two rewards for the price of one! Then, when he has a forbidden object, he's more likely to bring it to you to trade than to drag his prize to his cave under the dining room table for a leisurely chew. The rare occasion that he doesn't get \"the thing\" back won't be enough to overcome the programming you've done by playing the \"trade\" game with him frequently. In order for this to work, you have to stop playing \"chase the puppy\" when he grabs the sofa cushion or some other forbidden object. This is often an attention-getting behavior; he's learned that grabbing \"your\" toys and dashing off with them initiates a rousing play session. Here's what you do: 1. Offer him his well-stuffed Kong and say, \"Take it!\" Have him on a leash if you think he'll run off with it. 2. Give him a little while to get fully engaged in chewing, and then say \"Give!\" or \"Trade!\" in a cheerful tone of voice and offer him a handful of irresistible treats, such as small bits of chicken or cheese. 3. Hold the treats under his nose and let him sniff. It may take him several seconds to think about it, but eventually he should drop his Kong and start eating the treats. Don't let him gulp them! Hold the tidbits so he can only take them one by one. 4. When he drops the Kong, say, \"Yes!\" 5. While he is still nibbling, reach down with your other hand and pick up the toy. 6. Let him nibble a bit longer, then offer him the Kong again. 7. Repeat the exercise several times. Then end the game by giving him back his Kong and letting him chew to his heart's content. 8. Play this game at every opportunity, whenever he's engaged in chewing on his toys on his own, or whenever you feel like initiating the game, until he'll give up his chew object easily on your \"give\" cue. Troubleshooting What if the game doesn't always go as smoothly as you might like? Here are some of the challenges you may face: Your dog may not be willing to drop his toy in exchange for the treats in your hand. Try dropping the treats on the floor in a little Hansel-and-Gretel-trail. Lots of dogs are more willing to give up their valued possession if the treats are within easy reach on the floor. Then, while he is following the trail to your hand that's still holding a reservoir of treats, pick up the Kong with your other hand. Your dog may lose interest in his toy after he realizes you have yummy treats in your hand. Try using less valuable treats, or a more valuable chew toy. Or simply play the game when he happens to be chewing on one of his toys. Your dog may be a resource guarder. If he growls, snaps, or even stiffens and looks angry when you try to trade with him, you should STOP practicing this exercise and seek the help of a qualified and positive training professional to help you resolve the resource guarding challenge. (For more on resource guarding, see \" [Eliminate Aggressive Dog Guarding Behaviors](/issues/4_9/features/5390-1.html),\" September 2001.) Meanwhile, supervise him very closely to prevent his access to forbidden objects so you don't put yourself at risk for being bitten because you have to take something away from him. Stop puppy chewing by teaching your dog to leave it You can also teach your dog to respond to your cue to leave something alone before he sinks his sabers gum-deep into a treasured possession. To teach \"leave it,\" have your dog on leash in front of you. Show him a tasty treat, tell him \"Leave it!\", and let him see you place it under your shoe. Freeze-dried liver cubes work well for this; they are high-value for the dog, but firm enough that they aren't easily squished under your foot. Your dog will probably dig, claw, and even chew at your foot to try to get the treat. Let him. This is an exercise in patience for you as well as an exercise in \"Leave it!\" for him. Be sure to wear durable shoes for this exercise. Sandals may leave you with bloody toes, and patent leather will be permanently scratched. Your dog may give up easily when he realizes he can't get the treat, or he may be very persistent. Either way, you're just going to wait for him to give up. The instant he looks away from your foot, \"mark\" the moment with the click of a clicker or word such as \"Yes!\" and feed him a very tasty treat. If he continues to look away from your foot, keep clicking and treating at a high rate of reinforcement - lots of clicks and treats. If he returns his attentions to the treat under your foot, just wait for him to look away again. Do not repeat the cue. When he looks away again, click and treat - again, at a high rate of reinforcement. When he can control his urge to maul your foot for at least five seconds, carefully move your foot off the treat. If he tries to grab it, simply cover it back up with your foot. You don't need to repeat the \"Leave it\" cue. In a surprisingly short time, he'll ignore the treat on the floor. Now pick it up, show it to him again, repeat the \"Leave it!\" cue and try it under your foot again, still with a high rate of reinforcement. Remember to keep your cue cheerful; you're not trying to intimidate him away from the forbidden object; you're just giving him information. When he's reliably ignoring the treat, you can move a few inches away from it. Don't get too confident! The farther you move from the treat, the more likely he is to think it's okay for him to have it. Take it slow. Set him up to succeed, and in time you'll be able to tell him \"Leave it\" and leave the object unattended. You can translate this exercise to real life as soon as your dog understands to look away from the object when he hears the \"Leave it!\" cue. Set some tempting items on the floor, put him on leash, and walk him past the objects, just out of reach. The instant he looks at an object, say \"Leave it!\" in a cheerful tone, and stand still. He may stare at and strain toward the object. Just wait. When he gives up and looks away from the forbidden object, click and treat. Then continue toward the next object. When he'll do this reliably without the leash tightening at all, you're ready to try it off leash. Then, as you supervise your pup's antics, if you see him coveting an inappropriate object, just say, \"Leave it!\" in that cheerful tone, and be ready to click and treat when he turns back toward you. Once you've taught your dog the \"trade\" and \"leave it\" games, the rest is up to you. Of course, you'll continue to supervise him closely to minimize his access to forbidden objects and redirect his attention when you see him covet an inappropriate one. If, however, he does happen to find something he's not supposed to have, odds are he'll bring it to you to exchange for something better. Next time you see your dog with Aunt Ida's antique lace doily in his mouth, instead of going into \"Omigod the puppy has the doily!\" panic mode, walk to the refrigerator, take out a bag of his favorite treats, and calmly initiate the trade game. You'll be surprised by how easy it is. Why do adult dogs chew? On occasion, an adult dog who has been trustworthy with his chewing habits may suddenly surprise you with an oral foray into the forbidden. This may be a stress response to something environmental happening in your absence, such as a burglar trying to break into your home, loud equipment working in the street in front of your house, or stray dogs romping through your yard. Sometimes even something like a compelling need to urinate or defecate can stress a well-trained dog into inappropriate chewing. If you can determine the nature of the stressor and control or remove the cause, your dog should quickly revert to his prior good chewing behavior. He might also need a refresher course in the crate, after a veterinary exam to rule out possible medical causes. (Anytime there's a significant behavior change in an adult dog it's important to rule out - or treat - any possible medical contributors to the undesirable behavior.) A return to inappropriate chewing may be a result of inactivity and pent-up energy. Perhaps the weather's been bad or your workload extra heavy, curtailing your normal exercise sessions with your canine companion. That energy has to go somewhere - and for some dogs, it goes right to their jaws. The solution here is a renewed commitment to provide adequate exercise, with the addition, perhaps, of mental exercise into your dog's daily routine. (See \" [How to Play Tug-of-War With Your Dog](/issues/7_10/features/Tug-o-War_15660-1.html),\" October 2004, for a list of activities for low-mobility games.) You may also have misjudged your dog's maturity, giving him a little too much freedom a little too soon. When we went to Australia last October for two weeks, I left detailed instructions with our pet-sitter, including a caution that Bonnie, our youngest pack member at 18 months and the only one still routinely crated in our absence, should be given no more than a couple of hours of house-freedom at a time, maximum. We returned home to discover that particular instruction had somehow gotten lost in the shuffle; the sitter had been crating Bonnie only at night. As a result of too much freedom and less exercise than normal, our little black Scottie/Corgi mix discovered the joys of nibbling on various household objects, including the corner of the plastic dog food bin. Six-plus months of strict remedial supervision and management later, we're now, again, able to leave her uncrated for up to two hours at a stretch. If I leave the house for longer than that, she's back in her crate. I probably could leave her for longer periods, but I'm a firm believer in erring on the side of caution. Finally, a well-run positive training class can assist in resolving behavior problems, chewing and otherwise, by helping you and your dog learn to communicate more clearly with each other. The better you understand how his mind works, and the better he understands what you expect of him, the stronger the relationship between the two of you. In the end, it's the strength of this relationship that will carry you through the challenges of chewing and other dog caretaking adventures, and allow you to experience the joys and rewards of sharing your life with a canine companion. [Summertime News](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/editorial/summertime-news/) Does your attention span get shorter when its hot? Mine does. Ill keep these notes short and sweet. Ive received some fascinating responses from pet food company executives regarding the long-term fallout, positive and negative, of the pet food recalls early this year. Ive received so many, in fact, that Im going to expand them into a longer article and run it next month. Id like you to be able to read, in their entirety, what some of the execs say their companies are doing to ensure that we dont experience anything like the gluten recalls again. For years, weve pressed pet food companies to disclose their ingredient sources and manufacturing locations. Many people are starting to realize that this is information they dont know about their own food supply and many have renewed their efforts to pressure Congress to stop blocking laws that would require country-of-origin labeling (known as COOL) for meats and produce. Such a labeling law was enacted as part of the 2002 Farm Bill, but it has been largely blocked from taking effect. A July 2 article in the New York Times blames the meat lobby in general and former Representative Henry Bonilla (RTX) specifically for pushing through delays of the mandatory origin labeling. If you need motivation to act, here is Bonillas comment: No one was prohibited from putting labels on products. If consumers wanted this, they could have demanded it. Lets demand it! Everyone who takes their dogs to swim in lakes or ponds should read CJ Puotinens warning (page 17) about toxic algae blooms in warm, shallow water. On June 27, we received an e-mailed account from a Michigan man whose dog died two days earlier as a result of swimming in and drinking toxic pond water. The man, with a lifetime of professional dog ownership, had never known of such a danger, and neither had we. We put an alert on the Whole Dog Journal website and sent out an e-mailed bulletin to dog owners as soon as we confirmed the story. Which reminds me: If you havent signed up for the website access to Whole Dog Journal that comes with your paid subscription, you should. Those who do will receive any emergency e-mail bulletins we publish, sometimes weeks before we can get the information into the print version of the magazine. Finally, a summer treat: If you are seeking an enjoyable and intelligent dog-related book to help pass these long, hot days, look no farther than Ted Kerasotes Merles Door: Lessons from a Freethinking Dog. Kerasote is an award-winning nature writer, and Merle is the Lab-mix former stray who came to share his rural Wyoming home. The duo had an enviable relationship, based on an uncommon degree of mutual respect instead of the dominant master/submissive pet paradigm, with remarkable results. I dont agree with all of Kerasotes theories on canine behavior or condone all of his training practices, but I hugely enjoyed his thoughtful account of a special dogs lifeand gifts. [Raw Dog Food Diet Recipes](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/food/raw-dog-food-diet-recipes/) [Updated January 3, 2018] The idea of cooking for my dogs turns me pale. Not because I think there's anything wrong with home-cooked dog diets, or because I'm worried about doing it right, but for one simpler reason: I hate to cook. Had my only option for feeding my dogs a homemade diet been cooking their food, I'm afraid they'd still be eating out of a bag. But the idea of a raw diet, once I wrapped my mind around the concept of feeding bones, seemed, if not exactly simple, at least feasible, given my limited kitchen skills. I've been surprised to learn that there are many people like me: we don't cook for our families or even ourselves, but we feed our dogs a homemade raw diet, and actually enjoy preparing their meals. Feeding a raw diet is quite simple, especially once you have a system in place, but like anything else new, it can seem very complicated when first starting out. I hope these sample diets will be helpful to newcomers considering feeding their dogs raw, and that even those who have been doing it for awhile may learn some new tricks to make the process of finding, preparing, and storing raw dog food simpler. My dog's diet In 1998, I began feeding a raw diet to the three dogs I had at the time. While getting started took a lot of planning, the routine I've worked out makes it simple for me to manage now. Piglet, my 15-year- old Chinese Shar-Pei, weighs 35 pounds, and is relatively inactive due to her age. She ate more when she was younger, and I gave her more fat. Here's what I feed her now: Breakfast (4 ounces, plus dairy and vegetables) - 1 large egg alternating daily with 1 to 1\u00bd oz liver or kidney - Muscle meat, heart, green tripe, and/or healthy leftovers, enough to equal 4 oz total food (including egg/organs) - A spoonful of yogurt or cottage cheese (I use low-fat or nonfat varieties) - 3 to 4 oz veggies, alternating daily between steamed veggies and pureed \"veggie muffin\" (described below) Dinner (5 ounces) - Mon/Wed/Fri: rotate among chicken necks, chicken backs, and lamb breast (with skin and visible fat removed) - Sun/Tues/Thurs: rotate among different ground products, ranging from raw meaty bones only to complete diets - Saturday: canned fish, alternating between jack mackerel and pink salmon, or occasionally sardines Dietary supplements - 2 high-potency fish oil gelcaps (I give high doses due to her arthritis) - Antioxidants (Vetri-Science Cell Advance 880, Thorne Veterinary Small Animal Antioxidants, or Thorne Veterinary Immugen) - B-50 vitamin complex - Splash (1 tsp?) of organic apple cider vinegar - 1/8 tsp green blend (usually Berte's Green Blend) I do not package food in meal-sized portions. Instead, I divide food up into amounts that will last around one to three meals, and freeze. I store most food in Ziploc-style freezer bags that I wash and reuse. Each time I feed a meal, I move anything that I will need for the same meal in two days from the freezer to the fridge. When I run out of one food, I start on the next, so meals are often a mixture of several different kinds of food. \"Veggie muffins\" are prepared in large batches that last a month or more. I puree a mixture of various fruits (apple and banana, sometimes others as well), vegetables (lettuce, celery, cucumber, zucchini, dandelion greens, arugula, etc.), and herbs (always ginger and garlic, usually along with parsley or cilantro) in a food processor, then spoon the mixture into a muffin tin and freeze (you can use ice cube trays for smaller servings, but Piglet loves veggies). Once frozen, I transfer the veggie muffins to freezer bags. Steamed veggies are usually frozen broccoli or sometimes cauliflower or winter squash. I save any leftover sauces, gravy, meat drippings, chicken carcass, etc., and add them to the water that I use to steam the veggies, then pour the water over the meal to make \"breakfast soup\" (any bones are removed first). Eggs are soft-cooked using microwave egg cups. Pills are given dipped in a bit of cream cheese or peanut butter. The ground mixtures I feed are primarily a source of bones that my dogs would not otherwise get, such as beef, pork, and venison. I helped to start a raw food co-op in my area that allows us to buy directly from vendors at lower prices and gives us access to foods not normally found in stores (though stores can often order these products for you). I get all my raw meaty bones from the co-op, along with beef, lamb, and pork (ground, trim, heart, cheeks, liver, and kidney). I have a small 5-cubic foot upright freezer that allows me to buy in bulk. Piglet's teeth are too worn to chew raw meaty bones (RMBs) properly, as she can't shear off pieces small enough to swallow, so I cut her RMBs into small pieces using Joyce Chen scissors. I weigh all of her food using a postal scale, as otherwise she gains weight. I used to give Piglet beef rib bones for recreational chewing, but she eventually broke a couple of teeth, so now I use chicken feet and bully sticks. Bully sticks, also called beef, steer, or macho sticks, or pizzles, are made from beef penises. Dogs love them, they last a long time, and they're readily available. At the time I made the switch to feeding a raw diet, my oldest dog was 13, and had suffered from allergies all his life. He became completely allergy-free within three months of starting the raw diet. A second dog prone to allergies improved, but continued to have some problems. Piglet was also able to come off all arthritis medications for several years, though she is back on them now. All of my dogs have loved raw food and never experienced any problems with it. Using a grinder Laura Fulton, who lives in Diablo, California, grinds most of the food she feeds her two Weimaraners. She explains: I began feeding Violet, now 10 years old, a diet from Dr. Pitcairn's book (see Resources) after she had a horrible reaction to vaccinations as a puppy. She did well on that diet, which included raw meat, cooked grains and supplements, for five years. When I got a new puppy, Dozer, I wanted to start both dogs on a raw diet that included bones, but I was concerned because Violet is a \"gulper\" - she prefers to swallow her food whole, no matter the size or shape. After removing a pork bone lodged in her throat, I knew I could not continue to feed her whole bones. I decided grinding raw meaty bones would be better then just feeding meat, as I liked the idea of them getting the natural balance of nutrients, including calcium, from the meat and bones. I tried several small, mediocre grinders before I got my American Eagle \u00be horsepower grinder. It grinds everything I need to feed my dogs a varied diet. It weighs 75 pounds, so it usually stays on my kitchen counter. I do give my dogs bones to chew when I can supervise them. Dozer gets more whole RMBs, as he is a very thorough chewer. I believe that chewing on bones provides good exercise and helps clean their teeth more than the ground bones do. Violet (who weighs 76 pounds) and Dozer (84 pounds) each eat about 2 pounds of food daily, though I adjust the amounts depending on how they look. In the morning, they each get 1 pound of ground meat, usually hearts or trim from beef, pork, lamb, turkey, or ostrich, mixed with \u00bc cup of veggies three times a week. They also get whole, raw eggs without the shell two or three times a week, and I give each dog 2 tablespoons of yogurt or kefir after their breakfast. In the evening, they each get 1 pound of ground RMBs, such as chicken necks, backs, or wings; lamb breast; turkey necks; or rabbit. Once a week they get canned salmon. For veggies, I rotate through a mixture of celery, kale, beets, beet greens, romaine lettuce, spinach, sweet potato, apple, carrots, broccoli, string beans, snap peas, bok choy, collard greens, parsley, avocado, dandelion greens, and mustard greens. I blend these with enough water to make a thick liquid in my blender and freeze them in muffin tins, then transfer them to Ziploc bags to stay in the freezer. They also get whatever fruits I eat, such as bananas. If either dog seems hungry or has a growly tummy in the evening, I will feed a grain meal, such as oatmeal, before bed. I also use canned pumpkin and slippery elm as needed for upset stomachs. Each dog gets the following supplements daily or as noted: - 400 IU vitamin E - 1 Tbsp wild salmon oil - 1,000 mg Ester C - B-complex vitamin - Liquid trace minerals (1 drop three times a week) - Probiotics (two or three times a week) - Alfalfa tablets or a teaspoonful of liquid chlorophyll (three times a week) - Wheat germ (just a sprinkle now and then) - Zinc supplement: one capsule with 15 mg zinc and 2 mg copper split between the two dogs once a week I purchase my meat monthly in bulk through a dog food co-op. I also buy meats on sale at various grocery stores. I typically grind most of the meat when I get it and then put it into 2-pound plastic yogurt containers that are easily frozen. I use between 90 and 120 pounds of meat per month. I have a freezer in my garage as well as an extra refrigerator that comes in handy when I need to defrost food in bulk, for repackaging. My dogs are very healthy - their coats shine and they smell good. Their teeth stay clean, and typically the only time they go to the vet is for regular check-ups. Comments: I have seen the American Eagle grinder in action, and it is awesome. The more powerful, stainless steel grinders are expensive, but they make the job of grinding much easier, particularly if you have a lot of food to process. Try to find one with a reverse switch, as this one has, which also makes a big difference. The right tools Shari Mann, of San Francisco, has fed her dogs a raw diet since 1993. She has an active Cardigan Welsh Corgi, Meg, who just turned five years old - and she just got a Bull Terrier puppy. Meg weighs a lean 25 pounds. She eats 9 to 10 ounces of food daily, divided into two very unequal portions: about 1 ounce for breakfast, and 7 to 8 ounces for dinner, with the rest coming from snacks and treats. Breakfast is home-ground beef, pork, or lamb rolled into balls containing pills: 500 mg vitamin C, and 100 to 200 IUs vitamin E. She loves to work for her food, so these are fed as training rewards. After her three- to five-mile daily exercise, she gets a quarter-ounce cube of cheese or meat, or maybe raw beef liver. For dinner, we work in variety. The one constant is a chicken foot with each evening meal, which she eats first. She gets at least two different kinds of animal protein (meat, meat mixes, raw meaty bones, eggs, or fish), and either goat milk yogurt or green tripe. I add 1 gram of salmon oil with each dinner. I'm fortunate to be able to order most food from the SFRaw co-op. I buy some items from the grocery store as well, such as canned mackerel. Eggs come from my friend's organic chickens. Raw meaty bones are turkey, duck, chicken, or pork necks; chicken backs; or pork ribs. She does not like large chunks of food, so I cut them up with a meat cleaver, or I use my Estwing kindling axe and a chopping block for pork neck bones. When chopping, I keep my unused hand behind my back, and make sure there are no dogs around. Any sharp bone edges can be smashed with the flat backside of the axe. The main meats I use are beef, lamb, and pork, cut into half-inch cubes, as well as turkey heart and gizzard, and canned jack mackerel. She gets bones in the evening meal only once or twice a week (she doesn't really like them that much, unlike prior dogs I've had); the rest of the time we use powdered eggshell calcium, about \u00bc teaspoon per meal. She gets tiny snippets of raw beef liver or Organ Blend from greentripe.com. I grind mixes for the dogs that include meat (beef heart, pork roasts, London broil, or leg of lamb) and organ meat (beef liver or kidney). This is especially convenient to feed on trips to our vacation cabin. I chunk or grind meat when I get it, and freeze in Ziploc containers. I buy whole beef livers and kidneys from the co-op, which I partially freeze for slicing ease. I use my Tilia FoodSaver for the organs, since it preserves the food value longer. Meg gets no grains or veggies on a regular basis, as she doesn't like them (I fed veggies to prior dogs who enjoyed them). I add a tiny sprinkle of kelp powder to her evening meal. Now and then, I'll add fresh crushed garlic, herbs or bury some veggies under her yogurt. Treats are most often dehydrated meats, such as turkey heart, London broil, or beef liver, which I make myself in my L'Equip dehydrator. I also mix an equal amount of beef liver and canned pumpkin in the food processor, then bake it, and serve that as treats. My new puppy has been fed Halshan's ground chicken and ground turkey (with bone), and Honest Kitchen Embark (approved for puppies) by her breeder. I'll continue with similar foods, plus fresh raw goat milk. After a few days I'll start gradually adding my usual variety, including small amounts of veggies and fruits (apples, bananas). I'll start her on chicken feet to see how she handles raw bones (whether she is a chewer or a gulper). If she can't handle bone just yet, I'll grind it for her. I'll give salmon oil, vitamin E (100 IU), and a B-complex vitamin every couple of days. Comments: Having the right tools can make the job much easier. Shari's grinder, dehydrator, hatchet, and Tilia FoodSaver simplify preparing and storing healthy meals and treats. Lacto-fermented what? Whole Dog Journal's longtime contributor CJ Puotinen, who lives in New York, describes the diet she uses for Chloe, her 3-year-old, 75-pound Labrador Retriever: I feed Chloe pasture-fed organic meat, poultry, and eggs from farms here in New York and New Jersey, with occasional raw goat milk cheese from the farmer's market or health food store and goat milk kefir that I make at home. I also make lacto-fermented vegetables with finely shredded carrots, sweet potatoes, ginger, and other root vegetables. Lactofermentation predigests vegetables, increases their vitamin content, and provides both probiotics (beneficial bacteria) and prebiotics (foods that feed beneficial bacteria). My first pet nutrition mentor was Juliette de Bairacli Levy, whose Complete Herbal Handbook for the Dog and Cat introduced her Natural Rearing philosophy. I started following her guidelines 20 years ago with our cats and then with our first Lab, Samantha. Levy believes that meat fed in large pieces exercises stomach muscles and helps prevent bloat and other digestive problems, so Chloe never gets ground meat. Whenever we buy a side of beef, we have it cut to order with the maximum amount of bone on the meat, whole or cut into large chunks, and wrapped in 1- to 2-pound packages. Chloe gets more chicken and beef than other meats because we have such good local suppliers. She also gets lamb, goat, turkey, venison, or bison. Once in a while she gets wild-caught Pacific salmon, and I do cook that to prevent salmon poisoning. Chloe's recreational bones are usually beef, lamb, goat, or turkey. I try to provide raw meaty bones at least every other day because if Chloe goes for several days without any, she will have a loose stool with mucus when bones are reintroduced. Many people say that they can't give their dogs raw bones because they get diarrhea. This is not unusual - it takes the digestive tract a while to adjust, which is why it makes sense to start with small amounts of bone, or to take the bone away after a few minutes and give it back to the dog the next day for a few minutes more. Whenever we run out of raw bones and then get a new supply, Chloe has loose stools for a day, and then they become small, hard, and chalky, like plaster. In my experience, bone-fed dogs seldom have anal sac problems. Chloe's dinner usually starts with 2 or 3 tablespoons of lacto-fermented veggies, 1 to 2 tablespoons coconut oil, a tablespoon of shredded dried coconut, a teaspoon of cod liver oil, and a little fresh organ meat, such as liver, if available. If she's getting an egg or cheese that day, it gets mixed with the veggies. The meat or poultry comes next, fed in her crate on a towel because of the mess it makes. She gets raw meaty bones at least three or four days a week. If she gets meat without a bone attached, she'll get an after-dinner bone to chew on. I use raw marrow bones for that - once she cleans them out, I fill them with raw goat cheese. I put Willard Water concentrate in her drinking water and often add a splash of it to her dinner. Her other supplements are Standard Process Canine Whole Body Support powder and Seacure powder, both of which help the vegetables taste better. Chloe gets between 1 and 1\u00bd pounds of meat and raw meaty bones per day, usually fed in a single evening meal. Lately I've been giving her a cup of fresh goat kefir for breakfast, which I plan to continue as she has become fond of kefir, and it's so good for her. I generally feed a light evening meal with eggs and/or raw dairy or kefir on Saturday, and then fast her (water only) on Sunday. Chloe was weaned on kibble, but it didn't take long to switch her to raw food. Less than a week after we brought her home at eight weeks, she was eating 100 percent raw and has ever since. She sometimes gets grain-based treats from friends or vets or trainers, but most of her training treats are freeze-dried liver, lamb lung, turkey hearts, or other low-carb or no-carb fare. Comments: I find it fascinating to see how CJ integrates many of the things she has written about in her Whole Dog Journal articles into Chloe's diet, including lacto-fermented vegetables (\" [It's All in How You Make It](/issues/4_3/features/5144-1.html),\" March 2001), coconut oil (\" [How Coconut Oil Benefits Your Dog's Health](/issues/8_10/features/15754-1.html),\" October 2005), Seacure (\" [Securing Seacure](/issues/6_4/features/5535-1.html),\" April 2003), and Willard Water (\" [Willard Water](/issues/9_6/features/Dog_Medicine_15815-1.html),\" June 2006). She also wrote more about Juliette de Bairacli Levy in \" [Grandmother Nature](/issues/9_7/features/Holistic_Pet_Care_15822-1.html),\" July 2006 and about using pasture-fed meat in \" [Upgrading to Pasture Fed](/issues/6_7/features/5557-1.html),\" July 2003. Even toy breeds eat bones Randall Mackie, of San Francisco, has fed his 7-pound Yorkshire Terrier, Pumpkin, a raw diet for eight years. He explains why and how: I started feeding a raw diet when Pumpkin, who was a puppy at the time, just wouldn't eat kibble, canned, or any other processed foods. She also had several bouts of serious gastrointestinal problems, one of which landed her in the pet hospital for several days. Within a month of switching to raw, she had gained weight, was more active, and she had no further digestive disorders - ever! I feed muscle meat for her morning meal, and raw meaty bones for dinner. I don't worry about balancing each day's meals, but believe in the concept of \"balance over time.\" A typical morning meal is one ounce of meat, usually beef stew meat or beef heart, but I vary this with chicken or pork meat, chicken hearts, chicken or duck gizzards, and whatever else I can find at the Asian markets here. Every few days, I add a small amount of cooked beef liver (she gets the runs with raw liver, even in tiny amounts). Her favorite evening meal is a 1- to 2-ounce piece of pork neck bone. She loves these, and even if she can't completely consume them, they give her lots of chewing pleasure. I used to use a meat cleaver to chop them up, but I found an Asian market nearby where the bones actually come cut up in the perfect size for her. I find that she can generally consume about \u00bc to \u00bd of the bone. Some nights, she gets chicken necks or chicken backs instead, and about once a week, she gets jack mackerel for her RMB meal. Pumpkin is good about not gulping, but I still split the chicken necks lengthwise, then split them again, and I hold onto them while she eats them. I also mince up the chicken backs before I give them to her. A couple of days a week, Pumpkin is fed pre-made raw medallions from Nature's Variety, when other family members are caring for her. Finally, she gets table scraps, cottage cheese, yogurt, cheese, etc. - almost anything I eat, she will eat, except for veggies and eggs. I've tried and tried to get her to eat those, but finally gave up. Sometimes she'll eat bits of fruit (apple, melon, etc). And she loves vanilla ice cream! For treats, I primarily use EVO kibble. I've even fed EVO at times when I didn't have anything thawed for her. The only supplements she gets right now are fish oil and sometimes vitamin E, both of which I mix in with the cooked beef liver she gets in the morning. When I first started feeding raw meaty bones, Pumpkin didn't quite know what to do with them, but she picked up on it quickly. In the beginning, I held the bone to help her get started, and now that's part of our routine. I'll hold the bone for a while, then after a few minutes I'll let her take it away from me, and she'll go and chew on it for a good long while. Comments: Many people think that toy breeds cannot handle bones, but Pumpkin would beg to differ! Small dogs seem to be more susceptible to esophageal damage from bones, so be sure your dog chews them up well, or help out by holding onto the bones (if your dog doesn't object), cutting them up into pieces too small to cause choking, or grinding them. Mass production for big dogs Bridget Moran, of Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, is a Rottweiler breeder and Bravo! retailer who feeds a whopping 12 pounds of food a day to her six dogs, ranging in age from 2 to 11 years old, and weighing from 67 to 115 pounds. She reveals her system for feeding so many big dogs: I feed raw meaty bones (RMBs) in the morning and muscle meat in the evening, for a total of 6 pounds of food each meal: Morning meals may be composed of: - Pork rib tips - Chicken quarters, or chicken necks with added chicken hearts or gizzards - Venison, lamb, or duck necks - Turkey necks, or turkey backs with added turkey hearts - Chicken breast meat with bone Evening meals: - Chunked pork heart (cheaper than beef heart, which one dog doesn't like) - Ground turkey, beef, venison, or buffalo - Tripe, always mixed half and half with another protein - Chicken hearts and gizzards, or turkey hearts - Jack mackerel (canned) Supplements: - 50/50 mixture of Berte's Immune Blend and Berte's Green Blend - Salmon oil I buy pork rib tips, chicken quarters, chicken necks, and pork heart in bulk from a restaurant food supplier that delivers near my house. I purchase turkey backs from the local grocer. The rest of my products are from Bravo. I split the food unevenly between my six dogs, adding muscle meat to RMB meals when needed to get the proper amount of food for each dog, or if stools seem too dry. I weigh all my dogs' food, to help me get the amounts right, and mix and match proteins at will. I have been very lucky and have never had a choking incident (a friend lost her dog, a full sister to one of mine, to a turkey neck). I use Bravo! Blends, which contain meat, bone, organ meat, and veggies, a few times a week to supply the bulk of my organ meat, or I add a handful of Bravo beef liver cubes to either meal. Once every month or two, I feed the more expensive exotic ground raw meaty bones from Bravo, such as elk, ostrich, or quail, for variety. Here is my system. At an office supply store, I buy unscented garbage can liners for around $10 for 10,000 bags. These bags are not freezer-weight, but the food does not stay in the freezer long. I split each case of food into bags containing enough for a meal for each of my dogs, plus a little extra. If I have time, I cube pork heart or beef heart, or grind muscle meat, and put about five pounds each into rectangular Glad or Ziploc containers (this shape works best for maximizing freezer space). I have a 22-cubic-foot chest freezer. With chest freezers, it's helpful to know approximately where everything is, so I made a wooden divider that splits the lower half of the freezer into thirds, allowing me to put 40-pound bulk cases on top. The divider also lets me stack and retrieve Bravo rolls more efficiently. When I put food into the freezer, I alternate between muscle meat and RMBs, making it easier to get to what I want. I'm also careful to shift older food to the top when I fill my freezer up again. The first dog I switched to a raw diet was my 11-year-old male who was very lame, but could not handle any pain medications. After a few weeks on the raw diet, he started putting weight on his bad leg, and was soon trotting around and retrieving balls. He lived almost another year before I lost him to cancer of the spleen. The vet and I were totally amazed, and I was a convert from that point on. Comments: Feeding a raw diet to so many large dogs can seem overwhelming, but once you have a system worked out, it goes quite smoothly. Weaning pups onto raw food As a breeder, Moran explains how she feeds her Rottweiler pups: The first solid food I feed puppies at about four weeks of age is a very soupy mix of goat milk and ground turkey, gradually adding more turkey and less milk (all meals followed by nursing on the dam). After a few days, I add whole, skinless chicken drumsticks and thighs, with the meat scored. Chewing meat helps relieve teething pain and saves the dam's nipples - most dams do not want to nurse during this stage, but I have found this helps tremendously (I've also found a raw diet increases the amount of milk the dam has at this point). At five weeks of age, I give the puppies a meal of ground raw meaty bones (usually from Bravo!). The second meal of the day is whole RMBs (skinless chicken), and the third meal is ground turkey and goat milk. The puppies soon begin chewing the edge of the chicken bones. When this starts, I introduce chicken backs (I still give larger chicken pieces as well, as there is not much meat on the backs). I like to use chicken backs as they are too big for the puppies to swallow whole, and they learn to hunker down and chew through the backs until they have pieces they can swallow. I found that if I started with chicken necks first, there was always one puppy that would swallow the necks whole. I had a 5-week-old puppy who swallowed three chicken necks whole, then pitched a fit when I took him from the food bowl, wanting even more! He was fine, but it's better that they learn to chew their food first before swallowing it. Once the puppies are doing well with their chicken backs, I add in another protein. I use ground RMBs from Bravo!, starting with the beef blend. I continue to add one new food every few days. I recommend to their new owners that puppies be fed three meals a day, as follows (the order does not matter): - Meal one: whole raw meaty bones - Meal two: meat meal (no bones), eggs, organs, cottage cheese and yogurt, along with veggies, if desired - Meal three: \u00bd meat, \u00bd raw meaty bones (ground or whole) This diet is half RMBs and half meat and other animal products. The emphasis is on the \"meat\" in RMBs as well. If chicken necks or backs are the RMB of the day, I recommend adding more meat to this meal to improve the meat to bone ratio. I also suggest the same supplements I use for all my dogs (see above). With my Rottweiler puppies, I feed 5 percent of their body weight at seven to eight weeks of age daily, divided into three meals. I then monitor their condition at least weekly, increasing each meal by one ounce when I see a puppy start to look thin. The timing will vary depending on each puppy's activity level and genetics. By 12 weeks of age, pups need their food increased every one to two weeks, and by six months, usually only monthly increases. By ten months, I am feeding 2 to 3 percent of their estimated adult weight, and no further increases are needed. I find the body structure of my raw-fed puppies seems to be more solid. I believe they are a little more muscled from putting their front feet on the raw meaty bones and pulling the meat off. Muscles work out while eating! Comments: This feeding approach can work for any puppy, but it may be best to wait a week or two after bringing a new puppy home before changing his diet, so that if digestive problems develop due to parasites, disease, or the stress of a new home, you'll know diet is not the cause. A \"prey-model\" diet One style of raw feeding called \"prey model\" advocates feeding a diet based on whole prey and excluding anything else. This is based on a desire to mimic the diet of the wolf in the wild. Ginny Wilken, of Alameda, California, describes the prey-model diet she has fed Tomo, her 11-year-old, 85-pound American Staffordshire Terrier, since he was four years old: Tomo had three surgeries for hip and knee problems when he was young, prompting me to seek options to help him. I started with a Billinghurst-style raw diet, which soon morphed into a prey-model approach. \"Prey model\" is a concept with wide latitude. Tomo is not fed a strict prey-model diet; I've tailored it to meet his individual needs. I think this diet is well suited to folks with moderately good access to meat sources. Tomo is a low-activity senior, an easy keeper with definite preferences. He enjoys food, but sees a meal as a social event, and is always happier to eat if someone is watching or sharing. This is sometimes a challenge, as he will turn down \"difficult\" meals at home alone that he will gladly tackle in \"public.\" Here are his diet items: - Pork neck bones (whole split necks), ribs, shoulder, and shanks - Turkey parts, including unattached necks - Chicken and duck (whole or half) - Lamb necks (whole), heart, and kidney - Goat (six-way cut) - Meaty chunks of beef, lamb, pork, and venison - Raw eggs, free-range (home grown) - Organic or natural beef liver, heart, and kidney - Green tripe, cow gullets, and tracheas (from greentripe.com) - Chicken feet - Pork brains, spleen, and pancreas - Whole small fishes, like smelt or sardines - Intact heads or whole animals, when available - Homemade soups from all varieties of bones - My table scraps or \"shares,\" just meat, fish, and vegetables (only broccoli and greens, and only with fat on it) - Timberwolf salmon oil I buy food from butchers, Asian markets, or wholesale from packers and ranchers. All our food is from quality sources, and much of it is organic or naturally raised. These days, Tomo can't skip meals, as he needs to take a number of supplements twice a day, including antioxidants for his heart, anti-inflammatories for arthritis, and thyroid medication. He gets pills in slices of meat or handfuls of tripe or ground beef, usually when I am eating, to make a treat out of it. Tomo is a very careful chewer, but large pieces may come up and go down a few times to get chomped just right. He has never choked on food. I don't fast him, but I do feed a bountiful day, followed by one or more lean days. He averages 1\u00bd pounds of food a day, with a higher percentage of bone than is common with a prey-model diet. This regulates his digestion, which tends toward quick and loose. I saw lots of positive changes. First, he ate, without being picky! Then I noticed that fleas no longer bothered him. His skin and ear problems cleared up quite a bit, though not entirely. His breath and coat improved, and his digestion became much more consistent. He became less manic, and easier to train and handle. His hips seemed to bother him less. Eight years later, I'm still very happy with his diet. Comments: It's important when following the prey-model style to feed a wide variety of foods, as shown here, not just meat and bones, and not just one or two meat sources. Tomo's diet also demonstrates how supplements can be used appropriately. Getting started All those who shared their diets with us have fed a raw diet for a long time, and we've become quite relaxed about it. Believe me, we all suffer anxiety attacks the first time we hand our dogs a raw meaty bone. It's hard to overcome the warnings we've received all our lives about giving bones (especially chicken bones) to dogs. Remember, though, that those warnings apply to cooked bones. Most dogs handle raw bones without a problem, especially if they are careful chewers. However, if you have a dog who tends to gulp his food, or if you just don't feel comfortable feeding whole bones, you can still feed ground or cut-up raw meaty bones, and can give recreational bones instead for chewing pleasure and dental health. Most of us who feed a raw diet have seen a variety of health improvements in our dogs, including cleaner teeth, healthier coat and skin, less problem with fleas and allergies, better muscle tone, and increased vitality. As always, however, if your dog has any problems, it's a good idea to try changing what you feed. If you see an improvement after making a change, that points to a nutritional problem, either due to excesses or deficiencies in the diet, or to an allergy to one or more ingredients. No matter what style of diet you feed, the cardinal rule is to always do what works for your dog. Mary Straus does research on canine health and nutrition topics as an avocation.
