Medical Acupuncture Medical Acupuncture \"Acupuncture is one of the oldest, most commonly used medical procedures in the world. Originating in China more than 2,000 years ago, acupuncture has become increasingly popular in the United States during the past two decades. Research shows that acupuncture is beneficial in treating a variety of health conditions. Traditional Chinese Medicine theorizes that there are more than 2,000 acupuncture points on the human body, and that these connect with pathways called meridians, conducting energy (qi) throughout the body.\" Source: [National Center for Complementary & Alternative Medicine](http://nccam.nih.gov/), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) About acupuncture In acupuncture, fine disposable needles are inserted at critical points in the body that connect nerves, muscles and organs. Acupuncture can affect respiratory, digestive, urinary and reproductive systems, as well as muscle tone, hormone production, circulation and allergic responses. We offer acupuncture to treat chronic pain, musculoskeletal and joint pain, headache, cancer treatment side effects, gastrointestinal conditions, and women's health issues including urinary problems, infertility, nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and menopause. Our acupuncture staff includes anesthesiologists, a naturopath and a Chinese-trained licensed acupuncturist. More information [American Academy of Medical Acupuncture](http://www.medicalacupuncture.org/) Evaluation and treatment After careful evaluation by one of our program's clinicians, an individualized treatment plan is developed for the patient. In many cases, the plan will call for the patient to get a series of treatments (highly variable, depending upon the patient and the condition). Treatment sessions normally last about an hour. Comprehensive integrative medicine consultations are also available. INTERESTED IN AN ONLINE SECOND OPINION?
