In Peru, Dr. Tafur learned how ayahuasca shamanism could be used to heal the emotional body (Ayahuasca shamanism involves the ceremonial use of ayahuasca, a traditional Amazonian plant medicine known for its spiritual properties). After observing hundreds of people go through this kind of spiritual and emotional healing, Dr. Tafur recognized the broader value of spiritual healing techniques. Spiritual healing is spiritual practice. Spiritual practice is spiritual healing, and both can help to heal the emotional body and in turn, the mind-body. In order to spread this message, Dr. Tafur, his brother Mario Tafur, and their associates have started the non-profit organization Modern Spirit, dedicated to demonstrating the value of spiritual healing in modern healthcare. Modern Spirit has now initiated, in collaboration with USC and MAPS, the Modern Spirit Epigenetics Project, one of the largest mechanistic assessments of psychedelic medicine to date.
