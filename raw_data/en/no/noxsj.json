Making big headlines just before the holidays last year, this journal contained studies demonstrating that multivitamins do not prevent dementia or second heart attacks, nor do they clearly reduce incidence of cancer, cardiovascular disease or all-cause death in the general adult population. These findings do not come as a surprise to health care practitioners who use nutrition, including supplementation, as a primary treatment method. It is easy to agree that, \"most supplements do not prevent chronic disease or death,\" but calling a supplement's overall use unjustified is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. More than half of Americans regularly use some kind of health supplement. Unfortunately, the editorial is likely correct that most often these supplements provide few health benefits, and may actually be harmful. The one-size-fits-all approach that a multivitamin offers fails to consider nutrition requirements that vary hugely depending on a person's diet, location, occupation, health history, medications, digestion and genetic ability to process vitamin forms. For some, a multivitamin will not offer enough of a nutrient to make any difference; for others, it can pack harmful excess. Consumers should think of vitamin and mineral supplements like prescription drugs: A person should use a particular form of a specific nutrient for a set amount of time to treat or prevent a certain endpoint. To a lesser degree, carefully chosen nutrient supplementation can build overall health. People who are pregnant, cleansing or fasting, or undergoing certain medical therapies do appear to routinely benefit from high-quality multi-nutrient supplementation. The most important ways to achieve the health outcomes sought by these multivitamin studies do not entail taking pills of any kind. So what's your best bet? Consume your multi vitamins in the form of a diet filled with a rainbow of vegetables (six to nine cups per day!), a moderate amount of meat from pastured animals and plenty of healthy fats (think fatty fish, avocados, olives, grass-fed butter). Furthermore, physical activity is proven to reduce the risk and improve the outcome of dementia, heart disease, cancer and almost every other chronic disease. Don't forget to add sunshine, laughter and quality sleep. Health like that does not come from a bottle!
