Even though there are many ways to add length to your lashes, from easy-to-use falsies to eyelash extensions to curlers and do-it-all drugstore mascaras, lash serums are enticing because they promise to boost length and volume, and promote healthier lashes long-term. The eyes are a sensitive area of the face, though, so whenever you're applying products, you'll want to make sure they're not just effective but safe. Ahead, find out more about eyelash serums, including how they work. The short answer: It depends. Currently, there is only one product proven effective for growth and thickness, which is Latisse. The FDA-approved serum is formulated with an active ingredient called bimatoprost, which not only causes existing lashes to become longer but also stimulates growth in hair follicles not currently producing lashes. The catch? It's a pharmaceutical drug, so you'll need a doctor's prescription to get it. \"Over-the-counter lash-growth serums are cosmetic products rather than drugs, so they do not make any claims to grow lashes longer,\" says Joshua Zeichner MD, a board-certified dermatologist. However, these alternative formulas do offer conditioning benefits that help hydrate and strengthen, which can help prevent breakage and promote the look of longer and fuller lashes. \"You can't argue with the before and after photos of consumers using these products and experiencing significantly thicker and fuller eyelashes,\" Zeichner says. Mona Gohara MD, a board-certified dermatologist, can attest to the power of lash serums. \"I have experienced a loss of lashes from aging and alopecia areata, and I've seen tremendous benefit from these products,\" she says. If you're interested in trying a lash serum for yourself, read on for our favorite picks and dermatologist-recommended options. Formulated with peptides, biotin, and hyaluronic acid, this affordable serum helps to soften, nourish, and condition lashes and brows. Over time, the conditioning benefits will help promote the look of fuller and thicker-looking hair. Available with a prescription, Latisse is an FDA-approved solution that's been on the market since 2001. Tara Rao, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Mount Sinai Hospital, says when used as directed, it can \"increase growth and thickness.\" Our beauty editor, Genesis Rivas, swears by this lash serum. \"Grande Lash Serum transformed my sparse, small lashes. Now everyone always asks me if my lashes are real or extensions,\" she says. \"It not only stimulates healthy growth of new lashes but also strengthens and hydrates lashes you currently have,\" adds Zeichner. Some buyers say it's better for thickness than length What's so great about this cult classic: Not only do the plant-derived actives help give lashes a growth boost but the formula also enhances their curve and color. Coleus forskohlii helps to stimulate the production of melanin in your lashes to give them a deep, dark look, while silk proteins coat and curl. This potent blend of peptides, biotin, aloe vera, and Tahitian plankton will boost the length, thickness, and strength of your lashes (and brows, too). But the real reason we're making space for it on our bedside table: The magic wand includes both a precision tip (so you can easily apply the product along the upper lash line) and a denser applicator (so you can evenly distribute the product from roots to ends). This nourishing serum from Shiseido packs a one-two punch: Not only will it pump up the volume of your lashes but it can also make your brows appear fuller\u2014thanks to the formula's MVP, arginine (an amino acid). Even better? The doe-foot applicator makes it easy to get to hard-to-reach spots between lashes and into the lash line. You don't need to apply harsh chemicals to your sensitive eye area to get lush lashes. This clean formula is plant-based yet effective. Hemp-derived cannabis seed extract hydrates and conditions lashes and brows, plant peptides create the appearance of lash and brow thickness, and quinoa helps support healthy hair follicles to encourage natural growth. Olaplex's signature bond-building technology is now available in a lash serum to help transform dry and brittle lashes. Experience stronger, nourished, and healthier looking lashes with this formula packed with peptides. It also helps support the skin barrier to promote a better environment for natural growth. Make the most of your beauty sleep with this dreamy serum. As you catch z's, serious skincare and antioxidants\u2014nourish and fortify the lash base, so lashes are stronger and grow longer. A little thicker than other products, this is a clear gel that applies easily on the upper lash line and is so gentle you can use it with contacts. \"The soy protein helps enhance lashes and keeps them stronger and longer,\" adds Nazarian. Buyers say the formula is thick and difficult to apply Worried about your lashes falling out while removing falsies or wiping off mascara? Reviewers saw less lash loss with this serum, which is formulated with ingredients like pro vitamin B5 and hyaluronic acid to help grow stronger, thicker eyelashes. Some customers say it takes a while to see results This lash serum is a non-irritating formula that's prostaglandin-free, so if you've tried other enhancers and they haven't worked for you, this could be your solution. The best part: You may see results in as little as 30 days. Joyce Imahiyerobo-Ip, MD, a board-certified dermatologist with Vibrant Dermatology, says she started noticing new growth about two weeks into use, and by the end of the first month, her lashes were \"definitely stronger.\" She recommends this formula, made without any gluten, parabens, phthalates, or sulfates, for anyone looking for a cleaner product. \"It has eyelash-fortifying peptides (amino acids) and hair-fullness peptides that offer superior results,\" she says.
