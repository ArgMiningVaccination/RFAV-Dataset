Petitioner completed a doctoral degree in guid ance and counseling but was denied a license to practice psychology by the District of Columbia Board of Psychology due to a statutory change in the D.C. Health Occupation Revision Act of 1985, D.C. Code \u00a7 3-1201.01 et seq., that required applicants to have a doctoral degree in psychol ogy and no longer recognized degrees in fields related to psychology; the Court of Appeals affi rmed the license denial because the Board's interpretation of the Revision Act was consistent w ith the language of the statute and its legislative history and not otherwise arbitrary or capricious.

Court of Appeals remanded the denial of a license to practice medicine in the District of Columbia to a psychiatrist licensed in Mi chigan who had sought licensure w ithout taking a new test under the statutory provisions for endorsement and reciprocity in the District of Columbia Health Occupations Revision Act of 1985, D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 3-1201.01 to 3-1213.01; appellant had scored 73.3% on the federation licensing examination in Michigan wh ich was below the federation-certified score of 7 75% required on the same exam to receive a passing score in the District, but had sixteen years of experience and demonstrated that the medical board had not expl ained its practices in requiring strict equivalency of those doctors who had taken the standarized test but did license other doctors who had taken a different state exam. Roberts v. District of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 577 A.2d 319 (1990). NOTICE SUFFICIENT. District of Columbia Board of Medicine acted with proper jurisdiction in the revocation of a doctor's license despite an erroneous citation to a repealed statute in a revocation notice, where the same conduct was cause for discipline under both the repealed and the current statute, the same disciplinary sanctions were pres cribed by both for the conduct, a nd no prejudice was shown.

ANALYSIS 49 Discipline Findings License Notice sufficient Standard of care Unlicensed practice DISCIPLINE. Failure to enroll in a residency program coul d be understood to imply that a doctor was practicing medicine \"beyond the scope\" of a restricted license within the meaning D.C. Code \u00a7 3- 1205.14(a)(21); moreover, D.C. Code \u00a7 3-1205.14(a )(18) authorizes discipline if a physician violates any of the conditions of an agreement be tween the licensee and the Board of Medicine to voluntarily limit the practice of the licensee made pursuant to D.C. Code \u00a7 3-1205.18. Salama v. District of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 578 A.2d 693 (1990). The substantial evidence test requires an agency to (1) make written findings of basic facts on all material contested issues; (2) thes e findings, taken together, must ra tionally lead to conclusions of law sufficient to support the agency's decision; and (3) each basic finding must be supported by evidence sufficient to convince reasonable minds of its adequacy; in a disclipinary action, the Board of Medicine failed on the second ground as the go verning statute did not preclude a doctor from leaving an ordered residency progr am, so long as doctor did not atte mpt to resume practice. Salama v. District of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 578 A.2d 693 (1990). FINDINGS. District of Columbia Board of Psychology's denial of petitio ner's license to practice psychology was affirmed where petitioner had received a doct oral degree in guidanc e and counseling but the licensure requirements were revise d to require that a doctoral degree in psychology, and not fields related to psychology, was required for applican ts by D.C. Code \u00a7 3-1205.04(o); the Court of Appeals found that the Board's inte rpretation of the code was consis tent with the language of the revised statute, their decisi on was not arbitrary or capri cious, and the Board had not unconstitutionally delegated its rule-making authority to a private organization to determine what constitutes a doctoral degree in psychology. Donahue v. District of Columbia Bd. of Psychology, App. D.C., 562 A.2d 116 (1989). LICENSE. Court of appeals remanded back to the medical board a case that was brought by a psychiatrist licensed in Michigan who had been denied a license to practice medicine in the District of Columbia without retaking the standarized licensing examination; the medical board had failed to explain its practices in waiving the examination requirements for applicants currently licensed in 50 another state and issuing a medical license by reci procity or endorsement to an applicant who was licensed and in good standing under substantially equivalent requirements under D.C. Code \u00a7 3- 1205.03 when the record revealed the board required strict equivalency on passing scores for those doctors who had taken the same standarized exam ination that the distri ct uses but were less stringent with doctors who had a passed a diffe rent state examination. Roberts v. District of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 577 A.2d 319 (1990). NOTICE SUFFICIENT. The District of Columbia Board of Medicine acted with proper jurisdiction in the revocation of a doctor's license despite an erroneous citation to a repealed statute in a revocation notice, where the same conduct was cause for discipline under both the repealed and the current statute, the same disciplinary sanctions were pres cribed by both for the conduct, a nd no prejudice was shown. Salama v. District of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 578 A.2d 693 (1990). STANDARD OF CARE. Because the selection of foster parents and the supervision of the care they provide are not activities within the re alm of common knowledge and every day experience, expert testimony was needed to establish the standard of care before the District could be found liable for either negligent selection or negligent superv ision. District of Columbia v. Hampton, App. D.C., 666 A.2d 30 (1995). UNLICENSED PRACTICE. There was sufficient evidence to convict a licensed physician of aiding and abetting a licensed paramedical assistant in the physician's employ in the practice of a healing art without a license under former D.C. Code \u00a7 2-102, sin ce the physician paid scant personal attention to a clinic he set up and staffed with physician assistants, was present in the clinic only a few hours each week, left a pad of pre-signed prescription pads for the assistant' s use, and never saw a majority of the patients.

ANALYSIS Equivalence Experience of practitioner. Strict equivalency EQUIVALENCE. Chiropractor was not entitled to certification by reciprocity because he failed to establish at the administrative level that Florida's licensing standard s were \"substantially equi valent\" at the date of the licensure to the District of Columbia's requirements. Singer v. District of Columbia Bd. of Medicine, App. D.C., 631 A.2d 1232 (1993). EXPERIENCE OF PRACTITIONER. The Board of Medicine's reliance solely upon he r Federation-certified FLEX score and its refusal to consider her current qualifications, including f our years of practice at a hospital, did not violate applicant's due process rights by creating an irre buttable presumption of incompetence. Roberts v. District of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 577 A.2d 319 (1990). This section reflects a legisl ative judgment that, apart from cu rrent licensure and good standing in another state, the relevant c onsiderations for a license by endorsement and reciprocity are 61 circumstances at the time of original licensure and not intervening experience or accomplishment, perhaps because the latter, as an objective measur ement of qualification, ar e too difficult to assess. Roberts v. District of Columbia B d. of Med., App. D.C., 577 A.2d 319 (1990). This section conveys the legislature's inte nt that, notwithstanding current licensure and good standing in another state or terr itory, the relevant consideratio ns for a license by waiver of examination or reciprocity are circ umstances at the time of origin al licensure and not intervening experience or accomplishment.

Due process Evidence Former licensees Fraud Jurisdiction Malpractice Notice Prior discipline Revocation upheld Standard of proof Sufficiency of evidence CONSTRUCTION. Nothing in D.C. Code \u00a7 3-1201.01 et seq., (the Revision Act) or its legisl ative history indicated that the term \"licensee\" was intended to refer on ly to someone who was licensed at the time a final decision or order was issued, and agreement with th e petitioner's argument that the omission of the word \"former\" from the Revision Act was an indi cation that the District of Columbia Board of Medicine had no authority over a former licensee, w ould have lead to the unreasonable result of the Board's being without authority to impose discipline on former and current licensees, so that petitioner's argument was rejected as going too far. Davidson v. Dist rict of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 562 A.2d 109 (1989). ACTIONABLE TORT FOR BREACH. 72 Public policy in the District in favor of conf identiality of the physician-patient relationship is consistent with breach of a physician-patient re lationship as an actionable tort. Vassiliades v. Garfinckel's, Brooks Bros., App. D.C., 492 A.2d 580 (1985). ADEQUACY OF NOTICE. Having received adequate notice of char ges under repealed \u00a7 2-1326, a physician received adequate notice of violations under \u00a7 3-1205.14 and, th erefore, discipline based on such violations was proper. Salama v. Distri ct of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 578 A.2d 693 (1990). The Board of Medicine had jurisdiction to discipline a physician, notwithstanding that the revocation notice referred to repealed \u00a7 2- 1326, rather than \u00a7 3-1205.14, where the final order suspending the physician's license referred to the co rrect statute. Mannan v. District of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 558 A.2d 329 (1989). Where the Board of Medicine's notice refe rred to repealed \u00a7\u00a7 2-1326 and 2-1327, but the final decision cited this section in addition to the repe aled statutes, there was no error as there was no \"material difference\" between the old and new stat utory provisions or any prejudice resulting from this error. Davidson v. District of Columb ia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 562 A.2d 109 (1989). DUE PROCESS. Denial by the District of Columbia Nurses' Examining Board of a nurse's application for reinstatement under the authority of former D.C. Code \u00a7 2-407, after her license was revoked based on conduct which occurred in Maryland, ran afoul of the due process clause as the nurse was deprived of her constitutional ri ght to a hearing on her applicati on. Woods v. District of Columbia Nurses' Examining Bd., App. D.C ., 436 A.2d 369 (Oct. 9, 1981). EVIDENCE. Where a physician claimed that assistants were responsible for billing, in order to establish the willful filing of false medical records under D.C. Code \u00a7 3-1205.14(a)(8), the Board of Medicine must find, at minimum, that the physician's lack of supervision over assistants rose to the level of culpable fault or omission, and that the physician was consciously indifferent to the consequences of failing to monitor billing matters. Mannan v. District of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 558 A.2d 329 (1989). Evidence of concession of negligence was pr operly admitted in physician competency hearing since the concession was made in a malpractice action, was originally made in writing by the physician's attorney, was orally affirmed by the phys ician in a conference w ith the trial judge, and was submitted to the civil jury without objection. Sherman v. Commission on Licensure to Practice Healing Art, App. D.C., 407 A.2d 595 (1979). Guidelines were improperly admitted since th ey had not been adopted or promulgated by either the Commission on Licensure to Practice the Hea ling Art or by the Council of the District of Columbia; to rely upon their violation as per se evidence of a physician's responsibility for a patient's death, or of the physician's failure to us e proper sterilization tech niques, was to treat the guidelines of a private group of professionals as having the force of public law, and was not harmless error. Sherman v. Commission on Licensure to Practice Healing Art, App. D.C., 407 A.2d 595 (1979). 73 There was sufficient evidence to find that the petitioner knew or should ha ve known of the denial of petitioner's licensure application in Florida prio r to filing an application in the District of Columbia because there was uncontradicted ev idence that petitioner was present when the application was denied and writ ten notice, whether actually r eceived or not, would only have confirmed what petitioner alrea dy knew, therefore, petitioner failed to demonstrate that an erroneous finding of service with the Florida order would have mate rially affected the decision of this matter. Davidson v. District of Columb ia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 562 A.2d 109 (1989). FORMER LICENSEES. This section permits the discipline of former licensees, in addition to current licensees. Davidson v. District of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 562 A.2d 109 (1989). FRAUD. Where a dentist submitted claims for essentially the same services in three separate claims over a two-month period to two different insurance companies, evidence was sufficient to support the Board of Dentistry's conclusion that the dentist had filed a false statement under D.C. Code \u00a7 3- 1205.14(a)(14). Gropp v. District of Columbia Bd. of Dentistry, App. D.C., 606 A.2d 1010 (1992). JURISDICTION. Petitioner's contention that the District of Columbia Board of Medicine lacked jurisdiction because its notice of intent to re voke petitioner's license erroneously cited repealed statutes, D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-1326 (d)(1), 2-1327 failed because petitione r failed to demonstrate that there was any material difference between the old and new statutor y provisions or any prejudice resulting from the error of citing the old statutes a nd, in its final decision, the Board ci ted the provisions of the revised version of the statutes in ques tion in addition to the repealed statutes. Davidson v. District of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 562 A.2d 109 (1989). MALPRACTICE. A doctor, in testifying as an expert witness, renders an opi nion based on the application of scientific principles to the dia gnosis and treatment of physical dise ases, which is in the nature of giving a second opinion; thus, a doctor who testified fa lsely as an expert witness that he was board- certified in thoracic surgery and provided counsel with a curriculum vitae containing other false information about his academic credentials, willfully ma de a false report or reco rd in the practice of medicine. Joseph v. District of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 587 A.2d 1085 (1991). NOTICE. Petitioner's assertion of inadequate notice of th e factual basis of charges because the charges were based on the purported receipt of a certified lette r rather than on actual knowledge of the order underlying the notice failed because the notice in formed the petitioner of the grounds for the charges. Davidson v. District of Columbia Bd. of Med., App. D.C., 562 A.2d 109 (1989). Since formal notice to physician under former D.C. Code \u00a7 2-123(d) specifically charged the 74 physician with 'willfully\" practicing improper abor tion procedures, Board on Licensure to Practice the Healing Art could not find hi m guilty of \"carelessness\" without new notice and a chance to respond to that charge. Sherman v. Commission on Licensure to Pr actice Healing Art, App. D.C., 407 A.2d 595 (1979). PRIOR DISCIPLINE. Summary suspension of dentist's registration to dispense controlled substances was properly treated as prior \"discipline\" with in the meaning of subdivision (a)(3 ) of this secti on, notwithstanding subsequent dismissal of proceeding to permanently revoke that registration. Williamson v. District of Columbia Bd. of Dentistr y, App. D.C., 647 A.2d 389 (1994). REVOCATION UPHELD. Charges against dentist for controlled subs tances violations were supported by substantial evidence, and five-year revocation of his dentistr y license would therefore be affirmed. Williamson v. District of Columbia Bd. of Dentistry, App. D.C., 647 A.2d 389 (1994). Where there was ample evidence that a den tist committed fraud and he admitted, with respect to one of the specifications, that he forged a patien t's signature, there was a sufficient basis for a two- year revocation of his license. Gropp v. District of Columbia Bd. of Dentistry, App. D.C., 606 A.2d 1010 (1992). STANDARD OF PROOF.
