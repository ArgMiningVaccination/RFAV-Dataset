Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 P R O C E E D I N G S 1 CHAIRMAN MURIS: Thank you all very much for coming. 2 I'm Tim Muris. I'm the chairman of the FTC. We have a star- 3 studded panel today, and I'm delighted on behalf of the FTC 4 to introduce the distinguished individuals who have joined me 5 today as we open these hearings on Competition and 6 Intellectual Property Law and Policy in the Knowledge-Based 7 Economy. 8 We have with us the Honorable Charles James, 9 Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, U.S. Department of 10 Justice; the Honorable James Rogan, Undersecretary of 11 Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U.S. 12 Patent and Trademark Office; the Honorable Robert Pitofsky, 13 professor of law, Georgetown University of Law Center and 14 former chairman of the FTC; the Honorable Pauline Newman, 15 U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; the Honorable 16 Q. Todd Dickinson of Howrey, Simon, Arnold & White and former 17 Undersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and 18 Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; the 19 Honorable Gerald Mossinghoff, of Oblon, Spivak, McClelland, 20 Maier & Neustadt, and former Assistant Secretary of Commerce 21 and Commissioner of Patent and Trademarks before they had a 22 proliferation of titles; and Professor Richard Gilbert, 23 Department of Economics, University of California 24 Berkeley and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General 254 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025for Antitrust, Department of Justice; and finally, 1 but certainly not last or least, President Richard Levin of 2 Yale University. 3 I want to thank each of the speakers for making time 4 in their busy schedules to join us today. I think this is a 5 premier panel of speakers, and I'm certainly excited. I 6 don't plan to speak too much myself. When we announced the 7 hearings on November 15, I made a set of remarks, and we have 8 them available here. 9 I will say a few things, beginning with the obvious, which is 10 that innovation has become crucial to our information age economy. 11 Products and services undreamed of by our parents fuel the nation's 12 growth. Whole industries have been born and 13 others transformed, and understanding of the role of 14 innovation and of the effects of competition on innovation 15 is essential for responsible enforcement of the antitrust laws. 16 Intellectual property is a bulwark of the innovation process. 17 The importance of innovative success heightens the significance of each 18 of its components. 19 As such, questions involving the treatment of IP are 20 increasingly significant in the application of public laws to 21 business transactions, including, of course, the antitrust 22 and consumer protection laws. 23 I'm pleased that the Justice Department has joined 24 with us to co-sponsor these hearings, and that the U.S. 255 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Patent and Trademark Office will contribute substantially. 1 The FTC has a distinguished history of studying 2 important public policy issues relating to competition and 3 consumer protection. The Commission's activities in recent 4 years have been particularly notable. As chairman, I believe 5 it is important to continue this tradition of research and 6 study, which is why my fellow commissioners and I initiated 7 this set of hearings. 8 Similar to the approach taken in prior FTC forums, the 9 emphasis will be on hearing the best thinking from scholars, 10 business leaders and legal practitioners on the nature and 11 effects of the patent and IP systems. 12 In particular, the hearings will highlight economic 13 insights on the effect of existing IP rules on innovation, 14 growth and efficiency. IP and antitrust law both seek to 15 promote innovation and enhance consumer welfare. 16 The goal of patent and copyright law, as enunciated 17 in Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, 18 is: \"To promote the progress of science and useful arts by 19 securing, for limited times to authors and inventors, the 20 exclusive right to their respective writings and 21 discoveries.\" IP law, properly applied, preserves the 22 incentives for scientific and technological process that is 23 for innovation. Innovation benefits consumers through the 24 development of new and improved goods and services and spurs 256 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025economic growth. 1 Similarly, antitrust law, properly applied, promotes 2 innovation and economic growth by combating restraints on 3 vigorous competitive activity. By deterring anti-competitive 4 arrangements and monopolization, antitrust law also ensures 5 that consumers have access to a wide variety of goods and 6 services at competitive prices. 7 In short, we hope that the hearings will help inform 8 the policy-making process by bringing forth information that 9 may prove useful to enforcers, lawmakers and scholars as they 10 deal with IP questions. We are here to listen and to learn. 11 Our hearings could not be more timely. Despite the 12 growing importance of IP, there is relatively little 13 empirical work on the overall effects of the IP system as 14 currently constituted. Economists have studied some topics, 15 such as inter-industry differences and the effectiveness of 16 patents. 17 Current empirical research on the effects of the IP 18 and patent systems is being conducted under the auspices of 19 the National Academy of Sciences. We are honored that the 20 co-chair of this project, Yale President Richard Levin, is 21 sharing the rostrum today. 22 The net effects on social welfare of various parts of 23 the patent system, however, are not well understood, although 24 IP experts I've talked to tend to hold strong and sometimes 257 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025contrasting views on the topic. 1 As a former professor who was schooled in the law and 2 economics tradition, I believe that good empirical testing 3 and analysis is vital to an informed understanding of the IP 4 and patent systems and to the development of sound policy. 5 Obviously when legal regimes overlap, as IP and antitrust do, 6 there may be sensitivities at the intersection as each regime 7 examines issues that are also important to the other. 8 I would like to underscore that there is no hidden 9 agenda in these hearings. Admittedly, we will hear from 10 critics who have expressed concern that too many patents are 11 inappropriate or overly broad and that patent law today errs 12 on the side of excessive protection of IP. 13 On the other hand, we will also hear responses from 14 IP experts who are staunch defenders of existing patent rules 15 and who strongly oppose any perceived weakening of the 16 system. 17 Our goal is to highlight these contrasting points of 18 view and to lay the foundation for further work that will 19 increase our understanding and thereby enhance the quality of 20 public policy. 21 In sum, our approach to these hearings and to other 22 hearings the Commission may sponsor in the future is nicely 23 encapsulated in a quotation from the first commissioner of 24 patents, Thomas Jefferson: \"Here we are not afraid to follow 258 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025truth wherever it may lead nor to tolerate any error so long 1 as reason is left free to combat it.\" 2 Before turning to my distinguished cochair, Assistant 3 Attorney General James, let me briefly highlight our plan for 4 the hearings, which will take place in stages over a series 5 of days through June. 6 On Friday, we will hold sessions on antitrust basics 7 for patent lawyers and IP basics for antitrust practitioners. These 8 sessions will differ from standard nutshell treatments in that they 9 will focus directly on the issues of interest in the following 10 sessions. They will also focus on which each discipline needs to 11 understand to facilitate the conversation we anticipate during these 12 hearings. 13 I highly recommend these essential foundation 14 sessions to you. Subsequent sessions will address issues 15 such as the roles of competition and IP in spurring 16 innovation, real world experiences with patents, competition 17 and innovation in different industries, likely consumer 18 welfare effects of patent standards and procedures, likely 19 consumer welfare effects of antitrust rules such as those for 20 patent pools, licensing, contract, standard setting, 21 unilateral refusals to deal and settlements. Our scope will 22 include some international and jurisprudential perspectives 23 on these issues. We will close with roundtables that will 24 provide opportunities to assimilate what we have learned. 259 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 Let me turn to our next speaker. Charles James has 1 had an impressive career in both the public and private 2 sectors. He's now the Assistant Attorney General for the 3 Antitrust Division at the United States Department of 4 Justice. He previously served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney 5 General for Antitrust and as Acting Attorney General during 6 the first Bush Administration. He also served in senior 7 positions here at the Federal Trade Commission. 8 In addition, he's had a very successful career at the 9 law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue with an antitrust and 10 trade regulation practice. 11 On a personal note, I've known Charles for 20 years. 12 I am delighted to have the opportunity to work with Charles 13 and his colleagues at the Antitrust Division. I'm especially 14 both pleased and proud that these hearings are taking place 15 jointly with the Antitrust Division with Charles at the 16 helm. 17 Please welcome my friend and colleague, Charles 18 James. 19 (Applause.) 20 CHAIRMAN JAMES: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's 21 my great pleasure to be here today as we open up our 22 hearings into the intersection of antitrust law and intellectual 23 property. 24 I believe in giving credit where it's due. Bob 2510 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Pitofsky, during his tenure as chairman here, did a 1 tremendous job of reviving the role of hearings on 2 competition issues as a basis for assisting in the 3 formulation of antitrust policy, and I'm very pleased that 4 Tim Muris is carrying on that tradition and taking it a step 5 further by inviting we at the Department of Justice to 6 participate as full partners with him in these hearings, and 7 we're certainly looking forward to that the effort. 8 As many of you know, I've spent a good deal of my 9 career disagreeing with the antitrust pundits about just 10 about everything, but one of the things that I do agree about 11 is the significance of the issues that we're confronting 12 today. 13 These intellectual property hearings, as evidenced by 14 the very broad turnout that we see here in this room, have 15 captured the imagination of the antitrust bar, the 16 intellectual property bar, and I can tell you, having just 17 returned from the World Economic Forum, that this was a topic 18 of tremendous discussion there, and there is a tremendous 19 amount of interest in every quarter about the process that 20 we're undertaking today. 21 I think you can see from the slate of kickoff 22 speakers that there is a tremendous amount of seriousness in 23 this, and we certainly applaud the role of the Department of 24 Commerce, both in current and in former personnel from that 2511 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025agency in participating in this hearing. 1 You can see from the group of people who have come 2 together today, including Judge Newman, that these hearings 3 will take place on a very high intellectual plain, and they 4 will be in the best tradition of developing antitrust policy; 5 that is to say that we will try to bring the best thought 6 process to the table and form our policy decisions on that 7 basis. 8 I think if you sit here long enough today, I think 9 you're going to hear from virtually every speaker, and it's 10 one of the benefits of going second, that antitrust law and 11 intellectual property law share a common purpose. Antitrust 12 law certainly attempts to promote competition by preventing 13 artificial restraints on the competitive process. Intellectual 14 property law attempts to promote competition by celebrating 15 and rewarding innovation through the creation of property 16 rights and making sure that those rights have durability by preventing 17 certain forms of imitation or inappropriate use. 18 Consequently, as antitrust law addresses the 19 competitive implications of conduct involving intellectual 20 property and as intellectual property law addresses the 21 nature and scope of intellectual property rights, the key 22 issue here is to have these things in balance, that is, 23 competition laws do what they need to do to protect 24 innovation and our competition laws do what they need to do 2512 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025to protect the competitive process. 1 As Tim said, we approach these hearings with open 2 minds, without any preconceived conclusions, and as Tim 3 indicated, you're going to hear from a broad range of people, 4 both the people on the antitrust side who have concerns about 5 the extent to which property rights preclude competition, and 6 people on the intellectual property side, who hold the view 7 that the over-enforcement of the antitrust laws might intrude 8 into legitimate intellectual property rights, and I think in 9 the middle, hopefully, we will come to some good insights 10 about how both disciplines can coexist and go forward 11 promoting their joint goals. 12 Just by way of some introductory remarks about what I 13 hope will take place at these hearings, I will start by 14 saying that as everyone knows, the Federal Trade Commission 15 and the Department of Justice articulated policies regarding 16 intellectual property in 1995 in a set of guidelines. The 17 most frequently asked question since Tim announced these 18 hearings that I encounter is, \"Is this an effort to rewrite 19 the Intellectual Property Guidelines?\" 20 I don't think that that's necessarily where anyone is 21 going here. I think we are entering these hearings from a 22 view that antitrust policy is best made in the light, and 23 consequently, we want to get the best thinking and get the 24 best information, and we'll let the policy consequences of 2513 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the information process sort themselves out as we are more 1 informed. 2 Throughout this process of formulating the hearings, 3 we found it useful to help to break the issues out into some 4 flexible sub-groups. As with any grouping, the lines aren't 5 always neat, but we hope to aim these hearings to focus on 6 licensing practices involving single IP-holder practices and 7 multiple IP-holders. Currently, the ubiquitous questions are refusal 8 to license IP, and finally the international dimension of IP law as it 9 exists in the various jurisdictions in a global 10 economy. 11 Talking first about some of the issues that we hope 12 we'll explore, in terms of the single firm aspect of it, 13 bundling of intellectual property rights through means of 14 packaged licensing has been an issue that's emerged in a 15 number of antitrust contexts. We certainly hope that that 16 will be explored to some substantial degree. 17 Obviously, these bundling practices can have 18 efficiencies, but the critical question that we encounter as 19 antitrust lawyers is whether or not they properly facilitate 20 or in some instances impede the development and licensing of 21 intellectual property. We hope that many of the speakers in 22 their discussions will help us with regard to that issue. 23 A second issue that we encounter very often is grantbacks. 24 Grantbacks will certainly allow people to share risks, particularly 2514 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025as you think of follow-on inventions from an initial licensing 1 arrangement, but also there is the question about the extent to which 2 grantbacks reduce a licensee's incentive to innovate. The hearings 3 will hopefully inform us on that topic. 4 Finally, in the single firm area we expect to hear 5 about a lot of licensing restrictions, for example, payments 6 or agreements not to compete or agreements that extend beyond 7 the life of the intellectual property rights, the wonderful 8 area of refusals to license. As everyone knows, the decision 9 in the CSU v. Xerox case 18 months ago by the Federal Circuit 10 has been a topic of extensive discussion and thought in both the 11 intellectual property and the antitrust communities. 12 We hope that the hearings will elucidate the thought 13 process underlying that decision, how courts have interpreted 14 it and certainly how courts have handled related issues such 15 as license agreements that are conditioned on certain actions 16 or cross-licensing on another patent or purchasing or 17 requiring purchasing of other products. 18 Patent pooling is an issue that I'm sure will have a 19 great deal of discussion about, especially intellectual 20 property rights and organizations in particular. As everyone 21 knows in the 1990s, the Division examined a number of 22 arrangements, including I think three different proposals 23 regarding MPEG, and two proposals regarding patent pools. In all five 24 instances there were favorable business review letters, and 2515 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025it's important as we go forward in these hearings to examine and 1 reexamine the thought process that underlie those decisions and to make 2 sure that we're applying the appropriate criteria and appropriate 3 approach in evaluating these collective circumstances. 4 On a somewhat related note, standard setting organizations are 5 a very important topic. We know that standards often can facilitate 6 the creation of products through encouragement of compatibility. By 7 the same token, standards organizations bring together competitors 8 which always make antitrust lawyers at least look closely, and making 9 sure that we have the right approaches with regard to standards is an 10 important issue. 11 With regard to standards, it is important from my 12 standpoint that we look to both the creation of the 13 standards, but also the operation of the standards down the 14 road and hopefully bright ideas that we bring together will 15 help us think through those issues. 16 There's a whole host of practical issues that we hope 17 to look to. One of the key issues that comes up in the 18 antitrust context very often is the question of scope and 19 validity. This issue can often be determined competitive as 20 to whether we think that there are firms that are in 21 horizontal or vertical relationships with each other or 22 whether they are, in fact, potential competitors of each 23 other, and that is a significant issue in a lot of our 24 conduct cases as well as our merger analysis. Again we're 2516 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025hopeful that the issues will be discussed fully. 1 Finally in the international area, we now live in a 2 world of global competition. Firms operate across borders. 3 Many of the transactions that we look at are international in 4 dimension, and it is very clear to the business community 5 that different rules regarding intellectual property can 6 impede trade flows, cause tremendous amounts of confusion and 7 substantially complicate antitrust analysis. 8 Recently in December of 2001, the EU published a 9 Green Paper. It's called Technology Transfer Block 10 Exemption. There certainly have been discussions of the 11 intersection of antitrust intellectual property in the UK, 12 Australia and Canada. 13 I hope we'll spend some substantial time during the 14 course of the hearings exploring how intellectual property is 15 treated in various jurisdictions around the world, again 16 promoting the very important convergence agenda that is at 17 the height of what Tim and I are doing in other forums. 18 The fact of the matter is that we have a number of 19 important discussions to undertake over the next several 20 months. The schedule is ambitious. I think the staff of 21 both agencies has done a tremendous job in assembling 22 wonderful panels, getting balance, ensuring that the issues 23 will be explored fully, and we certainly look forward to the 24 opportunity to work with our colleagues at the Federal Trade 2517 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Commission and with all of you as the hearings progress. 1 I believe Tim's going to introduce the first 2 speaker. 3 (Applause.) 4 CHAIRMAN MURIS: As those of you who know me know, this is the 5 sixth or seventh job I've had in government and the third time I've 6 been at the Federal Trade Commission, and it's not surprising that I'm 7 an admirer of people in government service, and one of the best things 8 about it for me is to meet many fine people over the years. 9 And one of my recent experiences excellent 10 experiences along that line has been to meet Jim Rogan. I 11 had admired Jim in the past and have recently had the 12 opportunity to have several occasions to talk to him, and I 13 was particularly excited when he took this job. 14 Judge Rogan obviously will add an important patent 15 perspective. He's the Director of the U.S. Patent and 16 Trademark Office and the Undersecretary of Commerce for 17 Intellectual Property. That makes him the principle policy 18 advisor in the Bush Administration on intellectual property 19 matters, both domestic and international. 20 Judge Rogan also offers an important legislative 21 perspective. He's served two terms in the United States 22 House of Representatives. He was on the House Commerce 23 Committee and the House Judiciary Committee where he earned a 2418 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025reputation as a strong leader in the area of intellectual 1 property. 2 Before his career on the Hill, he was California's 3 youngest sitting state court judge. He served as presiding 4 judge of his court before being elected to the California 5 State Assembly, so please welcome Judge Rogan. 6 THE HONORABLE JUDGE ROGAN: First, I want to thank my 7 good friend, Chairman Tim Muris, for inviting me to 8 participate in these proceedings today, and to also 9 acknowledge both him and another great public servant, 10 Charles James, for their sponsorship. 11 And, Tim, if you will allow me, as we used to say up 12 on the Hill, a point of personal privilege, I want to echo 13 what Charles said about the fine job your staff has done. 14 They have been extremely helpful to us as we have prepared 15 for these hearings, and I want to thank and acknowledge them. 16 The USPTO welcomes the FTC and the Justice 17 Department's desire to air a greater understanding of the 18 patent system. Until recently, patent law was regarded as an 19 esoteric field, understood and navigated by a relative few. 20 It held, at best, a marginal place in law school curricula. 21 Today, both practitioners and law schools know 22 differently, and the FTC and the Department of Justice are to 23 be applauded for helping to create a better understanding of 24 intellectual property rights. In attempting to regulate 2519 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025certain economic relations, a greater appreciation of 1 intellectual property will prevent against the unintentional 2 consequence of stifling the very innovation and competition 3 these hearings seek to encourage. 4 The USPTO is the federal government's tangible 5 expression of commitment to invention and creativity. This 6 commitment goes back to the early days of our republic. Our 7 founders recognized the importance of patents and copyrights 8 in encouraging research and innovation. In drafting the 9 framework for the United States, they placed in the 10 Constitution in Article I, Section 8, the authority for 11 Congress \"to promote the progress of science and the useful 12 arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors 13 the exclusive right to their respective writings and 14 discoveries.\" 15 For over two centuries, our nation has remained 16 deeply committed to that vision. The founders understood 17 that a property interest granted to inventors and creative 18 competitors, for a limited period, would create the incentive 19 for innovation to propel us from a small, agrarian colony 20 into an advanced and prosperous country. The FTC and the 21 Antitrust Division today undertake their missions in an economy in 22 which intellectual property-based enterprises play a leading role. 23 During my service as an elected official, I saw that 24 vision in action. With the decline of defense spending at 2520 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the end of the Cold War, the economy in my home state of 1 California came close to depression: Some 700,000 jobs were 2 lost when defense industries left the state. Yet in a few 3 short years California rebounded dramatically. All of those 4 lost jobs were recovered and more, but they did not come from 5 defense-based industries. Mostly they came from industries 6 based on investment in intellectual property. Today, 7 California continues to lead the nation toward a 8 knowledge-based economy. 9 The understanding of the patent system begins with 10 the recognition that patents are a form of property 11 anticipated by the Constitution. The supposed tension 12 between intellectual property law and antitrust law arises, I 13 suspect, from a misunderstanding of patents as a form of 14 monopoly. Although a patent allows an inventor to exclude 15 others from using or selling the invention without 16 permission, it is not a monopoly in the antitrust sense. 17 While patents can encourage risk-taking and 18 investment in new ideas, patent law also limits the advantage 19 that a patent confers. An inventor does not have an 20 exclusive rights to that invention forever. Once the term of 21 the patent expires, the invention is in the public domain and 22 may be used or manufactured by anyone. This term limit also 23 creates incentives for patent-holders not to rest on their 24 laurels: They must continue to innovate, since the advantage 2521 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025of patent protection is temporary. 1 In granting an inventor a temporary patent, the 2 public is given permanent and valuable consideration. In 3 exchange for the limited grant, inventors must disclose their 4 invention for all the world to see, study, replicate, and 5 make improvements thereon. The patent must describe and 6 disclose the invention so completely that it would allow 7 someone of ordinary skill in the art to replicate the 8 invention without difficulty. 9 This is a remarkable trade-off. It is analogous to 10 asking a business to each its competitors how to use the 11 latest, most cutting edge technology. This disclosure 12 requirement is all the more something when one considers that 13 it also allows a competitor to see where the competition's 14 research may take them in the future. It is highly unlikely 15 that businesses ordinarily would open such windows into their 16 research and development without obtaining a valuable right 17 in exchange. 18 Under our patent system, that which might forever 19 remain locked up as a trade secret is now open for 20 inspection. In analyzing the economic effects of the patent 21 system, commentators often ignore this quid pro quo that 22 society obtains from inventors in exchange for the temporary 23 patent grant. 24 The Patent Act also encourages the disclosure of 2522 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025secret information in another way. It creates an incentive 1 for inventors and businesses to publish their technologies 2 early, even if they do not intend to patent them, since the 3 printed publication of an invention can disqualify another 4 who might independently arrive at the same discovery from 5 obtaining exclusive patent rights in the United States. The 6 FTC has previously noted the importance to competition of 7 having policies that encourage disclosure and research. I 8 know these hearings will highlight the important role that 9 the Patent Act obviously plays in advancing that policy. 10 A patent is not simply a grant of economic advantage, 11 nor is it a form of economic regulation. A patent must be 12 earned through the satisfaction of objective criteria, as 13 well as by appropriate disclosure of the innovation. When 14 the inventor applies to the PTO for a patent, the application 15 is examined to ensure that under the Act, the claimed 16 invention is new, useful and non-obvious when measured 17 against all previous inventions. 18 Patent examination does not include an analysis of 19 the potential commercial impact of the patent. It does not 20 determine the relevant market in which the invention may be 21 marketed or sold. No patent examiner projects the economies 22 of scale to be achieved through the invention. Patent 23 examiners, in considering the breadth of claims, are guided 24 by the principle that a patentee's rights are limited only by 2523 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the ability to make a fully enabling disclosure of the 1 invention, to provide an adequate written description of the 2 invention, to demonstrate the utility of the invention, and 3 to show the invention is novel and non-obvious in view of 4 what we call the \"prior art.\" 5 It is true that an innovator in a new area of 6 technology may gain what is called a \"pioneer patent\" that 7 provides broad rights. There is nothing new, nor should 8 there be anything unsettling about this. The history of 9 patents, and that of America, is replete with examples of 10 inventions that broke new ground. From the telephone to the 11 Internet, from automobiles to plastics, the issuance of 12 patents has not impeded the development of new technologies 13 and industries, despite the initial protests that issuance of 14 the patent would decimate innovation and competition. 15 Although patent law and competition law are not 16 universally congruent, they're highly compatible and serve 17 many similar ends. To the extent that the Patent Act and 18 antitrust laws are based on dissimilar policies, competition 19 regulators are rightfully cautious in assuming that Congress 20 automatically intends the distinctive policies of antitrust 21 laws to trump those underlying the intellectual property 22 system. 23 This is especially true when one contemplates that 24 the foundations of intellectual property are found within the 2524 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Constitution. These hearings rightfully reflect that caution 1 as well as the FTC and Justice Department's recognition of 2 the growing importance of intellectual property rights on the 3 U.S. economy. 4 Over the last two decades, our three agencies have 5 helped work within the framework of the patent system to 6 facilitate innovation and productivity in the American 7 economy. For instance, licensing guidelines at the FTC and 8 DOJ promulgated in the 1980s helped articulate a balanced 9 view of the value of patent rights. 10 That development allowed creative and inventive 11 enterprises to increasingly see patents not merely as a tool 12 for protecting their product market, but as valuable assets 13 that serve a broader economic purposes. Based on the value 14 of these assets, a proliferation of start-up firms in the 15 last decade received financing even before they had products 16 to sell. 17 Today established firms, and in particular 18 universities, now have increasing incentives to look to 19 others who can use their patented technologies in order to 20 maximize return on their intellectual property. In contrast, 21 a return by regulators to viewing IP rights with a 1970s era 22 suspicion would risk interfering with these market-based 23 incentives to innovation. 24 Several independent developments in the last 20 years 2525 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025also have affected patent policy. One was the establishment 1 of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The 2 existence of a court of national jurisdiction for cases 3 involving patents has been an invaluable tool. By reducing 4 the jurisdictional conflicts that had preceded the court's 5 formation, the Federal Circuit has made for a more stable 6 patent system. 7 The USPTO now has a more coherent body of law against 8 which to judge patent applications, and inventors have a more 9 assured basis for making judgments on filings. Patent 10 litigators have a greater ability to anticipate the issues 11 that will be raised in cases concerning whether patents are 12 valid and infringed. This stability has helped contribute to 13 enhancing the value of patent rights as an engine of 14 progress. 15 Another development has been the expansion of the 16 subject matter of patents. Whenever new technologies are 17 prepared for patenting, such as with microorganisms or 18 computer software, the entry of patent law in these areas was 19 greeted with predictions of disaster. Yet today, the United 20 States is the international leader in these and all other 21 areas of technological advancement. 22 Further, the United States has made it a key part of 23 its trade policy to create international frameworks for 24 recognizing intellectual property rights. Agreements 2526 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025negotiated through WIPO and the WTO have enhanced the ability 1 of American inventors and holders of intellectual property 2 rights to obtain and enforce parallel rights abroad. 3 In short, over the past two decades, the value of 4 patents as business portfolio assets has increased, their 5 validity has become more predictable, and the area in which 6 patents could be obtained have expanded. Each of these 7 developments enhances the usefulness of patent law as a 8 motivator for innovation. This is reflected in today's 9 unprecedented explosion of patent applications. 10 There are some who regard the increase in patent 11 filings with suspicion. The USPTO regards this growth with 12 mixed emotions. For a number of years, the USPTO has been 13 engaged in what sometimes seems to be an epic struggle to 14 muster sufficient resources to provide the timely and quality 15 service our customers need. But we remain confident that the 16 growth in patent applications is a boon for America's 17 economy, as well as contributing to the genius for 18 innovation. 19 Looking across the world we see a high correlation 20 between a country's economic strength and the vitality of 21 their patent system. No single cause explains economic 22 growth, but neither is it an accident nor coincidence that 23 the United States stands at the top of both lists. 24 Once again, I thank Chairman Muris for his gracious 2527 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025invitation to participate here today. In accepting the 1 invitation, I committed our agency to helping these hearings 2 facilitate a full discussion on the issues surrounding the 3 interplay of intellectual property and antitrust policy. 4 We look forward to assisting both the Commission and 5 the Department of Justice in gathering whatever information 6 they need to make sound policy decision in today's 7 knowledge-based economy. 8 Thank you. 9 CHAIRMAN MURIS: Thank you very much, Judge Rogan. 10 Let me introduce now Bob Pitofsky, who is my 11 distinguish predecessor here at the FTC. He was chairman for 12 six years, and he encountered many of the complex and 13 difficult issues that we hope to address in these hearings. 14 Indeed Bob was the first person who suggested that we 15 do these hearings, and as on many other matters I took his 16 advice, and it was good advice. Bob, as many of you know, 17 has been a prominent academic for longer than he may care to 18 admit. He's been practicing in these areas for decades. I first 19 encountered Bob when I was a young staffer at the FTC at an AEI 20 conference -- I don't think Bob remembers this, but I had the extreme 21 pleasure of going out to dinner after going after he spoke, with Bob 22 Pitofsky and Bob Bork, and Bob and I have been friends for a long time. 23 He has graciously come back to give us his views on this topic, so I 24 welcome Bob Pitofsky. 2528 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 PROFESSOR PITOFSKY: Well, I didn't remember the 1 dinner with Tim and Bob Bork. Have you got any notes? I 2 would like to see what we both said. 3 I am very pleased to be included here in initiating 4 this program, looking at these very challenging issues at the 5 intersection of antitrust and intellectual property. The one 6 thing that I think we're all going to be unanimous about is 7 these hearings are timely and extremely important. 8 I realize that a set of hearings before a regulator 9 agency, especially on such esoteric subjects, are not usually 10 the subject of the headlines of newspapers, but history 11 demonstrates the fact that quite often it's the hearings and 12 the studies and the analysis that turn out to be more 13 significant and have a greater impact than the high 14 visibility cases that are brought by agencies. 15 And I appreciate Charles James' kind word about the 16 fact that this agency in the '90s restored that tradition. I'm not 17 entirely objective, but I do think this is the place, along with the 18 Department of Justice and the Patent Office, 19 to be exploring this set of issues. 20 It was what this agency was thought to be designed to 21 do in 1914 and 1915. The idea was not just to enforce the 22 laws, not just be an enforcement agency, but examine the 23 question of whether the laws and the procedures that are 24 current deserve to continue to be enforced and to be current, 2529 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025to detect and report on new economic trends, and to 1 investigate on behalf of the administration and Congress of 2 new developments in the economy. 3 Now, these are important hearings. Why? I think the reason 4 is that the economy is immensely dynamic, and most people would agree 5 that innovation is the driving force in that dynamism, that 6 increasingly the products and services that we care about the most and 7 which make the most difference to the success of our economy are 8 products and services that are the embodiment of ideas. 9 Now, it is true that antitrust and intellectual 10 property have the same long-term goals, which is to encourage 11 innovation or incentives to innovate, and to help to contribute to 12 consumer welfare, but the simple fact, the reality is that it hasn't 13 worked all that well at different times in our history. It's not a 14 seamless convergence of policies. 15 In the 1970s, the Department of Justice issued a 16 series of rules and regulations about antitrust and 17 intellectual property, which were very, very restrictive. 18 First of all, there was an assumption in those rules that if 19 you had a patent, you must have market power, and I think 20 that defies common sense. You can have a patent, and nine 21 other people can have a patent, and you could be meeting them 22 in the marketplace or you could be meeting non-patented 23 competitors in the marketplace. 24 Many of the rules declared practices, especially 2530 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025licensing practices, illegal per se, that is, abbreviated 1 analysis in which behavior was declared illegal, simply on 2 the face, without examining why the behavior was engaged in 3 and whether there were good business reasons. 4 Many licensing practices that today would not even be 5 investigated were declared illegal in that set of rules only 6 30 years ago. It was amazing to me to sit with a class of 7 students, as I did just two or three weeks ago, and examine 8 the content of the so-called \"Nine No-Nos\" of enforcement 9 policy in 1970, a far, far cry from where we are today. 10 It seems to me that one must conclude that in that 11 period, enforcement agencies, backed by the courts, had come 12 to a position where antitrust usually trumped intellectual 13 property and the values underlying intellectual property. 14 I do believe that the pendulum has swung a long way 15 since then. There are many examples. I'll use one that 16 Charles mentioned is going to be a subject of these hearings, 17 and that is the CSU v. Xerox case. I have no quarrel with the 18 result of the case, who won and who lost, but the analysis was as 19 follows: That it's a unanimous premise, and I agree with that, that 20 the party holding the patent or a copyright for that matter 21 doesn't have to license it. They can tuck it away. They can put 22 it away. They can do it themselves. They have no obligation to 23 license. 24 That's unanimous, but then the next step in the argument 2531 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025is that because you didn't have to license it in the first place, you 1 can license it on any terms you see fit, with three very, very narrow 2 exceptions. 3 I am very uncomfortable with that kind of analysis. 4 It seems to me that there, intellectual property has trumped 5 antitrust because some of the licensed conditions that could 6 be introduced are licensed conditions that have traditionally 7 been violations of the antitrust laws, and I have in mind, 8 particularly using your monopoly power, your real market 9 power or your monopoly power in one market because you have a 10 patent in order to influence and even monopolize another 11 market. 12 That, it seems to me, is trumping antitrust, and all 13 this occurs in a period in which many scholars are concerned, 14 and I include myself in this group, in the number and the 15 scope of patents that are being issued, even after you 16 discount for the size of the economy. 17 The fact remains that there are more patent 18 applications and more patents issued today per dollar of R&D 19 than has been the case in many decades. I don't think it's 20 because we've become more original and more innovative, and 21 certainly I would look to these hearings to examine the 22 question of why it is that we find ourselves issuing as many 23 patents as we do. 24 What are the possible approaches? First of all, one 2532 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025approach would be to argue that intellectual property is just 1 property, and there's no reason why antitrust must adjust to 2 take to special circumstances of innovation and the 3 embodiment of ideas in to account. I don't think that's 4 right. 5 I think in innovation-type markets, in the high-tech 6 sector of the economy, it is much more dynamic and the 7 durability of market power is less. I don't mean that it's 8 always going to be dissipated in a short period of time, but 9 on average market power isn't going to last as long. 10 Also, as the intellectual property guidelines pointed 11 out, Rich Gilbert had so much to do with, it's so much easier 12 to appropriate, to misappropriate intellectual property, and 13 finally, and I think most significantly, there is emerging in 14 this scholarship a notion that the basic economics of 15 intellectual property markets are different. 16 Most of the expenditure in IP markets is in coming up 17 with the idea in the first place. It's the basic investment 18 in R&D. Once you have the R&D, duplicating the product often 19 doesn't cost anything or hardly anything at all. A copy of a 20 line of computer code, for example, doesn't cost anything at 21 all. 22 The result is that quite often in intellectual 23 property markets I recognize that the tendency is not to 24 curtail output and raise price. It's quite the opposite. 2533 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025It's to increase output and lower price in order to get as 1 many people as possible to use this product which it costs 2 you practically nothing to reproduce. 3 And Andrew Grove in his book \"Only the Paranoid Survive\" has 4 a chapter in which he explains the economics of this. Lawrence Summers 5 has done a paper quite recently on this subject, and I'm quite 6 persuaded the economics could very well be different, and that should 7 be examined in this set of hearings. 8 The other extreme is that antitrust has no role to 9 play at all. Because the market is so dynamic, just leave 10 the market alone, and it will take care of dissipating market 11 power. As Bill Gates in a hearing before Congress said, no one 12 has a key to the factory of ideas. 13 Well, I agree with that, but it doesn't follow that 14 market power will dissipate in a short period of time. First 15 of all, there is the patent itself which creates significant 16 market power for a period of 20 years or the copyright for 17 even longer. There can easily be network effects where once 18 you pass a tipping point in a particular market sector, it 19 becomes almost impossible for anyone to catch up. 20 You can leapfrog over it to a new technology, but 21 catching up is extremely different, and just look at the real 22 world. The fact of the matter is that there are companies in 23 the high-tech sector emphasizing intellectual property who 24 have had market power for quite a period of time -- ten years, 15 2534 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025years -- and brought in enormous profits as a result, pharmaceuticals, 1 bio-tech, computers and so forth. 2 Now, do I think that any company is likely to 3 duplicate the performance of Alcoa in the first half of the 4 century which dominated the market for the first 50 years? 5 No, probably not, but that doesn't mean that you can't have 6 durable market power in this industry. 7 The result is, the bottom line is, I don't agree with 8 either position. Intellectual property is different, and yet 9 I think antitrust has a very important role to play. The 10 question is how do you adjust antitrust in order to fit 11 comfortably with the goals of intellectual property? 12 That is an immense challenge, which I take it will be 13 the centerpiece of these hearings. But with the Department 14 and the FTC, and I'm very encouraged by the fact that the 15 Patent Office is so willing to consider these issues in an 16 open mind in an analytical way, and with the wonderful people 17 who have been at the Commission in the past, Susan DeSanti 18 and others, who have run our hearings, all I can say it's an 19 immense challenge. Lots of luck. 20 (Applause). 21 CHAIRMAN JAMES: All of us today have been 22 celebrating our role in making antitrust policy and making 23 intellectual policy from the standpoint of the enforcement 24 agencies and regulatory agencies. 2535 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 One of the realities of our lives in government is 1 every once in awhile there is another body of your government 2 who can bring our policy decisions down to earth, and that is 3 the judicial branch of our government, which has an equal and 4 very important and very significant role in helping us 5 understand the legal limits on the policy decisions we make. 6 We are very glad today to have the Honorable Judge 7 Pauline Newman here to give us the view from the Court of 8 Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the court that presides over 9 many of these key issues we'll be discussing in our session. 10 She has served on the bench there since 1984. Judge 11 Newman has her roots in the scientific community. She earned 12 her Ph.D. in chemistry from Yale and worked as a research 13 scientist before embarking on a career that led to a service 14 on a wide variety of boards and committees dedicated to 15 addressing legal issues in intellectual property. 16 Judge Newman has authored quite a number of very 17 important decisions, far too many for us to list today, but they are 18 very important, and she has helped to craft the law in this area as 19 much as anyone, and we are indeed very honored to have her speak with 20 us today and to get the judicial branch's input in these important 21 undertakings. 22 Please welcome Judge Newman. 23 (Applause.) 24 THE HONORABLE JUDGE NEWMAN: Chairman James, Chairman 2536 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Muris, Judge Rogan, I'm delighted to share this distinguished 1 podium and to share in the introduction of this very 2 important topic. 3 All of the speakers thus far and surely for the rest 4 of the afternoon will stress the national, social and 5 economic benefits of industrial innovation. We've all 6 recognized what we've come to call the knowledge economy. 7 We're talking here about knowledge based on science, 8 knowledge derived from science, but knowledge that's been 9 made available through technology and through industrial 10 effort, electronics and communications, other new fields, all 11 flowing from advances of science and from entrepreneurial 12 risk-taking commercial investment. 13 Examples in the biological science you mentioned this 14 afternoon, material science, the interrelationship of 15 knowledge and the law and technology has penetrated even the 16 mature businesses of the past. 17 Our court's 20-year existence coincides with this 18 period of intellectual and industrial development, 19 development that's been intertwined with and supported by the 20 laws of intellectual property, primarily patent property on 21 the agenda for today. 22 I should say that I speak only for myself, not for my 23 colleagues on the court and not for our court, and I do draw 24 on my past experience as a scientist and as a lawyer with 2537 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025technology-based industry, and as well as my observations on 1 the Federal Circuit. 2 The Federal Circuit arose from the broad policy study 3 of industrial innovation, as some of the speakers have 4 already mentioned this afternoon, in 1978 President Carter's 5 domestic policy review of industrial innovation. It was a 6 time of serious industrial stagnation. The Federal Circuit 7 was formed as a dramatic move for the purpose of adding 8 stability to the patent law. It was the first change in 9 judicial structure in over a hundred years, perhaps the last 10 for another hundred. 11 Let me tell you something about our court. Patent 12 cases are about a quarter of our case load. The rest of our 13 jurisdiction is mostly historical, derived from our 14 predecessor courts, relating to government contract disputes, 15 tax cases, Fifth Amendment cases and eminent domain claims, 16 Native American claims (we're the successor to the old Indian 17 Claims Commission), child vaccine injury claims, all of those 18 appeals come to us, as well as veterans claims (we're the appellate 19 court for the newly formed Court of Veterans' Appeals), employment 20 disputes, oil and gas price controls left over from the old 21 Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals, which has become quite 22 permanent, and other customs duties case coming 23 from the Court of International Trade come to us, unfair 24 competition and imports. We receive the appeals from the 2538 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025International Trade Commission, the trademark appeals, of course, from 1 the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the other patent 2 office tribunals, a broad variety deriving, as I said, from our 3 predecessor courts and this additional jurisdiction of appeals of 4 patent cases from the district courts in the nation, and the 5 congressional insistence on preserving the general structure of the 6 appellate courts. 7 Most of our judges have a general background. Most 8 of our judges hadn't seen a patent with its nice blue seal 9 before coming on our court. 10 The issues of policy, economics and the law that 11 surround antitrust issues it seems quite clear to me are not 12 the same from those that govern the role of patents. 13 Patents are directed at innovation. That's their 14 purpose, and of course they affect competition. That's how 15 they work. That's the only way they work, and that is why 16 we're here today. The history of trade regulation though 17 shows that these interactions have not always been well 18 understood and perhaps still are not well understood. 19 The role of creative invention and the evolution of 20 scientific knowledge and its practical application and the 21 investment risk-taking in producing new products all become 22 history, most irrelevant, when the products are successful and 23 on the market. But isn't that when antitrust starts? 24 The patent system serves to encourage the start of 2539 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025this lengthy and expensive and risk-laden process. Unless 1 the process of innovation is successfully completed, the 2 patent is of no value. I shouldn't say no value. The 3 knowledge it discloses can be of enormous value. 4 But one of my first assignments as an industrial 5 scientist was to review the technological history of 6 synthetic rubber, and I did easily find about 150 detailed 7 scientific references. Every single one was in the patent 8 literature. None existed elsewhere. 9 In virtually all fields of technology today as well, 10 patents are the major if not the only source of technical 11 information, so it is appropriate to understand the functions 12 of patent systems in considering trade regulation. 13 Patents cover only things that are new, things that 14 were unknown before the patentee discovered them and 15 disclosed them. The technologies have driven the economy 16 since the Industrial Revolution have all invoked the 17 commercial incentive of patents. There are, I'm told, no 18 exceptions, from the cotton gin to the electric light, the 19 airplane. 20 As soon as the inventor showed the way, the 21 entrepreneurial spirits of the nation took hold, and the 22 copiers appeared, and litigation ensued. All the major 23 patents have been through the courts. 24 The economic role of patents was studied as well as 2540 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025it might be at the time of the formation of the Federal 1 Circuit court. You may recall that in the late 1970s, the 2 economy of the nation was at a low point. Investment in 3 basic science and in applied research had disappeared. There 4 were mass layoffs of scientists and engineers. I recall the 5 revolution in the American Chemical Society to try to somehow 6 adjust or interact with what was happening to scientists who had 7 studied and were jobless. 8 Our production in the United States was no longer 9 competitive. Old technologies were stagnant. New ones were 10 dormant, and the balance of trade had turned negative for the 11 first time perhaps in our national history. Only technology-based 12 industry made a positive contribution, and there was concern, real 13 concern, that national policies were not attuned to the needs of 14 this industry, that we had created disincentives to industrial 15 innovation. 16 I was a member of this Domestic Policy Review in the 17 Carter Administration, and I recall talking and thinking 18 about the conclusions, and the conclusion that didn't take 19 much to know, that a diminished patent incentive had evolved 20 in the United States. Chairman Pitofsky mentioned some of 21 the 1970 procedures and guidelines that were being followed. 22 It was clear that antitrust policy as well as 23 judicial attitudes were providing disincentives to 24 technological industry, and the economic consequences were 2541 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025quite apparent, and they led to some major policy changes, 1 new examination practices in the patent office. The 2 Reexamination Statute came out of that study, formation of 3 the Federal Circuit and changes in competition policy, 4 changes still pretty much present. 5 In 1981, a spokesman for the patent section of the 6 Antitrust Division, Roger Anderwell, summarized the economic 7 premises for the policy changes. He said that companies that 8 invest heavily in the research and development of new 9 technologies have about three times the growth rate, twice 10 the productivity rate, nine times the employment growth, and 11 only one-sixth the price increases as companies with 12 relatively low investments in R&D. 13 And that economic philosophy has very much guided the 14 interface, if I can call it that, between antitrust and 15 intellectual property law. 16 This so-called tension, we still call it tension, 17 between the patent laws and the antitrust laws was rebalanced 18 with emphasis on industrial innovation. Today our economy is 19 even more dependent on technology and the advance of 20 technology-based industry than we were 20 years ago. 21 Also during that period we've experienced the most 22 creative, energetic, entrepreneurial surge since the 23 Industrial Revolution because manufacturers are involved. 24 I'm afraid our court can't take all the credit, but I would 2542 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025like to. The creation of our court was a major step that was 1 taken as part of the design to restore the statutory and 2 indeed the constitutional role of intellectual property. 3 Well, we all know, and President Levin has heard me 4 say, how hard it is to quantify the place of patents in this 5 I call it a technological odyssey. The powerful new 6 knowledge that science was producing was better supported by 7 patents. 8 There were harmonious decisions of the Supreme 9 Court. I mention particularly the Chakrabarty decision, 10 which is credited for enabling the bio-tech industry, and the 11 Federal Circuit, after it came into existence, the first 12 thing that it did or tried to do was to restore the 13 strength of the presumption of validity of patents had been in 14 the statute since 1952, for all the good that it did anyone. 15 Our court, from the beginning, has tried to be 16 faithful to the statute. I trust we've succeeded in some of 17 these areas. One of the things that I have noticed since 18 I've been on the court is that the investors, the businesses 19 that have been built on technology, seem to understand what I 20 call the risk return principles of the patent system often 21 far better than the legal system has. 22 This commercial reality is seen in every patent in 23 litigation, and it does contravene some of what I've read 24 being written by the theorists. For example, one sometimes 2543 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025reads, in studies of the patent system, that most patents are 1 on minor changes. That's true. But the conclusion ensues 2 that they aren't worth very much, why bother. 3 Yet in our court we often see patent litigation on 4 what look like relatively minor advances in relatively small 5 industries, but the business they support must be worth at 6 least the hundreds of thousands or the millions of dollars 7 that the litigation costs. 8 Each minor advance leads to the next one, to perhaps 9 what's called a leapfrogging advance by a competitor adding 10 the diversity and competitiveness, instead of the stagnation 11 that we now see in industries where innovation is absent. 12 Economists tell me, I press them on this, that it's 13 not easy to include all the variables and analysis of the 14 relation among technological advance and patent rights. The 15 value of individual patents, of course, varies greatly as do 16 all other aspects of the product and its cost of development 17 and its position in the market. 18 Commentators have well recognized that the dependence 19 of patent protections varies with the industry and its 20 maturity and its capital structure and its rate of 21 technological change, and it does have other factors. I do 22 see it. I welcome the interest of this Commission and of the 23 scholarly interest, but we are still at the threshold of 24 understanding how best to serve the national interest. 2544 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 In the courtroom, each case presents a different set 1 of relationships. The litigation is almost always between 2 competitors, the innovator and often a copier. Litigation 3 occurs after the invention has been developed, after it's 4 been shown to be successful in the marketplace. 5 Only the successes are copied. The creation and the 6 marketing of something new is much rarer, much harder than 7 moving in after it's been proven out. It's for this reason 8 that I say that the intellectual property laws are much 9 broader impact than is measured by market competition, and I 10 am pleased to see on the F.T.C.'s web page that you are receiving 11 submissions on this broader impact. 12 Let me just close with a few thoughts as to broad 13 areas that I think in addition to whatever else you're 14 studying would benefit from review, at least as they apply to 15 new fields of technology. 16 The first one involves very basic fundamental concepts that 17 perhaps it wouldn't hurt to look at it again: how easy or how hard 18 should it be to get a patent? What should be the extent 19 of advance in the field in order to obtain a patent, and how 20 do you measure it? How expensive should it be? 21 As Judge Rogan said, the thing to be patented must be 22 not only new, but it must be unobvious to persons of ordinary 23 skill in the field of the invention. Last year I think there 24 were over 300,000 patent applications, inventors who thought that 2545 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025they met those requirements at least enough to make the initial 1 commitment in the legal fees to get into the system. 2 What an extraordinary testament to intellectual 3 vigor. Not all of these applications will be granted, but 4 maybe half will. So I wonder what's going to happen to the 5 other half. Are they going to be shelved? Are they going to 6 be hidden in secrecy? How many of those will be developed to 7 benefit the marketplace? 8 The standard of unobviousness is the core of the 9 United States' law of patentability. The early United States 10 patent statues required only novelty and utility, as in 11 England, that's what the British law required, but the judges 12 often instructed the jury on something they called 13 invention. Justice Story called patentability the 14 \"metaphysics of law.\" 15 Now, it's in our statutes since 1952 and requires 16 unobviousness and there is a large body of precedent applying that 17 standard. In litigation most patents are attacked on that 18 ground. It's fuzzy ground. It's hard to decide, difficult 19 to administer, even harder to set. 20 Some of you may remember at the time that the 21 European patent was being established in order to try to 22 ascertain what standard should be set for the examiners in 23 the European patent office, the various systems were studied, 24 and it was ultimately decided to try to establish a standard 2546 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025sort of halfway between that which was being applied in 1 Germany and that which was being applied in the Netherlands, 2 perhaps approximating the vigor in the United States, 3 perhaps a little more rigorous. I must say I'm no longer 4 current on international practices. 5 What I have observed, however, is still the 6 continuing similarities in the scope of patents that are 7 granted in the various countries. Much has been written, is 8 being written on patent scope, for it has many implications 9 for the patentee and of course for competitors. 10 How easy, how hard should it be to avoid someone 11 else's patent while using his idea? The Federal Circuit has 12 in recent years tightened its view of patent scope, tightened 13 its view of how the law of infringement should be 14 interpreted. 15 As a result, our decision constraining the doctrine 16 of equivalents is now before the Supreme Court, where much of 17 the argument related to the balance between innovator and 18 copier, a lot of discussion of fairness as well as the 19 economics. 20 These are hard questions. They have many 21 implications beyond competition, beyond patentability. For 22 instance, some of our opinions have said that if you, the 23 patentee, wanted broader coverage, you should have done more 24 work. You should have had more examples of broader 2547 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025specification and entitled yourself to broader coverage. 1 There's as much commentary on all of this. Some 2 decisions have said, Well, you should have fought longer and 3 harder with the patent examiner instead of taking what you 4 could get. The critics say that all of this adds to the 5 front-end cost, diverts resources at a time when they're 6 scarcest, because it's often uncertain, at the time the 7 patent application must be filed, even more so if we go to a 8 first-to-file system, in order to decide whether the product 9 has market value. 10 The response and generally my court's position is 11 that the limits of the grant should be clear. There should 12 be clear notice to competitors of what's covered and what's 13 available without the court having to tell you. 14 These are important questions of law, policy and 15 economics, and there are risk factors. Risk factors of 16 course vary with the field of the invention, and again the 17 front-end costs of R&D. How much you can do before you're 18 reasonably assured of a return on that R&D -- do you have to do -- 19 depends on the field of the invention. 20 In some fields technology is soon obsolete. The 21 common thread, the fundamental theme of patents is that the 22 prospect of a commercial advantage is an effective incentive, 23 effective enough to meet our national economic goals, and that 24 reducing that prospect reduces the incentive. How to measure 2548 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025all of this I will leave in your hands. 1 I see the strength of the patent system drawn from 2 the principles of property. The securing of property, as one 3 discovers, this is the word that the Constitution uses, to 4 secure the right, was viewed as the securing of a natural 5 right. It's interesting to me to compare Jefferson's view of 6 patents as primarily an instrument of fairness with Madison's 7 view as an incentive to commercial enterprise, but both of 8 these accord with a powerful view, the powerful belief of the 9 framers in the sanctity of property. 10 And it's these property rights, as I see it, that are 11 the foundation, the economic foundation of the innovation 12 incentives that are built on technology. 13 I have yet to come upon an improvement in the 14 simplicity and effectiveness of the principle that legally 15 protected exclusivity for a limited time in exchange for the 16 disclosure of the new knowledge is an incentive, an effective 17 incentive to innovation. 18 So where are we? Science and its applications have never been 19 more promising. Technological development has never been more dynamic. 20 The public disclosure role of patents in this context is at least as 21 important as it's ever been. The 22 knowledge contained in patents is not owned by the patentee. 23 It's contributed to the public. 24 Only the use of the knowledge in tangible embodiments 2549 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-80251 that you sell is controlled by the patentee. Others can use 2 that knowledge to enhance their understanding, the progress 3 of science to build on it. In that sense the property is the 4 converse of intellectual, for the ideas in patents are freely 5 available to all. 6 I was interested to hear that you're also going to study 7 foreign patent and antitrust aspects because we know that much of the 8 patented technology in the United States is of foreign origin. This 9 reflects the large foreign presence in our markets, and United States 10 industry reaching into world markets under foreign patents. 11 In our court, sometimes both sides are foreign 12 entities or at least the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign 13 entities, and the patent decisions in other courts, we see 14 this in some of the European states, often are United States 15 origin inventions. 16 Other nations are studying our law. They're very 17 interested in our judicial structure. We often have 18 delegations finding out what is the secret of the 19 entrepreneurial vigor and the creative strength of the United 20 States. Again I would like to think it's the Federal 21 Circuit. 22 So I conclude with a truism, that an understanding of 23 intellectual property in all of its complexity is fundamental 24 to the development of an optimum national policy. 25 So I commend you, Mr. Chairman, General James, for 2650 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025this educational afternoon. 1 (Applause.) 2 CHAIRMAN JAMES: Our next two speakers, Q. Todd 3 Dickinson and Gerald Mossinghoff, have both helped lead the 4 Patent and Trademark Office. First, Mr. Dickinson is a former 5 Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the 6 Undersecretary of Commerce for intellectual property. 7 He is now a partner at Howrey, Simon, Arnold & 8 White. He specializes in intellectual property, drawing on 9 his wealth of experience in this field. He's also written 10 extensively on topics of keen interest to us today, including 11 electronic commerce and IP enforcement in a knowledge-based 12 economy. 13 He's taught at George Washington University, my alma 14 mater, which makes him brilliant; Georgetown University; 15 George Mason University, a place of fondness to Chairman 16 Muris; University of Pittsburgh; and Tokyo University. 17 Please welcome Q. Todd Dickinson. 18 MR. DICKINSON: Thank you, General. Thank you again 19 for inviting me, and I know I join my colleagues, both 20 current and former at the USPTO, in thanking you and Chairman 21 Muris for convening these hearings because this is obviously, 22 as many speakers have pointed out, a critical and an 23 important topic for us to investigate. 24 Let me also thank Judge Newman. She is a tough act 2551 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025to follow in many ways. She does a beautiful job at 1 articulating many of the key issues that are before us, and 2 so what I'm hoping to do today is just touch on a few of them 3 from the perspective of someone who has had to, as my 4 colleagues have, administer the system and talk about a few 5 of the particular issues that are involved there that I've 6 understood your point to look into during the hearings. 7 I think it's instructive to recall, as several 8 speakers have, just what the benefits attained by 9 intellectual property systems and the policy rationale for 10 them are in the first place. 11 As was suggested, the first and principal rationale 12 obviously is that many times economic incentives are needed 13 to motivate people to invest fully in research and 14 development into new technologies, and we provide those 15 through the systems that we've been talking about today. 16 By providing that period of exclusivity, prohibiting 17 others from copying innovation, they are designed to 18 encourage the investment in that research and development and 19 in the resulting innovation. 20 This has been repeatedly demonstrated, and I'm going 21 to put some of this in historical context. This has been 22 repeatedly demonstrated throughout our history in the United 23 States. The patent grant and the copyright grant are both 24 constitutionally based, and they were among the first laws 2552 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025passed by the very first Congress sitting in Philadelphia, 1 and those systems, I think, have led in many ways to the 2 United States being among the most technologically advanced 3 and culturally rich countries the world has ever known. 4 Now, sometimes, as people have said, we call these 5 rights monopolies. I think that's probably too strong a 6 word. It obviously has inherent and sometimes negative 7 connotations, so what is really granted is a fairly limited 8 property right in many cases, property right whose economic 9 value will often be determined by the market and not by 10 government fiat. 11 Also, I think it's important to remember that in only 12 a very small percentage of cases can patented ideas survive 13 the product development cost burdens, the manufacturing 14 problems, the marketing problems, and the other rigors of 15 getting them into an actual product, and many patent ideas 16 that do end up in cover alternatives, incremental optional 17 features, cost savings, et cetera, and don't ordinarily 18 displace alternatives, and they can also, in many cases, be 19 easily designed around. 20 There are also many inherent legal limits on the 21 protection that patents can afford. A valid patent, some 22 have said, is really nothing more than a limited term right to bring 23 an expensive and lengthy lawsuit against infringers on the basis what 24 may turn out to be narrowly drawn or interpreted claims. 2553 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 Moreover, any prior use, any sale, any publication or 1 public knowledge more than one year prior to the application 2 filing date is an absolute bar to the validity or enforcement 3 of such a patent. It might be suggested that therefore only 4 on occasion or rarely can individual patents or small 5 clusters of patents, even if fully enforced, provide 6 significant market exclusivity, and only in narrow and new 7 markets for limited terms, no matter how unfairly one might 8 seek to define that relevant market. 9 The number of truly pioneer inventions or pioneer 10 patents that turn out to be capable of providing significant 11 market power with sufficiently broad claims may be indeed 12 fairly small, and if so, are usually well deserved. 13 Now, this is not to suggest that multiplicity of 14 patents or what have been called patent thickets or patent 15 shields or other collections of patents could not establish 16 sufficient barriers to entry to create the possibility of 17 market power. I think that's one of the issues that these 18 hearings will elucidate in many ways, but as I say there are 19 many vehicles and many mechanisms that are used to address 20 the negative implications of that, designing around being a key 21 one, thereby improving the process. 22 In turn, broad cross-licenses are given to those 23 improvements. These mechanisms can help break down some of 24 those thickets and shields and provide business access to the 2554 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025intellectual property and actually encourage competition. 1 Now, obviously this is not to say that certain 2 situations could not raise anti-competitive concerns. Some 3 of them have been talked about this morning. One can 4 certainly envision when patent thickets arise when 5 accompanied by anti-competitive conduct, they can tip the 6 balance between IP protection and the antitrust laws. 7 The Commission and the Department have dealt with 8 these, for example, in the DVD context, MPEG and others, and 9 they have mechanisms to deal appropriately with such 10 situations. But again it's not necessarily the patent 11 thicket itself, I don't think, which tips the balance. It's 12 the anti-competitive conduct. 13 Some, however, including perhaps a lot of folks in 14 the academic world, worry that overly strong IP protection 15 rights or those which might be inappropriately or overly 16 expansively granted may actually have the opposite effect to 17 this incentive that we've talked about, and that may serve as 18 an impediment rather an incentive for the kind of 19 technical progress the patent system was designed to foster. 20 Repeated studies have sought to analyze this question 21 over the years from a variety of pedagogical viewpoints, and 22 frankly I think they've come to a fairly widely varying 23 results. For every individual who believes that broad 24 patent rights will choke such important and fast-moving 2555 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025fields as the Internet or genomics, there are others who 1 argue that the historic record and frankly the current market 2 might suggest otherwise. 3 I'll give you an example. Some have argued for years 4 against the patenting of software. It's been a long running 5 debate, since the first programmable digital computers had 6 software which was accessible generally. 7 They have charged that the patenting of software in 8 this context would actually impede, maybe even strangle, an 9 important industry sector in the United States. Yet today, 10 we patent software routinely. It's one of the fastest 11 growing categories of patenting in the office, and the patent 12 software industry seems to be remarkably robust in the United 13 States, and the factors that have contributed to certain 14 charges of market dominance in that field have not implicated 15 patent rights. 16 Now, when new technologies arise, they even create a 17 significant enthusiasm to spread that technology very 18 rapidly, and sometimes intellectual property is seen as an 19 impediment to that spread, and I think that's a fair 20 reaction, it's a natural reaction, particularly when it's 21 those technologies may be widely accessible or easily copied. 22 However, most of these new technologies, at the same 23 time, depend very heavily for their commercialization on the 24 protection and the nurturing effect that IP systems properly 2556 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025provide. 1 Investors in such new technologies often require that 2 there be strong assets to provide the collateral to back up 3 those investments. If they can be copied easily by 4 competitors, there's obviously less incentive to invest, so 5 ultimately there's a tension, the tension in these hearings 6 again will illustrate between the need to incentivise 7 invention and particularly follow-on invention and the need 8 to incentivise investment in the development and 9 commercialization, and then to make that technology widely 10 available. 11 It's also important to note that many factors will 12 affect the commercialization of technology, especially in 13 fast growing areas. There's sometimes a presumption that 14 patents can bring this to a halt. As we've said, if only 15 patents were often that powerful. Ordinary market forces can 16 often swamp that effort, and moreover, as we've said, 17 designing around and other types of mechanisms have contributed 18 here. 19 For every one-click patent which is alleged to 20 dominate on the on-line retailing market, for example, there 21 comes a new solution, such as two-click with its inherent 22 technological and commercial advantages and potential outcome 23 at the end of the day, and I hope that the studies that this 24 process will evaluate and bring to light will provide a 2557 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025balanced review of this area, and a subsequent understanding 1 of the reality of the situation which I think is much more 2 important than the academic arguments that are sometimes 3 engaged in. 4 Let me again reiterate and commend, mirroring what 5 Chairman Muris had said and commend President Levin -- and 6 Commissioner Mossinghoff is involved in this as well -- for the 7 study they're undertaking at the National Academy of Science, 8 and I think that's extremely valuable. 9 Let me talk a little bit about some of these specific 10 topics. Patent thickets, again let me return to that for a 11 second and how that relates to what we do or what we've done 12 at the Patent Office. 13 Some concerns we've said have been raised over the 14 extent to which these new technologies may lead to multiple 15 licensees and multiple patents and what the competitive 16 effect of this might be. 17 The principal evidence behind a lot of these concerns 18 appears to be the increasing number of patents, and several 19 speakers have addressed this issue of patents and the number 20 of patents and patent applications which are processed 21 through the Office. 22 There hasn't been a lot of empirical data yet. I 23 would suggest, though I know there are some studies out 24 there, that would demonstrate just where these actual 2558 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025thickets are in a particular industry. I think that will be 1 an important thing to come to understand, if indeed such a 2 thicket or such a concentration existed. 3 It may be something that's more researched as 4 occurring across a wider spectrum of technologies, and these 5 new technologies, as they arise, there may be an 6 underappreciation of the potential for patent protection 7 where this expansion occurs in areas such as business 8 methods. 9 It may also be the case that reforms in the patent 10 laws and policies that we'll talk about, and I'll talk a 11 little bit more in a minute, have made the patent system more 12 accessible and made it where at one point in time it may have 13 been underutilized. 14 Also, I think a lot of the arguments about thickets, 15 unfortunately, tend to seem to rest, at least the ones that 16 I've heard, on fairly anecdotal evidence, where patents are 17 categorized as broad or overbroad, either through a have I 18 expansive reading of the patent, maybe the abstract, maybe 19 the press releases in some cases I've noted when companies 20 obtain patents. 21 It should be reminded that the claims of the patents 22 are the only thing that have a legal effect, and as the 23 Commission and the Department and others study this, I think 24 they need to make sure they get below the surface to a lot of 2559 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025these arguments to the reality of them. 1 Of course it is indeed possible, maybe even likely, 2 that thickets might exist in certain areas, but I think we 3 have to take them in many cases on a case-by-case basis. 4 Let me talk about the issue of scope of protection, 5 which I think is another issue. Defining patentability 6 subject matter is at root. It's a matter for the Congress 7 and for the courts to decide, and as Judge Newman talked 8 about, we have gotten very clear guidance in this area in 9 many ways, from the very seminal opinions 20 years ago in 10 Diamond versus Chakrabarty where the Supreme Court held that 11 genetically-engineered living organisms were appropriate 12 subject matter within the scope of Section 101 of the Patent 13 Act, and then in doing that propounded the broader philosophy 14 that anything under the sun made by the hand of man is 15 patentable subject matter. 16 Right up to the present time, the U.S. system has 17 taken a very expansive view of what is protectable by patent, 18 and in many ways, we are by far the world leader in 19 recognizing and expanding that. 20 And just a month or so ago the Supreme Court in the 21 JEM case reiterated and actually went from a five to four 22 vote up to a six to three vote on this basic tenant of the 23 patent law. 24 Now, most observers would I think recognize that this 2560 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025change, this evolution, this setting that we've come to has 1 also been a very significant contributing factor in the 2 United States to developing new technological markets, 3 technology probably being the singular example. 4 Another great foundation or principle of our system 5 in the United States is that it's technology neutral. It 6 aims to apply the same norms to all inventions and all 7 technologies. Now, some are critical of that. That's 8 understandable, but I think that the uniformity and the 9 neutrality of patent standards, of novelty, the obviousness, 10 non-obviousness and utility have allowed it to respond to new 11 sciences, entire new industries, without the need for 12 Congress to constantly retool the law with the attendant 13 political pushes and pulls, depending on who's in power or 14 who's the chairman of a particular committee or not. 15 The natural evolution of the patent system I think is 16 no small achievement. More importantly, I think these 17 arguments that have been made about the scope of 18 patents may be actually after the wrong target in some ways, 19 with potentially negative results. 20 I think in that context, it's very important to 21 distinguish between patentability, what's patentable on the 22 one hand, and access or licensing or the ability to get at 23 that technology on the other hand. 24 Now, licensing clearly has antitrust implications, if 2561 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the underlying behavior is anti-competitive. However, in 1 many areas where the actual concern is about access, we were 2 talking about software a minute ago, genomics, even to some 3 degree the very rigorous debate about HIV/AIDS drug pricing 4 in South Africa. Those who would suggest that the concern 5 needs to be dealt with have dealt with it by trying to attack 6 patentability instead of licensing and access, and I think 7 that's getting at it from the wrong end. 8 As I said though this is not to suggest that certain 9 types of patents may not raise legitimate questions of access 10 that have market implications. 11 These examples, while important, in many cases tend 12 to be fact- or technology-specific and therefore can be best 13 dealt with with an individualized or medial approach perhaps 14 rather than a broad brush. 15 An important and I think justified concern in this 16 area is what's called patent layering. It occurs at the 17 moment most significantly I think in the genomics industry. 18 The concern is that patents which issue on gene sequences, 19 perhaps even greater concern on fragments like expressed 20 sequence tags or single nucleotide polymorphisms, will be so 21 numerous, yet issue to such a multiplicity of inventors and 22 assignees so as to form a kind of intricate licensing web 23 that prevent other researchers from gaining access. 24 For example, if you were going to commercialize a 2562 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025diagnostic method, you may have to go from owner to owner to 1 owner to owner with redundancies and cost implications that 2 are clear. 3 To address this concern I commissioned, when I was 4 over at the Office, what was called a white paper on 5 so-called patent pooling to analyze whether this traditional 6 means of dealing with this issue might be appropriately 7 applied in the biotechnological area. 8 Now, in traditional antitrust terms I think patent 9 pooling's often thought to have negative effects and can 10 be highly discouraged when it's unregulated. However, when 11 we have a situation as we're talking about here -- another 12 recent example would be the MPEG or High Definition 13 Television, for example -- there is a really opportunity I 14 think to moderate the negative effects, to increase access by 15 pooling together with appropriate oversight and regulations. 16 That white paper I think is still on the USPTO web site. 17 Another good example of an appropriate access 18 mechanism that's worked is a very similar one, and that's 19 one, for example, that was adopted 20 years ago by the 20 University of California, San Francisco and Stanford, who 21 were the assignees of the Cohen/Boyer patent for manipulated 22 recombinant DNA, a very basic -- in fact it's a very pioneer 23 patent. 24 The assignees in that case, recognizing the issues 2563 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025they were faced with, chose to license that patent, chose to 1 license that patent freely to any academic researcher or any 2 non-commercial researcher that wanted to use it and charged 3 an appropriate licensing mechanism for the commercializer of 4 that. 5 As a result in many ways the bio-tech industry 6 continued to grow and prosper, and we've seen that today 7 recently in a similar mechanism where the Wisconsin Alumni 8 Research Function has entered into a similar licensing 9 program with regard to their system cell patent, also a very 10 significant pioneering patent. 11 One issue that this highlights, which I think should 12 be -- I think those of us in the intellectual property 13 community are very nervous when it's invoked, one issue which is 14 clearly sort of on the table, and that's the question of 15 compulsory licensing. 16 I think it probably behooves us to look primarily in 17 that area to much less drastic alternatives, cross licensing 18 mechanisms we've talked about before, the use of superior 19 licensing, negotiating strength in certain areas and 20 particularly the public sector. NIH's agreement with WARF 21 would be a good example, even jawboning by public policy 22 officials. An example of that recently would be HHS's Secretary 23 Thompson's discussions with the Bayer Corporations on Cipro in the wake 24 of the recent anthrax attack and the patent pooling I talked 2564 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025about before. 1 Let me talk briefly about the breadth of patents 2 which are issued, because I know that's another key question 3 which people have talked about a lot, and before I do that, 4 specifically let me touch on an issue which Director Rogan 5 mentioned, and that is the issue of revenue. That directly 6 affects this question. 7 USPTO is one of the only, if not the only, fully fee 8 funded agency in the federal government, and any diversions 9 of fees from the USPTO that occurred on my watch, on his 10 watch, and others' watch, continues to be a significant 11 problem, particularly if that magnitude increases. It 12 directly affects its mission, the quality of its products and 13 services. 14 And I think I would applaud those in Congress who are 15 trying to take steps to statutorily end this on a permanent 16 basis and solidify the PTO's revenue position. 17 I think also additional resources need to be 18 developed to further that mission. Patent examiners need 19 more time to examine. They do, especially in increasing 20 complex arts, especially with the greater burden which, with 21 all due respect to Judge Newman, which the courts I think are 22 appropriately placing on the Office to make a greater and 23 more complete record. 24 In this case time truly is money, and if the quality 2565 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025is to be further improved, resources have to be found. Now, 1 this is not to say in any means that the examiners don't do a 2 great job with the resources they have. They do, but this is 3 not a case of trying to go to terrible to perfect. This is 4 rather going from very good to better. 5 Now, second, much of the public comment on breadth 6 seems to be again kind of anecdotally driven or somewhat 7 based on flawed methodologies. Many critics of patent 8 breadth choose very individual patents to pick them out. 9 The USPTO issued 190,000 patents last year, 10 and they picked these out to try to make their case. 11 I think it's very important that we understand the 12 breadth of the kinds of issues we're talking about in this 13 area rather than using war stories or individual cases. 14 However, one of the mechanisms for dealing with that 15 is the reexamination system, which would allow the Office to 16 go -- allow the patentee or third-party to bring that patent 17 back into the Office for reexamination in light of additional 18 prior art. 19 Now, traditionally there's tension here. Congress 20 took this issue up no less than three years ago, passed a 21 bill expanding reexamination somewhat, but leaving a 22 system which still had some rather significant holes in it. 23 Congress, fortunately, I think is something in a mood to 24 reconsider this issue again. I would hope that they do 2566 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025because I think that the reexamination system is a very 1 valuable one but it needs additional reform. 2 Let me touch on the issue that Judge Newman talked 3 about, and that's the issue of obviousness. The USPTO 4 searches and examines in accordance with statutory and 5 regulatory law. Section 103 is a good example of that, but in that 6 case, the courts have required the Office to apply only specific and 7 definitive art references with clear motivation of how to combine those 8 references, and only that will suffice for this obviousness 9 determination. 10 As recently as last month, the CAFC stated that this 11 evidence had to be clearly documented. The examiner could 12 not even rely on the general knowledge that the examiner had 13 in the field or even common sense for an obviousness 14 determination. 15 Regarding patent quality measures generally, let me 16 suggest that the only really comprehensive data of quality 17 that I'm aware of that's really truly comprehensive happens 18 to reside in the USPTO itself, in their owner quality 19 assurance process. 20 This cuts across all technologies. That process is 21 conducted by the most seasoned, the Grade 15 examining 22 professionals, that's been in place for many decades. There's a 23 large body of data. It's constantly reviewed by USPTO management, 24 by the Inspector General at the Department of Commerce and by GAO 2567 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025and subject to congressional oversight. 1 It is showing a remarkable consistency in quality 2 over the long-term, so anyone who would choose to study, I 3 hope folks do, quality in this area needs to gain access and 4 use that particular data. 5 However, when new technologies emerge -- a good example 6 would be business methods, which I know was an issue that was 7 cited in the materials leading up to this meeting -- additional and 8 perhaps tailored approaches need to be taken. That issue arose in 9 2000, and what we did in the Office was to put in place the 10 so-called business method initiative which, while these patents 11 have been issuing since the mid-1860s on, while the IBM Corporation 12 was founded on a pair of patents from the 1890s on the method of 13 keeping statistical records, they've really come into their open 14 as a result of the State Street Bank opinion and the growth of the 15 Internet. 16 I think it's instructive. Many people have been 17 concerned about the growth of these patents in the Office. 18 They are rapidly increasing, but it's also instructive to 19 note, they're less than a half of 1 percent at the moment of 20 all the patents that issue out of the office. 21 But the concerns about how this Office addresses them 22 are real and genuine, so we issued this business method 23 initiative. Among other things, we brought the private 24 sector in these technologies, insurance industries, 2568 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025securities industry, et cetera, into the Office to help the 1 examiners understand them better, and we instituted what was 2 called the second look where a very seasoned examiner or 3 quality assurance specialist reviewed them a second time 4 before it issued. 5 And the effects of this was the overall allowance 6 rate dropped down to about 40 percent, which is almost 25 7 percent or more less than the overall issue rate in the 8 Office. 9 Finally, let me talk about an issue that Chairman 10 Pitofsky raised, and that was the number of patents that 11 issued overall and what the implications are of that. Let me 12 suggest, he raised a concern about it. 13 I think as Director Rogan stated, it's obviously a 14 concern for the Office in its operations and its revenue. I 15 think it will be a very interesting thing to determine what 16 the impact of the effect of that is overall. Some would 17 suggest that it's a natural consequence of reforms that were put in 18 place to strengthen the patent system. 19 It's also I think a natural consequence of the 20 increased investment in research and development. It's 21 also a consequence of the increase in foreign filing in the 22 United States. 23 I think we also need to remember that patents expire, 24 not at the end of their full term, but they expire when 2569 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025someone fails to pay the maintenance fees, and that something 1 like on two-thirds of patents, the maintenance fee at year 12 2 is not paid. 3 Let me talk a little bit about some of the reforms 4 which may have led to this multiplicity, we'll call it, of 5 patents. In the early '80s principally and into the '90s they 6 included things like creation of the CAFC, Diamond versus 7 Chakrabarty, the reexamination system, the Bayh-Dole Act, 8 better, at least more certain, funding mechanisms. 9 All of these I think have contributed to making 10 people feel -- business people, researchers, investors feel 11 more secure in the patent system, and that likely has driven 12 up I think in many ways the number of patents which have 13 issued. 14 I think we need to place this in a certain context. 15 It may not be that there are too many patents issuing today, 16 but rather that there might have been, if you will, too few 17 before, that they were underutilized, undervalued because of 18 flaws in the system at the time. 19 Some have also suggested the process the USPTO 20 conducts is without adequate oversight. I don't think that's 21 the case either with their conduct or their policy function. For 22 example, the software field, three public hearings have been 23 held in the last decade to get input. Long comment periods 2470 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025have ensued after that. 1 As we developed examination guidelines on 2 biotechnology and utility and written description 3 requirements and others, those examination guidelines were 4 subjected to the review process and comment process. They 5 were revised in accordance with comments. NIH in particular 6 was very involved in the comment period relative to the 7 utility guidelines, so I think that needs to be remembered as well. 8 So let me close there with one final comment, just a 9 brief one, and that is that I think that the Commission and 10 the Department need to be aware that there has been -- maybe 11 it's a slight note of caution. There has been a very 12 significant amount of discussion and interest in the 13 intellectual property community leading up to these 14 hearings. 15 I think it may even be fair to characterize it as 16 wariness, particularly in light of how some of the issues 17 were framed. Many folks I think in the IP community feel 18 that the legal and policy issues here are among the most 19 sophisticated and challenging. 20 And when I was doing my own patent work, I worked in 21 the field of catalyses, where you used to say small changes 22 in structure can make a big difference in outcome, and I 23 think that's the concern that is expressed here as we work to 24 change or modify or improve the system, so I would certainly 25 urge on their behalf a cautious and deliberate approach which 2671 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025I think certainly seems to be the case so far. 1 Also there are significant international implications 2 to this that we need to be mindful of. This process does not 3 occur in a vacuum in this, and previous administrations 4 worked very closely with our colleagues overseas to bring 5 harmony and consistency to the law, and in some way it would 6 be a difficult situation if the United States were sending in 7 inconsistent messages on such critical issues. 8 I hope we also bring others in to the process as well 9 from other agencies in the government, USTR, the State 10 Department, Customs Service and others. 11 Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, General, for 12 giving me the opportunity. 13 (Applause.) 14 CHAIRMAN JAMES: Just in case anyone is continuing to 15 harbor the notion or doesn't understand that our Patent and 16 Trademark Office is now and always has been in very capable 17 and thoughtful hands. 18 Our next speaker, Gerald Mossinghoff, is also a 19 former Assistant Undersecretary of Commerce and Commissioner 20 of Patent and Trademarks. 21 Now, among other things, he brings to us an 22 impressive level of international experience in this area. 23 He was the United States Ambassador to the Diplomatic 24 Conference on the Revision of the Paris Convention and 2572 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Chairman of the General Assembly of the United Nations World 1 Intellectual Property Organization. 2 On the domestic side, Mr. Mossinghoff played a key 3 role in advising President Reagan regarding the establishment 4 of the Federal Circuit, and I believe his remarks today will 5 address on that along with other important topics in the 6 international area. 7 (Applause.) 8 HONORABLE GERALD MOSSINGHOFF: Thank you very much. 9 I'm very honored to be able to participate in these very 10 important hearings. 11 My name is Gerald J. Mossinghoff, and I am senior 12 counsel to the Arlington intellectual property law firm of 13 Oblon, Spivak, McClelland, Maier & Neustadt. In addition to 14 that I teach intellectual property because at the George 15 Mason School of Law and the and the George Washington 16 University Law School. 17 During President's first term, I served as Assistant 18 Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and 19 trademarks. During that time, we were able to achieve 20 significant progress in the protection of intellectual 21 property. With bipartisan support across the three branches 22 of government, we enacted realistic user fees for the Patent 23 and Trademark Office that led to that office being sufficient, 24 and has been pointed out today, tragically it's more than 2573 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025self-sufficient. It's a source of income for totally 1 unrelated government programs. 2 We set goals, ultimately achieved, of reducing the 3 average time of patent pendency to 18 months and trademark 4 pendency to 13 months. 5 Concrete steps were undertaken toward automating the 6 USPTO's enormous databases leading to the goal of a paperless 7 office. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was 8 established as we've heard. 9 We established a formal Trilateral Cooperation 10 arrangement with the European Patent Office and the Japanese 11 Patent Office, and that trilateral cooperation, which will 12 celebrate its 20th anniversary next year, has proved to be 13 extremely useful in fostering cooperation and harmonization 14 both on technical matters and automation in other areas and 15 in broad policy issues. 16 The penalties for illegal counterfeiting were 17 significantly increased, and effective enforcement measures 18 established. 19 The Computer Chip Protection Act was amended. 20 We laid the foundation that led to the United States 21 joining the Berne Copyright Convention. 22 And we began the steps that led to multinational 23 intellectual property norm-setting being conducted in the 24 GATT as opposed to in the World Intellectual Property 2574 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Organization. This resulted in the landmark agreement on 1 trade-related aspects of intellectual property or TRIPS, in 2 the World Trade Organization. 3 I am convinced that this progress was the direct 4 result of the close cooperation during that period between 5 the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, then 6 under the leadership of Assistant Attorney General William 7 Baxter, and the USPTO. 8 We were in weekly, monthly consultations and 9 cooperation, putting these policy matters together and 10 getting them enacted. 11 This afternoon, in the brief time available, I'll 12 focus on three what I refer to as blue collar kinds of 13 issues: First, the critical importance of an adequately 14 funded USPTO; secondly the Court of Appeals for the Federal 15 Circuit and the key role it's playing and some of the history 16 that led up to that enactment and establishment; and 17 third, to the suggestion sometimes heard and heard today that 18 maybe there are too many patents being granted and sometimes, 19 somehow we should raise the bar on the number of patents. 20 The USPTO must be adequately financed in my view if 21 we're going to have effective intellectual property 22 protection in this country. Central to the effective and 23 appropriate patent protection technology is the PTO and the 24 quality and timeliness of the examinations of patent 2575 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025applications. 1 Quality depends upon the skill and dedication of the 2 approximately 3,000 patent examiners, properly trained, 3 supervised and mentored and with effective administrative and 4 technical support. For it to do its job properly the office 5 must have the latest in e-government support, but apparently 6 fiscal constraints will deprive the processing of the more 7 than 300,000 patent applications it will receive. 8 Timeliness depends on adequate resources, and this is 9 another area of great concern. For the past several years, 10 more than $850 million in user fees paid by patent applicants 11 to support the PTO have been diverted to other totally 12 unrelated government programs, and as could be guaranteed, 13 the Office is falling alarmingly behind in being able to cope 14 with its increasing workload. 15 My back-of-the-envelope calculations are that if the 16 current funding of the USPTO remains constant in real 17 dollars, increasing only by cost of living adjustments, in 18 five years it will take more than three years for an 19 applicant to receive a first action on application, and the 20 overall time of pendency would increase to an average of more 21 than four years, a result which I would submit is totally 22 unacceptable to U.S. inventors and U.S. industry. 23 There would be a total of 2 and one-half million 24 patent applications pending in the office, with each examiner 2576 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025having a docket of more than 750 applications as compared to 1 the 100 applications on a typical examiner's docket today. 2 In short, the Office would be swamped. 3 Undersecretary Rogan, for whom I have the highest 4 regard, can confirm whether these dire predictions are 5 accurate. I believe they are, and steps must be taken now to 6 ensure that they are not realized. 7 Secondly, I would submit that the Federal Circuit 8 Court of Appeals is an unqualified success. That was 9 established, as Judge Newman pointed out, in a bipartisan 10 effort to bring certainty and stability to U.S. patent law. 11 Based upon a key recommendation of President Carter's 12 domestic review on industrial innovation, a centralized 13 national court with exclusive appellate jurisdiction over 14 patent related cases was viewed in that review as \"a vehicle 15 for ensuring a more uniform interpretation of the patent 16 laws, and thus contributing meaningfully and positively to 17 predicting the strength of patents.\" 18 One of my highest priorities as a newly appointed 19 Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks in 1981 was to 20 recommend that the Reagan Administration support that 21 initiative of the Carter Administration. This was by no 22 means assured given the strong opposition of the American Bar 23 Association to the creation of such a \"specialized federal 24 court.\" 2577 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 At the time I was teaching patent law at American 1 University's Washington College of Law and was all too 2 familiar with the chaotic situation that business executives 3 faced in deciding how, or most significantly where, to 4 enforce their patents. A leader in the research-based 5 pharmaceutical industry summed up that industry's support for 6 the Federal Circuit quite succinctly, \"to eliminate geography 7 dependent patent opinions.\" 8 Prior to the creation of the Federal Circuit, an 9 analysis of most patent issues would depend on what federal 10 circuit would try the case or hear the case, and such an 11 assumption would often be more significant than the facts 12 themselves. 13 The Reagan Administration did strongly support the 14 creation of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, 15 based on, among other things, then Secretary of Commerce, the 16 late Malcolm Baldridge. Having served as a very successful 17 chief executive of Scovill Industries, Secretary Baldridge 18 often expressed in his efforts to establish the court, that 19 successful business executives are able or should be able to 20 manage around adversity. They cannot handle uncertainty. 21 And as the several federal circuits drifted father 22 and farther apart in their interpretations of key sections of 23 the patent code, the inevitable uncertainty called into 24 question in the Carter Domestic Policy Review the viability 2578 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025of an effective U.S. patent system for protecting new 1 technology. 2 The beneficial results of the creation of the Federal 3 Circuit were immediate and felt throughout America's high 4 technology industries. Forum shopping, or more accurately 5 circuit shopping, is a thing of the past. Although in no 6 field as dynamic as patent law can there be 100 7 percent assurance of the outcome of any case, business 8 executives and their counsel can now look to a coherent and 9 consistent body of case law to guide their fundamental 10 research and development decisions. 11 My next recommendation is, Don't change the non-obviousness 12 requirement of the patent code. An assertion is sometimes made that 13 there are too many patents being granted, or that patents are 14 overbroad. This leads to an idea, usually very vaguely defined, that 15 we should somehow change the non-obviousness standard to raise the bar. 16 That would be most unwise in my view. 17 Notwithstanding, non-obviousness is the most 18 important patentability requirement and perhaps the most 19 difficult to apply and probably why it applies. Maybe 80 20 percent of the patent cases finally reach court. The section 21 is familiar to everyone here: \"a patent may not be obtained though 22 the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set 23 forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between a 24 subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such 2579 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the 1 time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in 2 the art.\" 3 The enactment of Section 103 in 1952 was a reaction 4 to a line of Supreme Court cases in which U.S. patents are 5 with held to be invalid because they lacked \"invention.\" In 6 one celebrated case, Justice Douglas went so far as to state 7 that for a new device to be patentable, it \"must reveal the 8 flash of a creative genius.\" 9 The Supreme Court's anti-patent bias in the period 10 leading up to 1952 was so pronounced that Justice Robert 11 Jackson in a celebrated dissent complained \"that the only 12 patent that is valid is one which this Court has not been 13 able to get its hands on.\" 14 In his \"Commentary on the New Patent Act,\" Mr. P.J. 15 Federico, a senior official of the USPTO and one of the 16 principal authors of the 1952 Act, stated as follows: \"There 17 has been some discussion as to whether section 103 modifies 18 the so-called standard of invention....While it is not 19 believed that Congress intended any radical change in the 20 level of invention or patentable novelty, nevertheless, it is 21 believed that some modification was intended in the direction 22 of moderating the extreme degree of strictness exhibited by a 23 number of judicial opinions over the past dozen or more 24 years.\" 2580 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 The Supreme Court did not reach the issue of proper 1 interpretation of section 103 until 1966 when the Court 2 decided three patent cases often referred to as the Graham 3 trilogy. In Graham the Court pointedly confirmed that section 103 4 codified the judicially developed non-obviousness requirement. 5 Congress did focus inquiry on objective obviousness and, in effect, 6 directed abandonment of \"invention,\" courts have previously used 7 to encapsulate the obviousness standard. 8 In Graham, still the leading case studied in all the 9 patent academies and in every basic patent law book, still 10 the leading case, the Supreme Court directed the lower courts 11 and the Patent and Trademark to apply the following test: \"Under 12 section 103, the scope and content of the prior art are to be 13 determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue 14 are to be ascertained.\" Let me underscore claims. We're not talking 15 about disclosure. We're not talking about where there's a neat 16 invention or not a neat invention. It's the claims that come into 17 issue under the test. 18 \"Against this background the obviousness or non-obviousness 19 of the subject matter is determined. Such secondary considerations 20 as commercial success, long felt but unresolved needs, failure of 21 others, etc., might be utilized to shed light on the circumstances 22 surroundin g the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented. 23 An indicia of obviousness or non-obviousness, these inquiries may have 24 relevancy.\" 2581 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 Notwithstanding the guidance, the regional Circuit 1 Courts of Appeals were all over the lot in interpreting the 2 new section 1023. One of the issues of whether synergism in 3 some form or another was required to satisfy the 4 requirement. 5 As noted by one patent law scholar, prior to the 6 Federal Circuit analysis of the issue, confusion reigned 7 among lower federal courts as to the proper role of synergism 8 in evaluating non-obviousness. 9 One of the principal areas of concern that led to the 10 creation of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals was section 11 103 and the differences in its interpretation throughout the 12 regional circuits. Although there are clear differences 13 among the several judges serving on the Court of Appeals for 14 the Federal Circuit at the present time, and we could name 15 names and we could name issues if we had to, there are no 16 major differences in the interpretation of section 103. 17 In one celebrated case, the Federal Circuit relied 18 upon section 103 when it vacated the Seattle district court's 19 preliminary injunction against Barnes & Noble in the famous 20 Amazon.com case. 21 Thus, with respect to section 103 regarding non-obviousness, 22 three factors have resulted in a workable 23 standard of the patentability, both in the Patent and 24 Trademarks Office by the 3,000 examiners and by the district 2582 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025court and the court of appeals. 1 First is the enactment of the section in 1952. 2 Second is the authoritative interpretation of the section in 3 the Graham trilogy of cases, and finally the creation of the 4 Federal Circuit, which in my view is doing an excellent job 5 of interpreting section 103 on a case-by-case basis. 6 There are now more than 700 Federal Circuit cases 7 interpreting section 103 in dozens of technical contexts. If 8 patent claims are said to be overbroad, I assume that means 9 that they would not be valid under section 103 of the patent 10 code or perhaps section 112 of the patent code, as those 11 sections are now written. Otherwise, I would have no idea 12 what overbroad means. 13 To attempt now to amend section 103 somehow to raise 14 the bar, whatever that means in any given case, would at the 15 very least result in a generation or two of uncertainty and 16 confusion. Such an attempt would in my view be met with 17 appropriate, vigorous and successful opposition by high 18 technology industry, inventors' groups and the organized 19 patent bar. 20 The number of patents being granted by the U.S. 21 Patent and Trademark office, a has been pointed out, have 22 increased significantly but I seriously doubt whether the 23 increase has kept pace in research and development. 24 In the research-based pharmaceutical industry, for 2583 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025example, R&D expenditures have increased more than ten-fold 1 in the past 20 years, from 2.3 billion in 1981 to more than 2 30 billion in the year 2001, and patents granted in the 3 pharmaceutical field, although substantially increased, have 4 not at all kept pace. 5 In 1981, we had 2017 such patents granted as compared 6 with 6,751 patents in the year 2000. So a ten-fold -- more 7 than a ten-fold increase in R&D was met with a three- or four-fold 8 increase in the number of patents in the pharmaceutical world. 9 Of course many of these patents covered new 10 lifesaving and life-enhancing medications that simply would 11 not have been invented except for the incentives provided by 12 the U.S. patent system. 13 I am certain that the pattern of the research-based 14 pharmaceutical industry is repeated in many other important 15 fields of technology. 16 Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. 17 Mr. James J. Kulbalski, a partner at Oblon Spivak, is 18 is submitting a statement in connection with these hearings 19 on patent pooling and technical standards, perhaps a little 20 more directly related to the subject matter. 21 I hope that his statement and these comments have 22 been helpful to you. Thank you very much. 23 CHAIRMAN JAMES: Rich Gilbert is the father of the 24 intellectual property guidelines, which he helped shape, when he 2584 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025was Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Economics in the 1 Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice. 2 His interest in developing those guidelines is hardly 3 surprising given that he is the author of a wide body of 4 scholarship on economics, intellectual property and 5 antitrust. He's now professor of economics at University of 6 California, Berkeley, where he continues to be at the 7 forefront of these and other issues. 8 And he certainly is someone that I've learned from 9 over the years. Please welcome Rich Gilbert. 10 MR. GILBERT: Thank you. 11 Well, I will briefly discuss the recent history of 12 thought about the appropriate role of antitrust policy for 13 intellectual property, and then I will also work through a 14 particular example and propose a Rule of Reason approach to a 15 particular issue in IP licensing. 16 But before I start, I want to comment on an issue of 17 prior art and the problem of accumulating a database on 18 invention position, and to do that I want to draw on one of 19 my favorite scholars of innovation, and that's Gary Larson. 20 (Shows slide.) There's a very large beast upside 21 down with a very, very small arrow in its belly up here and 22 these two cavemen saying, Well, maybe we should write that 23 spot down. 24 So I want to suggest this to you, to our friends at 2585 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the Patent and Trademark Office to keep this in mind. If you 1 get a patent for a process to bring down mastodons, it might 2 actually be written down there in the prior art. 3 Okay. Let's go on and talk about the development of 4 key principles and how they have evolved between the 1988 and 5 the 1995 Intellectual Property Guidelines. The 1988 6 Guidelines were really a watershed event. There was the 7 International Guidelines with a section of intellectual 8 property licensing. They introduced important concepts that 9 really defined and redefined the way that antitrust scholars 10 think about intellectual property. 11 We heard about the famous Nine No-Nos, and they were 12 quite a revolution in thought. The key principles in these 13 guidelines were three. First for the purpose 14 of antitrust analysis, the agencies regard intellectual 15 property as being essentially comparable to any other form of 16 property. 17 Now, what this meant was not that intellectual 18 property is the same as other forms of property. It clearly 19 is not the same. It differs in very important and material 20 respects, as has been identified earlier by Bob Pitofsky, and 21 of course there's statutory limits and statutory prerogatives 22 on the use of intellectual property, but in terms of how to 23 analyze intellectual property issues, the same principles 24 apply. 2586 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 Secondly, the agencies do not presume that 1 intellectual property creates market power in the antitrust 2 context. I don't think this is a very controversial point, 3 notwithstan ding Jefferson Parish v. Hyde, but at the time, in 1988 this 4 was somewhat controversial. 5 And the third point that the agencies recognize is 6 that intellectual property licensing allows firms to combine 7 complementary factors of production and is generally 8 pro-competitive. That is, licensing is a good thing. We 9 would like to have more of it, not less of it. 10 Now, in 1995 the overlap between these principles and 11 virtually the identical principles that existed in the '88 12 Guidelines were a source of some consternation to me, 13 although I find some comfort in the fact that they are so 14 close, and I think our thinking has helped up in a durable 15 and nonpartisan way over these years on these basic 16 principles. 17 Now, the '88 Guidelines also said or advanced a 18 particular way of thinking about intellectual property, by 19 advancing the principle that the owner of intellectual 20 property is entitled to enjoy whatever market power the 21 property itself may confer and also saying the Department 22 will not require the owner of technology to create 23 competition in its own technology. 24 In effect, this principle was that if there's a 2587 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025demand curve, think of a demand curve, for the products or 1 processes that used the license to intellectual property that 2 the IP owner is entitled to appropriate the area underneath 3 this demand curve. 4 This actually was a departure from recent thinking about cases 5 such as the shrimp peelers cases which challenged the ability to issue 6 royalties of discriminatory rates to reflect competition against 7 different types of technologies, so this was quite an advance in 8 itself, but there's a difficultly with this approach, and the 9 difficultly is market power depends on conduct, which of course may be 10 anti-competitive. 11 So there can be anti-competitive conduct such as 12 exclusive dealing arrangements on the use of competing 13 technologies which shift the demand curve out, and yet this 14 principle you're entitled to the area under the demand curve, 15 that is to the market power that the IP itself confers then 16 becomes circular and somewhat ambiguous so in the '95 17 Guidelines this principle was changed. 18 The part about the IP owner not being required to 19 create competition in its own technology was retained on the 20 whole, but then we substituted a different concept which was 21 that antitrust concerns may arise when a licensing 22 arrangement harms competition among entities that would have 23 been actual or likely potential competitors in a relevant 24 market in the absence of the license. 2588 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 I just like to use a shorthand competition in the 1 absence of the license, has that been effective, so if we go 2 back to this area underneath the demand curve, if we have the 3 licensing market on the left, and you think of there being 4 some different market. Now, if there are practices and those 5 practices effect say competitive conditions in that other 6 market, suppose it shifts the supply curve to the left and 7 leads to a higher price, that might shift the demand for the 8 licensed product out because the higher price increases the 9 demand for the licensed product, and now you have to weigh 10 those competitive effects in that market against whatever has 11 happened in the licensing market to see if on balance that is 12 an issue that the antitrust agencies should be concerned 13 about. 14 So now there are a number of different issues on an 15 antitrust intellectual property agenda. There's been a great 16 deal of learning at the agencies on intellectual property 17 issues. A lot of very fine minds have been devoted to these 18 issues, and we've had experience with a number of antitrust 19 cases and merger cases, and yet there's still a number of 20 areas where some more thinking is necessary and where some 21 definition of past thinking would be appropriate. 22 For example, should antitrust policy differ for 23 intellectual property? Again Professor Pitofsky talked about 24 this, the arguments for and against, how to deal with 2589 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025combinations of allegedly blocking patents, patent 1 settlements, cross-licensing and unilateral refusals to deal, 2 standard setting and competition in winner-take-all markets, 3 network effects, and I would also add to this list the 4 general issue of whether market power is good for innovation 5 and whether that justifies certain transactions that 6 otherwise would raise concerns. 7 Now, it's a tall order to deal with these things, and 8 I would like just as an example more to serve as a target for 9 criticism than anything else to propose a rule of reason 10 analysis to you for one of these issues, and that's how 11 to deal with combinations of allegedly blocking patents. 12 There's been a noisy message from the agencies on 13 this issue. We've heard about the MPEG, digital vertical 14 disk, the Motion Picture Entertainment Group, these were 15 standards that were formed by an association of parties who 16 cross-licensed their patents to enable these technologies. 17 And the message from the Department of Justice in the 18 form of business review letters was that it was alright to 19 aggregate these essential, that is, blocking, technologies, but 20 then we also have some other cases at the FTC. There was the 21 VISX case where the pool was dissolved, and it involved some 22 alleged blocking patents, others alleged to be substitutes. 23 The same with Ciba-Geigy-Sandoz, and this merger 24 having to do with gene therapy technologies. There were 2590 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025concerns raised about aggregation of patents, which again 1 were to some extent substitutes and also to some extent 2 blocking as well. 3 How can we think about these? I propose the 4 following elements for an approach, and I should add my 5 thinking here is informed by many conversations I've had with 6 my colleagues at Berkeley, including some colleagues who are 7 either recently or currently in active duty in the government 8 and also past conversations at DOJ with colleagues like Greg 9 Werden and others, and so -- but again this is all my 10 thinking. 11 I don't blame anybody else, and you'll probably want 12 to insulate yourself from anything I would say anyway, but if 13 you think of the key elements of the approach, first what is 14 the probability that blocking patents would be found invalid 15 or not infringed? 16 I'm going under the premise that however we feel 17 about the desirability of patent rights, I'm going under 18 a premise that if patents are, in fact, invalid or not 19 infringed, then they should not limit competition that would 20 otherwise occur. They should be in fact challenged. 21 The second point is benefits from competition if 22 patents are held to be invalid or not infringed, so if it is 23 the case that they truly should not be patent-right protected 24 in these areas, one of the benefits that would occur in its 2591 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025absence, and third, are the benefits from combining the 1 patents in the pool itself? 2 And if do I this correctly, it is an application of 3 the analytical principles of competition in the absence of 4 the arrangement which is in the IP guidelines, so I want to 5 introduce a little concept. One times two, that is the 6 probability that the patents will be held invalid times the 7 competitive effect which is the expected competition that 8 would have occurred in the absence of the licensing 9 arrangement. 10 And the third is the benefits of the licensing 11 arrangement, and these are the two sides of the rule of 12 reason balancing that I think is accepted practice in 13 antitrust these days. 14 Just to do a little bit of mathematics, and I'll go 15 through this very quickly, just define N as the number of 16 independent blocking patents. P is the probability that a 17 single patent would be held invalid or not infringed, and I 18 want to make the important assumption that this is the same 19 for all patents, and that it's independent, so showing one to 20 be invalid doesn't necessarily say anything about any other 21 patents. 22 C is the reduction in prices from competition which I 23 can measure as a percent of revenues on an annualized basis, 24 and E is the efficiency from combining the patents as a 2592 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025percent of revenues. And it leads to a simple formula, which 1 is that aggregation passes a rule of reason test. If E over 2 C is greater than P to the N, and E over C and what I'm 3 calling the efficiency ratio, it's a ratio of efficiency to 4 competitive effects, and P to the N is just the aggregate 5 probability that there would be competition in the absence of 6 the pool. 7 Now, it's something that's fairly obvious. P to the N, for 8 a reasons N goes down very quickly, so I have here three graphs 9 corresponding to different probabilities of any one patent being 10 held invalid, and I will note a recent study by Allison and Linley 11 showed that in a sample of 300 tested patents, half of them were 12 shown to be invalid, in litigation. 13 So of patents that were litigated in this period, I 14 think which was '86 to '89, half of the patents were shown to 15 be invalid, so a number of P around a half is one plausible 16 starting point, but you can take a smaller number or a higher 17 number. 18 If the number is smaller it goes down much quicker. 19 If the number is higher, it goes down slower but my main 20 conclusion is very simple, for any reasonable P once you get 21 beyond a large number of patents, the probability of 22 competition in the absence of the pool gets very low. 23 So what are some conclusions? Another way of saying 24 this if I can go back here is that the required efficiency 2593 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025ratio. Let's take the example, the MPEG pool contained 27 1 patents that were claimed to be essential to practice the 2 technology. That is 27 blocking patents. 3 Now, if you go out here to 27, it really didn't 4 matter what the probability is of the success of an 5 individual patent. It's pretty close to zero, that there 6 would be competition in the absence as long as these 7 patents -- as long as their validity is independent of each 8 other. That is they're not highly correlated. 9 So the conclusion here, well, first I would say is 10 that assertion of patents, an assertion that patents are 11 blocking is not in my view sufficient to indemnify a 12 combination from antitrust scrutiny because there is a high 13 probability that litigated patents are found invalid or not 14 infringed. 15 So merely saying I have a blocking patent is not 16 enough if we believe that the truth is in the ultimate test 17 of litigation over validity. Chances are that's an invalid 18 patent. It's just as high as the chances are that it's a 19 valid patent. 20 Secondly, it's not necessary in my view for the 21 agencies to conduct a full scale review of patent scope and 22 validity to assess the antitrust risk from combining patents. 23 Because a probablistic approach, which is what I've just 24 described, should be sufficient to estimate competition in 2594 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the absence of the combination, and there are some 1 combinations where I would argue that the likelihood of 2 competition is so low that it becomes in my view a fairly 3 easy antitrust analysis. 4 Second, I would also point out another fact here, 5 which I believe is at least the makings of a recommendation I 6 have to the agencies, and that's the private incentive to 7 challenge patents is less than the expected social return. 8 The users of patented technologies, if they choose to contest 9 the validity of a patent, they're going to appropriate only 10 some of the benefits of the a successful challenge, 11 but they pay the full cost, so there's a large spill-over 12 cost. 13 The benefits, first of all, are shared with other 14 licensees. Secondly, consumers benefit from the competition 15 that's created if the patent is shown to be invalid, and 16 again I'm going under the premise that an invalid patent is 17 one that none of us would like to enforce. 18 And then I could add to this also there 19 are dangers that the parties who might be affected by a 20 patent validity directly might have incentives that would be 21 settled, and there's a coordination problem that adds to that 22 which is each user wants someone else to challenge the 23 patents. No one wants to pay the cost. 24 It's much better to have a patent proved invalid and 2595 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025not pay for the cost of proving, and the cost as we know is 1 not at all trivial. There's a coordination problem, and it's 2 particularly severe when there are many patents and many 3 patentees, so I have a not-so-modest proposal here, which is 4 the antitrust agencies at least consider expending some of 5 their scarce resources to challenge suspect patents when those 6 spill over benefits and coordination problems are 7 particularly large and also settlement specific efficiencies 8 are small, that is when you think that this rule of reason 9 test is likely to be -- to call for enforcement, or when we 10 think that there are particular coordination problems that 11 would lead to findings of validities, of invalidity or not 12 infringement and the parties do not have an incentive to 13 establish that fact or parties external to the arrangement 14 also do not have an incentive to establish that fact. 15 That's my proposal. Thank you very much. I'm very 16 happy to be here and address you. 17 (Applause.) 18 CHAIRMAN MURIS: Thank you, Rich. We come to our 19 final speaker. Richard Levin has accomplishments far too 20 numerous to list. He's the president of Yale University. 21 He's the president not embroiled in major controversy at the 22 moment, at least not that I've read in the Washington Post. He's 23 also professor of economics, specializing in the economics of 24 technological change. Of great relevance to us today he's the 2596 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025coauthor of a well-known and crucial 1987 study entitled \"Appropriating 1 the Returns from Industrial R&D.\" 2 Also at the moment he's co-chairing a very important 3 study, as I mentioned earlier, at the National Academy of 4 Sciences, examining the operation of the patent system and 5 its effect on new technologies or newly patented technology. 6 Please welcome President Levin. 7 (Applause.) 8 PRESIDENT LEVIN: I'm very pleased to participate in 9 this opening session of these important hearings, and I'm 10 especially honored to share the platform with the 11 distinguished public servants who have shaped and who now are 12 shaping the interpretation and enforcement of the nation's 13 antitrust and intellectual property laws. 14 As the Chairman indicated, my involvement today 15 derives from two personal experiences. In the 1980s, with 16 the support of the National Science Foundation, the plug for 17 the importance of funding scientific research, I directed a 18 substantial research program at Yale on the economic impact 19 of intellectual property, and currently I co-chair a 20 committee on intellectual property rights in a knowledge-based economy, 21 as you said, under the auspices of the 22 National Academy's Board on Science, Technology and 23 Economic Policy. Both these experiences I believe provide 24 insights that are relevant to the subject of these joint FTC/DOJ 2597 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025hearings. 1 The centerpiece of our research in the 1980s was a 2 survey of 650 executives responsible for research and 3 development in 130 different industries. This survey, which I 4 developed in collaboration with my Yale colleagues, Alvin 5 Klevorick, Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter, sought to 6 characterize both the opportunities for technological advance 7 and the capacity for firms to appropriate the returns from 8 their investments in research and development. 9 The most striking and perhaps the most influential 10 finding from the data that we collected in the mid-1980s was 11 that the role of patents differed significantly across 12 industries and technologies. 13 In most industries, firms reported that being first to 14 market with a new or improved product and supporting their 15 head start with superior marketing and customer service most 16 effectively protected the competitive advantages of their 17 R&D. In these industries, patents were not regarded as 18 highly effective in protecting a firm's competitive 19 advantage. 20 By contrast, the pharmaceutical and certain other 21 chemical industries were striking exceptions. In these 22 industries, patent protection was deemed to be far and away 23 the most effective means of appropriating the returns from 24 research and development. 2598 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 Despite significant changes in patent law during the 1 ensuing years, a follow-up survey conducted in the late 1990s 2 by Wesley Cohen, Richard Nelson and John Walsh essentially 3 replicated our findings. 4 Now, the perceived value of pharmaceutical and 5 chemical patents derived in part from the nature of the 6 technology. In the 1980s, the valuable and effective patents 7 in these industries gave exclusive rights to a particular 8 chemical compound, a specific molecule typically. In such 9 cases, patent rights were relatively easily enforced, and the 10 rights to one patented molecule were rarely required to 11 obtain or practice a patent on another molecule. 12 Now, in contrast to this discrete nature of chemical 13 and pharmaceutical products, in other key technologies, such 14 as microelectronics, telecommunications and computers, it was 15 cumulative. Virtually any advance, even then and even more 16 so today, required access to a bundle of prior patents. 17 The circumstance had its roots as early as the very 18 beginning of the microelectronic era, when access to the Bell 19 Labs' transistor patent was required to develop virtually any 20 new product. It continued through the early years of the 21 integrated circuit era when industry participation typically 22 needed to license the fundamental product patent from Texas 23 Instrument and the fundamental process patent from 24 Fairchild. 2599 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025 By the early 1980s the semiconductor firms already 1 had well-developed practices of cross-licensing their entire 2 patent portfolios and determining the net flow of royalties 3 by scoring the most important patents in each portfolio. 4 Today with the widespread use of patented research 5 rules and the attendant need for cross licensing, the 6 pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are moving closer 7 and closer to this cumulative technology paradigm. 8 The difference between discrete and cumulative 9 technologies is not acknowledged in the grantuing of patents 10 or in the resolution of patent litigation, and I'm not saying 11 that it should be, but it is a distinction of some value in 12 antitrust analysis. Put simply, in cumulative technologies, 13 cross-license arrangements are a necessary condition of 14 technical progress, a necessary condition of progress. 15 They should not ordinarily be regarded as 16 anti-competitive unless they are used in a concerted way 17 without sufficient justification on grounds of efficiency to 18 block entry into a relevant product or innovation market. 19 Now, one more observation about our earlier 20 work that is not in my prepared remarks, but inspired by the 21 observations of Commissioner Rogan and Judge Newman about the 22 importance of the other side of the patent bargain. 23 The patent bargain is, we grant you this exclusive right 24 in return for disclosure, and one of the things we found when 25100 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025looking at the technical opportunity side in our data 1 collection effort, what indeed confirms the importance of 2 this other side of the bargain, that is antitrust analysis is 3 typically looking only at the grant of exclusivity and what 4 potential anti-competitive effects it might have in relevant 5 product or innovation markets. 6 But in fact we shouldn't ignore the importance of the 7 disclosure element, which our findings, our research found to 8 be quite pro-competitive, that is to say specifically, that 9 those industries that regarded the information contained in 10 patent disclosures as well as the public literature as 11 valuable and informative were the industries with the highest 12 rates of technological progress. Interesting finding. 13 Let me now turn to the work of our ongoing National 14 Academy's committee, which is investigating the broad 15 economic impact of changes in patent law and administration 16 over the past quarter century, and others have highlighted 17 many changes in both the statutes and court administrative 18 process and structure over those years. 19 Over the past two years our committees held three 20 conferences and six meetings involving extensive public 21 participation. We've heard from virtually every interested 22 segment of our society with a stake in the effectiveness of 23 the patent system, including most of the speakers on today's 24 program. We've heard from independent inventors, from open 25101 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025source software developers, from large companies, from 1 lawyers, judges, patent office officials in the United States 2 and Europe, representatives of international organizations, 3 academic economists and academic lawyers and antitrust 4 enforcement agencies. 5 Now, our committee expects to present its findings 6 and recommendations in September 2002, well after the 7 conclusion of these hearings, so I want to make 8 the point that I very clearly do not speak for the committee 9 which has not yet voted on its consensus recommendations and 10 has not -- and certainly haven't been going through the 11 formal review process at the academy, so I'm speaking 12 directly for myself about some observations of two particular areas of 13 concern that I've learned about through this process. 14 First, Commissioner Dickinson's comments 15 notwithstanding, there is widespread concern about the 16 quality of patents issued in some newly emerging areas of 17 technology. Now, I will concede that in some respects this 18 concern is inevitable. Almost by definition new areas of 19 technology lack well-developed bodies of prior art in earlier 20 patents and in the published literature. 21 This makes it difficult for patent examiners to 22 determine whether a claim meets the required test of novelty 23 and obviousness. Still, even an observer as sympathetic as I am 24 to the difficulties faced by patent examiners would find 25102 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025reasonable basis for concluding that many software patents, 1 including many of those describing computer-enabled business 2 methods, do not meet a common sense standard for innovation. 3 Now, there are potentially serious consequences from 4 a low threshold for patenting in emerging technology areas. 5 A patent after all does grant an exclusive right and in some 6 cases, not all, but in some cases it can confer power in 7 product in innovation markets. 8 We should be wary of creating unwarranted market 9 power by granting unwarranted patents, but I would argue the 10 remedy does not lie in placing more rigorous antitrust 11 constraints on the behavior of holders of low quality 12 patents. The remedy is to improve the quality -- is to 13 improve the process of granting and reviewing patents to 14 ensure that monopoly rights aren't conferred on rent seekers 15 who have not truly achieved progress in the useful arts. 16 Now the Patent and Trademark Office has already begun to 17 take steps, as Todd Dickinson mentioned, to improve the 18 quality of its review in emerging technology areas, improve 19 the quality of its databases, and indeed I would add it has 20 taken steps to improve the qualifications of newly hired 21 examiners in emerging technology areas, but still more 22 resources may be needed to ensure timely and effective review 23 of patent applications. 24 The courts might also consider to returning to a more 25103 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025rigorous application of the standard for non-obviousness 1 articulated in the last major Supreme Court decision on the 2 subject, the Graham case. I agree with Commissioner 3 Mossinghoff that changing the statute is not the solution, 4 but a recent study by Lunney in the Michigan Telecommunications 5 and Technology Law Review I think is quite persuasive in documenting -- 6 with all due respect to my devoted alumni, Judge Newman -- recent 7 decisions by the Court of appeals of the Federal Circuit that have 8 tended to substitute the secondary Graham factors for the primary tests 9 of obviousness. 10 And there are some good examples in that article that 11 show that the standard comes perilously close to saying 12 this: If someone invested money in developing this 13 invention, it must not be obvious. It's the commercial 14 success test. 15 A standard that diluted runs the risk of rewarding 16 pure rent seeking with rights that should be reserved for 17 socially beneficial innovation. 18 Another idea worthy of consideration would be to 19 institute a stronger system of post-grant review, and that 20 was mentioned earlier too, under which third parties can 21 challenge the validity of patents, and I would say on grounds 22 other than the narrow ones now permitted under the current 23 reexamination procedures. 24 A low-cost administrative review procedure might 25104 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025reduce the need for subsequent costly litigation, and it 1 might also reduce the need for what might turn out to be 2 wasteful investments by those who are later judged to have 3 infringed a valid patent. 4 A speedy procedure would also have another social 5 benefits, as Rich Gilbert talked about the externalities 6 involved here, that if early review of validity in new 7 technology areas could clarify at an early stage of those 8 technology the appropriate standard of non-obviousness and 9 the scope of permissible claims, this would have signaling 10 benefits to subsequent inventors and to the Patent Office 11 examiners early in the process instead of waiting for a major 12 court decision to come down years late. 13 The second area of concern that has come to our 14 committee's attention as opposed to this issue about patent 15 quality, the second area is one that more properly needs review I think 16 by the antitrust enforcement agencies. 17 We heard that increasingly in computer networking, 18 telecommunications and related technologies, we've come to 19 rely on the work of private, not public, but private standard- 20 setting consortia. The work of these bodies is often 21 indispensable for facilitating progress in cumulative 22 technologies. Yet the potential for anti-competitive and 23 exclusionary practices warrant scrutiny. 24 The antitrust guidelines that Rich Gilbert was part 25105 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025of developing and took the lead in developing for the 1 licensing of intellectual property I believe offer very 2 intelligent and sensible general guidelines in these areas 3 based on what they say about cross licensing and patent 4 pooling. They're a relevant model for policy in this area. 5 I would say though that to permit the efficiency 6 enhancing collaborations to move forward and to protect 7 consumers from anti-competitive practices, standard-setting 8 bodies should be subject to appropriately clear, specific and 9 well-crafted antitrust guidelines. 10 These are just two areas of concern that have come to 11 the attention of our committee. Among others, let me mention 12 the high cost of patent litigation, partly induced by an 13 inefficient reliance upon a number of subjective 14 determinations of intent in this kind of litigation. 15 A second concern drifts in some areas toward granting 16 patents for discovering facts of nature rather than truly 17 requiring human invention; and a third; wasteful duplication 18 of public resources caused by the failure to achieve 19 full international harmonization of patent law and full 20 reciprocity for searches and even examinations. 21 These concerns, like those involved in the standards 22 of patentability, I believe are more directly addressed 23 through statutory, judicial or straight competitive changes 24 in the patent system rather than in changes in antitrust law or 25106 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025enforcement. 1 Despite all of these concerns that have been raised 2 in the course of our committee's work and then undoubtedly 3 will be raised in the course of these hearings, we must not 4 lose perspective. Innovation is alive and well in the 5 American economy. For more than a half century our nation 6 has led the world in the development of new technologies and 7 the creation of new products. 8 Our international competitive advantage rests on the 9 unique encouragement that we give to scientific progress 10 through the peer-reviewed, public funding of projects that 11 are located in institutions that combine frontier research 12 with advanced scientific and technological education. 13 Open entrepreneurial economy, fueled by a vigorous 14 and effective capital market, translates the results of 15 scientific advancement into industrial innovation better than 16 is done anywhere. 17 Intellectual property rights play a significant role 18 in this progress by protecting the returns to innovation just 19 as antitrust enforcement preserves competition and protects 20 consumers from the abuses of market power. There's always 21 room for improvement. 22 I trust these hearings will identify some such 23 opportunities, but we should remember that intellectual 24 property and antitrust are only small pieces of the larger 25107 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025system that by any historical and international comparative 1 standard functions very well indeed. 2 Thank you. 3 (Applause.) 4 CHAIRMAN MURIS: I think we're finished for the day. 5 I want to give another round of applause to our speakers, and 6 to thank everyone for their participation and for your 7 patience. 8 Thank you. 9 (Time noted: 4:47 p.m.) 10 - - - - - 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25108 For The Record, Inc.
