History, functions, organization of the central personnel division. 1. History of the central personnel division. a. The 1975 legislative assembly passed a Central Personnel System Act, codified as North Dakota\u00b7 Century Code chapter 25 2. 54-44.3. The Act created the central personnel division as well as the state personnel board. The division was to establish and maintain classification and compensation plans as well as establish general policies and rules, which were to be binding on the affected agencies, relating to a unified system of personnel administration for the employees in the classified service of the state. b. From its beginning in 1975, the central personnel division developed general personnel policies in response to: the requirements for a unified system of personnel administration, requests from the state personnel board, requests from agencies or other officials in the executive branch, changed requirements in state or federal laws, and various decisions of the courts. These policies were discussed at meetings of the state personnel board ~ If a particular policy was approved by the board, the division would then act to include it within the North Dakota personnel policies manual. Policies approved and adopted in this way were then distributed to all state agencies . c. The policies included in the North Dakota personnel policies manual were to be followed by all agencies with classified employees. More specifically, merit system agencies were to strictly follow the policies, but nonmerit system agencies were advised that the policies formed a 11base11 for the development of the agencies own policies and procedures. d. In July of 1981 then Governor Allen Olson issued executive order number 1981-10. That executive order portrayed the North Dakota personnel policies manual as providing the assurance that classified employees would be treated fairly and uniformly if the policies were followed . The executive order identified the state personnel board as the agency which would hold public meetings to receive comments and approve revisions to the policies . Governor Olson also ordered that agencies headed by a gubernatorial appointee adhere to and follow the policies, including the statewide appeal mechanism. e. However, by late 1986 that manner of personnel policy tmplementation and its 11legality11 and effect on various agencies had been challenged before the North Dakota supreme court. By 1990 in order for the division to carry out its statutory purpose of establishing a unified system of personnel administration for the classified service of the state, it was apparent that certain policies had to be adopted as rules in accordance with North Dakota Century Code section 28-32-02. Functions of establishes, the central personnel division. The division maintains, and revises, classification and 26 compensation plans. It assigns position classifications and pay grades, hears various appeals according to rules of and as directed by the board, establishes and maintains required records for all employees in the classified service of the state. It assists appointing authorities and agencies with selection procedures, grievance procedures, and training programs. It ensures salaries are paid consistent with the state's classification system, compensation plan, and salary administration policy, and consults with state agencies regarding salary administration. The division provides services to the merit system agencies regarding recruitment and referral, and it provides information and technical advice to all state agencies and institutions, as appropriate, concerning equal employment opportunity and affirmative action. The division also serves as secretariat to the state personnel board. 3. Organization of the central personnel division. a. The central personnel division is a division of the office of management and budget. The division is separate from the state personnel board, although the division and board work closely together. The division adopts its own rules and the board reviews them. The board may disapprove a rule or policy adopted by the division. b. The central personnel division has a director and a staff. The director is appointed by the director of the office of management and budget from among persons certified by the state personnel board. The director may hold no other public office or employment. The director may be removed for cause, and may appeal removal to the state personnel board for a hearing. The director is responsible for the performance of the division as it exercises its duties and functions. The director is assisted by a staff of professional, administrative, and clerical employees. The staff are assigned to one of the following areas: administration, classification and compensation, merit system operations, employee relations and equal employment opportunity, and training and development. History: Effective March 1, 1991. NDCC functions subject to chapter 28-32. The portions of the central personnel division's organization and functions that are subject to North Dakota Century Code chapter 28-32 are those that involve its authority to adopt policies and rules relating to a unified system of personnel administration which impose requirements on other agencies. The central personnel division has the authority to adopt policies, rules, and procedures in three areas: 27 1. Subsection 1 of North Dakota Century Code section 54-44.3-12 provides the authority to establish general policies, rules, and regulations which are binding on the agencies affected once they are approved by the state personnel board. The rules referred to in this regard must include rules on establishing and maintaining the classification and compensation plans. 2. Subsection 7 of North Dakota Century Code section 54-44.3-12 provides the authority to develop procedures that must be followed by all state agencies and institutions regarding salary administration for all employees in the classified service. 3. North Dakota Century Code section 54-42-03 provides the authority for the North Dakota merit system council, of which the division is a part, to adopt general policies, rules, and regulations which are binding on the agencies affected. Those agencies are commonly known as the merit system agencies. The rules referred to in this regard cover many aspects of personnel administration for those grant-aided agencies which receive federal funds. History: Effective March 1, the public may use to obtain information. The public may obtain information, furnish information, or make requests to the central personnel division concerning any of its functions or rules by writing to: Central Personnel Division Capitol Building 14th Floor 600 East Boulevard Avenue Bismarck, North Dakota 58505-0120 Telephone inquires may be made by calling 701-224-3290 between 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Section CHAPTER 27-02-13 INCREMENTAL BOND PROCEDURES 27-02-13-01 Incremental Bond Procedures 27-02-13-01. Incremental bond procedures. 1. A project will be subject to the provisions of North Dakota Century Code section 52-04-06.1 if the bureau determines that: a. The total of the contracts awarded on the project are at least twenty-five million dollars excluding contracts awarded solely for design and engineering; b. More than one-half of the work will be completed within seven years of the date work begins; c. The total number of individuals performing services in employment on the project total two hundred fifty or more in the aggregate; and d. The estimated total benefits attributable to services performed on the project will exceed the estimated contributions to be paid for services performed on the project. The total amount of benefits will be estimated assuming that half of the workers will receive benefits equal to the maximum 79 weekly benefit amount times the average duration of benefits paid to all claimants during the most recently completed calendar year. The estimate of contributions to be paid will be made by multiplying the average tax rate for the most recently completed calendar year times the estimated amount of taxable wages to be reported by employers on the project. The estimated taxable wages must be determined by multiplying the number of workers projected to be employed on the project times the maximum taxable wage base in effect for the current year. 2. Determinations, with respect to whether a project is subject to the provisions of North Dakota Century Code section 52-04-06.1, must be made in the same manner as provided for in North Dakota Century Code section 52-04-17. 3. The owner of any projects determined to be subject to the provisions of North Dakota Century Code section 52-04-06.1 must notify the bureau in writing within thirty days of the award of any contract to any employing unit for work on the project. Any contractor for such project who, in turn, subcontracts to another must also notify the bureau in writing of such contract award within thirty days of the issuance of the contract. 4. Each employing unit having employees working on any project subject to the provisions of North Dakota Century Code section 52-04-06.1 shall maintain separate records for all employment on such project showing the individuals' names, social security numbers, and wages paid. Such employers must be required to report such employment and wages separate from other employment subject to the North Dakota Unemployment Compensation Law under a separate reporting account established for the project. 5. Each report must also indicate which workers were North Dakota residents at the time of their hire and the date of their hire. Job service North Dakota will notify the employer in writing which workers identified as North Dakota residents do not meet the two thousand dollars earnings test provided for in subsection 4. The employer will then have thirty days to submit proof of North Dakota residence for the workers so identified. Proof of residence must include copies of state income tax returns, drivers' licenses, vehicle registrations, or other public documents and records showing a North Dakota residence and dated more than one year prior to the date of hire. Failure by the employer to identify workers as North Dakota residents or furnishing acceptable proof of residence within the time specified will result in loss of refund credit for wages paid to the workers in question. 6. Refunds of bond payments with regard to subsection 4 of North Dakota Century Code section 52-04-06.1 may be made by the 80 bureau only after the employing unit has submitted a written r~quest for such refund. Such request must show for each worker claimed to be a North Dakota resident at the time of their hire, the worker's name, social security number, and total wages paid for work on the project. The request must also show the total wages paid for all work on the project, the percent of the total wages paid to North Dakota residents, the total amount of the employer's bond payments, and the amount of the refund requested. Applications for refund must be made within ninety days after completion of the employer's portion of the work on the contract or the refund will not be allowed. 7. If an employer's request for refund is reduced or denied, the employer must be notified promptly in writing of such determination. Such determination will become final unless, within fifteen days from the date of mailing to the employer's last known address, the employer files a request for redetermination. Proceedings on such request must be in the same manner as requests for redeterminations on rates of contributions as provided for in chapter 27-02-10 and North Dakota Century Code section 52-04-10. History: Effective January 1, 1991. General NDCC 52-04-06.1 OF EMPLOYMENT 27-02-14-01 Employment Defined 27-02-14-01. Employment defined. 1. Subdivision a of subsection 17 of North Dakota Century Code section 52-01-01 contains three separate and independent tests for determining if the service is employment. 2. Paragraph 1 of subdivision a of subsection 17 of North Dakota Century Code section 52-01-01 relates to the test for determining whether the service of an officer of a corporation is employment with respect to service performed for the corporation. Paragraph 2 of subdivision a of subsection 17 of North Dakota Century Code section 52-01-01 relates to the test for determining whether an individual's service is employment with regard to the test provided for in subdivision e of subsection 17 of North Dakota Century Code section 52-01-01. Paragraph 3 of subdivision a of subsection 17 of North Dakota Century Code section 52-01-01 relates to the test for 81 determining if an individual1s service in certain occupational groups is employment if such service is not employment under the test. If an individual1s service is employment under any one of these tests, it is to be considered employment for purposes of this section. 3. If the service is employment under one of the tests in subsection 2, the designation or description of the relationship by the parties as anything other than that of employment or of employer and employee is immaterial. 4. Generally, an officer of a corporation is an employee of the corporation and the service performed for the corporation is employment. However, an officer of a corporation who does not perform any services or performs only minor services and who neither receives nor is entitled to receive, directly or indirectly, any remuneration is not an employee of the corporation. A director of a corporation, in the directors capacity as such, is not an employee and such service is not employment. 5. Any service performed for another for wages or under any contract of hire is deemed to be employment unless it is shown that all three of the following tests are met: a. The firm or person for whom the services are being performed does not have the right to direct or control the worker1s performance. The service is considered employment when the firm for whom the services are performed has the right to control or direct the individual performing the services not only as to the result to be accomplished but also as to the details and the means by which the work is accomplished. In connection with this test, it is not necessary that the firm actually exercise direction or control. The test fails if the firm has the right to do so. The right of the firm to discharge a worker without incurring a contractual liability is a strong indicator of the right to control, particularly if the arrangement contemplates conti.nuing or reoccurring work. b. The service performed must be outside the usual course of business or outside all places of business of the firm for which the services are performed. The service must not be directly related to the principal business activity of the firm or the service must be performed outside of the firm1s places of business. The firm1s places of business are not limited to its building or premises, but may include the customers premises or 82 geographical areas where the firm normally performs its services. c. The individual performing the service must be customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business. The individual performing the service must do so of a business established independently relationship with the firm for whom the services performed. as a part of the are being Indicators of independence are a significant investment by the worker in facilities used in performance of the service. The possibility of a profit or loss as a result of the service. Working for a number of persons at the same time, the hiring of assistants, and the availability of the services to the general public are also indicators. In this connection, it is not sufficient that a worker be free to engage in such activities, the worker must actually be so engaged. 6. In addition to service which is employment under paragraphs 1 and 2 of subdivision a of subsection 17 of North Dakota Century Code section 52-01-01, other service is employment if it is performed under certain circumstances in the following occupational groups: a. As an agent-driver or commission-driver engaged in distributing meat products, vegetable products, fruit products, bakery products, beverages (other than milk), or laundry or dry cleaning services, for his principal. b. As a traveling or city salesman, other than as an agent-driver or commission-driver, engaged upon a full-time basis in the solicitation on behalf of, and the transmission to, his principal (except for sideline sales activities on behalf of some other person) of orders from wholesalers, retailers, contractors, or operators of hotels, restaurants, or other similar establishments for merchandise for resale or supplies for use in their business operations. The fact that the service falls within one of the enumerated occupational groups, however, does not make such service employment under this subsection unless the contract of service contemplates that substantially all of the services are to be performed personally by such individual; the individual does not have a substantial investment in facilities used in connection with the performance of the services (other than in facilities for transportation); and the services are not in the nature of a single transaction 83 that is not part of a continuing relationship with the person for whom the services are performed.

Sampling frequency for community water systems. (1) Surface water supplies. Community water systems shall sample at intervals specified by the department, but in no event less frequently than at three-year intervals. Samples analyzed shall be collected during the period of the year designated by the department as the period when contamination is most likely to occur. (2) Ground water supplies. Community water systems shall sample when specified by the department. b. Sampling frequency for check samples. If the result of an analysis indicates that the level of any contaminant exceeds the maximum contaminant level, the system shall report to the department within seven days and initiate three additional analyses at the same sampling point within one month. When the average of four analyses exceeds the maximum contaminant level, the system shall notify the department and give notice to the public. Monitoring after public notification shall be at a frequency designated by the department and shall continue until the maximum contaminant level has not been exceeded in two successive samples or until a monitoring schedule as a condition to a variance or enforcement action shall become effective. 2. Total trihalomethanes. a. Coverage. Community water systems which serve a population of ten thousand or more individuals and which add a disinfectant to the water in any part of the drinking water treatment process shall collect samples for the purpose of analysis for total trihalomethanes. b. Sampling frequency. The minimum number of samples required to be taken by the system shall be based on the number of treatment plants used by the system. Multiple wells drawing raw water from a single aquifer may, with the department's approval, be considered one treatment plant. 131 All samples taken within an established frequency shall be collected within a twenty-four-hour period. (1) Routine sampling. Analyses for total trihalomethanes shall be performed at quarterly intervals on at least four water samples for each treatment plant used by the system. At least twenty-five percent of the samples shall be taken at locations within the distribution system reflecting the maximum residence time of the water in the system. The remaining seventy-five percent shall be taken at representative locations in the distribution system, taking into account number of persons served, different sources of water, and different treatment methods employed. (2) Reduced sampling frequency. (a) Systems utilizing surface water or a combination of surface and ground water. The sampling frequency may be reduced to a minimum of one sample analyzed per quarter taken at a point in the distribution system reflecting the maximum residence time of the water in the system. The system1s sampling frequency may only be reduced upon written request by the system and upon a determination by the department that data from at least one year of sampling at a frequency of four samples collected per calendar quarter per water treatment plant used by the system and local conditions demonstrate that total trihalomethane concentrations will be consistently below the maximum contaminant 1 eve 1 . If at any time during which the reduced sampling frequency is in effect, the result from any analysis exceeds the maximum contaminant level and such results are confirmed by at least one check sample taken promptly after such results are received, or if the system makes any significant change to its source of water or treatment program, the system shall immediately resume sampling on a routine basis of four samples per quarter per treatment plant used by the system. Such increased sampling shall continue for at least one year before the frequency may be reduced again. (b) Systems utilizing only ground water. The sampling frequency may be reduced to a minimum of one sample analyzed per year per water treatment plant taken at a point in the 132 distribution system reflecting the maximum residence time of the water in the system. The system's sampling frequency may only be reduced upon written request by the system and upon a determination by the department that the system has a maximum total trihalomethane potential of less than the maximum contaminant level and local conditions demonstrate that the system is not likely to approach or exceed the maximum contaminant level. If at any time during which the reduced sampling frequency is in effect, the result from any analysis for maximum total trihalomethane potential is equal to or exceeds the maximum contaminant level and such results are confirmed by at least one check sample, the system shall immediately resume sampling on a routine basis of four samples per quarter per treatment plant used by the system. Such increased sampling shall continue for at least one year before the frequency may be reduced again. In the event of any significant change to the system's source of water or treatment program, the system shall immediately analyze an additional sample for maximum total trihalomethane potential taken at a point in the distribution system reflecting maximum residence time of the water in the system for the purpose of determining whether the system must begin sampling on a routine basis of four samples per quarter per treatment plant used by the system. (3) Increased sampling frequency. At the option of the department, sampling frequencies may be increased above the m1n1mum in those cases where it is necessary to detect variations of total trihalomethane levels within the distribution system. c. Compliance. Compliance with the maximum contaminant level shall be determined based on a running annual average of quarterly analyses. If the average of analyses covering any twelve-month period exceeds the maximum contaminant level, sampling shall be at a frequency designated by the department and shall continue until a monitoring schedule as a condition to a variance or enforcement action becomes effective. If the average of analyses covering any twelve-month period exceeds the maximum contaminant level, or if the 133 system fails to monitor, the system shall notify the department and give notice to the public. d. Reporting. All analyses shall be reported to the department within thirty days of the system's receipt of such results. e. Modification of treatment methods for reduction of total trihalomethanes. Before a system makes any significant modification to its existing treatment process for the purpose of achieving compliance with the trihalomethane regulations, the system must submit and obtain department approval of a detailed plan setting forth its proposed modification and those safeguards that it will implement to ensure that the water will not be adversely affected by such modification. Each system shall comply with the provisions set forth in the department-approved plan. At a minimum, the department-approved plan shall require the system modifying its disinfection practice to: (1) Evaluate the water system for sanitary defects and evaluate the source water for biological quality; (2) Evaluate its existing treatment practices and consider improvements that will minimize disinfectant demand and optimize finished water quality throughout the distribution system; (3) Provide baseline water quality survey data of the distribution system as the department may require; (4) Conduct additional monitoring to assure continued maintenance of optimal microbiological quality in finished water; and (5) Demonstrate an active disinfectant throughout the distribution system at during and after the modification. 3.

Systems shall sample at points of entry to the distribution system representative of each source unless the sources are combined before distribution, then the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system during periods of normal operating conditions. Systems must sample every three months if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are detected in the initial sample or in any subsequent sample. Sampling must be conducted at the same location or a more representative location each quarter. Systems must sample every three years if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are not detected in the initial sample or in any subsequent sample but the system is vulnerable and has more than five hundred service connections. Systems must sample every five years if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are not detected in the initial sample or in any subsequent sample and the system is not vulnerable or is vulnerable but has five hundred or less service connections. Analysis for vinyl chloride is required only for systems that have detected one or more of the following two-carbon for vinyl chloride is required at each distribution or entry point at which one or more of the two-carbon organic compounds were found. If the first analysis does not detect vinyl chloride, the department may reduce the frequency of vinyl chloride monitoring to once every three years for that sample location or other sample locations which are more representative of the same source. (2) Surface water systems. Systems shall sample at points of entry to the distribution system representative of each source unless the sources are combined before distribution, then the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system after any application of treatment during periods of normal operating conditions. Systems must sample every three months if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are detected in the initial sample or in any subsequent sample. Sampling must be conducted at the same location or a more representative location each quarter. Systems must sample quarterly for the first year and every three years thereafter if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are not detected but the system is vulnerable and has more than five hundred service connections. Systems must sample 135 quarterly for the first year and every five years thereafter if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are not detected but the system is vulnerable and has five hundred or less service connections. Systems may be required to monitor at department discretion if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are not detected in the first year of quarterly sampling and the system is not vulnerable. Systems may be required to analyze for vinyl chloride at the discretion of the department. c. Reduced sampling frequency. The department may reduce the frequency of monitoring to once per year for a system detecting volatile synthetic organic chemicals at levels consistently less than the maximum contaminant level for three consecutive years. d. Vulnerability. Vulnerability of systems shall be determined by the department based upon an assessment of the following: (1) Previous monitoring results; (2) Number of persons served by the system; (3) Proximity of a smaller system to a larger system; (4) Proximity to commercial or industrial use, disposal, or storage of volatile synthetic organic chemicals; and (5) Protection of the water source. A system is deemed to be vulnerable for a period of three years after any volatile synthetic organic chemical or unregulated contaminant, except for disinfection byproducts, is detected. e. Reporting. The results of all analyses must be reported to the department within thirty days of the system's receipt of such results. f. Compliance. Compliance must be determined based on the results of running annual average of quarterly sampling for each sampling location. If one location's average is greater than the maximum contaminant level, then the system must be deemed to be out of compliance. For systems that only take one sample per location, compliance must be based on that one sample. The department monitoring data has the authority to allow the use of collected after January 1, 1983, for 136 purposes of monitoring compliance. If the data is consistent with the other requirements of these rules, the department may use that data to represent the initial monitoring if the system is determined by the department not to be vulnerable. The department has the authority to determine compliance or initiate enforcement action based upon analytical results and other information compiled by a sanctioned representative or agency. g. Public notification. If a system fails to monitor or comply with a maximum contaminant level, the system shall notify the department and give notice to the public. 4. Unregulated contaminants. a.

Routine monitoring . a. General. Suppliers of water for public water systems shall collect routine samples for total coliform bacteria 143 analysis at sites which are representative of the water throughout the distribution system according to a written sample siting plan. The plan is subject to department review and revision. The routine samples must be collected at regular time intervals throughout the month except that systems using ground water not under the direct influence of surface water, as determined by the department, serving four thousand nine hundred people or less may collect all of the required samples on a single day if the samples are collected from different sites. At the discretion of the department, systems that use surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water that do not filter shall collect at least one sample for total coliform bacteria analysis each day that the turbidity level of the source water exceeds one nephlelometric turbidity unit. The sample must be collected near the first service connection within twenty-four hours of the first exceedance unless the department determines that the system, due to logistical or other problems beyond its control, cannot have the sample analyzed within thirty hours of collection. The sample results must be included in determining compliance with the maximum contaminant levels for total coliform bacteria. b. Community water systems. Suppliers of water for community water systems shall sample for total coliform bacteria at a frequency established by the department. The number of samples required must be determined by the population served by the system and in no event may the frequency be less than that set forth below: MINIMUM NUMBER OF POPULATION SERVED SAMPLES PER MONTH 25 to 1 000 1 1 001 to 2 500 2 2 501 to 3,300 3 3 301 to 4,100 4 4 101 to 4,900 5 4 901 to 5 800 6 5,801 to 6,700 7 6,701 to 7,600 8 7,601 to 8,500 9 8,501 to 12 900 10 12,901 to 17,200 15 17,201 to 21,500 20 21,501 to 25 000 25 25 001 to 33 000 30 33,001 to 41,000 40 144 41 001 to 50,000 50 50,001 to 59,000 60 59 001 to 70,000 70 70 001 to 83,000 80 83,001 to 96,000 90 96 001 to 130,000 100 Community water systems using a ground water source serving twenty-five to one thousand persons may, with written permission from the department, reduce this sampling frequency to one sample per quarter provided that: (1) The system has no history of total coliform contamination in its current configuration; and (2) A sanitary survey conducted by the department in the past five years shows that the system is supplied solely by a protected ground water source that is free of sanitary defects. c. Noncommunity water systems. Suppliers of water for noncommunity water systems using only ground water, and not ground water under the direct influence of surface water, serving one thousand people or less shall sample for total coliform bacteria in each calendar quarter that the system provides water to the public. The department may, in writing, reduce this routine monitoring frequency to no less than once per year based on sanitary survey results, accumulated analytical data, or the existence of additional safeguards such as a protective and enforced well code, disinfection, or an approved wellhead protection program. The frequency must be confirmed or changed based on subsequent sanitary surveys or data. The frequency may not be reduced until: (1) A sanitary survey conducted by the department shows that the system is free of sanitary defects; and (2) The system has performed at least one total coliform bacteria analysis of its drinking water and is in compliance with the microbiological maximum contaminant levels. Suppliers of water for noncommunity water systems using only ground water, and not ground water under the direct influence of surface water, serving more than one thousand people during any month, shall sample for total coliform bacteria at the same frequency as like-sized community water systems. With written permission from the department, noncommunity water systems may reduce this monitoring frequency for any quarter that one thousand people or less are served. The reduced frequency must be 145 one total coliform bacteria sample in each calendar quarter that water is provided to the public. Suppliers of water for noncommunity water systems using ground water under the direct influence of surface water shall sample for total coliform bacteria at the same frequency as like-sized community water systems. Monitoring must begin within six months after the department determines that the ground water is under the direct influence of surface water. Suppliers of water for noncommunity water systems using surface water, in total or in part, shall sample for total coliform bacteria at the same frequency as like-sized community water systems regardless of the number of people served. 2. Repeat monitoring. a. General. Suppliers of water for public water systems shall collect a set of repeat samples for total coliform bacteria analysis for each total coliform-positive routine sample. Systems which collect more than one routine sample per month shall collect at least three repeat samples for each routine sample that is total coliform-positive. Systems which collect one routine sample per month or less shall collect at least four repeat samples for each routine sample that is total coliform-positive. Systems may, with the approval of the department, count routine samples as repeat samples rather than routine samples provided that: (1) The routine samples are collected within five service connections of the initial total coliform-positive sample; and (2) The routine samples are collected before the system learns that the initial sample was total coliform-positive. b. Repeat monitoring time period. The required set of repeat samples must be collected within twenty-four hours of notification by the department of the total coliform-positive result. The department may specify a longer time limit if it determines that the system cannot collect the repeat samples within twenty-four hours due to logistical or other problems beyond its control. 146 The repeat samples must be collected on the same day except that the department may allow systems with a single service connection to: (1) Collect the required set of repeat samples over a four-day period; or (2) Collect a larger volume repeat sample in one or more sample containers of any size as long as the total volume collected is at least four hundred milliliters for systems that collect one or less routine sample per month and three hundred milliliters for systems that collect more than one routine sample per month. c. Repeat monitoring location. The repeat samples must be collected at the following locations: (1) At least one repeat sample must be collected from the original sampling tap that was total coliform-positive. (2) At least one repeat sample must be collected from a tap within five service connections upstream of the original total coliform-positive sampling tap. (3) At least one repeat sample must be collected from a ~ithin five service connections downstream of the original total coliform-positive sampling tap. (4) Systems required to collect four repeat samples shall collect the fourth repeat sample within five service connections upstream or downstream of the original total coliform-positive sampling tap. The department may waive the requirement to collect at least one repeat sample upstream and downstream of the original total coliform-positive sampling site and specify alternate sampling locations if the original sampling site is at or one away from the end of the distribution system. d. Additional sets of repeat samples. If one or more samples in the. set of required repeat samples is total coliform-positive, an additional set of repeat samples must be collected meeting the same time and location requirements as for the original set of repeat samples. Additional sets of repeat samples must be collected until no total coliform bacteria are detected in one complete set or the department determines that the maximum contaminant level for total coliform bacteria has been exceeded. The supplier of water shall report to the department and notify the public when a maximum contaminant level is exceeded. 147 3. Next-month samples. Suppliers of water for public water 4. systems that collect four or fewer routine samples per month that have one or more total coliform-positive routine or repeat samples shall collect at least five routine samples the next month that water is provided to the public. The department may waive this requirement only if one of the following conditions are met: a. The department or an agent approved by the department, but not an employee of the system, conducts an onsite visit before the end of the next month that the system serves water to the public and determines that additional monitoring or corrective action is not warranted. b. The department, in a written decision made available to the public, determines why total coliform-positive samples occurred and establishes that the system has corrected or will correct the problem before the end of the next month that water is served to the public. c. The department invalidates the original total coliform-positive routine sample. Routine total coliform bacteria samples normally collected the next month that water is provided to the public may be counted towards the set of five routine samples required the next month. Fecal coliform or E.coli analysis. Suppliers of water for public water systems shall analyze each total coliform-positive routine or repeat sample for either fecal coliform bacteria or E.coli. Systems shall notify the department by the end of the business day, or by the end of the next business day if the department offices are closed, once notified of a positive fecal coliform bacteria or E.coli result. 5. Invalidation of total coliform samples. a. Invalidation by the department. The department may invalidate a total coliform-positive sample only if one of the following conditions are met: (1) The laboratory establishes that the total coliform-positive result was caused by improper sample analysis. (2) The department determines, based upon the results of the required repeat samples, that the total coliform-positive sample resulted from a domestic or other nondistribution system problem. This provision 148 b. applies only to systems that have more than one service connection if: (a) All repeat samples collected at the same tap as the original total coliform-positive sample are also total coliform-positive; and (b) All repeat samples collected within five service connections of the original total coliform-positive sample tap are total coliform-negative. (3) The department, in a written decision made available to the public, determines that substantial grounds exist to indicate that the coliform-positive result was due to a circumstance or condition not reflective of the water quality in the distribution system. Invalidation must be based on the absence of total coliform-positive repeat samples and other factors as determined by the department. Invalidation may not be based solely on the grounds that all required repeat samples are total coliform-negative. Total coliform-positive samples invalidated by the department may not count towards meeting the minimum monitoring requirements. Department invalidation of a total coliform-positive sample nullifies subsequent fecal coliform or E.coli results for the same sample. Invalidation by the laboratory. All total coliform bacteria samples examined by the department or by any other laboratory certified by the department must be invalidated, unless total coliform bacteria are detected, if: (1) The sample produces a turbid culture in the absence of gas production using an analytical technique where gas formation is examined; (2) The sample produces a turbid culture in the absence of an acid reaction in the presence-absence coliform test; or (3) The sample exhibits confluent growth or produces colonies too numerous to count with an analytical technique using a membrane filter. Suppliers of water for public water systems shall collect a replacement sample for total coliform bacteria analysis from the same location as the original sample if the original sample is invalidated by the department or any other laboratory certified by the department. Replacement samples must be collected within twenty-four hours of 149 notification by the department and submitted for analysis until a valid result is obtained. The department may waive the twenty-four-hour time limit on a case-by-case basis. 6. Sanitary surveys. a. Coverage and effective dates. Community and noncommunity water systems that collect four or less routine total coliform bacteria samples per month shall undergo an initial sanitary survey by June 29, 1994, and June 29, 1999, respectively. b. Repeat frequency. Community and noncommunity water systems shall undergo an additional sanitary survey every five years following the initial sanitary survey, except that noncommunity water systems using only protected and disinfected ground water, as determined by the department, shall undergo subsequent sanitary surveys at least every ten years following the initial sanitary survey. c. Responsibilities. Sanitary surveys must be performed by the department or an agent approved by the department. Information collected on sources of contamination within a delineated wellhead protection area during the development and implementation of an approved wellhead protection program, if available, must be considered when conducting sanitary surveys. The department shall review the sanitary survey results to determine if increased monitoring for total coliform bacteria or other measures are needed to protect or improve drinking water quality. Community and noncommunity water systems are responsible for ensuring that the required sanitary surveys are conducted.

The state of North Dakota, in accordance with the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, declares that state and public policy is to maintain or improve, or both, the quality and purity of the waters of this state. These standards are established for the protection of public health and enjoyment of these waters, to ensure the propagation and well-being of fish, wildlife, and all biota associated or dependent upon said waters, and to safeguard social, economical, and industrial development associated with this resource. The waters of the state include all surface and ground waters of the state as defined in North Dakota Century Code section 61-28-01 and those rivers, streams, and lakes forming boundaries between this state and other states or Canada. All known and reasonable methods to control and prevent pollution of the waters of this state are required, including improvement in water quality, when feasible. The portion of the statement of policy contained in North Dakota Century Code section 61-28-01 which reads as follows, is a part of this chapter: It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state of North Dakota to act in the public interest to protect, maintain, and improve the quality of the waters in the state for continued use as public and private water supplies, propagation of wildlife, fish and aquatic life, and for domestic, agricultural, industrial, recreational, and other legitimate beneficial uses, to require necessary and reasonable treatment of sewage, industrial, or other wastes. It is the purpose of this chapter to maintain and improve the quality of waters in the state and to maintain and protect existing water uses. The 11quality of the waters11 shall be the quality of record existing at the time the first standards were established in 1967, or later records if these indicate an improved quality in certain waters. 169 Waters whose existing quality is higher than the established standards will be maintained at the higher quality unless it can be affirmatively demonstrated, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordination and public participation prov1s1ons of the continuing planning process, that a change in quality is necessary to accommodate important economic or social development in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing the lowering of water quality, the department shall assure existing uses are fully protected and that the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all point sources and all cost effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint sources are achieved. Waters of unique constitute an outstanding protected. or high national quality characteristics that may resource must be maintained and Any industrial, public, or private project or development other than municipal which constitutes a source of pollution shall provide the best degree of treatment as designated by the department in the North Dakota pollutant discharge elimination system. Municipal wastes are required to meet the effluent requirements as noted in subsection 3 of section 33-16-02-04. If review of data and public input indicates any detrimental water quality changes, appropriate actions will be taken by this department following procedures approved by the environmental protection agency. The environmental protection agency will be kept advised and provided with the information needed to perform its responsibilities under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended. History: Amended effective March 1, 1985; May 1, 1989; February NDCC 61-28-04 33-16-02-06. Specific standards of quality for designated classes of surface waters of the state. The following standards are prescribed as specific water quality for designated classes of surface waters to protect beneficial water uses as set forth in the following water use descriptions and classifications. It is recognized that during certain periods of the year, some waters may contain certain natural chemical, physical, and biological characteristics or properties equaling or exceeding the limits set forth in these standards. The department may use the natural background level as the standard for any particular parameters and as a base for controlling the addition of wastes from controllable sources. When the flow in the stream is less than the ten-year, seven-day low flow level, the department reserves the right to make a case-by-case evaluation of application of these standards. However, no substances shall be present in concentrations or combinations that materially interfere with, or that prove hazardous to, the intended water usage. 170 The magnitude of any specific parameter violation or the intrinsic nature and potential damage caused by any specific parameter violation will be considered by the department in evaluating whether a single parameter violation shall result in administrative action. Storet Code 00612 1. Class I streams. The quality of waters in this class shall be such as to permit the propagation or life, or both, of resident fish species and other aquatic biota and shall be suitable for boating, swimming, and other water recreation. The quality shall be such that after treatment consisting of coagulation, settling, filtration, and chlorination, or equivalent treatment processes, the treated water shall meet the bacteriological, physical, and chemical requirements of the department for municipal use. The quality of water shall be such as to permit its use for irrigation, stock watering, and wildlife use without injurious effects. The following substances, unless stated otherwise, are maximum limits not to be exceeded. The requirements of this class of water shall be as follows: Substance or Characteristic Ald1in CTotal) Ammonia (un-ionized) as (N) (Diss.) ** Maximum Limit The NH3-N in mg/1 concentration resulting from intermittent waste discharges cannot exceed the numerical value given by .427/FT/FPH/2 where: FT = 100.03(20-TCAP).

Since each stream or lake has unique characteristics which determine the 174 levels of these constituents that will cause excessive plant growth (eutrophication), the department reserves the right to review these standards after additional study and to set specific limitations on any waters of the state. However, in no case shall the standard for nitrates (N) exceed ten milligrams per liter for any waters used as a municipal or domestic drinking water supply. ** More restrictive criteria than specified may be necessary to protect fish and aquatic biota. These criteria will be developed according to the procedures in subdivision b of subsection 2 of section 33-16-02-07. *** Limitation is a pH dependent calculated value using the formula e[l.OOS(pH)-S.29]; pH= 7.8 was used for listed value as an example.

Within a period of twenty-four hours, or as soon thereafter as practicable, from the time the department or the society has received notification from a local law enforcement agency pursuant to section 40-02-03-03, the department staff and the society staff, or a qualified archaeologist designated thereby, or in the case of a historic burial, the specialist appointed by the department, shall commence the initial examination of any human remains which are the subject of the notification and undertake the following activities: 1. The human remains must be initially examined by the department and the society staff, or by a qualified archaeologist designated thereby, to determine the race and age of the remains, if possible, using relevant available and solicited information, e.g., plats, maps, records, interviews with landowners, and associated burial goods. 2. If a presumption as to race and age can be made based upon location, historical data and any associated burial goods, this information must be used to determine the disposition of the human remains by the staff of the department and the society. Disposition must be in accordance with applicable society and department statutes and rules. 3. In those instances wherein a burial site, human remains, and burial goods may constitute evidence in a potential criminal prosecution other than those described in North Dakota Century Code section 23-06-27, the burial site, human remains, and burial goods may be studied by any criminal forensic examination methods as may be required in the process of criminal investigation. 200 4. If it is determined by initial examination that the human remains are non-Indian, the remains may be further examined within the applicable scope of study as defined in section 40-02-03-01. 5. If it is determined by initial examination that the human remains are Indian, the remains may be further examined within the applicable scope of study as defined in section 40-02-03-01. 6. If it cannot be determined by means of such initial examination that the human remains are either Indian or non-Indian, it must be presumed that the human remains are Indian, based upon experience of the staff of the department and the society.

Whether or not the society intends to study a disturbed Indian burial site and its contents, the superintendent shall provide timely notification of the disturbed burial to the duly designated representative of the intertribal reinterment committee. Within a period of twenty-four hours, or as soon thereafter as practicable, from the time of receipt of such notification, the representative shall make an inspection of the burial site. The representative shall then make a determination as to whether the burial can be adequately and safely restored and protected in situ or, in the alternative, the contents of the burial should be disinterred completely and reinterred in another location. Archaeological testing of a disturbed human burial site to determine its spatial limits and integrity is an acceptable activity under this section to reach such determination regarding restoration in place or disinterment of human remains and burial goods. Prior to the 201 restoration or disinterment of the burial, the intertribal reinterment committee shall attempt to determine the tribal identity or affiliation of the human remains and any burial goods interred in the burial site. If it is determined that the disturbed burial can be adequately and safely restored and protected in situ and any requisite consent of the private landowner has been secured, the intertribal reinterment committee shall, as soon as practicable and subsequent to the completion of any study conducted on the contents of the burial at the direction of the society, cause the burial to be backfilled, stabilized, and protected from further disturbance by the human activities or natural processes which caused the disturbance in the first instance. If, on the other hand, it is determined that the in situ restoration of the burial is not feasible and any requisite consent of the private landowner has been secured, the intertribal reinterment committee shall, as soon as practicable and subsequent to the completion of any study conducted on the contents of the burial at the direction of the society, cause the disinterred human remains and any and all burial goods to be reinterred on Indian lands within the boundaries of the appropriate Indian reservation, as determined by the intertribal reinterment committee. Each such restoration and reinterment shall provide an opportunity for appropriate tribal religious ceremony or ceremonies . The expenses inherent in each such restoration and reinterment activity must be exclusively and fully incurred by the appropriate tribal government, as determined by the intertribal reinterment committee. The disinterment of the contents of a burial must be conducted under the supervision of a qualified archaeologist in accordance with the procedures inherent in a standard archaeological and contextual analysis within the applicable scope of study as defined in section 40-02-03-01.

As soon as practicable after receipt by the superintendent of each such notification pursuant to section 40-02-03-06, the society, in conformity with the applicable requirement prescribed by subsection 7 of North Dakota Century Code section 23-06-27, shall cause the appropriate representatives of the society to commence negotiations with the person proposing disinterment in an effort to achieve the avoidance altogether of the human burial site at issue by the proposed development activity. Such negotiations must be conducted during a period no greater than sixty days from the date on which the superintendent received notification pursuant to section 40-02-03-06. The superintendent shall give to the intertribal reinterment committee reasonable notice of the 205 prospective negotiations and said committee shall have the opportunity to consult with the superintendent regarding such negotiations through appropriate representatives. Should negotiations fail within the sixty-day period and should the state historical board not choose to seek alternative judicial relief to enjoin the proposed disturbance of the burial at issue, the superintendent, upon having determined that the documentation provided by the person pursuant to section 40-02-03-06 is sufficient, shall direct written notification to the person that the proposed development through the location of the human burial at issue may proceed as planned; provided, however, that the development may not actually proceed through the location of such burial, until such time as the human remains and any and all burial goods interred in the burial site have been disinterred. Any person who otherwise proceeds to cause the disinterment of the burial at issue will be deemed to be in violation of subdivision a of subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 23-06-27. In those instances wherein such written notification has been directed by the superintendent to the person proposing disinterment, the superintendent shall thereafter notify the intertribal reinterment committee of any intent of the society to direct a qualified archaeologist to conduct a study of the human burial site and its contents. Should such intent be expressed by the superintendent, the intertribal reinterment committee may make arrangements for the appropriate duly designated representative to accompany the representative of the society to the human burial site at the earliest practicable time. Such duly designated representative may be present at the site of the burial throughout the course of the conduct of the study by the qualified archaeologist and may provide any necessary assistance in conjunction with the conduct of the study. Subsequent to the completion of the conduct of any study, the qualified archaeologist who performed the study shall file a written report of the work completed and data recovered with the superintendent, who shall direct a copy of said report to the intertribal reinterment committee.

History: Effective March NDCC 38-12.1-05 Law Implemented: NDCC 38-12.1-05 43-02-01-20. Performance standards for coal exploration. The performance standards in this section are applicable to coal exploration which substantially disturbs land surface and on land designated unsuitable for mining under North Dakota Century Code section 38-14.1-05. Whether the land surface will be substantially disturbed shall be determined by the state geologist. 1. For purposes of this section, \"substantially disturb\" means, for purposes of coal exploration, to impact significantly upon land, air, or water resources by such activities as blasting, mechanical excavation, drilling or altering coal or water exploratory holes or wells, construction of roads and other access routes, and the placement of structures, excavated earth, or other debris on the surface of land. 2. Coal exploration activities which will substantially disturb land surface shall not be allowed to affect the following: a. Habitats of unique value for fish, wildlife, and other related environmental values. 216 b. Threatened or endangered species of plants or animals listed by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended [16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.] and their critical habitats. c. Species such as eagles, migrating birds or other animals protected by state or federal law, and their habitats. d. Habitats of unusually high value for fish and wildlife, such as wetlands, riparian areas, cliffs, supporting raptors, areas offering special shelter or protection, reproduction and nursery areas, and wintering areas. 3. The person who conducts coal exploration shall, to the extent practicable, measure important environmental characteristics of the exploration area during the operations, to minimize environmental damage to the area and to provide supportive information for any permit application that person may submit as part of the permit application. a. Vehicular travel on other than established graded and surfaced roads shall be limited by the person who conducts coal exploration to that absolutely necessary to conduct the exploration. Travel shall be confined to graded and surface roads during periods when excessive damage to vegetation or rutting of the land surface could result. b. Any new road in the exploration area shall comply with the provisions of chapter 69-05.2-24. c. Existing roads may be used for exploration in accordance with the following: (1) All applicable federal, state, and local requirements shall be met. (2) If the road is significantly altered for exploration, including, but not limited to, change of grade, widening, or change of route, or if use of the road for exploration contributes additional suspended solids to streamflow or runoff, then subsection 7 and subsections 1 and 2 of section 69-05.2-24-01 shall apply to all areas of the road which are altered or which result in such additional contributions. (3) If the road is significantly altered for exploration activities and will remain as a permanent road after exploration activities are completed, the person conducting exploration shall ensure that the requirements of chapter 69-05.2-24, as appropriate, are met for the design, construction, alteration, and maintenance of the road. 217 d. Promptly after exploration activities are existing roads used during exploration shall be either: completed, reclaimed (1) To a condition equal to or better than their preexploration condition; or (2) To the condition required for permanent roads under chapter 69-05.2-24, as appropriate. 4. If excavations, artificial flat areas, or embankments are created during exploration, these areas shall be returned to the approximate original contour promptly after such features are no longer needed for coal exploration. 5. Suitable plant growth material, as defined in subsection 31 of North Dakota Century Code section 38-14.1-02 shall be removed, stored, and redistributed on disturbed areas as necessary to assure successful revegetation or as required by the commission. 6. Revegetation of areas disturbed by coal exploration shall be performed by the person who conducts the exploration or the person1s agent. All revegetation shall be in compliance with the plan approved by the commission and carried out in a manner that encourages prompt vegetative cover and recovery of productivity levels compatible with approved postexploration land use and in accordance with the following: a. All disturbed lands shall be seeded or planted to the same seasonal variety native to the disturbed area or to some suitable, commercially available mixture approved by the state geologist. If both the preexploration and postexploration land uses are intensive agriculture, planting of the crops normally grown will meet the requirements of this section. b. The vegetative cover shall be capable of stabilizing the soil surface in regards to erosion. 7. With the exception of small and temporary diversions of overland flow of water around new roads, drill pads, and support facilities, no ephemeral, intermittent or perennial stream shall be diverted during coal exploration activities. Overland flow of water shall be diverted in a manner that: a. Prevents erosion. b. To the extent possible using the best technology currently available, prevents additional contributions of suspended solids to streamflow or runoff outside the exploration area. 218 c. Complies with all other applicable state or federal requirements. 8. Each exploration hole, borehole, well, or other exposed underground opening created during exploration must be cased or sealed to meet the requirements of chapter 69-05.2-14 and section 43-02-01-14. 9. All facilities and equipment shall be removed from the exploration area promptly when they are no longer needed for exploration, except for those facilities and equipment that the state geologist determines may remain to: a. Provide additional environmental quality data. b. Reduce or control the onsite or offsite effects of the exploration activities. c. Facilitate future surface m1n1ng and reclamation operations by the person conducting the exploration, under an approved permit. 10. Coal exploration shall be conducted in a manner which minimizes disturbance of the prevailing hydrologic balance, and shall include appropriate sediment control measures such as those specified in section 69-05.2-16-08. The commission may specify additional measures which shall be adopted by the person engaged in coal exploration. 11. Toxic-forming materials shall be handled and disposed of in accordance with sections 69-05.2-16-11 and 69-05.2-21-03. If specified by the commission, additional measures shall be adopted by the person engaged in coal exploration. History: Effective August 1, 1980; amended effective March 1, 1991.

History: Amended effective November 1, 1983; June 26, 1989; Personnel Board 257 FEBRUARY 1991 59.5-01-01-01. Organization of state personnel board. 1. History and functions. The 1975 legislative assembly passed a Central Personnel System Act, codified as North Dakota Century Code chapter 54-44.3. The Act created the state personnel board which oversees the development and administration of a unified system of personnel administration for the classified service of the state. The board is an administrative agency separate from the central personnel division of the office of management and budget, although the board and the division work closely together. The board promulgates~ its own rules, but also reviews the division's policies, procedures and plans, and may modify or repeal them. Additionally, the board can review and change pay ranges and classifications assigned to classified employee positions and hear appeals from classified employees who have satisfactorily completed their probationary period on employee grievances relating to demotion, suspension without pay, reduction-in-force, forced relocation, reprisal action, discrimination, and dismissal from state employment. The board may approve positions not to be included in the classified service. The board also hears discrimination appeals from job applicants and classified employees regardless of their status, as well as appeals from disqualified applicants for positions in the merit system. The state personnel board also serves as the North Dakota merit system council. In this capacity the board regulates the personnel policies and practices of the state agencies which are by statute subject to the merit system. The board's regulation of merit system agencies includes promulgating rules, approving policies and procedures, and conducting 259 hearings on complaints arising from those rules, policies, and procedures. 2. Board membership. The board is composed of a constitutionally elected official who is the chairman, a member appointed by the board of higher education, one member appointed by the governor, and two members elected by classified employees. The term of the constitutionally elected official is four years or the remainder of the official's term of office, whichever is shorter. Constitutionally elected officials meet at the expiration of the term of the elected member and select by a majority vote the constitutionally elected official who serves on the board. The terms of all other members are six years. Any vacancy in office is filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the selection of the person vacating the office. 3. Meetings. The board organizes annually at its first meeting of each fiscal year. It elects a vice chairman to serve for a term of one year. The board meets at least six times a year and at such times and places as are specified by call of the chairman or any three members of the board. All meetings are open to the public with reasonable notice provided by the central personnel division. Three members constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Three favorable votes are necessary for the passage of any resolution or taking of any official action by the board at any meeting. 4. Delegation of authority. The director, central personnel division, as secretary to the board, may issue a notice of hearing and specification of issues and appoint a hearing officer, other than the director, for evidentiary grievance hearings. The hearing officer, upon completion of the hearing, prepares a summaxy o-f ttre ~and conclusions and the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation for the board's action. The hearing officer may issue a proposed order of dismissal prior to a hearing. 5. Rttl-e suspension. The ho-ard m-ay suspend \u00b1t-s ~ Board office.

On August 8, 1984, Governor Olson issued executive order 1984-9 which placed the administrative supervision and direction of the statewide protection and advocacy program under the executive committee of the governor's council on human resources.

The bill also provided that the committee on protection and advocacy must operate independently of the governor or any state agency that provides treatment, services, or habilitation to persons with developmental disabilities or mental illness. b.

Initially, four members must be appointed for two-year terms and three members must be appointed for one-year terms.

(2) The purchasing electric utility may recover metering costs associated with production monitoring from the qualifying facility. b. Each electric utility must have standard offer contracts for capacity payments, when required by subsection 6, to qualifying facilities operating as peaking units with a design capacity of one megawatt or less.

Those minimal support awards are intended to assure that all parents understand the parental duty to support children to the extent of the parents' ability. The requirement also is intended to foster relationships between parents and children which may arise out of a recognition of this parental duty. 75-02-04.1-05 Describes the obligors. Determination of net process for determining income from self-employment: the income of self-employed 75-02~04.1-06 -Consideration of hardship: Specifies the circumstances which should be considered in reducing support obligations on the basis of hardship, as required by section 14-09-09.7(1)(d). 75-02-04.1-07 Imputing income from assets: Imputes annual net property income equal to six percent of the parent!s equity interest in 339 property other than the homestead, necessary household goods and furnishings, and one motor vehicle. 75-02-04.1-08 -Income of spouse: Precludes consideration of the income of an obligor's spouse except in circumstances where the spouse's income and financial circumstances are, to a significant extent, subject to control by the obligor; and with respect to in-kind income contributed by the spouse to the obligor. 75-02-04.1-09 Factors considered Not considered: In two subsections, identifies factors which are considered in arriving at the child support obligation and factors which are not considered. This provision is intended to assist courts in determining if a ponderance of the evidence establishes that factors not considered by the guidelines will result in an undue hardship to the obligor or a child for whom support is sought, as required by section 14-09-09.7(3). 75-02-04.1-10 -Child support amount: Establishes a schedule of support payments amounts based upon the obligor's net monthly income and the number of children for whom support is being sought in the matter before the court. The highest child support obligation established is with respect to obligors with a monthly income of $10,000. No higher support obligation would be imposed unless a court makes a determination that factors not considered by the guidelines would result in an undue hardship to an obligor or to a child for whom support is sought. 75-02-04.1-11 Parental responsibility for children in foster care: Describes the manner of calculating child support obligations in circumstances where both parents often reside together and where there are usually two parents, neither of whom is a custodial parent and both of whom are potentially obligors. 75-02-04.1-12 Uncontested proceedings: In cases where there is no dispute as to the amount of child support, requires the presentation of credible evidence describing the obligor's income and financial circumstances to demonstrate that the uncontested or agreed amount of child support conforms to the requirements of chapter 75-02-04.1. 75-02-04.1-13 -Application: guidelines in all cases where determined.

Definitions. 1. 11Custodial parent11 means a parent who acts as the primary caregiver on a regular basis for a proportion of time greater than the obligor, regardless of custody descriptions such as 11shared11 or 11joint11 custody given in relevant judgments, decrees, or orders. 2. 11Gross income\" means income from any source, including salaries, wages, overtime wages, commissions, bonuses, deferred income, dividends, severance pay, pensions, interest, trust income, annuities income, capital gains, social security benefits, workers' compensation benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, retirement benefits, veterans' benefits (including gratuitous benefits), gifts and prizes to the extent each exceeds one thousand dollars in value, spousal support payments received, cash value of in-kind income received on a regular basis, income imputed from assets, and net income from self-employment, 'but excluding benefits received from means tested public assistance programs such as aid to families with dependent children, supplemental security income, and food stamps. 3. 11In-kind income11 means the receipt of any valuable right, property or property interest, other than money or money's worth, including, but not limited to, forgiveness of debt (other than through bankruptcy), use of property, including living quarters at no charge or less than the customary charge, and the use of consumable property at no charge or less than the customary charge. 4. 11Net income11 means total gross monthly income less: a. Federal income tax obligation based on application of standard deductions and tax tables. b. State income tax obligation based on application of standard deductions and tax tables. 341 c. Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) deductions or obligations, whichever is less. d. That portion of premium payments for health insurance policies or ~ealth service contracts intended to afford coverage for the child or children for whom support is being sought, and payments made on actual medical expenses of the child or children for whom support is being sought. e.

History: Effective February 1, 1991. 75-02-04.1-02. instructions. Determination of 342 support amount General 1. Calculations of child support obligations provided for under this chapter consider and assume that one parent acts as a primary caregiver and the other pareAt contributes a payment of child support to the child1s care. 2. Calculations assume that the care given to the child during temporary periods when the child resides with the obligor or the obligors relatives do not substitute for the child support obligation. 3. Net income received by an obligor from all sources must be considered in the determination of available money for child support. 4. The result of all calculations which determine a monetary amount ending in fifty cents or more must be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar, and must otherwise be rounded down to the nearest whole dollar. 5. In appl~ing the child support guidelines, and obligors monthly net income amount ending in fifty dollars or more must be rounded up to the nearest one hundred dollars, and must otherwise be rounded down to the nearest one hundred dollars. 6. The annual total of all income considered in determining a child support obligation must be determined and then divided by twelve in order to determine the obligor's monthly net income. 7. Income must be documented through the use of tax returns, current wage statements, and other information sufficiently to fully apprise the court of all gross income. Where gross income is subject to fluctuation, particularly in instances involving self-employment, information reflecting and covering a period of time sufficient to reveal the likely extent of fluctuations must be provided. History: Effective February 1, 1991. Determination of support amount -Split custody. A support amount must be determined for the child or children in each parent1s sole custody. The lesser amount is then subtracted from the greater. The difference is the child support amount owed by the parent with the greater obligation. History: Effective February 1, 1991. 343 75-02-04.1-04. Minimum support level. A support obligation should be established in each case where the obligor has any income. Even though the obligor's payment is far from sufficient to meet the child's needs, considerations of policy require that all parents understand the parental duty to support children to the extent of the parent's ability. Equally important considerations of policy require the fostering of relationships between parents and children which may arise out of the recognition of parental duty. History: Effective February 1, 1991. Determination of net income from self-employment. 1. Expenses attributable to the cost of producing income vary from business to business. Deducting expenses from the gross income of the business determines the adjusted gross income, according to internal revenue service terminology. Business expenses may include: rent on business property, taxes, repairs, insurance, legal and professional fees, interest on borrowing, real estate taxes, insurance, utilities such as gas and electricity, heating costs, repairs and maintenance, and salaries or wages paid to employees. If the latest tax return is not available or does not reasonably reflect the income from the business because the business has not been in operation for a full year, because the business has been substantially reduced because of economic hardship, sale of assets, or termination of part of the business, or because the business has been substantially increased because of economic boom, increased assets, or expansion of business operation, a profit and loss statement which will most accurately reflect the current status of the business must be used. 2. After adjusted gross income from self-employment is determined, all business expenses which may be allowed for taxation purposes, but which do not require actual expenditures, such as depreciation and net operating losses, must be added to determine net income from self-employment. Business costs which are actually incurred and paid, but which may not be expensed for internal revenue service purposes, such as principal payments on business loans, may be deducted to determine net income from self-employment. 3. Farm businesses experience significant changes in production and income over time. To the extent that information is reasonably available, the average of the most recent five years of farm operations, undertaken on a scale substantially similar to farm operations of a party to the child support proceeding, should be used to determine farm income. 344 4. Landcosts are a significant part of farm expenses. Because farmlands are used both for the production of income and for investment purposes, for the purpose of making determinations under this section, deduction of business costs relating to the purchase of land is limited to the lesser of: a. The fair rental value of the land being purchased; or b. The total principal and interest payments actually made toward the purchase of the land. History: Effective February 1, 1991. of ~ardship. Situations occur over which the obligor has little or no control, and which may substantially reduce the ability to pay child support for a prolonged time. If a continued or fixed expense, other than the obligors living expenses, is actually incurred and paid, such as payments to restore a major casualty loss of property essential to living or to earning a livelihood, the amounts paid may be deducted from gross income to arrive at net income. History: Effective February 1, 1991. income from assets. All assets, other than property claimable as a homestead under North Dakota Century Code section 47-18-01, necessary household goods and furnishings, and one motor vehicle in which the parent owns an equity not in excess of fifteen thousand dollars must be considered for the purpose of imputing income. Annual net property income equal to six percent of the parents equity interest in all such property which does not produce at least six percent return on equity, reduced by the actual net property income, must be imputed. History: Effective February 1, 75-02-04.1-08. Income of spouse. The income and financial circumstances of the spouse of an obligor should not be considered as income for child support purposes unless the spouses income and financial circumstances are, to a significant extent, subject to control by the obligor as, for instance, where the obligor is a principal in a business employing the spouse. The value of in-kind income contributed by the spouse to the obligor must be considered, as where the obligors spouse meets the cost of providing living quarters or transportation 345 used by the obligor, or otherwise allows the obligor to avoid ordinary living expenses. History: Effective February 1, Factors considered- Not considered. 1. The child support amount and the calculations provided for under this chapter consider all factors described or applied in this chapter, except those described in subsection 2 and, in addition, consider: a. The subsistence needs, work expenses, and daily living expenses of the obligor; and b. The income of the obligee, which is reflected in a substantial monetary and nonmonetary contribution to the child's basic care and needs by virtue of being a custodial parent. 2. The child support guidelines schedule and the calculations provided for under this chapter do not consider: a. The increased need in cases where support for more than six children is sought in the matter before the court; b. The increased ability of an obligor, with a monthly net income which exceeds ten thousand dollars, to provide child support; c. The increased educational costs voluntarily incurred at private schools; d. The increased needs of children with handicapping conditions or chronic illness; e. The increased needs of children age twelve and older; f. The full cost of child care purchased by the obligee; g. The value of the income tax exemption for supported children; and h. The reduced ability of the obligor to provide support due to travel expenses incurred solely for the purpose of visiting a child who is the subject of the order. History: Effective February 1, 1991. 346 75-02-04.1-10. Child support amount. The amount of child support payable by the obligor is determined by the application of the following schedule to the obligor's monthly net income and the number of children for whom support is being sought in the matter before the court.

Parental responsibility for care. It is important that parents maintain a tie to for their child when that child is in foster responsibility for the support of that child is one maintenance of the relationship of parent and child. children in foster and responsibility care. Financial component of the 1. In order to determine monthly net jncome, it is first necessary to identify the parent or parents who have financial 349 responsibility for any child entering foster care, and to determine the net income of those financially responsible parents. If the child1s parents live in separate households, each parents financial responsibility must be separately determined. Net income for each parent must be adjusted upward to reflect any income, not received from that parent, which is directly attributable to and furnished on behalf of a child for whom that parent is financially responsible. 2. The number of children to be counted, when applying section 75-02-04.1-10, is the number of children under age eighteen, including the child or children entering foster care, who are living in the household of a parent of a child entering foster care, and for whom that parent is financially responsible. 3. The net income and number of children are applied to section 75-02-04.1-10 to determine the amount of net income available for child support. That amount is divided by the number of children in the household, for whom the parent is financially responsible, to determine the amount of child support per child in foster care. 4. If a child in foster care is entitled to receive income or benefits in his or her own right, such as social security or supplemental security income, the full amount of the child1s income or benefits must be applied to the cost of foster care. The amount of payment required from the responsible parents may not exceed the cost of foster care less the amount of the child1s income or benefits. History: Effective February 1, Uncontested proceedings. In a proceeding where the obligor appears, but does not resist the child support amount sought by the obligee, and in proceedings where the parties agree or stipulate to a child support amount, credible evidence describing the obligors income and financial circumstances, which demonstrates that the uncontested or agreed amount of child support conforms to the requirements of this chapter, must be presented. History: Effective February 1, 1991. Application. The child support guideline schedule amount is rebuttedly presumed to be the correct amount of child support in all child support determinations, including both temporary and permanent determinations, and including determinations necessitated by actions for the support of children of married persons, actions seeking 350 domestic violence protection orders, actions arr1v1ng out of divorce, actions arising out of paternity determinations, actions based upon a claim for necessaries, actions arising out of juvenile court proceedings, and actions seeking the reciprocal enforcement of support. History: Effective February 1, 1991. 352 APRIL 1991 75-02-07-17. Ratesetting. 1. The department shall establish reasonable rates for facilities for the care and maintenance of individuals dependent in whole or in part upon state or county supplementation of supplemental security income benefits. 2. The department shall annually determine the allowable costs and shall adjust those costs to reflect changes projected in operational and labor costs for the year, beginning on July first and ending on June thirtieth of the following year. The rate thereby established must be called the audit rate. 3. The department shall rank all licensed beds, in facilities for which an audit rate is established, by the respective audit rate set for the bed, and determine position in the ranking below which lie seventy percent of the ranked beds. The reasonable rate established for each facility must be the lesser of the facility1s audit rate or the audit rate which has been established for the facility in which the bed thus determined is located. The reasonable rate shall be effective from July first through June thirtieth of the following year. 4. A county social service board shall determine the payable rate for any resident whose care is, in whole or in part, paid for by that county social service board. The payable rate shall be an amount equal to forty-five dollars plus the least of: a. The reasonable rate; b. The rate charged by the facility to residents not dependent upon state or county supplementation of supplemental security income benefits; or 353 c. A rate voluntarily agreed to by the facility. 5. In the event a county social service board establishes a payable rate less than that required by subsection 4, any county social service board expenditures made pursuant to that rate will not nonetheless be considered by the department in determining that county social service board1s expenditures for poor relief pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 50-01-09.2. ****************************************************************** NOTICE 5. In the event a county social service board establishes a payable rate less than that required by subsection 4, any county social service board expenditures made pursuant to that rate will nonetheless not be considered by the department in determining that county social service board1s expenditures for poor relief pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 50-01-09.2. The amendment made under this subsection becomes effective with respect to rates paid for services furnished on and after July 1, 1991. ****************************************************************** 6. The payable rate shall include a forty-five dollar per month clothing and personal needs allowance which must be reserved for each individual. Facilities shall ensure that this monthly clothing and personal needs allowance is reserved for its intended purpose. 7. Partial year. a. For facilities changing ownership during the rate period, the rate established for the previous owner will be retained. b. For existing facilities adding beds, the rate for the new beds will be the same as for the other similarly licensed beds in the facility. c. New facilities will submit, for departmental approval, a proposed budget for operations for the period, at least three months but not more than fifteen months in duration, which ends on June thirtieth. The rate established based upon the approved budget shall be final and shall continue in effect until the beginning of the rate period next following after the end of the report period which coincides with the end of the budget period. 8. Adjustments and reconsideration procedures. 354 a. Rate adjustments may be made to correct errors subsequently determined and shall also be retroactive to the beginning of the facility's rate period. b. An adjustment must be made for a facility which has terminated participation in the program and has disposed of its depreciable assets or which has changed ownership. In this case, the regulations pertaining to gains and losses on disposable assets will be effective. c.

Principles of eligibility. 1. The process of determining whether a person should receive services coordinated through mental retardation-developmental disabilities case management involves the recognition of several criteria and an understanding of expected outcomes as each criterion is applied. Professional judgment is appropriately applied to answer two questions: a. Whether a person is a class member and, therefore, entitled to mental retardation-developmental disabilities case management services; and b. Whether a person is appropriate for mental retardation-developmental disabilities case management services even though not a class member. 2. These questions must be used as the frame of reference for a team of at least three professionals in the human service center, led by the developmental disabilities program administrator or the administrators designee, for the determination of whether a person should be served through services coordinated by a mental retardation-developmental disabilities case manager. For purposes of this chapter, 11the team11 refers to such a team. History: Effective July 1, service eligibility -Class member. 1. The order of the federal district court in Association of Retarded Citizens v. Sinner makes a specific group of persons 367 with disabilities eligible for services. These persons are \"members of the plaintiff class11 The team1s initial task is to determine whether the applicant for services is a member of the plaintiff class. The terms \"members of the plaintiff class\" or \"class members\" refer to the class of persons who, as of September 26, 1980, and at any time subsequent, have been or may become residents of the developmental center at Grafton, North Dakota, and san haven, located near Dunseith, North Dakota. This language creates, in effect, three separate groups: a. Those persons who, as of September 26, 1980, were residents of the developmental center or san haven. b. Those persons who, subsequent to September 26, 1980, became residents of developmental center or san haven. c. Those persons who, subsequent to September 26, 1980, would have become residents of the developmental center or san haven were it not for the community alternatives created or expanded as a result of this litigation. 2. Class membership for subdivisions a and b of subsection 1 will be determined by reference to facility records. The team must use recognized evaluation criteria to identify persons eligible for services under subdivision c of subsection 1. The court has eliminated persons with a sole condition of mental illness from this group. In determining whether a person would have been served by the developmental center and, consequently, is eligible under subdivision c of subsection 1, the following criteria must be met: a. The person must have which is so severe as disability; or a diagnosis of mental retardation to constitute a developmental b. The person must have a combination of conditions, one of which must be any level of mental retardation, which together are so severe as to constitute a developmental disability. 3. A diagnosis of the condition of mental retardation must be made by an appropriately licensed professional using diagnostic criteria accepted by the American psychiatric association. 4. Determination of whether the manifestation of the conditions is so severe as to constitute a developmental disability must be done in accordance with the definition of developmental disability in North Dakota Century Code section 25-01.2-01. 5. If the team determines that the person requesting services meets the criteria of subdivision c of subsection 1, the 368 person is eligible for mental retardation-developmental disabilities case management services. History: Effective July 1, service eligibility -Applicants who are not members of the plaintiff class. 1. A person who is not a class member may be eligible for services which the department, through the developmental disabilities division, purchases on behalf of persons whose needs are similar to those of class members. Such a person must: 2. a. Have a condition of mental retardation, diagnosed by an appropriately licensed professional using diagnostic criteria accepted by the American psychiatric association, which is not so severe as to constitute a developmental disability, but be able to benefit from treatment and services; or b. Have a condition, other than mental illness, so severe as to constitute a developmental disability, which results in impairment of general intellectual functioning or adaptive behavior similar to that of mentally retarded persons, and must be able to benefit from services and intervention techniques which are so closely related to those applied to persons with the condition of mental retardation that provision is appropriate. Determination of eligibility for persons described subdivision b of subsection 1 requires the application professional judgment in a two-step process: in of a. The team must first determine whether the condition is so severe as to constitute a developmental disability. North Dakota Century Code section 25-01.2-01 must be applied in order to determine if a developmental disability is present. The presence of a developmental disability does not establish eligibility for services through the mental retardation-developmental disabilities case management system, but does require the team to consider all assessment data and apply professional judgment in the second step. b. The team must next determine whether appropriate services can be provided to a person determined to have a condition, other than mental illness, so severe as to constitute a developmental disability. The team must have a thorough knowledge of the condition and service needs of 369 the applicant, as well as a thorough knowledge of services that would be appropriate through the developmental disabilities system. When considering if mental retardation-developmental disabilities case management is appropriate, the team must consider factors, including: (1) Whether the person would meet criteria appropriately used to determine the need for services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded. (2) Whether appropriate services are available in the existing developmental disabilities service delivery system. (3) Whether a service, which uses intervention techniques designed to apply to persons with mental retardation, delivered by staff trained specifically in the field of mental retardation, would benefit the person. (4) Whether a service, designed for the mentally retarded, could be furnished to the person without any significant detriment to the person or others receiving the service. 3. If the team concludes, through the application of professional judgment, that a person's needs can be appropriately met through specific services purchased by the department for class members, a mental retardation-developmental disabilities case manager may be assigned to coordinate services. Services may be provided subject to the limits of legislative appropriation. New services need not be developed on behalf of the individual. History: Effective July 1, 1991. two. Criteria for service eligibility- Children birth 1. Service eligibility for children from birth through age two is based on distinct and separate criteria designed to enable preventive services to be delivered. Young children may have conditions which could result in substantial functional limitations if early and appropriate intervention is not provided. The collective professional judgment of the team must be exercised to determine whether the child is high risk or developmentally delayed, and may need early intervention services. If a child, age birth through two, is either high risk or developmentally delayed, he or she may be included on the caseload of a mental retardation-developmental disabilities case manager and considered for those services 370 designed to meet specific needs. Eligibility for continued service inclusion through mental retardation-developmental disabilities case management must be redetermined at age three using criteria specified in sections 75-04-06-02 and 75-04-06-03. 2. For purposes of this section: a. \"High risk\" means a child, age birth through two, whose development is related to diagnosed disorders of known etiology and which have relatively well-known expectancies for developmental outcome within specified ranges of developmental delay. b. \"Developmentally _delayed infant\" means: (1) An infant who is performing twenty-five percent below age norms in two or more of the following areas: (a) Cognitive development; (b) Gross motor development; (c) Fine motor development; (d) Sensory processing (hearing, vision, haptic); (e) Language development (expressive or receptive); (f) Psychosocial development; or (g) Self-help skills; or (2) An infant who is performing at fifty percent below age norms in one or more of the following areas: (a) Cognitive development; (b) Physical hearing; development, including vision and (c) Language and speech development (expressive and receptive); (d) Psychosocial development; or (e) Self-help skills. 75.5 Social Work Examiners, Board of 373 a il 374 JUNE 1991 75.5-02-01-02.

As used in this section, the term \"trucking company\" means a motor common carrier, a motor contract carrier, or an express carrier which primarily transports tangible personal property of others by motor vehicle for compensation. Where a trucking company has income from sources both within and without this state, the amount of business income from sources within this state shall be determined pursuant to this section. In such cases, the first step is to determine what portion of the trucking company's income constitutes business income and what portion constitutes nonbusiness under North Dakota Century Code sections 57-38.1-01 and 57-59-01, article IV(1), and section 81-03-09-03. Nonbusiness income is directly allocable to specific states pursuant to the prov1s1ons of North Dakota Century Code sections 57-38.1-05 through 57-38.1-08, and section 57-59-01, article IV(5) through (8). Business income is apportioned among the states in which the business is conducted and pursuant to the property, payroll, and sales apportionment factors set forth in this section. The sum of the items of nonbusiness income directly allocated to this state plus the amount of business income attributable to the state constitutes the amount of the taxpayer's entire net income which is subject to taxing in this state. 2. Business and nonbusiness income. For definitions, rules, and examples for determining business and nonbusiness income, see sections 81-03-09-03 through 81-03-09-06. 3.

Each boi 1 er sha 11 have at 1 east one American society of mechanical engineers approved safety valve and if it has more than five hundred square feet [46.45 square meters] of water heating surface, or if an electric boiler it has a power input of more than~ eleven hundred kilowatts, it shall have two or more American society of mechanical engineers approved safety valves. 2. The safety valve capacity for each boiler shall be such that the safety valve, or valves will discharge all the steam that can be generated by the boiler without allowing the pressure to rise more than six percent above the highest pressure at which any valve is set and in no case to more than six percent above the maximum allowable working pressure. The safety valve capacity of new units shall not be less than the maximum designed steaming capacity as determined by the manufacturer. 420 The required steam relieving capacity in pounds per hour, of the safety relief valves on a high temperature water boiler shall be determined by dividing the maximum output in British thermal units at the boiler nozzle obtained by the firing of any fuel for which the unit is designed by one thousand (one British thermal unit equals 1.055 x 10 to the 3rd power joules). 3. One or more safety valves on the boiler proper shall be set at or below the maximum allowable working pressure. If additional valves are used~ the highest pressure setting shall not exceed the maximum allowable working pressure by more than three percent. The complete range of pressure settings of all the saturated steam safety valves on a boiler shall not exceed ten percent of the highest pressure to which any valve is set. Pressure setting of safety relief valves on high temperature water boilers may exceed this ten percent range. 4. For a forced-flow steam generator with no fixed steam steamline and waterline, equipped with automatic controls and protective interlocks responsive to steam pressure, safety valves may be installed in accordance with the following, as an alternative: a. One or more power-actuated pressure-relieving valves shall be provided in direct communication with the boiler when the boiler is under pressure and shall receive a control impulse to open when the maximum allowable working pressure at the superheater outlet is exceeded. The total combined relieving capacity of the power-actuated telievb~ pressure-relieving valves shall be not less than ten percent of the maximum design steaming capacity of the boiler under any operating condition as determined by the manufacturer. The valves shall be located in the pressure part system where they will relieve the overpressure. An isolating stop valve of the outside screw and yoke type may be installed between the power-actuating pressure-relieving valve and the boiler to permit repairs provided an alternate power-actuated pressure-relieving valve of the same capacity is so installed as to be in direct communications with the boiler. b. Spring-loaded safety valves shall be provided, having a total combined relieving capacity, including that of the power-actuated pressure-relieving valve installed under subsection~ subdivision a, of not less than one hundred percent of the maximum designed steaming capacity of the boiler, as determined by the manufacturer. In this total no credit in excess of thirty percent of the total relieving capacity shall be allowed for the power-actuated pressure relieving valves actually installed. Any or all of the spring-loaded safety valves may be set above the 421 maximum allowable working pressure of the parts to which they are connected but the set pressures shall be such that when all these valves (together with the power-actuated pressure-relieving valves) are in operation the pressure will not rise more than twenty percent above the maximum allowable working pressure of any part of the boiler, except for the steam piping between the boiler and the prime mover. c. When stop valves are installed in the water-steam flow path between any two sections of a forced-flow steam generator with no fixed~ steamline and waterline. (1) The power-actuated pressure relieving valve required by sttbsection..., subdivision a shall also receive a control impulse to open when the maximum allowable working pressure of the component, having the lowest pressure level upstream to the stop valve, is exceeded. (2) The spring-loaded safety valve shall be located to provide the pressure protection requirements of sttbsection..., sttbdivisions subdivision b or c. (3) A reliable pressure-recording device shall always be in service and records kept to provide evidence of conformity to the above requirements. 5. All safety valves or safety relief valves shall be so constructed that the failure of any part cannot obstruct the free and full discharge of steam, and water from the valve. Safety valves shall be of the direct spring-loaded pop type, with seat inclined at any angle between forty-five and ninety degrees, inclusive to the centerline of the spindle. The coefficient of discharge of safety valves shall be determined by actual steam flow measurements at a pressure not more than three percent above the pressure at which the valve is set to blow. 6. Safety valves or safety relief valves may be used which give any opening up to the full discharge capacity of the area of the opening of the inlet of the valve, provided the movement of the valve is such as not to induce lifting of water in the boiler. 7. Deadweight or weighted-lever safety valves or safety relief valves shall not be used. 8. For high temperature water boilers safety relief valves shall be used. Such valves shall have a closed bonnet. For purposes of selection, the capacity rating of such safety relief valves shall be ixpressed in terms of actual. steam flow determined on the same basis as for safety valves. In 422 addition~ the safety relief valves shall be capable of satisfactory operation when relieving water at the saturation temperature corresponding to the pressure at which the valve is set to blow. 9. A safety valve or safety relief valve over three inches [76.20 millimetet millimeters] in size, used for pressure greater the fifteen pounds per square inch gauge [1.03 kilopascals], shall have a flanged inlet connection or a welding-end inlet connection. The dimensions of flanges subjected to boiler pressure shall conform to the applicable American standards. History: Amended effective July 1, 1991. Implemented: NDCC 65-12-08 92-04-05-14. Feedwater valves and piping. 1.

When two or more boilers are fed from a common source, there shall also be a globe or regulating valve on the branch to each boiler located between the check valve and the source of supply. Whenever globe valves are used on feed piping, the inlet shall be under the disc of the valve. On single boiler-turbine unit installations, the boiler feed shutoff valve may be located upstream from-the boiler feed check valve. 2. When the supply line to a boiler is divided into branch feed connections and all such connections are equipped with stop and check valves, the stop and check valves in the common source may be omitted. 3. If a boiler is equipped with duplicate feed arrangements, each such arrangement shall be equipped as required by these rules. 4. A combination stop-and-check valve in which there is only one seat and disc and a valve stem is provided to close the valve when the stem is screwed down, shall be considered only as a stop valve, and a check valve shall be installed as otherwise provided. 5. Where an connected the feed the inlet economizer or other feedwater-heating device is directly to the boiler without intervening valves, valves and check valves required shall be placed on of the economizer or feedwater-heating device. 6. The recirculating return line for a high temperature water boiler shall be provided with the same stop valve, or valves, required by section 92-04-05-13, sub.sect ion 1 for the rna in 423 boiler and the required stop valve or valves is optional.
