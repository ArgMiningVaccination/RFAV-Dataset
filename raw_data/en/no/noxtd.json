Read about more fundamental and clinical research breakthroughs at the Emory [Lab Land](http://www.emoryhealthsciblog.com/) blog. HIV/AIDS The example of the \"Berlin patient,\" the only person ever cured of HIV infection, has energized HIV/AIDS researchers around the world. They are exploring a variety of tactics to attack the HIV reservoir in infected people, ranging from gene editing to \"kick and kill.\" A [host of researchers at Emory/Yerkes National Primate Research Center](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2016/06/ciar_nhp_grant/) are among those pushing this forward. This past year, an Emory/NIAID team led by Aftab Ansari, PhD, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine, showed that a gentle, antibody-based approach [could suppress SIV infection in macaques](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2016/10/ansari_siv_science/) for extended periods, which [surprised many](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/10/antibody-treatment-surprisingly-cures-monkeys-hiv-infection) in the field. The human test of this approach is now underway at the National Institutes of Health. On the preventive vaccine side, a large scale efficacy study [recently began in South Africa](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/first-new-hiv-vaccine-efficacy-study-seven-years-has-begun), the first in seven years. Atlanta-vased GeoVax's Emory-rooted technology [continues to advance in clinical studies](https://www.geovax.com/news-events/entry/2016/10/20/geovax-hiv-vaccine-clinical-data-presented-at-hivr4p-conference.html). Further back in the pipeline, Yerkes researchers are testing innovative approaches, such as a [milk-bacteria-based mucosal vaccine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4637245/) from the lab of Rama Amara, PhD, and the [potent nanoparticle adjuvants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27928002) developed by Bali Pulendran, PhD, and his group. Zika Despite the World Health Organization's declaration in November that the public health emergency is over, Zika infection is still driving brain-related birth defects in several countries. Expect to hear more about Zika epidemiology and vaccine research, [including from Emory investigators](http://www.news.emory.edu/stories/2016/06/mulligan_zika_travelers/index.html), this year. In contrast with HIV, which seems to escape from almost anything humans, or their immune systems throw at it, Zika is doable, scientists think. At an Emory [Emory](http://www.cfar.emory.edu/vdc/calendar/sep.php) talk in September, Harvard's Dan Barouch made the case that Zika is a slam dunk, immunologically. Two big questions remain: [does dengue get in the way](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/46434/title/Zika-and-Dengue-Immunity--A-Complex-Relationship/)? And can vaccine makers test quickly and distribute widely? Fecal transplant for antibiotic-resistant infections Emory physicians have been leaders in developing fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) as a remedy for recurrent Clostridium dificile infection. This form of diarrhea, which can be life-threatening, sometimes arises as a result of antibiotics that wipe out the helpful bacteria that live in the intestines, paving the way for C diff. Now the Emory team (Colleen Kraft, MD; Tanvi Dhere, MD; Aneesh Mehta, MD; and Rachel is testing whether FMT could prevent other antibiotic-resistant infections besides C diff. This [approach will be examined](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02922816) in a group of patients that tends to have a lot of antibiotic exposure: kidney transplant recipients. The team's first publication on this topic from 2014 is [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4350815/). Electrical stimulation of the brain to enhance memory At Emory, physicians have led efforts to develop [deep brain stimulation](http://entice.emory.edu/index.html) to treat Parkinson's, epilepsy, and treatment-resistant depression. Now experiments are underway to test whether similar techniques can [enhance](http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/index.html#%21/4071/presentation/31210) memory. To be sure, there already have been some reports on transcranial (that is, non-invasive) electrical stimulation to enhance memory, enough that some neurologists have [published a warning](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2016/july/neuroscience-researchers-cauti) to the [\"do it yourself\" community](https://www.wired.com/2014/05/diy-brain-stimulation/). Additional 2017 topics to watch Watch for additional key topics that could capture attention in 2017, including testing of immunotherapy in additional types of cancer such as [breast cancer](http://www.emoryhealthsciblog.com/immunotherapy-triple-negative-breast-cancer/), the prospect of customizing a cancer patient's diet "}
