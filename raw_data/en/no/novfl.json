Its clinic in Dadar, Mumbai is one of the biggest Homeopathic corporate branches in Asia. And the impetus behind starting the advanced chain of Homeopathic clinics for promoting wellness among people is none other than Dr More Raghu Prasad, who has carved a niche for himself as a renowned and well-known homeopathic physician. Furthermore, he has earned a name for pioneering research in homeopathic medicine for incurable diseases. The vision of Namma is to make India a disease-free country, and it has a deep connection with Dr Prasad's growing years in a rural area. He witnessed the pain of diseased people very closely with no facilities available for treatment. The experience stirred his conscience and paved the way for pursuing the subject of homeopathy in the later part of his life. He completed his Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery and started Namma Homeopathy to provide a low-cost and effective treatment to the diseased. Namma Homeopathy is an integrated health system and emphasises treating patients for all chronic problems and incurable conditions like infertility, diabetes, thyroid disorders, PCOD, allergies, asthma, psoriasis, vitiligo, back pain, varicose veins, hair loss, joint pains, gastritis, piles, migraines, anxiety, depression and sexual problems. Highlighting more on the subject, Dr Prasad says, \"At Namma, what comes first is an inclusive approach. The name 'NAMMA' means 'ours', and it has been coined to align with our belief that the responsibility of creating a healthy society is 'ours'. It motivates us to act with conscience, perform responsibly, and function with integrity. We have a team of 50+ highly qualified and talented doctors in the research department at Bangalore researching new medicines and formulas for treating incurable diseases, including the Immunogenic Miasmatic 6th Generation Homeopathic Medicines.\" In Immunogenic Miasmatic 6th Generation Homeopathic Treatment, the Medicines act in the immune cells, which improves the immunity power, which is called immunogenic. The medicines work on the disease's root cause removing the causative factor, which is called miasmatic. It acts according to the new generation's present lifestyle and environmental condition, which is called the 6th generation. After a lot of research on new diseases, viruses, bacteria, pandemics, and present lifestyle conditions, Dr Prasad's research team developed this treatment method, and it has successfully treated chronic diseases at their clinics. \"Research Department plays an important role in treating patients at Namma Homeopathy. Our doctors' research considers the disease pattern, cause, symptom and condition. We have researched a new formula called Advanced Nano Genetic Constitutional medicines, which has helped patients treat diseases from cold to cancer. Its effectiveness has also been found in treating different kinds of arthritis, diabetes, varicose veins, asthma, infertility, and autoimmune disorders. A lot of effort is put into offering the best to our patients without any side effects and with a complete solution. Namma Homeopathy medicines can make a patient better emotionally and mentally,\" adds Dr Prasad.
