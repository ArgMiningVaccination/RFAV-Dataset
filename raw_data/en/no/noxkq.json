The new research put yoga head-to-head against physical therapy and found the two were [equally good at restoring function and reducing the need for pain medication over time](http://time.com/4825261/back-pain-yoga-physical-therapy/). In the new study, [published in Annals of Internal Medicine](http://annals.org/aim/article/2633223/yoga-physical-therapy-education-chronic-low-back-pain), a group of 320 people did 12 weeks of yoga or physical therapy, or they simply received a book and newsletters about coping with back pain. People in the active treatment groups reported that their pain was less intense than it was at the start of the study and that they were able to physically move more. Some were also able to reduce, or even stop, their pain medications. Those improvements stuck around for a full year after the study was over. This research is unique because the people in the study were racially diverse, and most were from low-income families. Many had pre-existing medical conditions. That's important, say the researchers, because chronic back pain -- which affects about 10% of U.S. adults -- has a greater impact on minorities and people of lower socioeconomic status. "}
