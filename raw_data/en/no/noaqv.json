The Center for Rural Health at the University of North Dakota School ofMedicfna would like to acknowledge the contributions of individuals andorganizations for their patience and assistance in the development preparationof Rural Health Abstracts and Citations. Ira Moscovice, Ph.D. of theUniversity of Minnesota and Sam Cordes, Ph.D. of the University of Wyomingwere especially helpful in the formative stages of the project.The membersof The Center's National Advisory Group ware also quite helpful in providingus with guidance in the project. Other individuals who devoted time andeffort to the project include David Boilard and the staff of the Harley E.French Library of the University of North Dakota Health Sciences programs; andFred Eldridge, a micro-computer consultant with the University's and Terry Stratton of The Rural Health ResearchCenter worked many hours to enter the abstracts and citations. Without theirefforts, the project would continue to be an idea on the shelf. Also, theentire support staff of The Center were always willing to eve just a littlemore to meet the deadlines. Finally, project would not have been possiblewithout the support of The Office of Rural Health Policy, Department of Healthand Human Services and The Bush Foundation of St. Paul, Minnesota. ii PREFACE It should be noted that the articles contained within this bibliography arenot annotated. That is, the abstracts of the peer-reviewed journal articlesare reprinted verbatim. In addition, many of the current rural healthpublications were in the form of short articles which appeared in varioustrade journals (i.e., Hospitals). Since these types of articles (usually fivepages or less) generally do not have abstracts, only the citation of thearticle is listed.As with any project of this nature, there are certain caveats andclarifications for the reviewer to note. First, there are some articles inthe abstracted sections that do in fact have abstracts; the reprints of thesearticles were simply late in arriving at The Center and, as a result, did notallow us the opportunity to include their complete abstract.These abstracts,however, will be reprinted in the updated volume at a later date.Secondly,we apologize to those authors whose work should but does not appear in thisvolume.Although we have made every effort to publish a comprehensivebibliography, we recognize that some publications will be inevitablyoverlooked.This is especially true for the most recent publications (late1987 and 1988). Again, we hope to rectify these oversights as this volume isupdated. iii; ALCOHOLISM & DRUG DEPENDENCY AnTRAZTED CITATIONS Aase, J.M.\"The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in American Indians: A High Risk Croup\",Neurobehavioral Toxicology Teratology, (Summer, 1981), 3 (2), 153-156.There are several factors which might increase the risk for FetalAlcohol Syndrome in Native American groups. Cultural influences,fetality, patterns of alcohol consumption and abuse, and perhapsdietary and metabolic differences may be involved. The suspicion ofincreased occurrence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in the Indian populationis presently based upon incomplete or anecdotal evidence, but studiesare now underway te define actual prevalence rates in some of thesegroups. Bach, P.J. and Bornstein, P.H.\"A Social Learning Rationale and Suggestions for Behavioral Treatmentwith American Indian Alcohol Abisers\", Addictive Behaviors, (1981), 6(1), 75-81.Social learning theory postulates that modeling of overt behavior andthe individu4l's cognitive representation of his/her behavior are twofactors causally related to one's actions. Four factors are identifiedas central to alcohol abuse among American Indians:(a) rapidconsumption of alcohol; (b) outmoded models of prolonged intoxication;(c) non-responsibility for intoxicated behavior; and (d) the peerdrinking group. It is demonstrated that each of these four factors canbe adequately accounted fnr using a social learning theory paradigm andconsequently addressed within a behavioral treatment program. Beavvais, F., Oetting, E.R. and Edwards, R.W.\"Trends in Drug Use of Indian Adolescents Living on Reservations:1975-1983, American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse, (1985), 11(3-4), 209-229.Anonymous surveys on drug use were administered to 7th-12h gradestudents in Indian reservation schools. A large number of tribes weresurveyed from 1975 through 1983. Thee is reason to believe theresults are reasonably representative of Indian youth living onreservations.Lifetime prevalence for most drugs is higher than thatfor non-Indian youth throughout this period, and rates for alcohol,marijuana, and inhalants, the most frequently tried drugs, were 1 particularly high. Since 1981 there has been a slight drop, inlifetime prevalence for most drugs. Current use figures show the sametrends, with increasing current use through 1981 and a drop since thattime.Analysis of patterns of drug use, classifying youth according tonumber, type, and depth of involvement with drugs, shows a similartrend, wieh radical increases until 1981 and then a drop in all but Oneof the more serious drug use types. Despite this drop, 53% of Indianyouth would still be classified as \"at risk\" in their drug involvement,compared with 35% of non-Indian youth. Reasons probably relate toseverely detrimental conditions on reservations; unemployment,prejudice, poverty, and lack of optimism about the future. Carpenter, R.A., Lyon, C.A. and Miller, W.R.\"Peer-Managed Self-Control Program for Prevention of Alcohol Abusein American Indian High School Students: A Pilot Evaluation Study\",The International Journal of the Addictions, (February, 1985), 20 (2),299-310.A peer-managed self-control program to teach responsible drinking wastested with 30 American Indian teenagers at high risk for problemdrinking.Students were randomly assigned to three groupsincorporating combinations of self-monitoring, peer-assistedself-control training, and alcnhel education. Significant decreaseswere observed in quantity and frequency of drinking and in peak bloodalcohol levels. These inyrov3ments were maintained at follow-ups of4,9 and 12 months posttre,Itment. Self-report data were corroborated bybreath tests and official records. No group differences were found,indicating that minimal and full program interventions had comparableeffects. Cohen, F.G., Walker, R.D. and Stanley, S.\"The Role of Anthropology in Interdisciplinary Research on IndianAlcoholism and Treatment Outcome\", Journal of Studies on Alcohol,(September, 1981), 42 (9), 836-845.The Seattle Indian Alcoholism Program offers a comprehensiveIndian-oriented rehabilitation system.

Falk, J.L.\"Drug Myth or Biochemistry &Behavior, (1983), 19, 385-391.The acceptability of nonmedical use for a particular drug is a functionof diverse social needs. Drug dependence is due less to intrinsiceffects than to the situation in which drug taking occurs. An 2 addictive level of drug self-administration is a symptom of behavioraltroubles rather than a definition of the trouble itself. The intrinsiceffects of drugs do not in themselves produce either misuse or evokespecific kinds of behavior sich as sexual or aggressive activities.Drugs can, however, cons to ,:unction as discriminative stimuli forsocially sanctioned behavior that would not under other circumstancesbe tolerated.The intrinsic reinforcing potential of an agent evolvesin and domdnates situations in which other reinforcing opportunitiesare either absent or remain unavailable to an individual who isunprepared to exploit them. While certain intrinsic properties of adrug contribute to its potential as a reinforcer (e.g., rapid onset andbrief duration of action), reinforcing efficacy is notorfouslymalleable.It is a function of historic and currently-acting factore.particularly social reinforcers. The importance of physical dependencein the maintenance of drug seeking and taking is mainly unproven andprobably overrated. Situations under which important reinforcers areavailable only in small portions intermittently can induce variousexcessive activities, including an untoward concern with obtaining andusing drugs.Drug dmpendence prevention as a species of environmentaldependence can be best effecLed by either alterations in theintermittent reinforcement situations inducing excessive behavior or byprovidins opportunities and training with respect to reinforcingalternatives other than drugs. Fisher, A.D.\"Alcoholism and Race: The Misaprlication of Both Concepts to NorthAmerican Indians\", The Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology,(1987), 24 (1), 80-98.This paper discusses problems in the use of the concept of race inregard to alcoholism. It discusses the related difficulty of applyingthe bio-genetic model of alcoholism and its transmission to the peoplescommonly called Indians of North America. Because of the nAnifestsociocultural differences among groups of Indians, and because ofmodern views on human bio-genetic variation, it is concluded thit thecommon alcohol abuse problems shared by these groups are most probablyrooted in the groups' relations to the means of production in NorthAmerica, and not in their 'Indianness,' whether biologically orculturally understood. Flores, F.J.\"Alcoholism Treatment and the Relationship of Native American CulturalValues to Recovery\", The International Journal of the Addictions,(November-December, 1985), 20 (11-12), 1707-1726.Native American alcoholics, Native American nonalcoholics, Angloalcoholics, and Anglo staff were compared on demographics and theRokeach Value Survey. The subjects were from an inpatient alcoholtreatment program of a rural community mental health center located 1 3 mile from the bouncUry of a large southwestern Indian reservation.Results from this study provide evidence which supports the poomrprognostic rates of alcoholism recovery for Nattve American alcoholics.Evidence is also presented which suggests that Native Americans' valuesare measurable and significantly different from Anglo values. Whilethe relationship between values and recovery was difficult to discern,it is suggested that the disparity in values between the two culturesis one reason why so few Native American alcoholics remained intreatment. French, L.A. and Hornbuckle, J.\"Alcoholism Among Native Americans: An Analysis\", Social Work, (1980),25, 275-280.This article will approach alcoholism among Native Americans from apsychocultural perspective, which isolates Native American alcoholismfrom alcoholism in society in general. At times, this approach mayappear to be at odds with more conventional etiologies and popularmethods of treating alcoholism that are advocated by psychologists,psychiatrists, social workers, and medical personnel. Nevertheless,this approach fits the current multidisciplinary framework recommendedby the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Guyette, S.\"Selected Characteristics of American Indian Substance Abusers\",The International Journal of the Addictions, (August, 1982), 17 (6),1001-1014.Previous research on American Indian drug abuse has focused ondescriptive, epidemiological studies of youth. There exists a paucityof information concerning adult use, patterns of use, and treatmentapproaches.Data on characteristics of 71 adult American Indians in anurban treatment program are reported, including patterns of use andcultural implications of use. The study results discuss the tendencyfor introduction to drugs fn the street setting and patterns ofcombination drug use. Hill, T.\"Life Styles and Drinking Patterns of Urban Indians\", Journal of DrugIssues, (Spring, 1980), 10, 257-272.This article describes the major life styles and drinking patterns ofthe \"everyday\" Winnebago and Santee Dakota of Sioux City, Iowa. Anintensive research strategy and methodology which included extensiveparticipant observation were used in the collection of data.Throughout the research an attempt was made to see drinking acttvities 4 1 0 in terms of the Indians' cultural systems. In contrast to thereseLrchers who argue that a single set of drinking standards or normsis shared across ethnic and class lines in the United States, it isshown that multiple sets are used by the Indians of Sioux City and thatsome sets define some forms of heavy and frequent drinking asacceptable behavior. Hughes, S.P. and Dodder, R.A.\"Alcohol Consumption Patterns Among American Indian and White CollegeStudents\", Journal of Studies on Alcohol, (September, 1984), 45 (5),433-439.College students in Oklahoma completed a self-administeredquestionnaire to compare the drinking behaviors of culturally activeAmerican Indians (N-34 men and 24 women) and Whites (N-181 men and 250women).Significantly more Indians were classified as orinkers, butthey had begun drinking at a somewhat later age. Both groups indicateda preference for beer, and they were quite similar in quantity andfrequency of beer comsumption. White students reported drinkingsignificantly more wine and distilled spirits, and drinking more oftenin public places, such as bars, pubs, restaurants and parked cars;Indians drank more in their own homes and in the homes of friends.White students tended to cite hedonistic reasons for drinking whereasIndians reported escapist or social reasons and drinking to \"get high.\"Drinking-related problems were reported somewhat more often by Indianstudents, notably so by Indian women. Indians were more inclined toreport the more serious drinking problems of being arrested, blackingout, interference with school or work, and difficulties in humanrelationships. White students more often cited problems of nausea orvomiting, drinking and driving, doing something that was laterregretted and damaging property. It was suggested that the higherIndian arrest rate could be indicative of police bias and that thereports of problem drinking among Indian women be investigated further. Hurlburt, G., Gade, E., and Fuqua, D.\"Personality Differences Between Alcoholics AnonyTT.ous Members andNon-MeMbers\", Journal of Studies on Alcohol, (1984), 45 (2), 170-171.The purpose of this study was to determine whether there arepersonality differences between members of Alcoholics Anonymous andnonmembers. A total of 91 alcoholics who were active members of A.A.and who had completed at least six months of abstinence were matched byrace and sex with 91 alcoholics who had recently completed alcoholismtreatment and who were not A.A. members. Four scales of the EysenckPersonality Questionnaire (EPQ), measuring toughmindness, emotionality,extroversion and \"fakability,\" were administered to both groups. A2 x 2 x 2 multivariate analysis of variance was performed using sex(men, women), race (American Indian, Caucasian) and group (A.A.,non-A.A.) as the independent variables. The main effects of race and 5 group were significant, but none of the interaction effects weresignificant.American Indian alcoholics were significantly moretoughminded than the Caucasians.AA.A. members were significantly moreextroverted and less and emotional than non-members. Jones-Saumty, D.J., and Zeiner, A.R.\"Sociocultural and Psychological Indians Arukoru Kenkyuto Yakubutsu Ison,(December, 1985), 20 (4), 367-374. -The Indian Health Service considers alcoholism to be the major healthproblem of American Indians today. Various factors may contribute tothe problem of American Indian alcohol abuse. Chief among these arepsychological and sociocultural influences. Psychological factors suchas depression, locus of control, and cognitive functioning have beenproven to be useful measures in predicting treatment outcome and riskfor alcohol-related problems.Sociocultural factors such as age, education, ethnic background, andsocioeconomic status have been shown to be related to alcoholism andits concurrent problems. This paper reviews etiological theoriesrelating sociocultural and psychological factors to American Indianalcoholism.We further assess the comparability of an American Indianalcoholic sample on psychological adjustment and sociocultural factorsrelative to major studies in the literature which report similar datafor alcoholics from the general population.

Acomparison of alcohol and drug use among the two groups suggested thatIndian students use alcohol and drugs in a manner similar to that oftheir peers in the same geographical locale and socio-economicbackground.

Hill citessome minor criticisms: exclusion of historical studies; incompletenessof the annotations and subject index.

A specific and critical examination of mortalityand morbidity statistics yields a number of valuable insights to theways of addressing the problem. The current status in many communitiesdictates intervention at three levels. First, high mortality andmorbidity rates must be reduced through creative and innovativeintervention with the social and physical environment. Alcohollegalization and other issues are discussed as distinct possibilities.Second, educational programs are needed to elevate the knowledge ofAmerican Indian communities about alcohol and drug misuse. Educationshould be specifically crAel:ted to impraving ability to deal with earlydevelopmental problems that might lead to misuse. Third, AmericanIndian rehabilitation probrams need to be upgraded and improved bygaining more resources and by using them more effectively. Increaseduse of both traditional tribal strengths and modern treatmentmodalities is promising. Rehabilitation programs may be even moreimportant in the future if mortality reduction programs such as thosedescribed are successful. May, P.A.\"Substance Abuse and American Indians: Prevalence and Susceptibility\",The International Journal of the Addictions, (October, 1982), 17 (7),1185-1209.The use of alcohol and other substances by American Indians hasreceived considerable popular attention over the years. Empirioalstudies of prevalence for all types of substance abuse, however, havegenerally been few and limited in scope. In this paper prevalencestudies among Indians are reviewed and analyzed by comparison with eachother and national studies. In addition, issues important to theresearch of Indian alcohol and drug abuse are discussed. Finally, aspecific scheme of susceptibility is proposed which may explain thepatterns of variation in both tribal and individual substance abuse. 8 Oetting, E.R. and Beauvais, F.\"Drugs and Nat:ie American Ybuth: (Fort Collins: ColaradoState inhalants, stimulants and cocaine.Anti-drug massages may have influemed light users whose use hesdropped, but not heavy users, one in five Indian youth use drugs otherthan marijuana, a rate constant since 1981.Drug use is linked neither to emotional distress nor acculturationstress.It is related to peer drug associations, although lessstrongly than in Anglo youth, and is linked more directly than in Angloyouth to family influence. Root causes may be poverty, prejudice, andlack of social, educational and economic opportunity on reservations. Oetting, E.R., Edwards, R., Goldstein, G.S. and Garcia-Meson, V.\"Drug Use Among Adolecents of Five Southwestern Native AasricanTribes\", The International Journal of the Addictions, (1980), 15 (3),439-445.Drug use by Native American adolescents from five Southwestern tribesis compared wtth a large national sample. Native Americans show higheruse of alcohol, marijuana, and inhalants from the 7th through the 12thgrade.They show lower use of barbituates. Peyote may be seen as lessdangerous then LSD. There are no significant differences for otherdrugs.Cultural characteristics that may influence potential dangerfrom drug use and intervention strategies are noted. Oetting, E.R., Goldstein, G., Beauvais, F. and Edwards, R.Drug Abuse Among Indian Children Interim Report, NIDA Grant1R01-DA01853. (Fort Collins: Colorado State University, 1980.)This interim report on drug use among 9 to 12 year olds is part of aseries of in-depth studies about Native American drug use. Two methodsfor 0)taining drug use information from young children were tried:interviews and paper and pencil surveys. Interviews were too costlyand impractical. A properly constructed survey proved to be morefeasible and reliable.As pert of a continuing study, this project grew out of a series ofprevious studies which focused on drug use by Native Americanadolescents.This review of the studies shows that they have a farhigher rate of use for nearly all drugs than do young people from alarge national sample. By the time these children were 13, when thestudy began, many had already been using drugs for some time. Thisproject, therefore, was planned to develop and test methods forsurveying drug usa by younger children, from 9 to 12 years old. 9 The present study, using a sample of over a thousand Native American 9to 12 year olds, shows that drug use is high among these children.There are no national data for young children, but charts of drug useby age show that by the time these children were 12 years old they hadused marijuana, inhalants, and alcohol more than the average for anational sample cf children who were \"Rich older, 12 to 17 years old.Use of cigarettes is also very hie. and is correlated with other druguse.Many of these young children who are involved heavily with otherdrugs are also beginning to experiment with \"pills\".The survey also included a number of measures of potential correlatesof drug use.The results suggest that all of the following areimportant in understanding drug use among young Native Americanchildren: the community, cultural identification, the family, theschool, peers, emotional problems, expectancy about the future,attitudes toward drugs, and deviant attitudes and behaviors.Copies of statistical appendices to the report are available from:Western Behavioral StudiesDepartment of PsychologyColorado State PsychologicalReports, (1982), 50, 639-646.MRPI profiles of 11 Caucasian, 11 Hispanic American, and 11 AmericanIndian alcoholics were compared. The subjects were chosen randomlyfrom among veterans in treatment for alcoholism at a small VA MedicalCenter.Subjects represented similar secondary diagnoses and did notdiffer significantly In age or education. One-way nonrepeated-measuresanalyses of variance on validity, clinical and the MacAndrewsAlcoholism Scales showed significance only for Scale 2 scores, elevatedfor the Hispanic American group but within the normal range.Examination of dominant highpoint code types in each group indicatedptimarily 4 or 49 for the Caucasians and 24 for the Hispanic Americans.American Indian subjects were more heterogenous with 1, 6, or 9highpoints.Generally, the resultant profiles conform to previouslypublished alcoholic MMPI prototypes, supporting use of the MMPI for thepopulation studied. Ths results do not support development of separateMM2I norns for psychiatric subjects from these minority groups, butcross-validation on a larger sample is requireu. 10 1 Rex, Alcoholism dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) isoenzymephenotypes were determined in autopsy liver samples from 50 NorthAmerican Indians from New Mexico. Forty-six of the 50 livers hadsufficient ADH activity to allow phenotyping at the ADH2 and of the ADH2/3 allele was 0.59 and is the highest thus farreported in any racial population. All 50 livers possessed the ALDH 1isoenzyme which exhibits the greatest anodic mobility on starch gelelectrophoresis at pH 7.6. The results show that ADH and ALDHphenotypes among Americna Indians living in New Mexico are very similarto those of Caucasian populations and quite different from those ofOrientals. Schinke, S.P., Gilchrist, for Preventing Substance Abuse with American Indian Youth\"White Cloud Journal of American Indiar ',Intel Health, (1985), 3 (4),12-18.Primary prevention is an appealing response to substance abuse problemsamong American Indian people. Still, substance abuse preventionprograms developed with Indian people, based on empirical data andoriented toward youth, have not been forthcoming. This paper offersculturally sensitive, scientific strategies for closing gaps in thesubstance abuse prevention research literature. The authors describestrategies of assessment, design, implementation, and evaluation in theservice of preventing substance abuse with American Indian youfh. Eachstrategy is illustrated by the authors' research. The stategies arediscussed relative to their advantages, limits, and research agenda. Schinke, S.P. and Schilling, R.F.\"Pacific Northwest Native American Youth and Smokeless Tobacco Use\",The International Journal of the Addictions, (1987), 22 (9), 881-884.This study examined snuff and chewing tobacco use among Alaska Nativeand American Indian adolescents. Results ihow frequent and early useof smokeless tobacco products. Almost one fifth of all females andclose to one half of all males had used snuff or chewing tobacco onmore than 20 occasions. Weekly smokeless tobacco use was reported by34% of all females and by 42% of all males. By product type, 32.6% ofall subjects had used snuff and 27.8% had chewed tobacco in the pastweek.Among females, over one half of all subjects had used snuff orthewing tobacco before age 10 years. Among males, nearly one half ofthe subjects first usad smokeless tobacco prior to 8 years of age. Fewsubjects had used cigarettes or other smoked tobacco products.1117 Stratton, R.\"Relationship Between Prevalence of Alcohol Problems and SocioeconomicConditions Among Oklahoma Native Americans\", Current Alcohol, (1981),8, 315-325.Oklihoma Indian tribes are ranked according to five problem drinkingindicators and five socioeconomic indices. The relationships betweenthe tribes' prevalence of alcohol problems and socioeconomic conditionspredicted high rates of alcohol problems, but more favorable conditionsdid not predict low rates. Social controls may be more important thansocioeconomic conditions in controlling alcohol problems among OklahomaNative Americans.In a previously published study we found that Native American tribes inOklahoma varied dramatically in the extent to which they suffered fromalcohol problems. In this followup study we have sought explanationfor these large differences by comparing the socioeconomic conditionsof the tribes to their rates of alcohol related problems.The relationship between socioeconomic conditions and alcohol problemshas received considerable attention in the literature. Popham, et al .found that when the price of beverage alcohol relative to averagedisposable (real) income is high, indices of alcohol consumption andalcoholism are usually low, and vice versa. In a similar vein, Edwardset al. suggested that alcoholism is likely to increase the risk ofdeath more in upperclass than in lowerclass alcoholics. On the otherhand, others have blamed economic deprivations for high rates ofproblem drinking, especially among disadvantaged minorities. Pricesuggested that Indian societies which had little access to economicopportunities have more drinking problems than those with great access.Caravedo found that socioeconomic deprivation is a primary factor inboth the etiology and the medical consequences of alcoholism. Tucker, W.B.\"U.S. Ethnic Minorities and Drug Abuse: An Assessment of the Scienceand Practice\", The International Journal of the Addictions, (1985),20 (6 & 7), 1021-1047.Despite the disproportionate use of \"hard drugs\" in certain ethnicminority communities, and the unique patterns of drug abuse in others,many have complained that there remains an absence of attention paid tothe special problems of substance abuse by Afro-Americans, AmericanIndians, Asian-Americans, and Latinos. Furthermore, no comprehensivereview of drug abuse by American ethnic minorities has ever beenundertaken. In response to these concerns, an assessment of the currentstatus of the drug abuse field, relative to ethnic minorities, wasundertaken.The review included delineation of ethnic-specificproblems and the institutional and scientific responses to thoseconcerns.Strategies for addressing inadequacies are proposed. 12 Walker, R.D. and Kivlahan, D.R.\"Definitions, Models, and Methods in Research on Sociocultural Factorsin American Indian Alcohol Use\", Substance and Alcohol Actions Misuse,(1984), 5 (1), 9-19.This paper presents a critical discussion of the definitions,conceptual models, and methodological issues that researchers shouldconsider in studies of sociocultural influences on drinking practicesand problems.In particular, these concerns are related to studies ofAmerican Indian and Alaskan Native people. In an effort to avoidovergeneralized explanatory statements, it is recommended that effortsbe made to study more specific aspects of such loosely defined terms asculture, alcoholism, and \"Indianness.\" Research in this area mightusefully be guided by parsimonious conceptual models developed andinvestigated in the dominant culture; however the extent to whichrelationships observed within one group generalized to another groupremains an empirical question. Operationalizing variables andcollecting valid data cannot be assumed to have equal applicabilitywith different subgroups. By remaining sensitive to the methodologicalimplications of sociocultural differences, investigators can moreaccurately clarify the processes by which complex biological,psychological, and sociocultural factors influence alcohol use andmisuse in any individual or group. Weibel-Orlando J., Weisner, T. and Long, J.\"Urban and Rural Indian Drinking Patterns: Implications forIntervention Policy Development\", Substance and Alcohol ActionsMisuse, (1984), 5 (1), 45-57.Alcohol misuse has taken on epidemic proportions among some (but notall) American Indian populations. Cultural, psychological,socioeconomic and genetic etiologies have been offered to explain thissocial phenomenan. This study identifies the relattve strengths ofthese causal models to differentiate among both current and lifelongdrinking career patterns. Further, antecedent and drinking leveldifferences between urban and rural Indian populations in Californiaare described. Age, sex, level of stress as measured by the CornellMedical Index, percent of Indian ancestry and level of drinking in thefamily of origin are less powerful predictors of drinking level.Policy implications of these findings include; the development ofintervention programs which involve members of the patient's supportnetwork, accelerated interventions in rural Indian communitie3 andmid-level interventions among younger and less and 'Teetotaling':Drinking Levels and Styles in an Urban American Indian Population\",Journal of Studies on Alcohol, (May, 1984), 45 (3), 237-250.The differences between abstainers, moderate drinkers and heavydrinkers were examined in American Indians living in Lls Angeles,California.Equal numbers of these three groups (total N-.155) wereselected from four tribal groups: Siouan-sleeking, Navaho, FiveCivilized Tribes (of eastern Oklahoma origin) and indigenous Californiatribes.The relative predictive powers of sociostructural, culturaland psychological variables In accounting for current drinking levelswere then assessed. The results indicated that, much as fornon-Indian populations, heavy drinkers were more likely to have hadheavy-drinking models in the family of origin, to be men and to scorehigh on psychophysiological stress indices. Socioeconomic status andtraditionalism were found to be weaker predictors of drinking level.Differences in drinking styles over individuals' lifetimes and betweentribes were also studied. Ethnographic observations, case vignettesand statistical summaries of the sample by tribe and by drinking levelshowed that tribal origins, age and socioeconomic status influenceddrinking style and attitudes toward alcoelol, even if they did notpredict the current drinking level of the subjects. Westermeyer, J. and Neider, J.\"Depressive Symptoms Among Native American Alcoholics at the Time of a10-Year Follow-Up\", Alcoholism (NY), (September-October, 1984), 8 (5),429-434.Much has been written about alcoholism among Native Americans, itsprevalence, characteristics, and treatment. !depression has receivedrelatively little attentior in this population, however. This issomewhat unexpected in view of evidence suggesting that NativeAmericans experience frequent and major losses irom premature death offamily members, loss of children to state guardianship and foster care,loss of job, loss of freedom due to arrest and incarceration, and lossof prestige in the majority society. In this study, data on depressivesymptoms were collected from 33 Native American persons at the time ofa 10-year f^llow-up. They had been admitted for alcoholism at theUniversity of Minnesota Hospitals. Westermeyer, J. and Peake, E.\"A Ten-Year Follow-Up of Alcoholic Native Americans in Minnesota\",American Journal of Psychiatry, (February 1983), 140(2), 189-194,In a 10-year follow-up of 45 alcoholic American Indians, 42 (93%) werelocated.Seven had been abstinent for 2 or more years, 26 still haddrinking problems despite repeated treatment, and 9 had died. Theauthors hypothesize that the absence of stable employment and a stable 14 marriage or family environment reduced the efficacy of treatmentefforts in this population. Those who achieved 2 years of absttnencewere characterized by stable employment and/or marriage, as well as bystronger interpersonal relationships and less depression than theothers.The recovered subjects provided considerable help to otheralcoholic persons in addition to serving as positive role models. Whitley, G.P.'Reservation Versus Nonreservation American Indians' Loci of Controland Psychological Reports, (April, 1980), 46(2), 431-434.Rotter's Internal-External Control Scale was administered to 85 adultAmerican Indians. The reservation group included 44 subjects, 18 ofwhom were heavy drinkers. The nonreservation group was composed of 41subjects, 15 of whom were heavy drinkers. Subjects living on thereservation bad scores more internal than subjects living outside thereservation.Heavy drinkers were more internal than light drinkers. 1521 NON-ABSTRACTED CITATIONS Andre, J.\"Innovative, Community-Oriented Approaches Seen as Essential toTreatment and Prevention of Indian Alcoholism\", NM'S HealthRepresentative, (September, 1981), 2 (15).

In the past ten years in the EasternCanadian Arctic attempts have been made to alleviate the problem andphysicians, avdiologists and educators have been involved in treatment,training programs and research with varying degrees of success.In the last few years the Quebec Inuit have become mere aware of theseproblems and have asked for assistance. Whatever evolves, Inuitco-operation and advice is essential; their cultural identity must berespected if any project is to be successful.In February, 1984, a program outline working paper entitled \"Programfor Combatting Hearing Disorders in the Inuit Population of NouveauQuebec* was circulated by Projet Nord-Laval University. The goal ofthe program WAS \"to ensure the integrity of hearing for the Inuit bypreventing hearing loss, identifying hearing loss and minimizing theeffects of hearing loss\".In October, 1984 a Pilot Project involving the school population atKuujjuaraapik was carried out involving personnel from the ProjetNord-Laval Univdrsity, the Department of Otolaryngology and the Schoolof Human Communication Disorders-McGill University. Beiser, M.\"Mental of American Indian 4nd Alaska Native Children: SomeEpidemiological Perspectives\", White Cloud Journal, (1981), 2 (2),37-47.The large proportion of the American Indian population which is underthe age of 15 indicates that behavior scientists need to know moreabout the psychological functioning of children. Epidemiologicalstudies done thus far have had a number of limitations. Analysis ofthese studies suggests future directions for research. An effortshould be made to empirically define and standardize diagnosticcategories.Complex behavior should be based on the observations ofpeople representing multiple perspectives on the child. Studies shouldalso look at mentally healthy behavior of Indian children.21 Beiser, M., and Attneave, C.L.\"Mental Disorders Among Native American Children: Rates and RiskPeriods for Entering Treatment\", American Journal of Psychiatry,(February, 1982), 139 (2), 193-198.The authors compared national data on use of outpatient mental healthservices by Native American children in 1974 with 1969 national data onnon-Indian children. At all ages except 5 to 9 years, Indians were athigher risk for entering the ,.reatment system than were non-Indianchildren.In addition, utilization patterns varied by age and sex.The authors discuss possible reasons for the higher risk ratesdemonstrated by Indian children; these include schools and the effectsof poverty. Broudy, D.W. and May, P.A.\"Demographic and Epidemiologic Transition Among the Navajo Indians\",Social Biology, (1980), 30 (1), 1-16.The theories of demographic transition and epidemiologic transitionprovide vehicles for the examination of Navajo fertility, mortality,and growth patterns. The Navajo population is found to be growingrapidly due to decreased mortality and fertility rates which havedeclined but remain twice as high as U.S. rates. Infectious diseasesare now less important as a factor in mortality, but remain a problemlarger than that in the overall United States. Rates of death fromdegenerative diseases have not yet become a great problem among theNavajo, but mortality from social pathology (accidents, alcoholism,suicide, homicide, and cirrhosis of the liver) is considerably higherthan that in the general United States. Discussion of each of thesespecific behaviors and possible etiological factors are presented. Ingeneral, it can be said that the Navajo Indians represent a group whichis in the tranaitional stage of both the demographic and epidemiologictransition, although some exceptions are noted. Camazine, S. and Bye, R.A.\"A Study of the Medical Ethnobotany of the Zuni Indians of New Mexico\",Journal of Ethnopharmacology, (December, 1980), 2 (4), 365-388.This paper examines the medical ethnobotany of the Zuni Indians ofwest-central New Mexico. Historically, these people were hunters andgatherers, and later, farmers and sheepherders. They developed anextensive knowledge of the local flora and a complex religious rite andsystem of medical practice. Now, as customs and values of Westernsocieties encroach upon their lifestyle, the Zuni's knowledge of themedicinal use of plants is in danger of being forgotten.Field work conducted during the summers of 1977 and 1978 with the Zuniinvolved interviews with 27 Zuni medicine men and elders and thecollection of 138 plant species. For 49 species a medicinal use was 22 described.These remedies were examined in detail to determine theirpharmacological and psysiological action and their culturalsignificance.A total of 31 medicinal plants collected in this studywere not mentioned in the Zuni ethnobotanical study by Stevenson over60 years earlier. This may reflect a difficulty in recording all theplant remedies of a culture rather than an acquisition of new remediessince that time. The use of herbal remedies today and the knowledge oftheir use in the past has diminished. Chovan, M.J. and Chovan, W.\"Stressful Events and Coping Responses Among Older Adults in TwoSociocultural Groups\", The Journal of Psychology, (1984), 119 (3),253-260.In this study of the way 32 men and woman between the ages of 60 to 90coped with stressful situations, two instruments were used; the LifeExperiences Survey and the Ways of Coping Checklist. Overall,health-related concerns were more frequently reported by older adultsthan any other stressful event. When coping responses were categorizedaccording to four modes--intrapsychic, inaction, direct action, andinformation seaking--the Appalachian group was found to use theinformation-seeking mode; the Cherokee group, ehe intrapsychic mode.Significant differences were found between males and females in copingmodes and life-stress, particularly health-related stress, and thecoping modes of intrapsychic and information seeking. Coulehan, J., Grant, Reisinger, K., P. Rogers, K.D., andKaltenbach, C.\"Acute Rheumatic Heart Disease on the NavajoReservation, 1962-77\", Public Health Reports, (1980), 95 (1), 62-68.Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) occurmore frequently among lower socioeconomic groups than among other NorthAmerican populations. In recent decades, a marked decline in attackrates for ARF has been observed in Europe and the United States.However, no studies of ARF among American Indians have been reported.The Navajo Indian Reservation comprises about 25,000 square miles ofsemi-arid canyon and plateau country in northeastern Arizona,northwestern New Mexico, and southern Utah. The Navajo live undercrowded family conditions and in a relatively harsh environment. Upperrespiratory infections and pharyngitis considered to be streptococcalin etiology are common among Navajo children. Because the Navajohave virtually no coronary artery disease, RHD is the major cause ofcardiac morbidity and mortality among them. 23 To ascertain the frequency, demography, and clinical characteristics ofARF and RHD among the Navajo, all records of patients hospitalizedbecause of either condition over a 16-year period were reviewed. Also,the effect of a streptococcal disease control program was observed overa 3-year Public Health, (April, 1986), 76 (4), 412-414.We found that from 1976 through 1983 the incidence of acute myocardialinfarction (AMI) diagnosed among Navajo Indians remained low (0.5 per1,000 persons age 30 years or more), although thee incidence in womenappears to be climbing. Navajo AMI patients are more likely to behypertensive and diabetic than age- and sex-matched patients withgallbladder disease. Twenty-four percent die within one month of AMI. Enarson, D.A., and Grzybowski, S.\"Incidence of Active Tuberculosis in the Native Population of Canada\",Canadian Medical Association Journal, (May, 1986), 134 (15),1149-1152.We enalyzed the incidence rates of active tuberculosis reported between1970 and 1981 in three groups of people born in Canada; Inuit,registered Indians and others (mainly of European origin). While therates of tuberculosis were quite low in the last group, whichconstitutes about 82% of the population of Canada, they were 16 timeshigher among Indians and 24 times higher among Inuit. Some 20 to 30years ago the Inuit had the highest recorded rate of tuberculosis inthe world; with an intensive program the tate decreased sharply. Sucha program has not been implemented among the Indian population, and theincidence rate has not decreased as rapidly. A major effort isrequired to satisfactorily control tuberculosis among Indians. Inaddition, we must not allow our efforts to slacken in the contol oftuberculosis among the Inuit. Evers, S.E. and Rand, C.G.\"Morbidity in Canadian Indian and Non-Indian Children in the First Yearof Life\", Canadian Medical Association Journal, (February, 1982), 126(3), 249-252.A cohort study of health status was undertaken to determine thepatterns of morbidity in the first year of life for Indian andnon-Indian infants living in southern Ontario. The annual incidence ofoffice-reported health problems was 8.0 episodes for the 99 Indians and4.5 for the 316 non-Indians studied. The risk of illness of most 2430 diagnostic categories was more than 1.5 times greater and the rate ofhospital admission 4 times greater for the Indian infants.There was no difference between the two cohorts in the rates of visitsto hospital emergency departments. The main cause of illness in bothcohorts was respiratory tract infection; lower respiratory tractinfections, particularly pneumonia, were a major health problem amongthe Indian infants. Only 37% of the Indian infants compared with 68%of the non-Indian infants attended five or more well-baby examinations.Part of the difference in morbidity between the Indian and non-Indianinfants may be attributed to environmental factors, health carebehaviour and geographic constraints. Fritz, W. and D'Arcy, C.\"Comparisons:Indian and Non-Indian Use of Psychiatric ServicesTM,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, (April, 1982), 27 (3), 194-203.Major differences were found between the Saskatchewan Indian andnon-Indian populations in regard to the prevalence of, psychiatricdisorders, their rates of treatment and the mix of impatient andoutpatient services they receive. Diagnostic and treatment differencesbetween the two populations were more pronounced in the \"private\" thanin the \"public\" treatment sector. These findings are discussed inrelation to demographic, socio-economic and cultural differencesbetween Indian and non-Indian populations and to size andorganizational differences Native American School Children\",Hypertension, (November-December, 1980), 2 (6), 744-749.In 307 Native American (NA), 1784 black (B), and 7777 white (W)children in grades 1, 2, and 3 in Minneapolis schools (99% overallresponse rate), blood pressure (BP) was measured supine in the rightarm after 5 minutes' rest by trained technicians using a random zero BPdevice.In addition, height, weight, pulse rate, and triceps skinfoldthickness were measured. Among children aged 6 through 9 years, NAchildren had slightly higher systolic BP (SBP) than 13 or W childrenoverall (mean SBP: NA 106, B 104, W 105 mm Hg) and for nearly all agesex groups.In contrast, Phase 4 and 5 diastolic BP (DBP) wereconsistently lower in NA children (mean DBP4 :NA 64, B 69, W 67 mmHg); NA children also had lower pulse rates, greater pulse pressures,similar or slightly lower mean BP, similar height, greater weight, bodymass index, and triceps skinfold. Multiple regression analysesrevealed that the slightly higher SBP in NA children was explainedal=lst entirely by greater ponderosity. However, the lower DBP couldno'.. be explained statistically by any of the variables measured(Hypertention 2: 744-749, 1980). 253J. Hagey, R.\"The Phenomenon, the Explanations and the Responses: MetaphorsSurrounding Diabetes in Urban Canadian Indians\", Social Science AndMedicine, (1984), 18 (3), 265-272.Type II Diabetes is a growing problem among Indian people in Canada.Ojibway and Cree leaders in Toronto collaborated with the University ofToronto, Faculty of Nursing, to develop the Native Diabetes Prieogram.A key to the success of the program was seen by Natives to be the story'Nanabush and the Pale Stranger,' which seemed to put into perspectivethe nature of diabetes as a phenomenon. It provided explanations forit and answered numerous questions (non-biological) associated with thedisease and indicated appropriate coping strategies. Yet formalmethods of analyzing the story would not reveal its benefit as there isno explicit reference to many of the questions it implicitly answers.Metaphoric relationships are illuminated which may provide anunderlying rationality to the narrative. Cultural expression isadvocated as a source of making meaningful and tolerable fhat which isfeared and avoided; of generating metaphors which make healthinformation understandable and useful, by providing resolutions toconflicting systems of belief. Information does not come in discreetingestible particles of fact. All information is a sort of propagandain that it is tied to deeper meaning structures. Clinicians arearchitects of meaning construction. Clinical research and practicerequires a knowledge of the folk and professional construction ofmeaning around so-called factual information. Hoy, W.E., Megill, D.M., and Hughson, M.D.\"Epidemic Renal Disease of Unknown Etiology in the Zuni Indians\",American Journal of Kidney Diseases, (July, 1987), 9 (6), 485-96.An epidemic of renal disease is occurring among the Zuni Indians inwestern New Mexico. In 1985, 1.6% of Zunis had clinically recognizedrenal disease and 1% had renal insufficiency. The incidence ofend-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 1984 and 1985 was 14 times the ratefor US whites, and three times the rates of other Indians in ESRDnetwork 6.One third of the cases of renal disease and ESRD is due totype 2 diabetes, but the etiology ef disease in most of the remainderis unknown.Affected subjects range from early childhood to old age.Early signs are hematuria, mild to moderate proteinuria, normal BP, andlow total hemolytic complement, normal or low C3 and C5 levels, inabout 40% of the cases. The clinical course varies from benign torapidly progressive renal failure. Biopsies usually reflect animmune-complex mediated mesangiopathic glomerulonephrltis, with IgA,IgG, IgM, and C3 variably present in the mesangium. In some cases,there is a very strong familial pattern suggesting autosomal dominantinheritance or a marked communal exposure effect. This may be agenetic disease educed by the consanguinity in the ethnicallyhomogeneous Zuni population. Mesangiopathic renal disease is common insome Oriental populations, and this phenomenon may reflect the American 26 1 3 2. Indians' Oriental ancestry. This disease may also be due to toxicexposures related to jewelry-naking, potting, Zuni water, Zuni salt, orherbal or other products used for medicinal or religious purposes.This epidemic is creating much morbidity and generating huge costs forESRD treatment. Further study is needed to better understand itsetiology. Hunter, K.I, Linn, M.W., and Stein, S.R.\"Sterilization Among American Indian and Chicano Mothers\",International Quarterly of Community Health and Educatior, (1983-84),4 (4), 343-352.In a large study concerning family size and birth control among womenfrom five cultures in the Miami, Florida, area, it was noted that 60percent of the Miccosukee and Seminole Indians having five or morechildren were surgically sterile. Compared with the incidence forwhites (30%) and a similar socio-economic group of Chicanos (20%), theincidence among Indian women seemed highly inflated. To examine whythis should be so and whether or not there were negative effects ofsuch sterilization, analyses examined both pre- and post-operativedifferences between the Indians and a comparison group of Chicanos.Though there ware significant cultural differences found for the women,these differences did not interact significantly in predictingcomplications. Factors which may have contributed to the greaterincidence of tubal ligation among Indian women are explored. Lang, G.C.\"Diabetics and Health Care in a Sioux Community\", Human Organization,(1985), 44 (3), 251-260.Native American populations are increasingly being confronted withhigher prevalence rates of chronic conditions, sometimes referred to as\"diseases of modernization,\" such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension,and coronary artery disease. Diabetes mellitus (Type II) has emergedduring the past four decades as a major health concern. Compliancewith diabetic therapeutic regimens is difficult for all diabetics (df.Edkerling and Kohrs 1984). In Native American communities, it isimportant for non-Native American health workers to obtain anunderstanding of the social traditions and cultural meanings ofbehaviors that will be affected by therapeutic regimens. This paperexamines perceptions of diabetes and prescribed therapeutic regimens bydiabetics and their families in a Sioux community. Views on foods,diet, awl the dietary change that has occurred over the past centuryand a half may help explain patients' acknowledged low compliance withdiabetic diets. A distinction is made between \"way back\" \"Indian foods.\" Social and symbolic aspects food-ways may be drawn upon by dieticians and healthworkers to promote awareness of the potential benefits of lower-caloriediets.The roles of a recent Diabetes Program at the Indian Health 2733 Service Clinic and of the Tribal Health Office are considered withrespect to devaloping community-based health objectives. Leonard, B., Leonard, C., and Wilson, R.\"Zuni Diabetes Project\", Pdblic Health Reports, (May-June, 1986), 101(3), 282-288.Widespread type II diabetes among North American Indians and certainother populations is a relatively recent medical phenomenon. Increasedprevalence of diabetes Pppears to be related to sudden cultural shiftstoward sedentary 1ifes4y10 and increased caloric intake. Thesechanges, super-imposed on a genetic predisposition to diabetes, pose acommunity health threat to the Zuqi and similar populations.Regular aerobic exercise is clearly beneficial to most type IIdiabetics.The key public health issue is how to establish communityparticipation in effective aerobic activity. The Zuni DiabetesProject, fully described here, serves as a model in this respect. Longstaffe, S. Postl B., Kao, H., Nicolle, L., and Ferguson, C.A.\"Rheumatic Fever in Native Children in Manitoba\", Canadian MedicalAssociation Journal, (September, 1982), 127, 497-498.From data reported to a central computer file, cases of rheumatic feverin persons under 17 years of age in Manitoba were reviewed. Althoughthe overall incidence of the disease declined throughout the studyperiod, Jan. 1, 1970 to July 1, 1979, the rates per 100,000 populationwere higher overall (36) and for non-natives (29) and much higher fornatives (126) than average rates in urban centres around the world.Rates of death and readmission showed that the disease was also moresevere in the native Manitoba children. Lum, M.K.W.\"Decline in Infant Mortality of Alaska Yupik Eskimos from 1960 to1980\", Public Health Reports, (May-June 1986) 101 (3), 309-314.A 1960-62 study of southwestern Alaskan Eskimos documented an infantmortality rate of 102.6 deaths per 1,000 live births, four timesgreater than that of U.S. whites. In 1980-81, 20 years after eheoriginal study, a similar cohort was identified in this population srthat changes in infant mortality and other birth characteristics couldbe examined.Average birth weight and the amount of prenatal care received by themothers increased from 1960 to 1980. Birth weight and prenatal visitswere positively correlated. Results of the followup also revealed a1980-81 infant mortality rate--17.1 deaths per 1,000 live births--that 283 4 was less than a fifth of the 1960-62 rate and no longer significantlydifferent from the national rate. Major changes associated with thedecrease in mortality during the first 28 days of life (neonatalmortality) were a significant increase in the proportion of infantsborn in hospitals and an associated decrease in the number of deaths ofinfants weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth. The reduction inmortality during thie rest of the first year of life was related to adecrease in deaths due to infectious diseases, particularly measles andpertusis.Changes in infant mortality reflect the increasedavailability of health care in this region, improved immunizationprograms, and the establishment of the Bethel Prematernal Home inBethel, AK. Manson, S.M., Walker, R.\"Psychiatric AssessmentNatives\", Hospital and Kivlahan, D.R.and Treatment of American Indians and AlaskaCommunity Psychiatry, (February, 1987), 38 (2), It is widely recognized that the cultural uniqueness of AmericanIndians and Alaska Natives must be reflected in the methods ofdiagnosing and treating their mental health problems, but empiricalvalidation of specific diagnostic instruments and treatment has beenslow in coming. The alsthors' literature review indicates that manystandardized self-rating scales and interview schedules can accuratelyassess mental illness among Indians, provided they are modified toreflect cultural heritage and experiences. Group therapy isincreasingly chosen as a psychiatric treatment for American Indians, asare family-network therapy and several traditional Indian therapies.The authors also review the demographics and psychiatric epidemiologyof American Indians and Alaska Natives. Marburg, G.S.\"Mental Health and Native American: Responding to the Challenge of aBiopsychosocial Model\", White Cloud Journal of American Indian MentalHealth, (1983), 3 (1), 43-52.The mental health needs of Native Americans have long been neglected inthe professional psychological and psychiatric literatures. Heredescribed is a rural hospital based community mental health prob-amthat utilizes an array of remedial, developmental, and preventivestrategies to respond to this population's unique biopsychosocialneeds.Since outpatient, outreach, and aftercare programs also play acritical role in a comprehensive mental health program, fhey arediscussed from a general systems theory orientation. From thisperspective, the development of treatment and consulting networks isessential to provide a full spectrum of mental health services toNative Americans in rural areas. 2935 McShane, D.\"Mental Health and North American Indian/Native Communities: CulturalTransactions, Education and Regulation\", American Journal of CommunityPsychology, (1987), 15 (1), 95-116.Critical issues in the delivery of mental health services to NorthAmerican Indians/Natives residing in rural areas are discussed by (a)describing Indian populations/communities; 0)) briefly summarizingavailable literature concerning the nature of mental health problemswithin Indian communities; (c) examining Indian belief systems relevantto participation in mental health service delivery processes; (d)exploring community expectations for structuring participatoryinteractions which may inhibit utilization of mental health services;and (e) describing transactions between Indian consuuers and non-Indianprofessionals which 'have become typical over time. The rural contextwas examined as it interacts with individual and communitycharacteristics to affect Indian mental health. Relations betweengeography and culture, important in understanding the mental healthproblems of Indian people, are discussed in regard to expandingcommunity healing resources through empowerment, and viewing \"educationas transformation\" as a key concept in enhancing community healingprocesses. Navajo Area Indian Health ServiceNavajo Area Mortality Report for 1978. (Window Rock, AZ: IndianHealth Service, 1980.)This report provides basic data on Navajo vital events. The data isobtained from birth and death certificates. Vital Statistics are basedon community of residence. IHS uses National Center for HealthStatistics tapes to produce tabulations by Area and Service Unit ofresidence.Population for the denominators is estimated annually byIHS, Office of Program Statistics in Rockville. The populationestimated is Navajos living on or near the Navajo reservation. Navajosliving in Albuquerque or Flagstaff, for example, are presumably notincluded. Petersen, L.P., Leonardson, G., R.I., Stanageand Gilmore, Indians\", Obstetrics(October, 1984), 64 (4), 519-523.,W., Gergen, J.,and Gynecology, The poor health status of Sioux Indians residing on reservations inSouth Dakota has been recognized for many years. The present reportdocuments evidence of a high incidence of socioeconomic health-relateddisorders and pregnancy-related complications by comparing 342 pregnantwhite women and 405 pregnant Sioux Indian women. In collaboration with 30 the Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service, beginning in 1976, a programwas initiated to identify, assess risks, and provide patient managementfor pregnant Sioux Indians. This prenatal consultative program hasproven effective in the reduction of fetal and infant mortality. Red Horse, J.\"Clinical Strategies for American Indian Families in Crisis\", TheUrban and Social Change Review, (1982), 15 (2). 17-19.American Indian family system, particularly from the standpoint offamily violence, child neglect, and substance abuse, are the subject ofmuch debate, and questions about the effect of cultural norms andcultural differences in family conduct on the identification andtreatment of these problems have been raised. These topical debateswere extremely vital prior to the passage of the Indian Child WelfareAct of 1978.They launched advocacy efforts to revise social andcultural practices in child welfare institutions that were detrimentalto American Indian family systems.Subsequent to the passage of the act, cultural issues must beconsidered in the design of implimentation strategies, and treatmentprocedures are needed that respect and reinforce the structural andcultrual integrity of Indian and extended family systems. Essentially,practitioners must now address points of fusion that will meld Indiantradition with effective mental health practices. This article offersa strategy of cultural fusion adaptable to a broad spectrum of Indianfamily types.Moreover, as a cultural strategy, it is congruent withthe fabric of Indian communities and aspirations of cultural pluralismconsidered vital by Indian constituencies. Discussion of culturalfusion will highlight two sets of ideas: (1) a strategy fororganization and (2) principles of clinical service. Rhoades, E.R., Marshall, M., Attneave, C., Echohawk, M., Bjork, J., andBeiser, M.\"Impact of Mental Disorders Upon Elderly American Indians as Reflectedin Visits to Ambulatory Care Facilities\", Journal of the AmericanGeriatrics Society, (January, 1980), 28 (1), 33-38.In order to assess the impact of mental health problems among elderlyAmerican Indians, a study was conducted on the utilization patterns ofambulatory care facilities by various age groups of Indians. Sincemost health care of Indians is rendered by the Indian Hmtalth Service(IHS), data obtained from IHS computer centers provided a reasonableindex of disease patterns. Because the elderly have constituted such asmall fraction of the Indian population, they have not heretoforereceived significant attention. However, their problems are rapidlyincreasing.By adjusting the frequency of visits according topopulation, an estiaate of visit \"rates\" was made. These rates showedone visit for every 10 persons in the 0-44 Age group, one for every 5 31 persons in the 45-54 age group, but only one visit for every 25 persons in the 65+ age group. Most of the visits by older Indians concerned\"social\" problems rather than \"mental\" disorders as such.These dataprovide information that should prove especially helpful in the designof social and health programs for elderly Indians. Samet, J.M., Kutvirt, D.M., Waxweiler, R.J., Cancer in Navajo Men\", New England Journal ofMedicine, (1984), 310 (23), 1481-1484.We performed a population-based case-control study to examine theassociation between uranium mining and lung cancer in Navajo men, apredominantly nonsmoking population. The 32 cases included all thoseoccurring among Navajo men between 1969 and 1982, as ascertained by theNew Mexico TUmor Registry. For each case in a Navajo man, two controlswith nonrespiratory cancer were selected. Of the 32 Navajo patients,72 percent had been employed as uranium miners, whereas no controls haddocumented experience in this industry. The lower 95 percentconfidence limit for the relative risk of lung cancer associated withuranium mining was 14.4. Information on cigarette smoking wasavailable for 21 of the 23 affected uranium miners, eight werenonsmokers and median consumption by the remainder was one to threecigarettes daily. These results demonstrate that in a rural nonsmokingpopulation most of the lung cancer may be attributable to one hazardousoccupation. Shaw, J.R., Todd, N.W., Goodwin, M.H., Jr., and Feldman, C.M.\"Observations on the Relation of Environmental and Behavioral Factorsto the Occurence of Otitis Media Among Indian Children\", Public HealthReports, 1981, 96 (4), 342-349.Otitis media and associated adverse sequelae are a leading cause ofmorbidity among American Indians. Rates of acute infection and hearingloss are reported to be considered higher than among the general U.S.population.Such differences have not been explained adequately,although a variety of factors have been examined. The work reportedhere was undertaken in connection with a study of the epidemiology andmethods for controllins otitis media among four Indian populationsliving on reservations in Arizona. In this report, we present anevaluation of the association of some environmental and behavioralfactors with the occurrence of otitis media. 32:38 Shen, W.W.\"The Hopi Indian's Mourning Hallucinations\", Journal of Nervous andMental Disease, (June, 1986), 174 (6), 365-367.One of the 76 alcoholic patients with hallucinations studied in aninpatient alcoholism service WAS a 24-year-old half-Hopi Pueblo Indianmale, who developed a prolonged course of hallucinations after thedeath of his father.

Spaulding, J.M.\"The Canton Asylum for Insane Indians: An Example of InstitutionalNeglect\", Hospital And Community Psychiatry, (October, 1986), 37 (10),1007-1011.Based on archival data, the authcr chronicles the history of the Canton(S.D.) Asylum for Insane Indians, which was established by Congress in1903 and was closed in 1934 because of inadequate conditions. In 1926a nationwide survey found that patients at Canton received minimalcare.Tne rates of patient death and discharge at Canton reported in a1931 survey compared unfavorably to those at other mental institutionsin the U.S.The 1929 and 1933 inspection reports of psychiatristSamuel Silk, which documented the hospital's outmoded custodial careand questioned the necessity of institutionalization for 35 to 40 ofCanton's 90 patients, played a key role in the decision to close theasylum.The author attributes the decline of the Canton Asylum togradual neglect by its superintendent and various government agencies. Spaulding, J.M. and Balch, P.\"Perceptions of Mental Disorder of Yaqui Indians in Arizona: AnInitial Investigation\", White Cloud Journal, (1985), 3 (4), 19-26.This study was disigned to provide an initial research effort for theYaqui Indians of Arizone. The investigation sought to determinewhether specific behavior pattarns would be labeled by Yaquis asdescribing mental problems, using the Star (1955) vignettes. ThreeTucson-area Yaqui communities with 81 Yaquis responded tc the survey.Results evidence areas of overlap and divergence with previous studies.Implications for mental health service providers for Yaqui patients interms of their perception of women who sight be labeled as\"schizophrenic\" by the dominant culture, as well perceptions towardsalcoholism, are raised by the findings. Finally, important interviewereffects were foand suggesting that Yaquis are more reticent aboutmental health issues when discussing them with Anglos than whendiscussing them with other Yaquis. 3334 Sullivan, D.A. and Beeman, R.\"Utilization and Evaluation of Maternity Care by American Indians inArizona\", Journal of Community Health, (Fall, 1983), 9 (1), 18-29.Dr.twing upon a statewide consumer survey conducted in 1979 by theBureau of Maternal and Child Health, this report focuses on the healthservice utilization and evaluation of 110 American Indians. The datashows that Indians, in contrast to Anglos, have less prenatal care, ahigher incidence of transport to special care facilities, a higherincidence of newborn problems, and unusually high rates of early andlate discharge. The Indian women also reported a higher incidence ofcommunication problems with their caretakers and were less satisfiedwith the care that they received. The discussion considers theproblems of less continuity of care and personnel shortages as well ascultural differences for delivering the quality of care mandated bytreaty and subsequent laws to this impoverished minority group. Temkin-Greener, H., Kunitz, S.J., Broudy, D., and Haffner, Among Women on the Navajo IndianReservation, 1972-1978\", American Journal of Public Health, (April,1981), 71 (4), 403-407.Changes in the rates of induced abortions, bilateral tubal ligations,and hysterectomies on the Navajo Indian Reservation have been examinedfor the years 1972-1978. While the incidence of abortions and tubalsterilizations is still considerably lower among Navajo women thanamong the total United States population of women, it has risen,especially among those in the prime of the reproductive cycle, i.e.,ages 20-34.The rate of hysterectomy has not changed substantially.Regression analyses performed on the data indicate that the utilizationof surgery for fertility regulation in women on the Navjo Reservation,unlike other surgical procedures, is not affected by access tohospitals which provide surgery. Rather measures of involvement in thewage work economy are of a primary importance. Those areas of theReservation having the highest levels of such involvement exhibit thehighest rates of such surgery. Timmermans, F., Gerson, S.\"Chronic Granulomatous Otitis Media in Bottle-Fed Inuit Children\",Canadian Medical Association Journal, (1980), 122, 545-547.Otitis media in Inuit children is a problem of relatively recent originand unknown cause. The prevalence of otitis media in 238 Inuit and 47Caucasian children in Nein, a small community in Labrador, wasdeteremined by examination, and the history of breast-feeding orbottle-feeding was obtained. The prevalence of otitis media was foundto be inversely related to the age bottle-feeding was started. 34 4 Clinical observations suggest that otitis media in Inuit children ispart of a process leading to chronic foreign body granuloma of themiddle ear, and that the granuloma is formed from milk introduced intothe relatively short and straight eustachian tubes of Inuit infants bythe high negative intraoral pressure necessary for bottle-feeding. Timpson, J.B.\"Indian Mental Health: Changes in the Delivery of Care in NorthwesternOntarioTM, Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, (April, 1984), 29 (3),234-241.For ten years University of Toronto psychiatrists have made regularvlsits to isolated Indian villages in remote Northwestern Ontario,offering a clinical psychiatric program. Initially, two non-Indiansocial workers provided ongoing service between the psychiatric visits.Recognizing the difficulty in providing psychotherapy cross-culturally,the members of the treatment team developed the skills of local personswho were not formally trained in the treatment of mental healthproblems.The paper describes a significant shift in the psychiatricprogram beginning in 1981. At that time in certain communities localpeople took over the service, resulting in an increased ability toprovide a preventative psychiatric program. Community based workershave dealt more with early marital difficulties, grief reactions,transitional depressive states, and less with major mental illnesses.In the areas which have community based treatment teams, the emphasisin psychiatric service is shifting from direct clinical work to formalteaching and case consultations with the indigenous counsellors. Theevidence indicates optimism that the service is reaching more personsbefore the emergency stage than it did in previous years of theprogram. Williams, R.\"Meningitis and Unpaved RoadsTM, Social Science And Medicine, (1987),24 (2), 109-115.Access to health care may be influenced by a variety of factorsincluding ones attributable to Che individual as well as onesattributc,hle to the health care system. One category frequentlyreferred to is 'geographic' factors of distance and travel time. Inthe present study, a previously undescribed geographic factor--unpavedroads--is shown to be a clinically important barrier to access. Usinga case-control format, children admitted with bacterial meningitis areshown to have traveled farther over unpaved roads to get to a clinicthan matched controls seen at the same time. With control groupsmatched for age and similar pre-existing illness, the implication isthat unpaved roads resulted in increased morbidity by reducing access. 3 541 Williams, R.L.\"Vehicular Carbon Monoxide Screening: Identification in aCross-Cultural Setting of a Substantial Public Health Risk Factor\",American Journal of Public Health, (January, 1985), 75 (85), 85-86.A community program of screening and education for prevention ofvehicular carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning among a high risk populationin a cross-cultural setting is presented. The program was developedafter two infante deaths in separate incidents of vehicular COpoisoning.The results of the screening show 18.6 percent of vehiclesexceeding the Environment Protection Agency eight-hour standard for COexposure, and 2.6 percent exceeding the one-hour standard. Extensionof such programs to other high risk populations is recommended. Wolfe, M.D. and Carlos, J.P.\"Periodontal Disease in Adolescents: Epidemiologic Findtngs in NavajoIndians\", Community Dental Oral Epidemiology, (1987), 15 (1), 33-40.A cross-sectional epidemiologic survey was conducted of 618 NavajoIndians, aged 14-19, resident in a boarding school in New Mexico.Periodontal status was assessed by clinical measurements of attachmentlevel and gingival bleeding, and evidence of alveolar bone loss fromstandardtzed bitewing radiographs. Attachment level and gingivalbleeding here measured at posterior interproximal sites (six sitesin each quadrant): the mesio-buccal aspect of the second molar; thedisto-buccal and mesio-buccal aspects of the first molar and secondpremolar; and the disto-buccal as of the first premolar. Alveolarbone level was measured from radi..;.,-hs at the correspondingapproximal surfaces of the same teeth. Attachment loss was consideredpresent when the distance from the CEJ to the base of the pocket was >1 mm; bone loss was considered present when the radiographic distance from the CEJ to the alveolar crest was > 2 mm, and gingival bleedingwas considered present if bleeding occurred immediately after gentleprobing.Attachment loss was evident at one or more sites in 88.6% ofthe population. 45.9% of the subjects had attachment loss at eight ormore sites, and 101 subjects (16.3%) had one or more sites with at least 4.0 mm of attachment loss. Bone loss was present at one or moresites in 89.2% of the population, 28.6% had eight or more affectedsites, and 4.7% (29 subjects) had one or more sites with at least 2.0mm of bone loss. Gingival bleeding was evident at one or more sites in70.6% of the population, and 19.7% had eight or more affected sites.None of the conditions were strongly associated with sex, but theprevalence of bone loss increased with age.The prevalence andseverity of incipient periodontitis seemed much higher in thesesubjects than previously reported in other adolescent groups whensimilar diagnostic criteria and methods of measurement were used. 36 Wolfe, M.D. and Carlos, J.P.\"Oral Health Effects of Smokeless Tobacco Use in Navajo IndianAdolescents\", Community Dental Oral Epidemiology, (August, 1987),15 (4), 230-235.Recent reports have suggested that the use of smokeless tobacco isincreasing in adolescents, and is particularly high in NativeAmericans, causing concern about possible effects on oral health. Inthis study, 226 Navajo Indians, aged 14-19, were interviewed regardingtheir use of smokeless tobacco (ST), cigarettes, and alcohol.Midbuccal and mesiobuccal sites on all fully erupted permanent teeth(excluding the third molars) were exemined for the presence of gingivalbleeding, gingival recession, calculus, and loss of periodontalattachment.The oral mucosa was examined for evidence of leukoplakia.64.2% (145) of the subjects (75.4% of the boys and 49.0% of the girls)were users of ST. Of these, over 95% used snuff alone or incombination with chewing tobacco. 55.9% used ST one or more days perweek.52.2% consumed alcohol, usually beer or wine, and 54.0% smokedcigarettes.25.5% (37) of the users and 3.7% (3) of the non-users hadleukoplakia.The duration (in years) and frequency of ST use (days perweek) were highly significant risk factors associated with leukoplakia.However, the concomitant use of alcohol or cigarettes did not appear toincrease the prevalence of these lesions. No consistent relationshipwas observed between the use of ST and gingival bleeding, calculus,gingival recession, or attachment loss, either when comparing users tonon-users or when comparing the segment where the tobacco quid washabitually placed to a within-subject control segment. In view ofthese results, there is little doubt that smokeless tobacco issignificantly related to the etiology of leukoplakia. As some evidenceexists that smokeless tobacco use is a significant risk factrassociated with oral carcinoma, intervention programs to discourage theuse of smokeless tobacco by adolescents should be a public healthpriority. Young, T.K.\"Self-Perceived and Clinically Assessed Health Status of Indians inNorthwestern Ontario: Analysis of a Health Survey\", The CanadianJournal of Public Health, (July-August, 1982), 73, 272-277.This paper reports on a community health survey (interview and clinicalexamination) among Indian residents in a region of remote isolatedsettlements in northwestern Ontario. Prevalence rates were establishedfor certain health problems and the discrepancy between perceived andclinically determined health status was highlighted. 37 Young, T.K.\"Mortality Pattern of Isolated Indians in Northwestern Ontario: A10-Year Review\", Public Health Reports, (September-October, 1983), 98,467-475.The mortality experience of an isolated Indian population in the SiouxLookout Zone of northwestern Ontario from 1972 through 1981 is reviewedand compared with that of the Canadian popalation. Standardizedmortality ratios for major categories of causes computed showedexcessive risks in most conditions. Notablexceptions includedcirculatory diseases and neoplasms. Injuries and poisonings accountedfor more than one-third of deaths. The proportionate mortality andage-specific mortality rates were considerably higher in all age groupsin the Sioux Lookout Zone than in the whole of Canada. Excessive riskswere found in almost all categories of accidental and violent deathsexcept motor vehicle accidents and accidental falls. Local conditionsthat contributed to the pattern observed are discusse0. More than 90percent of deaths from accidents and violence occurred before themedical care system was involved, highlighting the need for primarypreventive strategies in reducing mortality due to these causes.While the infant mortality rate declined, pneumonia, gastroenteritis,and meningitis still accounted for 28 percent of infant deaths in thedecade.Even with sudden infant death syndrome excluded, about 25percent of infant deaths still occurred at home. Some features of thepattern of mortality reported here are also observed in other NorthAmerican Indian groups undergoing the stresses of social change. Young, T.K., and Hershfield, E.S.\"A Case-Control Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Mass NeonatalBCC Vaccination Among Canadian Indians\", American Journal of PublicHealth, (July, 1986), 76 (7), 783-786.This paper reports a case-control study to assess the protective effectof BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccination among Indian infants inManitoba, Canada. A record of past BCG vaccination was found in 49 percent of the tuberculosis cases, compared to 77 per cent of thecontrols, yielding a relative risk of 0.30. Stratified analysis,controlling for age, increased the relative risk to 0.39 (95%confidence interval 0.22 - 0.69).The preventive fraction was 44 percent.Non-differential misclassification of exposure status could haveoccurred; if this was adjusted for, ts.le relative risk would be reduced.If only bacteriologically confirmed cases were analyzed, theage-adjusted relatib- risk was 0.27. The protective effect of BCGvaccination in the newborn among Manitoba Indians is therefore at least60 per cent.The implications for health policy in this discussed. 384 4 Zeiner, American Indians in Oklahoma\",Arukuro Kenkyuto Yakubutsu Ison, (December, 1985), 20 (4), 359-366.Data developed primarily on Aeian populations suggest that alcohol useand misuse may, in part, be modulated by absence of the ALDH Iisoenzyme, a comcomitant increase in acetaldehyde (implicated in someof the toxic effects ascribed to alcohol; 28,35) for an acute alcoholdose, and resultant dysphoric effects. The present study explored thegenerality of these related hypothases in 51 North American Indians and8 Caucasian controls via hair root assays for prevalence of the ALDH Iisoenzyme and amount of absolute ethanol consumed per day in ALDH Iisoenzyme-positive and isoenzyme-negalAve groups. Our Caucasiancontrol data replicated previous findings. Prevalence of ALDH Iisoenzyme deficiency in North American Indians (13.7%) differssignificantly from previously published data on South American Indians(69%).It also differs significantly from Asian data (35-57%). NorthAmerican Indian data are similar to Asian data in showing that ALDH Iisoenzyme-deficient North American Indians also drink less alcohol thando non-deficient Indians. Further, family history of alcoholism isless (28%) in ALDH I isoenzyme-deficient American Indians than in thosewithout the deficiency (84%). However, unlike Asians, American Indianswith the isoenzyme deficiency still drink more alcohol per day than doCaucasian controls. Results have implications for increased toxiceffects as well as increased risk for alcoholism. 39 NON-ABSTRACTED CITATIONS Antle, A.\"Ethnic Perspectives of Cancer Nursing: The American OncologyNursing Forum, (May-June, 1987), 14 (3), 70-73.

Boyce, W.T. and Boyce, J.C.\"Acculturation and Changes in Health Among Navajo Boarding SchoolStudents\", Social Science and Medicine, (1983), 17 (4), 219-226.This paper describes the relationship between cultural background andillness experience among Navajo students during their first year at areservation boarding school. Sixty Navajo children were enrolled in a9-month, prospective study in which three descriptors of change inhealth status were assessed; (a) number of dormitory aide contactsinitiated by the child for an illness complaint; (b) psychosocialproblems referred to the clinic or to the boarding schooladministration. 46 Two measures of cultural background were developed to estimate thelocation of each child along a continuum of acculturation, ranging froma traditional Navajo cultural orientation to full assimilation intomodern Anglo-American society. First, the home communities for allchildren in the study population were ranked by eleven Navajoinformants on an equal-interval scale reflecting community differencesin cultural identity. Second, a questionnaire assessing acculturativedimensions of family life style was administered to each child bya Navajo assistant. In addition, each student was assigned a score forcultural incongruity, defined as the degree of absolute differencebetween community and family measures of cultural background. Thereliability and validity of each index of acculturation were confirmedusirg a variety of psychometric approaches.Controlling for the confounding effects of age, sex and family size, asignificant positive association was found between the number of clinicvisits and the degree of cultural incongruity. Boarding schoolstudents from families and communities which conflicted in culturalorientation experienced higher rates of clinic visits for illnessesrequiring medical attention. This result is discussed in the contextof current understandings of the epidemiological consequences ofcultural change. Guilmet, G.M.\"Health Care and Health Care Seeking Strategies Among PuyallupIndians\", Cultural Medical Psychiatry, (December, 1984), 8 (4),349-369.This study replicated Kleinman's research on family-based popularhealth care in Taiwan among the Puyallup Indians of Washington.Standardized interviews were conducted among 80 Puyallup families todetermine family health practices and beliefs, and the patterns ofreferral to professional practitioners. Comparisons are made betweenthe Puyallup and Taiwanese family health care practices and health careseeking processes. The author concludes that the relative absence offolk medicine and the availability of free medical care among thePuyallup are the most important factors causing the variance betweenthe rates of family treatment and the patterns of health care seekingbehaviors between the Puyallup and the Taiwanese.

Rogers, K.D. and Coulehan, J.L.\"A Community Medicine Clerkship on the Navajo Indian Reservation\",Journal of Medical Education, (December, 1984), 59 (12), 937-943.An elective clerkship in community medicine for medical students hasbeen conducted for 16 years on the Navajo Indian reservation. Animportant part of the clerkship is a project in which most studentsselect a health problem which they investigate using epidemiologicalmethods of assessment and for which they seek a solution. Therequisites for the projects are that real health problems are involved,scientifically sound methods are used, usable information is provided,and data collection can be completed within the clerkship tenure.Topics for the projects are selected jointly by the students and thefaculty members from several general subject area; this allows the workof individual students to be carried out as independent subprojects oflarger projects, and this, in turn, produces more information about andhas more impact ou the problems addressed. Other clerkship objectivesalso are achieved through investigative projects that may involvestudents in planning, organization, and evaluation of health care andin public health practice. 485 4 U.S. Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs\"Indian Health Service Oversight and Reauthorization of IndianHealth Care Improvement Act\".

Brod, R.L., May, P. and Stewart, T.\"Recruitment and Retention of Federal Physicians on the NavajoReservation\", The Social Science Journal, (1982), 19 (4), 47-66.Recruitment and retention of physicians in most rural areas of theUnited States has been a continuing problem. Special difficultiessurround the efforts of the Indian Health Service (IHS) to staff itsextensive health care delivery systems on Indian reservations,particularly those of the Navajo. Questionnaire data obtained from IHSphysicians practicing on the Navajo Reservation in 1976 are factoranalyzed and inferences are drawn regarding recruitment and retention.Particular attention is paid to choice of location factors and areasof job and life satisfaction. Physicians' choice to practice on thereservation was motivated by altruism and the multiple attractions ofthe Southwestern United States. Once there, physicians' areas ofsatisfaction center around their relationship with Indian patients andthe local community, but dissatisfaction is found in hospital staffingpatterns, equipment and other bureaucratic and structural variables. Ageneral retention model is tested in which demographic characteristics,location choice factors, and satisfaction indices are treated asindependent variables in a linear regression equation predictingphysicians' intention to practice indefinitely among the Navajo..Based on these results, two different types of physicians are describedand problems of models predicting retention using only demopaphic andattitudinal measures are discussed. 52 Church, R.N.\"Pharmecy Practice in the Indian Health Service\", American Journal ofHospital Pharmacy, (April, 1987), 44, 771-775.The current status of pharmaceutIcal services in the Indian HealthService (IHS) is described. IHS is a nationwide program for providinghealth-care services to more than 960,000 American Indians and AlaskaNatives who live on or near federal Indian reservations. Because IHSpharmacy practice revolves around the needs of the patient, pharmacistshave close and frequent contact with patients and must have an acutesensitivity to and respect for the cultural values and beliefs of thepatients.Ambulatory-care services are emphasized; pharmacists oftenprovide primary care to patients and make frequent use of prescribingauthority.All prescriptions are filled directly from the patient'spermanent health record, and private patient consultation rooms areused extensively. In the inpatient setting, pharmacists obtainmedication and related histories from newly admitted patients andprovide patient counseling at the time of discharge. Pharmacistsare also actively involved in facility-wide programs and committees(especially those that deal with quality assurance and facilityaccreditation) and serve as preceptors of pharmacy residents andstudents.In the future, IHS pharmacy practice will emphasize the expansion ofpatient-care activites and primary-care programs, effective use ofprescribing authority, and the refinement of patient consultationservices, services for the elderly, home health-care services, andinpatient clinical services. Davidson, J.R.\"Training Amerindian Primary Health Workers: Evaluation ofGovernment Training of Aguaruna (Jivaro) Traditional BirthAttendants\", Medical Anthropology, (Winter, 1985), 9 (1), 65-83.This paper addresses an urgent problem faced by Amerindians--How canWestern techniques of primary health care (PHC) be taught in a way thatwill most effectively upgrade their standard of health withoutinterfering with traditional concepts of medical care or disruptingcommunity life? The results of a consumer-based evaluation of primaryhealth care training of Jivaroan women suggest that techniques found tobe effective in nonindigenous settings are not as successful whenapplied in some indigenous communities. The primary problem oftraining indigenous health workers, obtained during a study of theeffectiveness of the national Peruvian traditional birth attendant(TBA) training program, lies in the conceptual differences between theinterpretation of the economic system, organization of the healthsystem, and perceived health needs of indigenous communities as viewedby national and regional health planners and administrators versus theviews of members of indigenous communities. 53 A,5 fl Dietrich, A.J., and Olson, A.L.\"Model System of Ongoing Care for Native Americans---a 5-YearFollowup\", Public Health Reports, (March-April, 1986), 101 (2),184-187.In 1979, continuing care from a personal physician was identified as apriority at the Indian Health Sevice site in Zuni, NM, a rural hospitaland ambulatory care center serving 7,000 Zuni people. To encouragesuch care, a system was established that assigned each patient to aregular physician and organized physicians into teams. Three teams,each consisting of three clinicians and other support personnel, servedspecific geographic regions of the village.Five years later, the ongoing care provided for active randomlyselected prenatal, diabetic, and general clinic patients was evaluated.The physician staff of the site had gone through a complete turnoverduring the previous five years. Based on a chart review for the yearprior to patient identification, patients saw their regular physicianfrom 48 to 61 percent of the time in all their visits, and theirregular physician or his or her team colleague from 71 to 82 percent ofthe time in all their visits.Ongoing care from a personal physician or close colleague can beachieved in the Indian Health Service. Organization of physicians intoteams appeared to be the critical element in promotin, angoing care atthis site where physician turnover is high. Team physicians seldom allleave at once, and ongoing care as a priority is passed on by theattitude of other team physicians, by transfer of specific patients,and patient expectation. Given the established benefits, ongoing carefrom a personal provider should be encouraged in the Indian HealthService as in other primary care settings. Farkas, C.S., and Shah, C.\"Public Health Departments and Native Health Care in Urban Centres\",Canadian Journal of Public Health, (July-August, 1986), 77 (4),274-277.The health issues of urban Native peoples in Canada are poorlydocumented.Although Natives make up only a small percentage of thetotal populations of Canadian cities, they are often a sizable groupand they appear to have many unmet health needs. Since the mandate ofpublic health departments includes health surveillance and promotion aswell as health programs for high risk populations, we have surveyed thetypes of program developed for Native populations in urban centres.The implications of our findings are discussed and recommendations andchallenges are offered to the public health departments in Canadiancities. 54 Cu Farris, L.\"Challenges in Serving the Elderly American Indian\", Florida Nurse,(June, 1986), 34 (6), 12.Enormous changes have taken place in the field of aging during the pastdecade.Not only are people living longer but many are living better.This represents a success in serving the elderly; needless to say,however, there remain numerous and significant problems to be solved.The situation is very evident in South Florida, where the highestpercent of elderly in the nation reside.An examination of the attitude of direct care providers and nursingstudents reveals a basic lack of knowledge as well as attitudtnalbiases and stereotypes regarding the needs and capacities of SouthFlorida's multicultural elderly populati.m. In an effort to makeproviding care to the elderly a more positive experience, theresearchers sought a way to provide information on four ethnic groupsliving in South Florida: American Blacks, American Indians, HispanicCubans, and Jewish Americans. This paper examines solely the AmericanIndians of South Florida.According to the 1980 Census, the Native American population in theUnited States was slightly over one million. Representing over 300tribes, almost all speak their own tribal language. The vast majorityof American Indians live in the western part of the United States. Thetwo tribes living in South Florida are the Seminole and MiccosukeeIndians. Fischler, H.S. and Fleshman, C.\"Comprehensive Health Services for Developmentally Disabled NavajoChildren\", Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, (February, 1985),6 (1), 9-14.A retrospective study of 60 Navajo children with developmentaldisabilities was conducted to evaluate the quality andcomprehensiveness of health services provided. Descriptive analysis bya multidisciplinary panel included medical record reviews, familyinterviews, and site visits to local health, educational, and familysupport services. Findings included timely and appropriate managementof *medical\" problems but a general neglect of \"developmental\" issues,such as hearing, speech/language, cognitive, and behavioralfunctioning,and attention to family understanding and adjustmenttoward caring for a handicapped child. Primary prevention andscreening efforts were judged generally adequate, although not utilizedby the majority of mothers of disabled children. Diagnosticassessments, family counseling, and referrals for treatment wereincomplete, fragmented, and poorly coordinated. These problemsresulted in potentially harmful delays in making referrals to availabletreatment programs. The majority of families interviewed tended tofocus on the \"medical\" problems, had a poor understanding of the\"developmental\" components, and rarely participated actively intreatment.5561 Garro, L.C., Roulette, J., and Whitmore, R.G.\"Community Control of Health Care Delivery: The Sandy Bay Experience\",The Canadian Journal of Public Health, (July-August, 1986), 77,281-284.In 1983, the Sandy Bay Band in Manitoba received a grant from Healthand Welfare Canada through the Community Health Demonstration Program.The demonstration project has centered on setting up a structure fortransferring control of health services to the Band and developinghealth education programs and projects sensitive to community needs.Although we focus on the local effect of the project, it is alsoevaluated in the context of the demonstration grant program andself-determination of Indian people. Guidotti, T.L.\"The Impact of a California Indian Health Program as Reflected inHospitalization Trends\", Public Health Reports, (January, 1980), 94(1), 3-15.Medical services to Indian residents in California are funded throughlocal communities through the Indian Health Service, as they are inother states.There is very little information, current or historical,on the health trends of Indians in California, where the totalpopulation of Indians is small and fragmented into numerous tribes andlinguistic groups. The Modoc-Lassen Indian Development Committee is acommunity agency Elunded in 1967, initially under state sponsorship, toprovide auxiliary health services to Indians in two remote ruralcounties.These services include the use of trained health aides whoprovide transportation, visitation, and advocacy. Ten years ofhospital admissions were reviewed for Indian residents of Modoc County(estimated Indian population 300). Declining admissions forrespiratory diseases, accidents, and all causes combined were apparent.Admissions for chronic diseases, such as diabetes, increased suggestingprevious under-utilization of available services. Interruptions in theoverall trends in diagnostic categories could be related to knownhistorical events in most cases.These included documented epidemics, initiation of a screening program,and the introduction of supporting services. The relative frequency ofadmissions for major diagnoses agreed with the scanty informationavailable from other sources on the health problems of this populationand California Indians in general. Admissions data are incompleteindices of health status but they may be profitably employed to assesslocal situations where other sources of information are not available. 56 Kunitz, S.J.\"Underdevelopment, Demographic Change, and Health Care on the NavajoIndian Reservation\", Social Science and Medicine, (March, 1981), 15A(2), 175-192.Employing a historical approach, the Navajo Indian Reservation isunderstood as an underdeveloped nation. The consequences are examinedin terns of demographic response, organization and utilization ofhealth services, and employment patterns within the service sectorgenerally and in health care specifically. In some respects, thehealth and other services come to serve as a misplaced target for theIndians' anger and frustration which might be better directed towardmore fundamental concerns such as control of natural resourceextraction, control of local business and tndustry, etc. The focus onhealth may also teach people that their problems are personal, whichthey are not. Kunitz, S.J., Temkin-Greener, H., Broudy, D., and Haffner, H.\"Determinants of Hospital Utilization and Surgery on the Navajo IndianReservation:1972-1978\", Social Science and Medicine (MedicalAnthropology), (January, 1981), 158 (1), 71-79.Hospital data from the Navajo Reservation indicate that utilization hasbeen responsive to changes in the health care system, Navajo socialorganization, and disease patterns. Distance of a community from thenearest hospital is the best predictor of hospitalization rates in thecommunity tut involvement in the wage economy and household size alsoenter significantly into the regression. Age of patients is alsosignificantly related to distance as well as to age of the populationand to dependance upon welfare. The rate of cholecystectomies in acommunity is best explained by distance from the nearest hospitaloffering surgery. This is in contrast to rates of i,lpendectomies andhysterectomies, which appear to be most significantly related tomeasures of acculturation to the dominant society. Morrow, R.G.\"Using Staff Input to Set Priorities in an Indian Service Clinic\",Public Health Reports, (July-August, 1987), 102 (4), 369-371.The McLauhglin Public Health Service clinic serves several thousandLakota people (Sioux) on Standing Rock Indian Reservation, SD. In1981, a priority-setting exercise established for the first time agrassroots expression of the concerns of the clinic's staff.A three-step process was used in which each staff member first compiledan open-ended list of health needs, then ranked the relativecontribution of five factors to making these problems important, andassessed each problem listed by those factors. The factors used weremortality, morbidity, vulnerability to intervention, facilities on 5763 hand, and social implications. The resulting priority tablerepresented each person's assessment of the health needs of thecommunity.A composite table was created to represent the group'sassessment.The staff concluded that among the many problems listed,Alcoholism and diabetes were the most compelling health problems. Thepriority score was almost identical for each, but the reasons weredifferent.Alcoholism was rated highly because it was felt to bewidespread and had serious social implications. Diabetes was rankedhighly because it was felt to be lethal and vulnerable to intervention.A significant long-term benefit to the clinic of the 3-month processwas to stimulate consultation within the local clinic and to unify thehealth team, endowing the members with a common sense of purpose. Nighswander, T.S.\"High Utilizers of Ambulatory Care Services: A Medical Center\", PUblic Health Reports, (July-August,1984), 99 (4), 400-404.In a retrospective study, 100 randomly selected, high utilizers ofambulatory care services in 1972 were followed for a six-year period,1973-78.The 22 men and 78 women had visited the Alaska Native MedicalCenter in Anchorage 15 or more times in 1972. Each patient was matchedby age and sex with a control patient who had made three or fewervisits.,There were predominately more women than men in all age groups in thehigh-utilizer group and in all but one age group in the general clinicpopulation.High-utilizer men as a group were older than high-utilizerwomen.In the follow-up period, the men in the high-utilizer group hadthree times the number of hospitalizations as the controls, and womenhad two times the number. At the end of the followup period, 1 ofevery 4 men in the high-utilizer group had died, and 1 of every 10women had died. One-half of these deaths were associated with alcohol.Several approaches to high-utilizer patients are useful. Awell-organized medical record, with a complete problem list and index,is imperative. Just as helpful is only having one or several healthcare providers consistently see the patient at each encounter. Untilthere is more study of 1-Alese complex issues, high utilizers must berecognized as a subgroup of patients at high risk for hospitalizationand early death. Rhoades, E.R., D'Angelo, A.J., and HealthReports, (July-August, 1987), 102(4), 356-360.The Indian Health Service (IHS) was transferred from the Department ofInterior to the Public Health Service in the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare in 1955. At that time, the general health of 58 Indian people substantially lagged behind the rest of the U.S.population.This gap was reflected in mortality rates which wereseveral-fold higher for Indians, or reflected in tine; there weredecades between the dates when the U.S. population achieved certainlower death rates compared with the dates when similar reductions wereachieved by Indians. t.a a result of preventive health programs,improvements in sanitation, and the development of a number of medicaladvances, substantial progress has been achieved in improving thehealth of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Life expectancy ofIndians has increased 20 years between 1940 and 1980. Prom 1955thcough 1982, the death rate for Indian infants dropped by 82 percent.Also, the age-adjusted death rate for tuberculosis decreased from 57.9per 100,000 population in 1955 to 3.3 in 1983. These and otherimprovements are summarized ia this paper. Rhoades, E.R., Reyes, L.L., and Buzzard, G.D.\"The Indian People\", Public HealthReports, (July-August, 1987), 102 (4), 352-356.The Indian Health Service (INS) is a bureau of the Health Resources andServices Administration, an agency of the Public Health Service. Itwas formed in 1955 by a transfer of health services from the Bureau ofIndian Affairs, Department of the Interior. Since that tine, IHS hasgrown larger and more complicated and has become a truly complexnational organization that is responsible for direct and contracthealth care services to approximately 1 million Indian people. Thehistorical background of the Service, its present organization, and theservices that it provides through a variety of organizationalstructures are outlined in this report. Robertson, L.S.\"Community Injury Control Programs of the Indian Health Service, anEarly Assessment\", Public Health Reports, (1986), 101 (6), 632-637.In response to the high rates of injury morbidity and mortality amongNative Americans, the Indian Health Service initiated community injurycontrol programs in 1982 mainly aimed at educating the populationsserved.Substantial declines in hospitalization rates per populationfor falls, motor vehicle injuries, and assaults were observed through1984.Regression analyses of changes in hospitalization rates forparticular types of injury in relation to rates of persons served in 54service units suggests some favorable effect of certain activities andpossible adverse effect of a few. Increased targeting of effort basedon detailed surveillance of serious injuries is planned. 5965 Rudolph, R.\"The Indian Health Service: Is There a Better Way?\", South DakotaJournal of Medicine, (February, 1986), 39 (2), 17-19.The history and evolution of the provision of health care for AmericanIndians is briefly traced. Problems in the delivery of care,particularly on South Dakota reservations are outlined. How these willbe addressed in an era of rapid change in delivery of care systems, andfederal budget limitations is problematic. The author concedes theweaknesses of the present Indian Health Service; but feels many ofthese are results of culture, isolation, poverty, and tradition.Input, consent, and support of the Native American is necessary for anynew or different approach. Shah, C.P. and Farkas, C.S.\"The Health of Indians in Canadian Cities: A Challenge to the HealthCare System\", Canadian Medical Association Journal, (November, 1985),133 (9), 859-863.It is well known that Canadian native people living on reserves havehigh morbidity and mortality rates, but less is known about the healthof those who migrated to urban centres. Several studies have shownthat these people have high rates of mental health problems, specificdiseases, injuries, infant death and hospital admission. In addition,there is evidence that cultural differences create barriers to theiruse of health care facilities. The low socioeconomic status, culturaldifferences and discrimination that they find in cities are identifiedas the primary blocks to good health and adequate health care. Moreepidemiologic studies need to be done to identify health problems,needs and barriers to health care. Federal, provincial and civicgovernments along with the appropriate departments of faculties ofmedicine should begin working with native organizations to improve thehealth of native people living in Canada's cities. Shannon, G.W. and Bashshur, R.L.\"Accessibility to Medical Care Among Urban American Indians in aLarge Metropolitan Area\", Social Science and Medicine, (1982), 16 (5),571-575.Federal health and medical care programs recently mandated for AmericanIndians living in cities are predicated upon information pertaining totheir unmet health needs and assessments of their accessibility tomedical care.Based upon a household survey conducted among arepresentative Indian population living in a large metropolitan area,an evaluation is made of the accessibility experience of thispopulation as it pertains to primary medical care. Using measures ofaccessiblility including travel time, appointment delay time, andwaiting room time, the experiences of Indian residents of majorresidential sections of the area are illustrated. Comparative 6066 assessments are made on the basis of the individual convenience factorsas well as on the basis of an aggregate index of accessibility that hasbeen proposed for health planning and evaluation. Significantdifferences in accessibility to primary care between residents incertain residential areas are demonstrated and suggestions for revisionof the accessibility standards are offered.

Young, T.K.\"Indian Health Services in Canada: A Socio-historical Perspective\",Social Science and Medicine, (1984), 18 (3), 257-264.The major trends and issues in the historical development of Indianhealth services in Canada since Confederation are discussed accordingto:(1) the legislative bases, including the RNA Act, the Indian Act,Indian Treaties, landmark court decisions and post-War national healthlegislations; (2) the policy statements of the federal governmentregarding services to Indians, culminating in the Indian Health Policyof 1979; (3) the changes in the organization and delivery of healthservices from the appointment of the first chief medical officer in1904 to the multi-million operations of the Medical Services Branch inthe 1980s; and (4) the reaction of Indian communities and politicalorganizations to government-sponsored health care and the recent trendtowards their increasing participation. Young, T.K.\"The Canadian North and the Third World: Is the Analogy Appropriate?\",Canadian Journal of Public Health, 74, (July-August, 1983), 239-241.It is often suggested that the health problems of the Canadian North,like the social and economic conditions, resemble those of most ThirdWorld countries. However, the principle causes of death and disabilityare actually very different, as also is the nutritional status and thesupply of health services. \"Health for all by the year 2000\" is anachievable goal in the Canadian North, but may not be in many ThirdWorld countries. 6167 NON-ABSTRACTED CITATIONS ANA Publications\"Hearing on Health s for Native Americans\", Report fromthe Amsrican Nurses' Association Commission on Human Rights, June 8,1979 New Mexico: ANA Publications, 1981), 1-12.

A descriptivestudy was done to obtain current information on beliefs about pregnancyand childbirth of Northwest Coast Indian women. General ethnographicdata were collected by means of participant-observation and werecompiled into field notes. Informally structured interviews were usedto elicit data concerning current beliefs about pregnancy andchildbirth.Ethnographic information obtained was mostly on an empirical levelsince many tribal actions were not readily discussed with outsiders tothe community, including fellow Native Americans. Twenty-fiveexpressed beliefs about pregnancy and childbirth were identified andcategorized into two sets. The first set included the beliefsexpressed by all respondents and indicated their relationship totraditional beliefs identified from the literature. The second setcontained only those beliefs expressed by respondents of childbearingage.Based on these beliefs and integrating transcultural nursing theory,implications for nursing actions are delineated. The nursing actionsoutlined include specific techniques, evolved from transculturalnursing concepts, that would be useful when caring for individualNative American women in community, outpatient, and inpatient settings.The implications also offer broad guidelines for developing effectivecare modalities when working with Native American women. Camazine, S.M.\"Traditional and Western Health Care Among Zuni Indians of New Mexico\",Social Science and Medicine (Medical Anthropology), (February, 1980),1411 (1), 73-80.This study examines the role of traditional and Western health careamong the Zuni Indians of New Mexico. Over the past 100 years, changesin the practice of traditional medicine have resulted from alterationsin the Zuni life style and the introduction of health care provided bythe Public Health Service. These alternative systems of health care 68 are both utilized to a varying extent, determined by many factors.Thepresent-day beliefs and expectations of the Zuni concerning disease,its etiology and its treatment are described in an analysis of theinteraction between the traditional and Western health care systems.The value of traditional medical practices is examined and theimportance of understanding them is stressed with the goal ofincreasing awareness of the health care providers of conflicts that mayarise with the introduction of Western medicine. Suggestions are madethat may facilitate the acceptance of modern health care in communitieswhere traditional medicine plays an important role. Coulehen, J.\"Navajo Indian Medicine: Implications for Healing\", Journal of FamilyPractice, (1980), 10, 55-61.Traditional medicine men coexist with physicians and hospitals on the25,000 square mile Navajo Indian Reservation. Most seriously illNavajos utilize both systems of health care. This natural experimentof coexistence emphasizes several general characteristics of allhealing.Traditional ceremonies are successful because they areintegrated into Navajo belief systems end meet needs of sick people notdealt wit/ by the available Western maZIcine. Physicians and otherhealers sinply remove obstacles to the body's restoration ofhomeostasit or, as the Navajo say, to harmony. Reductionism limits thespectrum of v'ostacles considered relevant (eg, causes of illness), butan alternate model might include emotional, social, or spiritualphenomena equally as significant to healing as are biochemicalphenomena.In that context, nonmedical healers, as well as physicians,can potentially influence factors relevant to getting well. Mason, J.C.\"Ethnicity and Clinical Care: Indians\", Hospital Physician, (1981), 17(10), 122-125.Language can be the greatest barrier to health care delivery. Indianpatients may have difficulty with conversational English to say nothingof medical or anatomical professional jargon. Anglo physicians shouldgain some knowledge of Indian terms related to illness and disease. Oetinger, G., III\"Running Against the Wind: The Human Factor. Patients' Perspectivesof Traditional Navajo Healing Practices Presently Used on theReservation\", Mid-South Sociological Association Paper, (1980).Explored is the relationship between the use of traditional healingpractices and the sociocultural and economic changes taking place onthe Navajo Reservation. The ongoing process of \"getting well\" has been 6975 analyzed through the eyes of the patient, in addition to utilizing morenormative historical and sociocultural variables. Data were collectedover a period of two years using informal conversations, structuredinterviews, review of anthropological literature, and participantobservation. We major criteria were used in the selection ofpatients:the nature of the ceremony performed on the individual, andan attempt to achieve a diversity of patient profiles. Sixtransitional stpAs in the process of \"getting well\" were identified:(1) a felt need, (2) seeking validation, (3) discerning whatpreparations must be made, (4) making a commitment and (5) percievedresults. 70'7 6 NON-ABSTRACTED CITATIONS Barrow, M.V., Jr.\"Early History of Medicine in Alachua County\", Journal of FloridaMedical Association, (August, 1982), 69 (8), 670-680.

The mostserious implication is a dwindli4g of support for Indian health carewhile the health of Indians continues to lag behind that of all othergroups in the United States. Empirical analysis in one service area ofthe Indian Health Service (IHS) in Oklahoma reveals Indians of lowerblood quantum to be younger, lower utilizers of expensive medicalservices, especially hospitals. The sudden loss of health carebenefits from IHS will be detrimental not only to this population andto an ever increasing number of Indians in the future but also to thelocal service units in the Indian Health Service. Bell, C.\"The Navajo Patient: Illumination of Cultural Differences\", ColoradoMedicine, (April, 1980), 77 (4), 127-130.A variety of cultural backgrounds exists in every patient population,soma vastly different from our ovn personal experience. The Navajonation, approximately 148,000 people, offers a dramatic display of howcustoms and folkways can alter the individual's view of medicine.

Aschool-based rheumatic fever prevention program had been instituted inmany parts of the Navajo Reservation during the last 2 years(1975-1977) of that period. This program, based on experience withstreptococcal disease control in Wyoming and Colorado, involvedperiodic culturing of throat specimens from both symptomatic andasymptomatic school children and the treatment of those whose cultureswere positive for group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. There was someindication that ARF occurred less frequently among children ingeographic units covered by the program than in uncovered areas, butthe number of reported cases was small in the 2-year period, and thevariation may have been caused by chance alone.During the subsequent 2 years, the rheumatic fever control programcontinued to reach a large number of Navajo elementary school children,but because of personal and transportation constraints, it did notreach all schools. Consequently, it was possible to review all casesof ARF diagnosed in school children for a period of more than 4 years 74 SO and to ascertain whether each affected child attended a school that wasactive in the program or for whoa a throat culture was performedimmediately before the development of ARF. Two hypotheses were tested.First, the risk of ART in children ages 5 to 16 was higher among thosewho did not attend schools active in ths program or for whom a throatculture was not done during the 2 months before their ARF wasdiagnosed.Second, the benefits of the program, expressed in monetaryterms, outweighed it2 Costs. Coulehan, J.L., Koros, A., A.\"Gasoline Sniffing and Lead Toxicity in Favajo Adolescents\",Pediatrics, (January, 1983), 71 (1), 113-117.During a 6-year period, 23 Navajo adolescents were hospitalized 47times for presumed lead intoxication seconaltry to gasoline sniffing.Most patients were male (87%) and sniffed gasoline as a socialactivity, more frequently in spring and summer. Sixty-five percent ofthe patients first presented with toxic encephalopathy. 31% encephalopathywith disorientation and hallucinations. Free erythrocyteprotoporphyrin levels were not consistently high, although blood leadlevels were all elevated. One death occurred. Approximately 11% of537 Navajo adolescents said they inhaled gasoline for enjoyment atleast occasionally.Among 147 junior high school students, blood lead levels averaged18+or-6 ug/dL with no values >40 ug/dL. Three of these students hadelevated zinc protoporphyrin levels and all three where anemic. Nocorrelation was found between levels of blood lead or zincprotoporphyrin and whether or not the youth reported sniffing gasoline.However, sniffing gasoline was associated with poor school performanceand delinquent behavior. Although apparently many Navajo adolescentsexperiment with gasoline inhalation, only a few engage in this activityfrequently enough to develop either asymptomatic or symptomatic leadoverload. Daniels, T.J.\"A Study of Dog Bites on the Navajo Reservation\"Public HealthReports, (1986), 101 (1), 50-59.Reservation-wide dog-bite statistics indicate a bite rate on the NavajoRaservation that is comparable to that of a large city.Detailedanalysis of 772 bite reports was made to determine the characteristicsof biters and their victims. This included an assessment of thebehavioral antecedents leading up to the bite incident; 98.4 percent ofall cases for which a possible cause could be ascertained were provokedin soma way.Both dog control and public education measures need to betaken to reduce the frequency of dog bites.75 Fischler, R.S.\"Child Abuse and Neglect hi American Indian Communities\", Child Abuseand Neglect, (October, 1983), 9 (1), 95-106.Child abuse and neglect have recently been found to occur amongAmerican Indians at rates comparable to other American populationgroups.Little is known about the clinical spectrum of Indianmaltreatment, the psychodynamics and effective treatment modaliCes.Cultural misunderstanding, modernization, poverty, situationia ,ss,poor parenting skills because of early break-up of Indian families,alcoholism, unusual perceptions of children, handicapped children, anddivorce constitute factors associated with maltreatment in cases cited.Old soluticm.f removing children from families were largelyinappropria ineffective and are being replaced by local effortsto develop homes, supportive family services, and legalprocedures to protect children. Communication between agenciesinvolved and mistrust of outsiders plus a lack of trained personnel andavailable community resources continue to pose major barriers toeffective treatment and prevention efforts. Recent federal policiesand laws clearly place the responsibility for child welfare in thehands of Indian tribes and tribal courts. The non-Indian healthprofessional has an important but limited role in providing technicalexpertise and in aiding development of community resources, taking careto support but not usurp the emerging leadership of Indian people. Fox, J., Manitowabi, D., and Ward, J.A.\"An Indian Community with a High Suicide Rate--5 Years After\",Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, (August, 1984), 29 (5), 425-427.This report deals with the five year follow-up after a suicide epidemicon a Manitoulin Island Indian Reserve in 1974 and 1975. In thesucceeding years, the suicide rate has dropped to a tenth of the leve3of the epidemic and has reached the levels for the rest of ManitoulinIsland including the White and Native population. There has been acorresponding drop in the rate of violent death and of the number ofsuicide attempts. It is suggasted that the multi-dimensionalprevention and intervention measures reported here have contributed toa significant improvement in present conditions. Hodgson, C.\"The Social and Political Implications of Tuberculosis Among NativeCanadians\", The Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology, (1982),19 (4), 502-512.Concepts of disease and the organization of health care are influencedby cultural and social theories. An example of this process is thetreatment of tuberculosis (a disease believed to have been introducedto North American by European settlers) among Indian and Inuit groups 76 in Canada.The quantity and quality of health care extended by thefederal government to tubercular native Canadians has varied over time.The explanations for this phenomenon can differ according to theobserver's perspective. More resaarch is needed if we are tounderstand the overall effect of tuberculosis treatment on nativesociety and on native/non-native relations in Canada.

Elderly Indians were 51-85 years or age andresided on two midwestern reservations. Data were collected throughuse of the Life Satisfaction Index Z-scale (LSI-Z), the OarsMulti-dimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire (OARS) and asemi-structured interview schedule. Findings indicated that lifesatisfaction tended to be high. Six internal environmental variablesexplained 40% of the variance in life setisfaction scores. A highercorrelation was found between self-perception of life satisfaction andmental health than objective ratings on these two variables. Thiastudy suggests that variables associated with the internal environmentmay be useful as indicators of life satisfaction in elderly reservationAmerican Indians and that subjective measures of life satisfaction maybe more predictive of mental health than objective measures.

Self,inflicted gunshot woundscomprised 75 percent of the suicides among Alaska Natives from 1976through 1980.A review of psychiatric consultations concerning 34Alaska Nativys who had survived a self-inflicted gunshot woundindicated some common characteristics. Of the group, 28 were male, and20 had been using alcohol at the time of the shooting. Inter-persom.1conflicts were cited by most persons as partial motivation for theshooting, and most shootings were impulsive rather than premeditated.Few patients had a psychiatric history or appeared impaired at the timeof the consultation.Cultural and intrapsychic factors thatrate of expressionincrease of non-Native influences withdisorganization and cultural conflict.might contribute to this highexamined.These include aof negative affect and ansubsequent social Lewis, T.H.\"A Sioux Medicine Man Describes His Own Illness and Approaching Death\",Annals of Internal Medicine, (March, 1980), 92 (3), 417-418.A Sioux medicine man spent a long professional life as a \"primary care\"rural indigenous practitioner.

Standardized mortalityratios (SMRs) for ages 1-69 indicated elevated risks among both sexesfor all major forms of accidents and violence (combined SMR male-3.2,female-3.7).The SMR was also greater than 3.0 among women forcirrhosis/alcoholism (4.4), diabetes (4.1) and pneumonia (3.5).Mortality rates for all cancer sites combined were lower than Canadianrates among both sexes (males SMR-0.53, females SMR-0.82). Onlycervical cancer (SMR-3.9) was significantly elevated. 80 Markides, K.\"Minority Status, Aging, and Mental Health\", Journal of Aging and HumanDevelopment, (1986), 23 (4), 285-300.Research findings on mental health and life satisfaction among agedblacks, Mexican-Americans and Native AmAricans are reviewed. Althoughthe literature has generally followed a social stress perspective thatpredicts greater mental health problems among minority group aged, theevidence shows that mental health and life satisfaction of these groupsis not any lower than might be anticipated based on their relativesocioeconomic standing. It is concluded that, despite increasedresearch, little is known about how enthnicity and minority groupstatus influence psychopathology and life satisfaction in late life. Moffatt, M.E.\"Land Settlements and Health Care: The Case of the James Bay Cree\",Canadian Journal of Public Health, (July-August, 1987), 78 (4),223-227.The James Bay Agreement (1975) gave the Cree Indians of northern Quebeccontrol of their health care system with provincial rather than federalfiscal responsibility. Transfer was complete in 1981. Earlyadministrative problems included financial crises, retention ofprofessional staff and appropriate professional advice. An epidemic ofgastroenteritis and an outbreak of tuberculosis in 1980 served to focusattention on important issues. These crisis were used by the Gres toconsolidate their relationship with McGill University and to lobbysuccessfully for water and sewage infrastructures. The system isworking but is vulnerable to outside influence due to insufficientnumbers of highly trained Cree personnel at all levels. Murdock, S.H. and Schwartz, D.F.\"Family Structure and the Use of Agency Services: An Examination ofPatterns Among Elderly Native Americans,\" The Gerontologist, (1978),18(5), 475-481.The social service needs and use rates of elderly Native Americans andtheir relationships to family structure are examined. Data frominterviews with 160 elderly Native Americans living in a reservationsetting indicate that levels of objective need are uniformly high, butespecially so for elderly persons living alone. Levels of perceivedservice needs, awareness of service agencies, and use of agencyserivces, however, are higher for those living in extended familysettings.Family structure thus appears to be an important factor inthe provision of services to elderly Native Americans. 81 Nuttall, R.N.\"The Development of Indian Boards of Health in Alberta\", CanadianJournal of Public Health, (September-October, 1982), 73 (5), 300-303.Health of Indian people in Alberta, and in Canada as a whole, issubstantially poorer Chan the health of the general Canadianpopulation.Gains made from 1945 until the 1960's have in general notbeen sustained in the 1970's, leaving most measurements of Indianhealth below Canadian standards. Recent data suggest a deteriorationin the morbidity and mortality statistics among Alberta Indians in thelate 1970's.As one strategy to improve Indian health, increasedcommunity involvement in community health services, and a degree ofcontrol of health services at the community level, has started inAlberta.The Alberta Indian Health Care Commission was established in1980 to act as a province-wide Board of Health for the Indians ofAlberta.In addtition, a local community-based Board of Health wasestablished at the Blood Indian Reserve in 1980. In the summer of 1982several other reserves in Alberta were developing community-basedBoards of Health. This paper examines the rationale behind theformation of these new Boards of Health, their objectives, someproblems encountered in their formation, and some prospects for thefuture. Nutting, P.A., Burkhalter, B.R., Dietrick, D.L., and Helmick, E.F.\"Relationship of Size and Payment Mechanism to System Performance in 11Medical Care Systems\", Medical Care, (July, 1982), 20 (7), 676-690.The performance of 11 medical care systems of varying size and paymentmechanisms (consisting of six government owned and operated IndianHealth Service units, three fee-for-service private practices and twoHMOs) was studied. Performance was defined as the percentage ofconsumers in need of care who received adequate caro according topredetermined standards for the process of care for various functions(i.e., prevention, screening, treatment, follow-up) and various healthconditions (i.e., prenatal and infant care, hypertension, anemia, UTI).Size was found to have a strong negative relationship to the quality oftreatment and follow-up care, but payment mechanism was significantlyrelated to prevention performance. In screening, the results dependedon the health condition: size was inversely related to performance ofscreening for hypertension; HMOs performed signifIcantly better inscreening for prenatal anemia; and neither size nor payment mechanismwas related to performance of screening for infant anemia.Owens, M.V., Cameron, C.M., Jr., and Hickman, P.\"Job Achievement of Indian and Non-Indian Graduates in Public Health:How do They Compare?\", Public Health Reports, (July-August, 1987), 102(4), 372-376.A graduate education program in public health for American Indians wasintroduced in the fall of 1971 at the College of Public Health,University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. The program wasinitiated with support form the Office of Economic Opportunity.82 Between August 1, 1971, and December 31, 1983, 52 American Indiansreceived public health degrees from the University of Oklahoma'sCollege of Public Health. Of that number jO received masters degreesin public health; 1 a PhD; and 1 a Degrees were grantedin these disciplines: biostatistics, epidemiology, environmentalhealth, health administration, health education, and human ecology.This study assesses the job achievements of 51 of those American Indiangraduates.Each Indian was paired with a non-Indian graduate randomlyselected from a cluster sample compiled from the school's files ofnon-Indian graduates. The results of this study showed that Indiangraduates had the kinds and amounts of responsibilities, with theexception of budget approval responsibility, that one would acquire orexpect to acquire in a key administrative or staff position. The studyfurther indicated that Indian graduates were generally achieving asmuch success and satisfaction in their jobs as the non-Indiangraduates. Peck, R.E., Marks, J.S., Dibley, M.J., Lee, S., and F.L.\"Birth Weight and Subsequent Growth Among Navajo Children\", PublicHealth Reports, (1987), 102 (5), 500-507.An examination of length, weight, and birth weight data routinelycollected from the clinics supported by the Navajo Nation SpecialSupplement Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) showed anassociation between birth weight and subsequent growth status. Navajochildren less than 2 years of age entering the WIC Program were dividedinto low, normal, and high birth weight groups, and their growthpatterns were plotted when they returned periodically for reassessment.Overall, the children tended to have low length-for-age and highweight-for-length measures, relative to the reference population, thatsuggest suboptimal nutritional status. Children with birth weightsless than 2,500 grams (g) were consistently shorter, lighter, andthinner than children with birth weights greater than 2,500 g.Although the overall growth status of the children improved between1975 and 1980, the growth among the children with low birth weightsnever fully caught up with that of the other Navajo children.Moreover, during that period, the normal birth weight group had amodest improvement in length-for-age relative to the referencepopulation, but the low birth weight group did not. These findingssuggest that prenatal interventions to improve the birth weight statusof Navajo infants may result in improving the growth status of Navajochildren. 8389 Rhoades, Indian Burden of Illness and Future Health Interventions\", PublicHealth Reports, (July-August, 1987), 102 (4), 361-368.This article describes the burden of illness of Indians eligible forservices from the Indian Health Service (IHS) and discusses strategiesfor reducing morbidity and mortality related to those conditions. Toimprove health to an extent that parallels the IHS's past achievements,the illnesses that now are prevalent among Indians require changes inpersonal and community behavior rather than intensified medical ;services.Analysis of these conditions leads to the conclusion thatmuch of the existing burden of illness can be reduced or eliminated.IHS is responding to this challenge by continuing to ensure Indians'access to comprehensive health care services, by increasing educationalefforts aimed at prevention, and by enlisting the support of othergovernment and private organizations in activities that have as theirpurpose (a) treating diseases if intervention will lessen morbidity andmortality (such as diabetes and hypertension) and (b) encouraging ofdietary changes, cessation of smoking, exercise, reduction in alcoholconsumption, and other healthy behavior. Rhoades, E.R., Marshall, M., Attneave, C., Echohawk, M., Bjork, J., andBeiser, M.\"The Impaof Mental Disorders Upon Elderly American Indians asReflected in Visits to Ambulatory Care Facilities\", Journal of theAmerican Geriatric Society, (1980), 28 (1), 33-39.In order to assess the impact of mental health problems among elderlyAmerican Indians, a study was conducted on the utilization patterns ofambulatory care facilities by various age groups of Indians. Sincemost health care of Indians is rendered by the Indian Health Service(INS), data obtained from IHS computer centers provided a reasonableindex of disease patterns. Because the elderly have constituted such asnail fraction of the Indian population, they have not heretoforereceived significant attention. However, their problems are rapidlyincreasing.By adjusting the frequency of visits according topopulations, an estimate of visit \"rates\" was made. These rates showedone visit for every 10 persons in the 0-44 age group, one for every 5persons in the 45-54 age group, but only one visit for every 25 personsin the 65+ age group. Most of the visits by older Indians concerned\"social\" problems rather than \"mental\" disorders as such. These dataprovide information that should prove especially helpful in the designof social and health programs for elderly Indians. 8490 Ross, C. and Davis, B.\"Suicide and Parasuicida in a Northern Canadian Native Community\",Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, (May, 1986), 31, 331-333.This report describes suicida and parasuicide in a small, remoteNorthern Canadian native community for a three-year pariod from 1981 to1984.The overall rate for suicide was 77 par 100,000, with a rate of241 for male treaty Indians age 20-24. Parasuicide in the form ofoverdose VAS epidemic, with a rate of 7,722 pier 100,000 in treatyIndians females age 15-19. None of the completed decades had previouscontact with the mental health system of previous parasuicides. Thepublic health implications of these figures are discussed. Shebala, B.A. and Reach, R.M.\"The Navajo WayTM, New Mexico Nurse, (December, 1983), 28 (4), 4-5.Because the ways of the Navajo culture are unfamiliar to mostnon-Navajo nurses, a variety of problemm are encountered in caring forN-majo patients. The purpose of this article is to briefly explainsome general information that may increase the nurse's knowledge andunderstanding of the Navajo culture and convey specific advice indealing with Navajo patients and their families. Stewart, T., May, P., and Perez, P., Jr.\"A Navajo Health Consumer Survey\", Medical Care, (December, 1980), 18(12), 1183-1195.The findings of n health consumer survey of 309 Navajo families inthree areas of the Navajo Reservation are reported. The survey showsthat access to facilities and lack of safe water and sanitary suppliesare continuing problems for these families. The families showconsistent use of Indian Health Service providers, particularly nurses,pharmacists and physicians, as well as traditional Navajo medicinepractitioners. Only incidantal utilization of private modical servicesis reported.Extendad waiting time and translation from English toNavajo are major concerns in their contacts with providers. Asurprisingly high availability of third-party insurance is noted.Comparisons are made between this data base and selected national andregional surveys, and with family surveys from other groups assumed tobe disadvantaged in obtaining health care. The comparisons indicatesomewhat lower utilization rates and more problems in access to carefor this Navajo sample. The discussion suggests that attitudesregarding free health care eventually may be a factor for Navajopeople and other groups, that cultural considerations are often ignoredor accepted as truisms in delivering care, and that the NavajoReservation may serve as a unique microcosm of health care in the U.S. 8591 Westermeyer, J., Walker, D., and Benton E.*A Review of Some Methods for Investigating Substance AbuseEpidemiology Among American Indians and Alaska Natives\", White CloudJournal, (1981), 2 (2), 13-21.Since 1970 there has been increasing research interest in theepidemiological study of substance abuse among American Indians andAlaska Natives. A number of sampling and investigative strategies havebeen used with varying degrees af success. Among the samplingtechniques used in research among Indians are community surveys,captive audience surveys, clinical samples, mortality statistics,alcohol/drug-related arrest records, records of conviction foralcohol/drug offenses, and the social indicator method. Procedures andinstruments have included review of recorded data collected byinstitutions and agencies, serologic and breathalyzer tests,interviews, rating scales, questionnaires, collateral informants,psychological autopsy, and signs of alcohol addiction. Results haveshown that there is great variation between tribes in the degreesubstance abuse. No strong correlations between any of a number offactors tested have clearly illustrated ehe reason for variations inthe substance use between groups of American Indians and AlaskaNatives. 86 NON-ABSTRACTED CITATIONS Beiser, M. and Attneave, C.L.\"Mental Health Services for American Indians: Neither Feast norFamine\", in Hunan Services for Cultural Minorities.

These include: health manpower, the viability ofrural health facilities, gerontology, Native American health care, anduncompensated care.In addition to the research and policy activities of The Center, avariety of service programs designed to meet the basic needs of ruralhospitals, providers and communities are also provided. A briefoverview of the service activities of the Office of Rural HealthServices follows. Physician Recruitment. The Health Manpower Placement Program recruits,places, and assists in retaining primary care physicians for ruralcommunities.The program identifies stable, primary care physicianswho are interested in long-term practices in a rural areas. Thecommunity's manpower needs are carefully matched with the personal andprofessional needs of the individual physician.One of the features of t1-9. placement contract between The Center and acommunity is the Community Placemen, Report. Personal interviews areconducted with representatives of local hlalth facilities,administrators, physicians, community leaders, and others who mightinfluence local health care services and physician recruitment efforts.The interviews provide information about the local health carefacilities and services, community demographics, utilization patterns,and other aspects of the community important to maintaining localhealth care services and recruiting physicians.The Center works with contracted communities for up to two years.Through the continuing assistance, a community maintains access to theexpertise of Center staff during the initial months followingplacement. To identify physicians with the best potential forestablishing a rural practice, The Center individually contacts primarycare physicians throughout the country, and introduces them toavailable practice opportunities. We often contact the physiciansearly in their training to enhance placement.The Center does not simply place physicians; it matches physicians andspouses with communities. In addition to the above mentioned services,the program also includes the following services: credentialsscreening, community education, on-site visit r.!oordination, andadvertising.92 Community Assessment and Development Program. Marketing is a tool thathospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities con use to regaincontrol over utilization of services within the community. The Centeroffers five marketing services through the Community Assessment andDevelopment Program: education, research, audits, planning, andpromotion.Marketing Education. The Center's marketing education program has twocomponents:an executive level session and a staff level session.Each session addresses the th.:ee themes of marketing concepts,application, and roles. The s3ssions are oriented toward the uniqueneeds of two different audiences.The day-long executive session helps administrators, managers, boardmembers, department heads, and physicians learn that marketing is morethan advertising. Emphasis of the session is on meeting consumer needs(research and audits), identifying strategies and actions to satisfythose needs (planning), and methods for conveying the message to theconsumer (promotion).The staff level session is a two hour presentation. All employees playa pivotal role in creating L.I2stomer satisfaction. The staff session isspecifically designed to offer employees a basic understanding of themarke'ang concept. Emphasis is placed on the importance of theemployee to the success of the facility's marketing program.Marketing Research. The survey-based research process is used byhealth care facilities to learn the needs and wants of area healthconsumers.In addition to image studies, service needs studies andcompetition studies can be performed. Service needs studies revealwhat services people perceive as being needed in the area, whatservices they are likely to use, and the consumers' awareness ofpresent services. Competition studies focus on utilizution issues suchas why people use the facility, why they go elsewhere, and where theygo to have specific conditions treated.While image, sorvice needs, and competition are the three primary areasof focus under marketing research; these are not the exclusive studies.Special studies can also be initiated. kiarketing Audits. A marketing audit is both similar and dissimilar tomarketing research. They are alike in Chat both are an examination oran evaluation of an organization's environment, activities, andprocesses.However, marketing research is generally associated with anexternal environment whereas a marketing audit is identified with aninternal review. Another distinction is in the area of methodology.Marketing research is primarily a survey research based formatinvolving mail or telephone questionnaires, sampling techniques, andstatistical analysis. A marketing audit has as its methodology the useof one-on-one personal interviews, group discussion and review, andexisting data review. 9 3 9 fi A marketing audit satisfies six basic organizational needs, including:1) to collect background information about the organization, itscompetitors, and its marketplace; 2) to identify key environmentaltrends; 3) to identify strengths and weaknesses of the organization andits competitors; 4) to identify important opportunities to explore andthreats to plan for; 5) to identify potential market segments andtargets; and, 6) to create a framework to better understand consumerneeds and wants.Market Planning. In some ways marketing research and market auditshave retrospective qualities. They both focus on creating an analysisof an existing environment and the conditions that over time haveshaped that environment. A market based planning process hasprospective qualities because it forces the institution to takeexisting data and ask questions to determine the future. Market basedplanning is important in a total marketing process because once theenvironment has been assessed a critical need exists to identify anaction plan composed of specific strategies of change. Promotion.A final marketing service is that of promotional material.A critical juncture in the marketing education process is therealization that marketing is not synonymous with advertising.Promotional strategies are created to communicate, educate, inform, andinfluence.Promotion is simply one part of a total marketing mix withadvertising representing one type of promotional mix. Otherpromotional strategies involve the use of newsletters, annual reports,billboards and posters.AcNocacv Program. The advocacy program is directed at fostering thedevelopment of linkages by rural communities with appropriateassociations, state legislatures, congressional delegations, and thefederal bureaucracy. Much of the change in health care (e.g.prospective payment system, case-mix management, and sole communityprovider status) originates in the legislative-political arena. TheAdvocacy Program is designed to empower rural-based providers with theknowledge and skills to interact with legislators and politicalinstitutions.Key components of the Advocacy Program include a woeking session onassociations and information resources, a workshop on legislativeadvocacy, ard a planning session to develop an annual advocacy plan.This process moves from as assessment of present information andassociation linkages to a thorough review of the federal and statepolitical process to an action plan complete with activities andresponsibilities.cealition Building. The experiences gained by The Center over theyears has provided the conceptual and methodological foundation forembarking on coalition building in rural communities. Coalitionbuilding assists rural communities to maximize their resources, forexample, networking and coordinating among several communities qpuldprovide those communities with a financial resource to develop andoperate a new and innovative health care service.94 100 Thera are three key components to coalition building. First is eheidentification of local leaders from various sectors in a community -health, education, religion, commerce and government. These leadersare brought together to form a team and develop a relationship ofmutual interdependence. Second is community-wide involvement. This isachieved in a nudber of ways, town meetings and presentations to localorganizations, to name a few. Third is a focal point for communitycummitment.This comas about when the local leaders with broadercommunity input establishes priorities and begins to implement anaction plan.The role of The Center is to facilitate the bringing together ofcommunities.By assessing their current situation ehrough any numberof means (e.g. survey, needs assessment), The Center can empowercommunities to take the needed steps to create a more unified healthcare system, promote effective use of health resources, and provide forgreater access to health care services in rural areas. Grants Development. The Grarts Development Program is an integralfunction of the overall structure of The Center for Rurdl Health. TheCenter has traditionally operated on a majority of \"soft\" funds derivedfrom grants and contract funding. As a result, proposals areconstantly under development related to innovative and creativeprograms in rural health.Examples of grants and contract proposals developed by The Centerinclude: transition support for rural hospitals anticipating closure,nutrition education, quality assurance in frontier and ru--al areas,develemment of long-term care cooperatives, support of leadershiptraining for rural residents, and a variety of health manpowerprograms.An educational seminar on grantsmanship skills in the health field isunder development. The seminar will focus on teaching basicgrantsmanship skills to persons with limited or no grant writingexperience.It is anticipated that the first sessions will occur inthe Fall, 1988. Other grantsmanship services provided by The Centerinclude literature searches, performing critiques of grants, andidentification of funding sources. 951 n For further informationcontact:The Center for RuralHealthUniversity of North DakotaSchool of Medicine501 Columbia RoadGrand Forks, North Dakota 58201(701) 777-3848 1 02 The Center for Rural HealthUniversity of North Dakota School of Medicine 103 "}
