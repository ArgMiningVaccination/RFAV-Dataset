Read Full LicensePage 3/29Abstract Background and objective: Integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine (ITCWM), as a representative type of complex intervention, is commonly used for the treatment of angina pectoris (AP) in clinical practice. However, it is unclear whether the details of ITCWM interventions, such as selection rationale, implementation, study design and potential interactions, were adequately reported. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the quality of reporting in the ITCWM interventional randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Through a search of 7 international electronic databases, we identi\u0000ed RCTs of AP with ITCWM interventions published in both English and Chinese from 1st Jan 2017 to 6th Aug 2022. The general characteristics of included studies were summarized, further, the quality of reporting was assessed based on three Checklists, including the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) with 36 items (except for one item 1b about abstract), the CONSORT for abstracts (17 items), and a self-designed ITCWM-related checklist (21 items covering design rationale, intervention details, outcome assessment and analysis). The quality of RCTs published in English journals, Chinese journals and dissertations were also compared. Results: A total of 451 eligible RCTs were included. For the reporting compliance, the mean score (standard deviation) of the CONSORT (72 score in total), CONSORT for abstract (34 score in total), and ITCWM-related (42 score in total) checklists was 35.67 (4.02), 13.17 (2.14), and 20.93 (3.95), respectively. More than 50% items were evaluated as poor quality (reporting rate\u000050%) among each Checklist. Moreover, the reporting quality of publications in English journals was signi\u0000cantly higher than that in Chinese journals regarding the CONSORT compliance (p<0.05), but there were no differences among journals regarding the CONSORT for Abstract and ITCWM-related reporting (p>0.05). The reporting of dissertations was better than journal publications in comparison of the CONSORT and ITCWM-related items (p<0.05). Conclusion: Although CONSORT appears to have enhanced the reporting of RCTs in AP, the quality of ITCWM speci\u0000cs is variable and in need of improvement. Reporting guideline of the ITCWM recommendations should be developed thus to improve their quality. Introduction Angina pectoris (AP), as a type of ischemic heart diseases (IHD), is presented by recurrent chest discomforts (radiate up to the neck or jaw, or down either arm or to the epigastric area) due to physical exertion or emotional distress [1, 2]. In clinical practice, AP usually de\u0000ned as an early warning signal for various underlying heart diseases, although its symptoms were hidden (such as crescendos over a period of minutes while dissipates with rest or nitroglycerin treatment) [3, 4]. For example, some studies found that patients with stable AP had higher rates of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke, and lower quality of life than those without AP [5, 6]. Currently, the common therapies of APPage 4/29include pharmacological and invasive treatments, but several adverse effects are unavoidable, including renal failure, hepatotoxicity, bleeding complications, anaphylaxis, and hematologic abnormalities, etc. Furthermore, the medical and surgical expenses in treating AP are expensive [7, 8, 9]. Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is more accepted by AP patients as its straightforward effect with few side effects, and inexpensive [10]. Based on previous evidence, TCM interventions could relieve myocardial ischemia, reduce myocardial oxygen consumption, exert antiplatelet and anticoagulant activity, and relieve pain [11, 12]. In China, most patients preferred integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine (ITCWM) over TCM or WM alone [13, 14, 15]. Scholars have identi\u0000ed the promising therapeutical results of ITCWM interventions for the treatment of AP for decades, after the \u0000rst ITCWM interventional trial of AP was published in 1994 [16, 17]. To standard the clinical practice, scholars made lots of efforts. Speci\u0000cally, the \u0000rst guideline of ITCWM treatment protocol for AP was developed in 2010 [18]. In 2017, an international consensus-based recommendations for TCM personalized treatment protocol of AP was issued [19]. During 2018-2022, several standards or guidelines for AP with ITCWM interventions have been published and updated [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Consequently, an increasing number of ITCWM interventional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for AP was registered and conducted, but the quality of these RCTs is variable. Previous systematic reviews (SRs) with meta-analyses (MAs) indicated that there is a large room for improvements of the included RCTs, particular in methodological quality [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. Appraisal of the trial quality largely depends on the reporting level of study design, implementation, and analysis. Although poor reporting does not necessarily mean poor methodology or trial quality, it is an essential indicator for reviewers and readers to evaluate the reliability and validity of trial \u0000ndings. However, no previous study has assessed whether ITCWM-related aspects (e.g., selection rationale, implementation, study design and potential interactions) are su\u0000ciently reported in the published RCTs of AP; indeed, no study has identi\u0000ed what key information affecting the quality of research should be described in the reports. Therefore, the present review is designed i) to summarize general characteristics from published RCTs concerning ITCWM for AP; ii) to assess the reporting quality of these trials based on the CONSORT; and iii) to evaluate whether necessary information related to ITCWM design, implementation and analysis is adequately reported based on a self-designed ITCWM checklist. Methods Eligibility Criteria This study included ITCWM interventional RCTs of AP published in English and Chinese from 1st January 2017 to 6th August 2022. Subjects with a de\u0000nite diagnosis of AP, regardless of age, gender, type of disease and severity, were included. The ITCWM intervention was de\u0000ned as a combination of TCM treatments and western medicine (WM) therapies. Speci\u0000cally, we included a wide range of TCM interventions, such as Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture and moxibustion. WM also included a various form of pharmaceutical or revascularization intervention, such as percutaneous coronaryPage 5/29intervention (PCI), external counter pulsation and coronary angioplasty bypass grafting (CABG). There were no limitations in the types of control groups and the assessed outcomes. Duplicate publications, non-randomized or non-controlled trials, quasi-RCTs, non-ITCWM interventional trials, study protocols, reviews, observational studies, case reports, abstracts or non-full-text reports, non-human studies, and non-English or non-Chinese reports were excluded. For publications in Chinese, we also excluded the articles published in non-core journals of China technology [32]. Search Strategy A systematic search was conducted on 6th August 2022 for the following databases: All EBM Reviews, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang Database and VIP Chinese Medical Journal Database. The search terms were The detailed search strategy is presented in Supplementary \u0000le 1. Study Selection Two review authors (JSD and JW) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved records based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full reports of any potentially relevant papers were reviewed and double-checked for further assessment of eligibility. Differences of opinion were settled by consensus or referral to a third review author (XZ). Data Extraction We developed a data extraction form about general characteristics of included records, including title, publication year and language, information of corresponding author(s), types of paper (dissertation or journal publication), study design (e.g., assignment and sample size), features of interventions, participants (e.g., types of AP and TCM patterns), and outcome(s). Two trained authors (JSD and JW) independently extracted the data, and another two review authors (XZ and NNW) conducted a second check. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Reporting Quality Assessment The reporting quality of included studies was evaluated according to a standard checklist of the CONSORT 2010 statement, of which the checklist of the CONSORT for Abstract was extracted for independent evaluation. In addition, a special-designed checklist comprised of 21 items related to speci\u0000c, unique characteristics of ITCWM interventional trials was formulated (Table 1) based on internal discussion by \u0000ve researchers (XZ, JL, PW, FH and ZXB). This checklist focused on the identi\u0000cation of critical issues in the design, implementation and assessment of ITCWM interventions, particular in thePage 6/29selection rationale, details of combination, e\u0000cacy assessment, and potential interaction (if applicable). Each item/question was scored in terms of three levels: For rating the CONSORT items, the assessment principles were referred to the CONSORT 2010 statement (including the CONSORT for Abstract guideline) with its explanation and elaboration (E&E) document [33, 34]. The details of scoring rules for ITCWM are presented in Supplementary \u0000le 2 which includes the explanations for each question and examples of eligible reporting. The quality assessment was independently conducted by one review author (JSD) and veri\u0000ed by another review author (JW). Possible disagreements were resolved with the consultation of a third senior review author (XZ).Page 7/29Table 1 Questions for assessing the reporting of ITCWM-speci\u0000c items Item no.Speci\u0000cs Q1 Whether the feature of ITCWM was presented in Title?

Abbreviation: ITCWM, integrated traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine; TCM, traditional Chinese medicine; WM, western medicine Data analysis We applied frequency and percentage to present categorical variables, and median and interquartile range (IQR) to present continuous variables. For individual item of reporting quality, the compliance rate was calculated with the number of items acquired \"2 scores\" based on the total number of included reports, which was further categorized as three levels: excellent compliance (>90%), good compliance (between 50% and 90%), and poor compliance (<50%). For the overall items of the CONSORT, the CONSORT for Abstract and ITCWM-speci\u0000c checklists, the reporting score was recorded as mean and standard deviations (SD). As type of publications was divided into journal paper (including English papers and Chinese papers) and Chinese dissertation, the comparisons of journal publications and dissertation, as well as publications in English and Chinese have been analyzed. All data were collected and recorded in Microsoft O\u0000ce Excel (Microsoft 365). Statistics analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 27.0. Results Search Result The initial search identi\u0000ed a total of 8,396 records, among which 1,082 studies were retained after excluding duplication or title and abstract screening. After reviewing the full text, 451 ITCWM interventional RCTs of AP were included for analysis (Fig. 1). Characteristics Of Included Trials Among 451 included studies from 1st January 2017 to 6th August 2022, the average number of publications was 92.75 before 2021. Started from 2021, a decreased by 56.87% was identi\u0000ed (Fig. 2). The most common design of intervention arm was Chinese herbal formulas (84.48%) plus pharmacological intervention (96.67%), with the median duration of treatment period and follow-up was 41 days (inter-quartile range 28-56) and 120 days (inter-quartile range 30-180), respectively. Most studies were published in Chinese (95.85%), and 77.38% trials with the sample size of 51-100. A total ofPage 9/29403 (89.14%) studies used both traditional Chinese and Western for AP diagnosis, of which 390 articles included TCM pattern criteria. The top 5 TCM pattern were Qi de\u0000ciency induced blood stasis pattern, intertwined phlegm and blood stasis pattern, Qi stagnation and blood stasis pattern, Qi de\u0000ciency and intertwined phlegm and blood stasis pattern, and blood stasis pattern (Fig. 3). In addition, 386 (85.59%) articles included TCM-related indicators for outcome assessments.

Ratings Of Overall Quality And Factors Associated With Reporting QualityPage 12/29The results of adherence to the CONSORT, the CONSORT for Abstract, and ITCWM-speci\u0000c checklist are presented in Tables 3, 4 and 5. For the completeness of the CONSORT checklist, the mean (SD) reporting score was 35.67 (4.02). Speci\u0000cally, the quality of reporting was excellent (2a, 4a, in 5 items (2b, 5, 8a, 19 and 20); 17a, 17b, 21, 23, 24 and 25). Moreover, for the CONSORT for Abstract, the mean (SD) reporting score was 13.17 (2.14). The quality of reporting was excellent (>90%) in 2 items (6 and 15); good (50-90%) in 2 item (2 and 10); and poor (<50%) in 13 items (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17). In comparison, the mean reporting score of the ITCWM- speci\u0000c items was 20.93 (3.95), relatively low. Except for \"excellent\" items markedly low (<30%), covering the identi\u0000cation of ITCWM in the title and keywords, provide objectives or hypotheses of ITCWM design, the rationale of blinding or open label in ITCWM trials, details for placebo design, baseline data relevant to ITCWM, and interpretation of studied ITCWM interventions. For the subgroup analysis, the reporting score of Chinese papers was lower than that in English papers regarding the CONSORT assessment (p<0.05). Furthermore, the reporting of dissertations (in Chinese) was better than that in journal papers (in both English and Chinese) in the CONSORT and ITCWM-speci\u0000c evaluation (p<0.05).Page 13/29Table 3 Reporting quality of included trials based on the CONSORT checklist and ITCWM-speci\u0000c items* Section/topic Item number and description Fully reported (2 score), N (%) Title and abstract1a.

Clear reporting of diagnosis is the key for ITCWM- related studies [36]. Although 89.14% studies diagnosed AP according to both TCM and WM criteria, however, some trials represented inadequate reporting, such as did not specify the types of AP, or TCM diagnosis reference. Through the calculation of TCM patterns included in the articles, three critical pattern elements of \"Qi de\u0000ciency\", \"Intertwined phlegm\", and \"Blood stasis\" were identi\u0000ed as major pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, which is consistent with the mechanism recognition of WM [37]. Among TCM various interventions, Chinese herbal formula was the most common therapy (84.48%), but 14.41% studies did not include TCM related outcome for e\u0000cacy assessment. The inconsistent adoptionPage 20/29of TCM pattern, Chinese herbal formula intervention, and TCM outcome assessments would induce potential problems in terms of appropriate evaluation for ITCWM designed studies [38]. Quality Assessment Of The Consort Regarding the reporting compliance of the CONSORT items, the average reporting rate was 42.64% (ranging from 0 to 100%). 20 items were reported poorly (<50%), most of which (55%, 11/20) related to methodological domains, such as trial design (item 3a and 3b), primary and secondary outcome measures (item 6a and 6b), sample size (items 7a and 7b), sequence generation (items 8b), allocation concealment mechanism (item 9), randomization implementation (item 10), blinding (item 11a), and statistical methods (item 12a). Previous studies have indicated that the methodology-related items are crucial for the assessment of bias risk and the reliability of reported effects [39, 40, 41]. Other items, including title (item 1a), losses and exclusions after randomization (item 13b), dates of recruitment and follow-up (item 14a), outcome (item 17a and 17b), generalizability (item 21), registration (item 23), protocol (item 24), and funding (item 25) were also reported poorly. Skepticism and criticism invited by inadequate reporting of trial registration, protocol, and ethical approval signi\u0000cantly damage the values of RCTs for AP [42]. In addition, a considerable number of the CONSORT for Abstract items were missing or incompletely reported; the average reporting rate was only 30.86%, with a range of 0 to 100%. 13 items (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17) were reported poorly, covering several sections of \"Title\", \"Trial design\", \"Methods\", \"Results\" and \"Other information\". In a manuscript, the \"Abstract\" is designed to highlight key points of the research, which provides crucial details to facilitate readers' understanding and decide whether it is relevant to their interests [43]. This review found that the reporting of Abstracts should be urgently improved. Generally, the international journals have a better endorsement of the CONSORT than those in Chinese journals. In this review, we also found that the reporting score of the CONSORT in English papers was higher than that in Chinese papers (p<0.05), which is similar to previous studies [44]. However, there was no signi\u0000cant difference regarding the CONSORT for Abstract (p>0.05). Thus, more attention should be paid to the reporting of Abstracts of ITCWM interventional RCTs for AP. Quality Assessment Of Itcwm-speci\u0000c Items For ITCWM items, the average reporting rate was 49.24%, with a range of 2-100%. The least reported information about ITCWM details can be summarized in the following aspects: identi\u0000cation of ITCWM in title and keywords, the rationale of the ITCWM was being used, trial design of ITCWM, and the description of ITCWM interventions. It is important for subsequent research in this \u0000eld that readers can clearly distinguish different research areas from thousands of literatures and recognize the signi\u0000cance of the use of ITCWM therapy. The \u0000rst identi\u0000er, with no doubt, includes the title and keywords. Further, the details of the implementations with related factors for quality control are essential for the replication of trials [45, 46, 47]. Unfortunately, in this study, we still found unsatisfactory reporting for ITCWM interventions although relevant reporting guidelines were issued, either the CONSORT 2010 or its Extensions (e.g., CONSORT Extension for Chinese Herbal Medicine Formulas 2017) [38]. In thePage 21/29comparison of different subgroups, we found that the reporting quality in Chinese Dissertations was better than those in journal publications regarding the ITCWM speci\u0000cs (p<0.05). This could be attributed to the page and words limitations for Chinese journal publications. Additionally, as the Dissertation is the basis for scholars to obtain their degree, higher requirements of quality were included [48]. Thus, more attention should be paid on Dissertations in the \u0000eld of ITCWM interventional RCTs for AP. Improvement Measures And Suggestions According to the de\u0000ciencies of reporting identi\u0000ed in this study, speci\u0000c improvements are needed. Previous \u0000ndings con\u0000rm that guidelines do help improve the quality of reporting. Therefore, editors and reviewers should be more rigorous in their requirements that authors should adhere to the reporting standards of the CONSORT (especially for the CONSORT for Abstract) in RCTs. There are two paths forward: strengthen reporting of the CONSORT and develop a series of standard reporting items relevant to RCTs with ITCWM interventions [49]. Limitations This study has some limitations. First, we only identi\u0000ed RCTs of AP with ITCWM published from 1st January 2017 to 6th August 2022 in English and Chinese, so we have not assessed other trials published before 2017 or in other languages. Second, methodology quality (e.g., using a Cochrane tool) assessment was not conducted because this review focused on the reporting quality. Although the results of this review may not necessarily be comprehensive, we do believe that the general trends indicated by this study are valid. Conclusion Without complete and transparent reporting of how a RCTs of AP with ITCWM was designed and implemented, it is di\u0000cult for readers to assess the reliability and validity of trial \u0000ndings. Although the CONSORT does improve the quality of reporting, developing standard reporting items speci\u0000cally relevant to ITCWM interventional RCTs as an extension to the CONSORT might be an effective means to achieving the improvement needed.
