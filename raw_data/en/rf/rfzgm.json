I am a Doctor of chiropractic and a specialist in corrective exercise. We will start with the body mind connection. The body has an amazing ability to heal itself as long as the body has the ability to communicate back with the brain. Nerves! Nerves are what helps the brain coordinate the function of all the tissues, organs and systems in the body. Every thing works because the brain tells it how to work through our nervous system. So how does this relate to chiropractic? Well first of all I have to explain to you what chiropractic is. Chiropractic is the #1 way to relieve neck and back pain. It is also natural way to relieve pain especially headaches, neck and back pain as mentioned before and shoulder, knee, wrist, arm, foot, and ankle pain. Traditional chiropractic deals with the spinal vertebral column or your back bone . The Spine is made up of 24 vertebrae which look like building blocks sitting one on top of another. These blocks are separated by disc or spacers that help to absorb movement forces. Within your spine runs your spinal cord , which we just talked about. Your spinal cord exits the spine through holes between the vertebrae and travels as spinal nerves to all your muscles organs and tissues in your body. Pain and dysfunction occur when the vertebrae stop moving correctly, due to time injury or imbalance. They literally start sticking together allowing pressure to build up within the joint irritating your spinal cord and spinal nerves. Irritation to the nerves will cause pain along with muscle, joint, and possibly organ dysfunction. Pain is different in different people, but the one thing that is common between people with pain is it doesn't allow you to live your life fully. When you are in pain you don't enjoy everyday activities, your family, or your hobbies when you are in pain. Pain can be dull, achy, stiffness, sharp, shooting, throbbing, pounding, numbing, tingling or even just a weird feeling! Balance Chiropractic is a modern chiropractic office, but for the people who have been to chiropractors before I want to talk about traditional chiropractic . Traditional Chiropractors typically will always take an x-ray of your neck and back before they treat you. Traditional chiropractors will just adjust, they don't believe in working on muscles in combination wit adjustments. Many times you will have to go threw a treatment plan where you will have to come 30 -40 visits no matter what your condition is. Also the benefits of \"just\" getting adjusted decrease if care is discontinued, and there is not a lot of long term relief for chronic problems. They don't give you tools to help your self. Modern chiropractors will use a variety of different therapies, which include manual and instrument assisted adjusting, muscle therapy including massage, stretching, electronic muscle stimulation, physical rehabilitation, nutritional therapies, and weight loss or life style coaching plans to keep you healthy. Balance Chiropractic + Rehab is a multifunctional holistic health center, our focus is the whole person. Our specialties are chiropractic, Manual muscle therapy, stretching, \"True\" Specific Functional rehab programs, whole body vibration therapy, custom foot orthotics, and nutritional internal functional medicine. In our office we see three different types of problems. Acute problems, chronic problems, and permanent problems. An example of an acute problem would be a sprained ankle, an injury from a slip, fall or car accident. A chronic problem is a problem that persists over time. Many times these will be constant neck, low back or shoulder pain that never goes away. These types of problems in most cases need physical rehab to fixed along with muscle work and adjustments. Then there are the permanent problems. I see these most commonly in people who have tried to be \"tuff\" most of there lives, they've lived with chronic pain and dysfunction and didn't do anything about it. When they finally have decided to come in we can't reverse the degenerative process we can only manage it to keep the pain and dysfunction from becoming worse! Low back pain is the second most common ailment or complaint in our country. Second only to the Common Cold. Over 11.5 billion dollars are spent each year on back surgery. Most adult complaints of back pain are related to trauma to their spine that occurred in their childhood or adolescence. Most adult complaints of back pain are related to trauma to their spine that occurred in their childhood or adolescence. Most of the problems that we see in our office can be described as being, \"Old Problems\" from accidents, injuries, slips, and falls! That means that when we study a new patient, most of the time we find evidence indicating that the problem has been around for months and years, even though the patient may have been feeling the problem for just days or weeks. The most common conditions we treat in our office our Headaches, Neck Pain, Shoulder tightness and stiffness, midback pain, rib pain, lower back pain, leg pain , ankle , knee, and foot pain. At Balance Chiropractic we use a unique whole body approach called combination therapy. If you have tried drugs, pills, just chiropractic, just massage, or just physical therapy without getting results. There Is a great possibility that you can benefit from combination therapy. We use gentle adjustments along with muscle work and stretching to relieve tension from your muscles and joints. Deep tissue massage breaks up knots in your muscles and helps to increase blood flow enhancing the healing process. Electric muscle stimulation helps to to reactivate tight tense muscles. Intersegmental traction therapy helps to stretch out muscles and increase movement within the joints of your spine. True rehab programs A true rehabilitation and exercise program can help people realize exactly which type of exercises can help them target the muscles and joints which are tight tender, overactive, weak, deconditioned restricted , and/or injured. These plans are designed to help you for the long term. Many people have not had the opportunity to try a supervised rehabilitation program and they may feel as though they just may have to live with the discomfort or weaknesses they are experiencing. Really, you just have to try some thing different. If you are experiencing the same treatment over and over and not getting the results you are looking for, another option, a true rehab program could be a great fit for you. Whole body vibration Whole body vibration training can help practically anyone experience a new way to get in shape, improve flexibility and rehabilitate chronic pain or injured areas while preventing future injuries from occurring. Every participant is taken through a full body functional exam to target weak an imbalanced muscles. Build a healthy foundation If you are run down, get sickness and colds easily feel week and fatigued a functional nutrition plan is for you. We can stimulate and re-balance your internal body systems allowing you to feel better and get back in balance. Functional nutrition protocols build up and strengthen your body systems. Which is the opposite of medicine that treats a symptom, leaving your body imbalanced causing more symptoms and problems. Drugs aren't bad This doesn't mean drugs are bad! There is a time and a place for medication medical doctors can do amazing things for disease and illness Functional nutrition therapy works with the bodies internal organ systems. We use natural vitamins, supplements, and herbs to rebalance and heal specific body systems that are imbalanced causing sickness and disease. We have Nutritional Protocols for many different problems including PMS, Menopause Symptoms, digestive issues, Fatigue, sleep problems, immune issues, people going through chemo-therapy, anxiety, depression, and weight loss just to name a few. Chiropractic isn't just getting \"cracked\"! It isn't coming back over and over, it isn't a cure all, it works great for some things and not so great for others. Don't get fooled, do your research before you pick a chiropractor. A good chiropractor should work with insurance networks, a good chiropractor should do regular re-evaluations and keep you updated on your care and progress with your treatment. You should not have to pay thousands of dollars up front for care, x-rays are not always required, getting an x-ray should be taken on a case by case basis. Chiropractic is not the the magic recipe, its not the alpha and omega, it's a tool that you can use to live a healthier fuller life with less pain. Right now only about 10% of the population utilize chiropractic and and alternative healthcare, but that is the healthiest 10% percent of the population don't be part "}
