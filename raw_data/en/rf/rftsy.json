(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the companies have submitted regulatory applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 6 months of age and older. These filings follow guidance from the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) to manufacture an Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine for the 2023-2024 fall and winter season. The Omicron XBB sublineages currently account for nearly all COVID-19 cases in the U.S.i and are further antigenically distant from prior circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. Although Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccines provide some protection against a range of outcomes from XBB-related COVID-19,ii evidence suggests that vaccines better matched to currently circulating sublineages can help further improve protection against symptomatic disease and severe COVID-19.iii The U.S. regulatory applications are based on the full body of clinical, pre-clinical, and real-world evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccines. Following guidance from regulatory authorities on the requirements for strain changes, the applications include data showing that the Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine generates improved responses against circulating XBB sublineages, compared to the current Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. The companies have manufactured Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccines at risk to ensure readiness ahead of the fall and winter season. Pending regulatory review and approval, the companies expect to be ready to ship Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccines immediately. Pfizer and BioNTech have also [submitted an application](/news/announcements/pfizer-and-biontech-initiate-application-european-medicines-agency-omicron-xbb15) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and expect to initiate submissions to other regulatory authorities in the coming weeks. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccines (COMIRNATY\u00ae) are based on BioNTech's proprietary mRNA technology and were developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder for BNT162b2 (Original) and BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries, and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. BioNTech is also the Biologics License Holder for BNT162b2 (Original) in the United States. INDICATION & AUTHORIZED USE AUTHORIZED USE Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) is FDA authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 6 months of age and older. EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent has not been approved or licensed by FDA, but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA, under an EUA to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for use in individuals aged 6 months of age and older.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Tell your vaccination provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: - have any allergies - have had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) - have a fever - have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner - are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects the immune system - are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding - have received another COVID-19 vaccine - have ever fainted in association with an injection The vaccine may not protect everyone A person should NOT get Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent if they have had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine*, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent, or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) or to any ingredients in these vaccines. There is a remote chance that the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received the vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. If you experience a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest hospital Seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms: - difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over the body, dizziness, and weakness Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, or COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA). The observed risk is higher among adolescent males and adult males under 40 years of age than among females and older males, and the observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low. Seek medical attention right away if the vaccine recipient has any of the following symptoms: - Chest pain - Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing - Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart Additional symptoms, particularly in children, may include: - Fainting - Unusual and persistent irritability - Unusual and persistent poor feeding - Unusual and persistent fatigue or lack of energy - Persistent vomiting - Persistent pain in the abdomen - Unusual and persistent cool, pale skin Fainting can happen after getting injectable vaccines, including Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received the vaccine for monitoring after vaccination People with weakened immune systems may have a reduced immune response to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent Side effects that have been reported with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, or COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) include: - Severe allergic reactions - Non-severe allergic reactions such as rash, itching, hives, or swelling of the face - Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) - Pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) - Injection site pain/tenderness - Tiredness - Headache - Muscle pain - Chills - Joint pain - Fever - Injection site swelling - Injection site redness - Nausea - Feeling unwell - Swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) - Decreased appetite - Diarrhea - Vomiting - Arm pain - Fainting in association with injection of the vaccine - Dizziness - Irritability These may not be all the possible side effects of these vaccines. Call the vaccination provider or healthcare provider about bothersome side effects or side effects that do not go away. Individuals should always ask their healthcare providers for medical advice about adverse events. Report vaccine side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
