Say it one way and you are golden, say it another way and you are in big trouble. When it comes to the FDA, they are very particular about any health claims being backed up by testing and their evaluation of the results. They are so particular that they scour the internet looking for unsubstantiated claims on product websites as well as company social media accounts such as Facebook and Twitter. Once they find a company in violation, they send a warning letter about misbranded products to the offender and demand immediate action to correct the violation. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the FDA has sent out numerous warning letters to companies that have made claims their product can prevent, fight, or cure Covid 19. The FDA doesn't even care if you are in the United States. They will send a warning letter if your site even remotely looks like you sell to customers in the USA. They do all of this to protect American consumers from misinformation and snake oil salesmen. What does it matter if I'm not based in the US? The FDA can't do anything to me just because US customers choose to buy my products. Well, the FDA may not be able to do anything directly to your company, but they can make sure you are hit just as hard financially as every other importer that violates the law. The FDA is a Partner Government Agency (PGA) with US Customs and Border Patrol. This means the FDA and CBP work together to stop dangerous and contraband goods from entering the US. The FDA usually considered mislabeled supplements and homeopathic remedies to be illegal drugs. If CBP finds anything the FDA says is illegal, CBP will seize the shipment. They may choose to release the shipment to be reexported, or they may choose to destroy the contents of the entire shipment. Either way, you as the importer get to pay all the demurrage fees, exam fees, and if you are lucky, the cost of shipping this back from whence it came. If you import to the United States, you must obey US laws. It is far better to stay out of trouble than to try to dig yourself out of trouble. The best way to stay out of trouble is to pay attention to FDA regulations regarding what verbiage is allowed on the packaging of supplements and homeopathic remedies, websites selling these items, and product literature produced by the importer. Companies cannot post or tweet that their supplement or homeopathic product can mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 (or any other disease) in people. These claims cannot be in the form of a quote from a client or a doctor, nor can any reference be made to an article or another website that in some way states or even implies your product can mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19. Making such claims pushes your product out of unregulated supplement status and into a FDA highly regulated drug status. It is one thing for me to write an article on my blog about the miraculous curing properties of oil of oregano and how using this product for decades at the slightest sign of a cough or stuffy nose enabled all three of my kids to make it through their entire school careers with only missing 4 days total among them, but it is quite another thing if my blog is part of my website where I sell oil of oregano. So this raises the question, what can you say about your product in order to advertise it and let consumers know what it is used for? Well, this is where you have to be very careful what you say and how you say it. The FDA allows three types of claims to be used on the label or in advertising (website, tweets, brochures, etc.): health claims, qualified health claims, and structure/function claims. Health claims describe the relationship between a dietary supplement and the reduced risk of a disease or health-related condition. Any health claim used for selling a product is subject to premarket review and authorization by the FDA. You might have some great product that you firmly believe will boost people's immune system and help them stay alive during this pandemic. You and everyone you know has been using it for years to successfully fend off the flu and every other virus your kids bring home from school. Good intentions and anecdotal evidence is not good enough for the FDA. The \"FDA will issue regulations authorizing health claims only when it determines, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner that is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles) that there is significant agreement, among experts qualified by training or experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by the scientific evidence.\" (Federal Register March 5, 1996) The FDA does not want just one study to support the claim; they want a hundred. In fact, the FDA has only approved about a dozen health claims for food and dietary supplements. (If you enjoy reading legal code on the weekends like I do, you can find these in 21 CFR 101.70-101.83.) The FDA is very conservative about what it approves. For example, there is lots of evidence floating around that shows zinc has the ability to boost one's immune system, but that evidence does not pass muster with the FDA. They did not approve the health claim petition that zinc boosts immune function in the elderly. So this means it is probably not a good idea to be advertising that the zinc you sell can fight off Covid. For health claims the FDA has approved, they have issued a \"model\" health claim to be used on applicable products. For example, the FDA has approved a health claim between calcium, Vitamin D, and osteoporosis: \"Adequate calcium as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life.\" Not exactly a statement that infuses me, a person where every single female relative over 60 suffers from osteoporosis, with confidence that this will prevent me from succumbing to the same fate. As I said before, the FDA is very conservative when it comes to what it approves. So what if there is a bunch of scientific research out there showing a supplement helps with a disease, but the research does not quite meet FDA requirements to issue an approved health claim? That is where qualified health claims come in. Qualified health claims (QHCs) are supported by scientific evidence, but do not meet the more rigorous \"significant scientific agreement\" standard required for an authorized health claim. To ensure that these claims are not misleading, they must be accompanied by a disclaimer or other qualifying language to accurately communicate to consumers the level of scientific evidence supporting the claim. Ocean Spray Cranberry Inc, a cranberry juice and supplement manufacturer, petitioned the FDA for approval of a health claim showing a relationship between consumption of cranberries and a reduction in urinary tract infections for women. The FDA denied the health claim petition but approved the subsequent qualified health claim petition. Like health claims, the FDA approves what claim can be printed on the product and advertisements. An example of a qualified health claim approved for cranberry supplements is \"Limited scientific evidence shows that by consuming 500 mg each day of cranberry dietary supplement, healthy women who have had a urinary tract infection (UTI) may reduce their risk of recurrent UTI.\" Even though Ocean Spray did all the work, any company that sells cranberry juice or supplements can benefit. Once a Letter of Enforcement Discretion (approval letter for qualified health claims) has been issued, it is public record and the qualified health claims approved by the FDA in it are free for anyone to use. If you are curious whether or not the FDA has issued a Qualified Health Claim for your products, visit the FDA website at [https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/qualified-health-claims-letters-enforcement-discretion](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/qualified-health-claims-letters-enforcement-discretion). You can read all about the studies they reviewed and exactly what you are allowed to put on your product label in each of the approval letters linked on the page. What are your options if no one has gone to the work of petitioning the FDA for health claim or qualified health claim approval and you don't want to do it either but there is still a ton of evidence out there that your supplement can help people? That leaves you with the option of stating the obvious - structure/function claims. Structure/function claims may describe how a supplement affects the normal structure or function of the human body. These claims are general wellbeing claims that describe general wellbeing from consumption of a nutrient. In other words, you can say a nutrient is used by the body to make a part of the body. For example, you can say \"calcium builds strong bones\" because bones are normally strong and calcium is used to build bones. You cannot say \"calcium prevents osteoporosis\" or \"calcium prevents brittle bones.\" These two statements would violate the approved health claim regulation for calcium. Even though \"brittle bones\" is not a disease, it is generally accepted that \"brittle bones\" refers to osteoporosis, which is a disease. Substituting symptoms of a disease to imply your product can stave off that disease is also a no-no. Or you can say a nutrient is used by the body to stay healthy. For example, you can say \"antioxidants maintain cell integrity,\" but you can't say \"antioxidants fight cancer.\" There is ample scientific evidence in scientific literature that describes scientifically how antioxidants maintain cell integrity, and since this is a general statement supported by scientific facts that does not make any sort of health claim or specific claim about the product, it is allowable for use with products containing antioxidants. You also have to make sure you don't accidentally make a claim about a sign or symptom that is characteristic of a disease. For example, \"reduces cholesterol\" might seem like a safe claim except that high cholesterol is a sign or symptom associated with stroke and cardiovascular disease, so \"reduces cholesterol\" is actually an implied disease claim. A safe version of this would be \"maintains cholesterol levels that are already in a normal range.\" The FDA recommends looking in medical text or other such sources to determine what key words are signs or symptoms of a disease. However, some symptoms like absentmindedness might refer to Alzheimer's disease or it might just refer to stressed out mothers of toddlers or those of us with more gray hair than we would like to admit. In this case, \"improves absentmindedness\" would be fine to use in advertising a product or placing on a label. These structure/function claims must be accompanied with a little cross at the end and a box nearby stating that \"This statement has not been evaluated by he FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\" I'm sure you have seen this on your bottle of Vitamin C right next to where it says \"supports the immune system.\" This disclaimer needs to be on your product, your website, and everywhere else you make a structure/function claim. Now you can't just put any claim you want on your label with that little cross next to it. According to the law, you must have substantiation that the claim is truthful and not misleading. In layman's terms, you need to have at least one very well done scientific study to back up exactly what you claim about your product. Homeopathic products get a little more leeway as long as you are very clear about the lack of scientific data backing up your claim. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), who works with the FDA to enforce advertising claims, has issues an Enforcement Policy Statement specifically about marketing claims for homeopathic drugs explaining their stance on this issue. Also remember to notify the FDA that you are using this claim at least 30 days before marketing your product. A few more \"can't dos\" to keep in mind: You can't use pictures or symbols to get around these rules. Generally speaking, a picture of a healthy organ would be considered a structure/function claim, and a picture of a unhealth organ or abnormal tissue would be an implied disease claim. You also can't name your product something like CancerCure or RenalRecovery and expect the FDA to not consider these disease claims. As the importer, it is up to you, not your manufacturer, to make sure your product labels are compliant with FDA regulations. The FDA has a lot of information on its website to help US manufacturers and importers know what is required of them. It may take a few hours to wade through the plethora of information, but it is worth you figuring it out before the FDA figures out you are breaking the law. Clean up your website, Facebook, and Instagram; delete non-compliant tweets; and fix those supplement labels before you import them. Mind what you say and how you say it. "}
