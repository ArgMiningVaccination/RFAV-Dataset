About Vaccines Vaccines are a contentious topic right now, and that's on purpose. The media and the doctors don't want people to be asking questions, or thinking that vaccines \u2014 like any other medical decision \u2014 might not be one-size-fits-all. This leaves a lot of families trapped in the middle. If they question vaccines, they're immediately branded as \"anti-vaccine\" and are ridiculed and told they're stupid. We think that's ridiculous. No medical choices are one-size-fits-all, and it's smart to ask questions and be discerning. There absolutely is a debate about what is best, and the answer isn't going to be the same for all families, or all children within one family. We're taking the conversation back, and supporting families in looking through the science and making their own decisions.
