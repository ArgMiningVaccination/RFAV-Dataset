( [2](https://www.healthcanal.com/nutrition/balance-of-nature-review#:~:text=Balance%20of%20Nature%20offers%20a,twelve%20spices%20called%20Fiber%20%26%20Spice.)) Pros Cons About Texas Superfood Texas Superfood is also a superfood supplement. It is made from a special combination of fifty-five raw vegetables, vine-ripened fruits, enzymes, grasses, herbs, and algae. It is a whole food dietary supplement. ( [3](https://www.dietspotlight.com/texas-superfood-review/)) Texas Superfood is non-GMO, sugar-free, and does not contain nuts, gluten, soy, or dairy ingredients. There are different ways of taking Texas Superfood supplements. It is available either as Texas Superfood capsules or in the form of fiber and spice powder. Texas Superfood has several benefits, including: - Improved organ function and overall health - Elevated mood - Healthy skin - Quality sleep - Balanced weight - Mental focus - Physical energy and performance Pros Cons INGREDIENTS Ingredients in Balance of Nature and Texas Superfood To get a clear picture of the ingredients in Balance of Nature and Texas Superfood, we'll look at the common ingredients in each, as well as the unique ingredients of each supplement. Let's get started whit the ingredients they share. Common Ingredients In Both Superfood Supplements Here are the common ingredients in Balance of Nature - Fruit & Veggie capsules and Texas Superfood: Wheat Grass Both Balance of Nature and Texas Superfood contain wheatgrass. Wheatgrass is beneficial for healthy digestion as it helps in weight loss and detoxification. It contains polyphenols and antioxidants, making the wheatgrass a beneficial and potent superfood. It is difficult to determine which nutritional supplement is more potent between Balance of Nature and Texas Superfood, because they do not disclose the amount of wheatgrass they contain. Broccoli Both Balance of Nature and Texas Superfoods contain broccoli. Some people don't want to consume it in its natural or cooked state, despite its well-documented health benefits. So, it is easy to consume it as a superfood supplement. Broccoli has many benefits, including having protective compounds against cancer, hormonal balance, and improved heart and eye health. There's a reason Moms always encourage their kids to eat their broccoli and spinach! Although both Balance of Nature and Texas Superfood supplements have broccoli as an ingredient, they do not indicate how much dosage is in their respective supplements. So, it is hard to choose which is more beneficial from this perspective. Spinach Spinach is a common ingredient in both Balance of Nature and Texas Superfood. Some people may dislike spinach it its natural state for its taste. However, spinach is a very nutritious vegetable. There are many benefits in consuming spinach, such as boosting the health of your heart and improving immunity and bone marrow. The two food supplements do not show the amount of spinach they have. So, it is hard to compare the two. So Balance of Nature vs Juice Plus continues to be a very tight race! Balance of Nature Ingredients The major ingredients in Balance of Nature's Fruits and Veggies are: Cabbage (exclusive to Balance of Nature) Cabbage is a popular superfood. It helps in digestion and improves immunity. It provides Balance of Nature with an upper hand over Texas Superfood because they do not include it in their supplements. Banana (exclusive to Balance of Nature) Bananas provide your body with potassium - a vital electrolyte in your body. Again, it is an advantage for Balance of Nature over Texas Superfood. The inclusion of bananas is a significant boost when comparing the potency of the two supplements, especially in the fruits category. Fruits in Balance of Nature - Tomato - Strawberry - Raspberry - Pineapple - Papaya - Orange - Mango - Lemon - Grapefruit - Grape - Cranberry - Cherry - Blueberry - Banana - Apple - Aloe Vera Veggies in Balance of Nature - Zucchini - Yam - Wheat Grass - Spinach - SoyBean - Shiitake Mushroom - Onion - Kale - Garlic - Celery Stalk - Cayenne Pepper - Cauliflower - Carrot - Cabbage - Broccoli Servings for Balance of Nature's Fruits & Veggies come in two bottles: one bottle for veggies and the other for fruits.

The supplement's formula comprises fifty-five raw vegetables, grasses, herbs, algae, vine-ripened fruits, and enzymes. Let's look at Texas Superfood's ingredients. They are: Green Tea Extract Green tea contains caffeine that improves your energy levels and is a powerful antioxidant. It also contains L-theanine, a compound that delivers a calming and relaxing effect to your body. ( [4](https://www.healthline.com/health/l-theanine#:~:text=Paired%20with%20caffeine%2C%20L%2Dtheanine,caffeine%20(%204%20%2C%205).)) Chlorella Texas Superfoods list Chlorella as the 4th most predominant ingredient in their formula. It has excellent benefits, such as improving immunity, cholesterol, and digestion. Spirulina Spirulina is a popular superfood that contains many beneficial antioxidants and polyphenols. It helps in weight loss, improving immunity, supporting liver health, improving muscle performance, fighting off oxidative stress, lowering cholesterol, supporting cardiovascular health, lowering blood sugar levels, and reducing inflammation. With such a high supplement profile, every superfood needs to include it as an ingredient. Texas Superfood lists Spirulina as one of its major ingredients. Organic Turmeric Powder Organic turmeric contains a powerful antioxidant known as Curcumin. It is also an anti-inflammatory compound and supports the growth of new neurons. Orange Juice Concentrate Orange fruits are rich in vitamin C, B, and A. Vitamin C is an excellent antioxidant. They also contain copper, potassium, and calcium compounds. Pomegranate Extract Pomegranate is rich in folate, beneficial for an infant's development and pregnancy. It is also rich in vitamin C and E and is a powerful antioxidant that helps skin health. If you have an allergy to any Balance of Nature or Texas Superfood ingredients, you need to avoid the supplements. Also, you need to contact the Balance of Nature health specialists if you are using statins to know how grapefruit may interact with your medication. Probiotics (exclusive to Texas Superfood) Probiotics refer to good bacteria in the body that assist in digestion, gastrointestinal health, and improve immunity. Texas Superfood has probiotics, while Balance of Nature does not. The number of probiotics in the serving must be significant to yield substantive benefits. The issue with Texas Superfood is that they do not reveal the composition. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the probiotics in their products are truly beneficial. PRICING Balance of Nature Pricing There are two ways to purchase Balance of Nature supplements: - One-off purchase of one bottle with 90 capsules > $89.95 (Daily serving is 3 capsules, so one bottle lasts for one month) - Monthly subscription plan > $69.95 A one-off purchase of Balance of Nature supplements is $89.95. A monthly subscription for the supplements is $69.95 per month. An additional benefit of the Balance of Nature subscription service is that they offer complimentary personal health coaching.

Texas Superfood Pricing There are also two ways to purchase Texas Superfood: - One-off purchase of one bottle with 180 capsules > $89.95 (Daily serving size is 6 capsules, so one bottle lasts for a month) - Monthly subscription plan > $69.95 A one-off purchase of Texas Superfood is $89.95. A monthly subscription for the supplements is $69.95 per month. Balance of Nature vs Texas Superfood Pricing Comparison As you can see from the comparison above, the pricing of each superfood supplement is essentially the same. If you're a busy person and serious about your long-term health, then a monthly subscription is the way to go. It removes the task from your \"to do list,\" and puts the process on auto-pilot. This is very handy if you're like most people living a hectic, working schedule. Both offer 30-day money back guarantees, so if you're not happy you can return the product. However, both superfood companies emphasize that to receive the full value of these superfood supplements you need to take them for 90 days. We agree with this assessment. It's hard to judge any supplement in 30 days or less. Enzyme Blend Digestive enzymes are important in helping particular compounds in their functions, such as metabolism during digestion. Balance of Nature does not contain any digestive enzymes. In contrast, Texas Superfood has digestive enzymes but does not indicate the specific composition. So, it has the upper hand versus the Balance of Nature supplements, although the true picture is somewhat elusive. The lack of digestive enzymes in Balance of Nature is a slight disadvantage. Some of the digestive enzymes you will get in Texas Superfoods are: - Maltase - Lipase - Bromelain - Lactase - For people who are intolerant to lactose, Lactase can be very helpful in the digestion of Lactose. - Protease - Papain - Invertase - Cellulase - Aids in the digestion of cellulose. - Amylase Protein Proteins are beneficial in meal replacement and digestion and can help weight gain. However, neither Balance of Nature nor Texas Superfood supplements contain proteins. What Is the Best Superfood on the Planet? There is no single superfood that is perfect. And we're now referring to actual foods, not supplements. Different superfoods have varying qualities. However, one essential element of superfoods is antioxidants. Antioxidants provide your protection against cell damage from toxins, and this includes cancer. The Power of Kale When you include superfoods in your diet, they improve your health and life span. And one excellent superfood is kale. Kale has a host of nutritional benefits. First, it has lots of iron, vitamins C and K, calcium, antioxidants, and fiber. These elements are helpful, especially for diabetic patients and other health issues. When a diabetic patient increases kale consumption, it reduces the production of toxins associated with high blood sugar complications. Another amazing property of kale is its ability to increase fiber and potassium in your body. The chlorophyll in kale binds to carcinogens, thus preventing their absorption into the body. However, carcinogens are rather pervasive, from our environment to secondary smoking to animal foods. So, consuming kale does help slightly mitigate the risk of cancer. Kale also boosts skin and hair health. It has beta carotene, which helps in the maintenance of body tissues. Some Other Great Superfoods Other notable powerful superfoods include: - Watercress - Mankai - Sun-dried tomatoes - Spinach - Blueberries - Salmon - Almonds - Artichokes - Peas - Peppers - Broccoli - The cruciferous (arugula, choy, bok, cabbage, collard greens, brussels sprout, cauliflower) Conclusion Balance of Nature and Texas Superfood supplements have incredible, powerhouse ingredients and are quite similar. It is hard to precisely distinguish the nutrient value between the two because they do not disclose the complete content of their ingredients. This superfood comparison really falls under the proverbial \"toss up.\" You just can't go wrong with either one, and to put one in front of the other would, in all reality, be an injustice to both.
