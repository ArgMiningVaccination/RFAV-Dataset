Any food rich in tannins are high in polyphenols: parsley, cilantro, fennel, basil, thyme, oregano, herb's seeds, onions (including leeks and green onions), garlic, fresh vegetables and fruits. The longer they take to grow and ripen, the richer in polyphenols they are. I would recommend a 6 oz glass of freshly squeezed juice of celery and/or fennel every morning until all symptoms are gone. Add carrots or apples in your juicer if the taste of celery or fennel is too strong. Also chew on 1/4 teaspoon of fennel or anise seeds before or after meals, like is offered at Indian restaurants. Red wine is also very rich in polyphenols. A glass of a good organic red wine a day can't hurt. It is actually good for you. "}
