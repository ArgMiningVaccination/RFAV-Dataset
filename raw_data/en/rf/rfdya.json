It is used to treat acute and chronic conditions in adults and children. Homeopathy can be used to prevent or treat a physical illness, infection or disease, or mood and behavior disorders. Homeopathy is easy to take. It can be taken as a liquid and added into drinks, which is extremely helpful for infants and children. Some homeopathic liquids can be applied to the skin. It also comes as sugar pellets, which is also helpful for children. There are rarely any side effects, which makes it safe for everyone. Homeopathy can work very quickly, sometimes overnight. At Winchester Natural Health Associates, we usually use homeopathy with other natural therapies to increase its effectiveness. Homeopathy works in a similar way to vaccinations/immunizations, using a minimal amount of a substance to prevent or treat a health condition. RESOURCES FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOMEOPATHY "}
