For questions or comments, contact: Licensing and Certification Section Office of Emergency Medical an d Trauma Prevention P.O. Box 47853 Olympia, Washington 98504-7853 360-236-2840 These First Responder Field Protocols are State Protocols that establish the standard for field performance. EMS County Medical Program Directors may NOT have protocols that vary from these without specific written approval from the Department of Health. Any deviation from these protocols must be identified to and approved in writing by the Department of Health. THESE FIELD PROTOCOLS WERE DEVELOPED AND WRITTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS: WASHINGTON STATE EM/TP PROTOCOL WORK GROUP Nina Conn Patty Courson Kenny Karnes Dane Kessler Richard Kness Marc Muhr Jim Palmer Terry Patton Jack Pinza Lynn Wittwer, MD 3 Introduction These protocols were developed by the Washington State Protocol Work Group and represent the consolidation of recommendations for emergency pre-hospital patient care from many local and national sources. The assessment information in the First Responder General Orders is intended to be considered with all protocols. These protocols are intended to: 1. Provide a guide to the appropriate emergency medical care procedures to be employed by EMS personnel while working under the direction of the County Medical Program Director; 2. Assist in the standardization of pre-hospital care in Washington State; 3. Provide base hospital physicians and nurses with an understanding of what aspects of patient care have been stressed to EMS personnel and what their treatment capabilities may be; 4. Provide EMS personnel with a fram ework for pre-hospital care and an anticipation of supportive orders from Medical Control; 5. Provide the basic framework on which Medical Control can conduct quality improvement programs. They are not intended to: 1. Be a statement of the standards of care required in any particular situation, but rather guidelines with sufficient flexibility to meet the needs of complex emergency medical or trauma situations; 2. Be a teaching manual for EMS personnel; it is assumed that EMS personnel are appropriately trained and that each person will continue to meet the state's continuing education requirements for recertification. It is further assumed that the County Medical Program Director will provide continuing education based on the results of patient care audit and review; 3. Interfere with the wishes of the patient or family, or the wishes of the patient's personal physician; 4. Dictate details of care to advising physicians; 5. Supersede pre-hospital patient care protocols developed and approved by the County Medical Program Director. 4 5TABLE OF CONTENTS FIRST RESPONDER GENERAL ORDERS Page 7 AIRWAY, CIRCULATORY AND ILLNESS ALTERED MENTAL STATUS....................................................................10 BEHAVIORAL EMERGENCIES ................................................................11 CARDIAC COMPROMISE ........................................................................12 HEAT EXPOSURE.....................................................................................13 HYPOTHERMIA.........................................................................................13 LOCAL COLD ............................................................................................14 RESPIRATORY EMERGENCIES..............................................................15 SEIZURES .................................................................................................15 INJURY BLEEDING (EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL) ...............................................16 BONE AND JOINT INJURY .......................................................................17 BURN.........................................................................................................18 HEAD INJURY ...........................................................................................19 SHOCK (HYPOPERFUSION)...................................................................20 SPECIFIC INJURIES .................................................................................21 SPINE INJURY ..........................................................................................22 CHILDBIRTH/CHILDREN/GERIATRICS DELIVERY .................................................................................................24 INFANT AND CHILD ASSESSMENT ........................................................26 COMMON PROBLEMS IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN.............................27 GERIATRIC EMERGENCIES ....................................................................29 PHYSICAL ABUSE AND NEGLECT..........................................................30 APPENDIX CHARTING ................................................................................................34 CORE BODY TEMPERATURE..................................................................34 DEAD ON ARRIVAL - Updated 9/05 ........................................................35 DO NOT RESUSCITATE (DNR) ORDERS - Added 9/05 ........................36 HELMET REMOVAL ..................................................................................38 OXYGEN DELIVERY ................................................................................39 PULSE, BLOOD PRESSURE, AND RESPIRATION - RANGES ..............40 REPORTING ABUSE ...............................................................................41 RULE OF NINES .......................................................................................44 START TRIAGE ........................................................................................45 TRAUMA TRIAGE PROCEDURES ..........................................................46 MEDICAL ABBREVIATIONS ....................................................................48 GLOSSARY ...............................................................................................49 6 7FIRST RESPONDER GENERAL ORDERS I.

If conscious patient has difficulty speaking. 90 F-86 F 32.0 C-30.0 C Shivering decreases. Strong muscular rigidity. Thinking is less clear, general comprehension is dulled, possible total amnesia. Muscle coordination erratic and jerky. Patient generally able to maintain the appearance of psychological contact with surroundings. 85 F-81 F 29.4 C-27.2 C Irrational. Loses contact with environment drifts into a stuporous state. Muscular rigidity continues. Pulse and respirations are slow and cardiac arrhythmias may develop. 80 F-78 F 26.6 C-20.5 C Patient loses consciousness and does not respond to spoken words. Most reflexes cease to function Heart-beat becomes erratic. 35 DEAD ON ARRIVAL (DOA) - Updated 9/05 I. EMS personnel shall not initiate resuscitation measures when a patient is determined to be: A. The \"obviously dead\" are victims who, in addition to absence of respiration and cardiac activity, have suffered one or more of the following: 1. Decapitation 2. Evisceration of the heart or brain 3. Incineration 4. Rigor Mortis 5. Decomposition B. Do Not Resuscitate orders and no pulse or respirations 1. DOA victims will be reported to the appropriate authorities based on local procedures. 2. DO NOT leave body unattended 3. Consider critical incident stress debriefing for EMS personnel when involved with sudden, unexpected, accidental, traumatic and/or unexplained deaths, particularly if children are involved. 36 DO NOT RESUSCITATE (DNR) ORDERS - Added 9/05 I. Scene Size-Up/Initial Patient Assessment II. Focused History and Detailed Physical Exam A. Determine the patient is in a Do Not Resuscitate status in one of the following ways: 1. The patient has an original, valid POLST Form at the bedside, on the medicine cabinet, on the back of the bedroom door, or on the refrigerator, OR 2. The patient has an EMS-No CPR bracelet that is intact and not defaced. The bracelet can be located on either wrist, either ankle, or on a necklace or neck chain, and worn by the patient, OR 3. The patient has an original EMS-No CPR Form at the bedside, on the medicine cabinet, on the back of the bedroom door, or on the refrigerator. 4. The patient has other DNR Orders: We encourage medical facilities to use the POLST Form. a) Sometimes health care facilities prefer to use their own health care DNR orders. When encountering other DNR orders, perform the following: (1) Verify that the order has a physician signature requesting \"Do Not Resuscitate.\" (2) Verify the presence of the patient's name on the order. b) Contact on-line medical control for further consultation. In most cases, on-line medical control will advise to withhold CPR following verification of a valid physician-signed DNR order. 5. In extended or intermediate care facilities, look for the DNR form in the patient's chart. III. Management A. Begin resuscitation when it is determined: 1. No valid DNR order exists. 2. In your medical judgment, your patient has attempted suicide or is a victim of a violence B. Do Not initiate resu scitation measures when: 1. The patient is determined to be \"obviously dead\". a) The \"obviously dead\" are victims who, in addition to absence of respiration and cardiac activity, have suffered one or more of the following: (1) Decapitation (2) Evisceration of heart or brain (3) Incineration (4) Rigor Mortis (5) Decomposition C. When the patient has an existing, valid DNR order: 1. POLST: a) Provide resuscitation based on pati ent's wishes identified on the form b) Provide medical interventions identified on the form c) Always provide comfort care 2. EMS-No CPR: a) Do not begin resuscitation measures b) Provide comfort care c) Contact patient's physician or on-line medical control if directed by local protocols or if questions or problems arise. 3. Other DNR orders: a) Follow specific orders contained in the DNR order based on the standard of care allowed by your level of certification/licensure and communications with on-line medical control. 4. Remember - Do Not Resuscitate does not mean Do Not provide comfort care when necessary. D. If resuscitative efforts have been started before learning of a valid DNR order, STOP these treatment measures unless continuat ion is requested by the DNR order and provide comfort care: 1. Basic CPR. 2. Intubation (leave the endotracheal tube in place, but stop any positive pressure ventilations). 3. Cardiac monitoring and defibrillation. 4. Administration of resuscitation medications. 5. Any positive pressure ventilation (through bag valve masks, pocket face masks, endotracheal tubes). E. Revoking the DNR order. The following people can inform the EMS system that the 37DNR order has been revoked: 1. The patient (by destroying the order, drawing a diagonal line or the word VOID across the front of the form, or by verbally revoking the order). 2. The physician expressing the patient's revocation of the directive. 3. The legal surrogate for the patient expr essing the patient's revocation of the directive. (The surrogate cannot verbally revoke a patient executed directive). F. Documentation 1. Complete the Medical Incident Report (MIR) form approved by your Medical Program Director. 2. State in writing in the upper left hand corner of the narrative summary: b) \"Patient identified as DNR by POLS T, EMS-No CPR, or Other directive.\" 3. Record the name of the patient's phys ician, and state whether you contacted the physician. 4. Record the reason why the EMS system was activated. 5. Comfort the family and bystanders when patients have expired 6. Follow your local Medical Program Director's protocols for patients who have expired. Actions may include contact of the local coroner's office, the local law enforcement agency, the local chaplain service, or funeral home. The MIR form must still be completed. G. Comfort Care Measures - Providing comfort care is an important responsibility and service you provide to patients and their families at a crucial moment in their lives. 1. Comfort care measures for the dying patient may include: a) Manually open the airway (do not provide positive pressure ventilation with a bag valve mask, pocket mask or endotracheal tube). b) Clear the airway (including stoma) of secretions with appropriate suction device. c) Provide oxygen per nasal cannula at 2-4 l/min. d) Positioning for comfort. e) Splinting. f) Controlling bleeding. g) Providing pain medications pertinent to the level of certification/licensure. h) Providing emotional support. i) Provide emotional support to the family. 2. Contact patient's physician or on-line medi cal control if directed by local protocols or if questions or problems arise. H. Special situation: 1. The patient's wishes in regard to re suscitation should always be respected. Sometimes, however, the family may vigorously and persistently insist on CPR even if a valid DNR order is located. These verbal requests are not consistent with the patient's directive. However, in such circumstances: a) Attempt to convince family to ho nor the patient's decision to withhold CPR/treatment. If family persists, then b) Initiate resuscitation e fforts until relieved by paramedics (for First Responders and EMTs). c) Advanced life support personnel should continue treatment and consult medical control. I. Remember: - Once a death has occurred, the family and relatives become your patients. IV. Ongoing Assessment as appropriate V. Transport if necessary 38 HELMET REMOVAL 1. One rescuer applies in-line traction by placing his or her hands on each side of the helmet with the fingers on the victims mandible. This position prevents slippage if the strap loosens. 2. The rescuer cuts or loosens the straps or the D-rings while maintaining in-line tension. 3. A second rescuer places one hand on the mandible, at the angle, with the thumbs on one side and the long and index fingers on the other. With the other hand, the second rescuer also applies pressure from the occipital region. This maneuver transfers the in-line traction responsibility to the second rescuer. 4. The rescuer at the top removes the helmet. considering these three factors: A. The helmet is egg shaped and must be expanded laterally to clear the ears; B. Glasses must be removed prior to helmet removal; C. If the helmet provides full facial coverage, it must be raised over the nose and moved backwards. 5. The second rescuer must maintain in-line traction from below in order to prevent head tilt. 6. After the helmet is removed the rescuer at the top places his or her hands on either side of the victim's head with the palms over the ears. 7. In-line traction is maintained from above until a backboard and cervical collar are securely in place 39OXYGEN DELIVERY OXYGEN ADMINISTRATION REFERENCE CHART Method Flow Rate (in liters per minute) % Oxygen Delivered Room Air 21 Nasal Cannula (prongs) 1 2 4 24 28 31 Face Mask (simple) 6 10 35-40 40-50 Nonrebreather Face Mask *(1) 12 15 80 90 Face Mask with Oxygen Reservoir Bag 10-12 90 Pocket Mask 10 15 30 50 80 100 *(2) Bag Valve Mask Room Air 12 21 40 - 90 *(3) Positive Pressure Device (demand valve) *(4) 100 100 *(1) Delivery system of choice for patie nts with inadequate breathing and patients who are cyanotic, cool clammy, short of breath, or suffering chest pain, suffering sever injuries, or displaying an altered mental status, or being transported. *(2) This is accomplished by occluding breathing port with thumb. *(3) Depends on brand of bag valve mask and provisions for occluding room air inlet. *(4) Should not be used on children under 12 years old.

(c) The report shall be made at the first opportunity, but; and in no case longer than forty-eight hours after there is reasonable cause to believe that the child or adult has suffered abuse or neglect. The report shall include the identity of the accused if known. (2) The reporting requirement of subsection (1) of this section does not apply to the discovery of abuse or neglect that occurred during childhood if it is discovered after the child has become an adult. However, if there is reasonable cause to believe other children, dependent adults, or developmentally disabled persons are or may be at risk of abuse or neglect by the accused, the reporting requirement of subsection (1) of this section shall apply. (3) Any other person who has reasonable cause to believe that a child or adult dependent or developmentally disabled person has suffered abuse or neglect may report such incident to the proper law enforcement agency or to the department of social and health services as provided in RCW 26.44.040. (4) The department, upon receiving a report of an incident of abuse or neglect pursuant to this chapter, involving a child or adult dependent or developmentally disabled person who has died or has had physical injury or injuries inflicted upon him or her other than by accidental means or who has been subjected to sexual abuse, shall report such incident to the proper law enforcement agency. In emergency cases, where the child, adult dependent, or developmentally disabled person's welfare is endangered, the department shall notify the proper law enforcement agency within twenty-four hours after a report is received by the department. In all other cases, the department shall notify the law enforcement agency within seventy-two hours after a report is received by the department.

(8) Any case referred to the department by a physician licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW on the basis of an expert medical opinion that child abuse, neglect, or sexual assault has occurred and that the child's safety will be seriously endangered if returned home, the department shall file a dependency petition unless a second licensed physician of the parents' choice believes that such expert medical opinion is incorrect. If the parents fail to designate a second physician, the department may make the selection. If a physician finds that a child has suffered abuse or neglect does not constitute imminent danger to the child's health or safety, and the department agrees with the physician's assessment, the child may be left in the parents' home while the department proceeds with reasonable efforts to remedy parenting deficiencies. (9) Persons or agencies exchanging information under subsection (7) of this section shall not further disseminate or release the information except as authorized by state or federal statute. Violation of this subsection is a misdemeanor. (10) Upon receiving reports of abuse or neglect, the department or law enforcement agency may interview children. The interviews may be conducted on school premises, at day care facilities, at the child's home, or other suitable locations outside the presence of parents. Parental notification 43of the interview shall occur at the earliest possible point in the investigation that will not jeopardize the safety or prot ection of the child or the course of the investigation. Prior to commencing the interview the department or law enforcement agency shall determine whether the child wishes a third party to be present for the interview and, of so, shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate the child's wishes. Unless the child objects, the department or law enforcement agency shall make reasonable efforts to include a third party in any interview so long as the presence of the third party will not jeopardize the course of the investigation. (11) Upon receiving a report of child abuse and neglect, the department of investigating law enforcement agency shall have access to all relevant records of the child in the possession of mandated reports and their employees. (12) The department shall maintain investigation records and conduct timely and periodic reviews of all cases constituting abuse and neglect. The department shall maintain a log of screened-out nonabusive cases. (13) The department shall use a risk assessment process when investigating child abuse and neglect referrals. The department shall present the risk factors at hearings in which the placement of a dependent child in an issue.

The department shall provide annual reports to the legislature on the effectiveness of the risk assessment process. (14) Upon receipt of a report of abuse or neglect the law enforcement agency may arrange to interview the person making the report and any collateral sources to determine if any malice is involved in the reporting. The children of the state of Washington are the state's greatest resource and the greatest source of wealth to the State of Washington. Children of all ages must be protected from child abuse. Governmental authorities must give the prevention, treatment, and punishment of child abuse the highest priority, and all instances of child abuse must be reported to the proper authorities who should diligently and expeditiously take appropriate action, and child abusers must be held accountable to the people of the state for their actions. The legislature recognized the current heavy caseload of government authorities responsible for the prevention, treatment, and punishment of child abuse. The information obtained by child abuse reporting requirements, in addition to it's use as a law enforcement tool, will be used to determine the need for additional funding to ensure that resources for appropriate governmental response to child abuse are available. 44 RULE OF NINES - ESTIMATING BURNS 45START TRIAGE APPENDIX Simple T riage A nd R apid T reatment 1.

This system is limited to use in the incident where needs exceed resources immediately available 4. Frequently reassess patients and perform a more in-depth triage as more rescuers become available 46 STATE OF WASHINGTON PREHOSPITAL TRAUMA TRIAGE (DESTINATION) PROCEDURE Purpose The purpose of the Triage Proced ure is to ensure that major trauma patients are transported to the most appropriate hospital facility. This procedure has been developed by the Prehospital Technical Advi sory Committee (TAC), endorsed by the Governor's EMS and Trauma Care Steering Committee, and in accordance with RCW 70.168 and WAC 246-976 adopted by the Department of Health (DOH). The procedure is described in the schematic wi th narrative. Its purpose is to provide the prehospital provider with quick identification of a major trauma victim. If the patient is a major trauma patient, that pati ent or patients must be taken to the highest level trauma facility within 30 minutes transport time, by ei ther ground or air. To determine whether an injury is major trauma, the prehospital provider shall conduct the patient assessment process according to the trauma triage procedures. Explanation of Process A. Any certified EMS and Trauma person can identify a major trauma patient and activate the trauma system. This may include requesting more advanced prehospital services or aero-medical evacuation. B. The first step (1) is to assess the vital signs and level of consciousness. The words \"Altered mental status\" mean anyone with an altered neurologic exam ranging from completely unconscious, to someone who responds to painful stimuli only, or a verbal response which is confused, or an abnormal motor response. C. The \"and/or\" conditions in Step 1 mean that any one of the entities listed in Step 1 can activate the trauma system. D. Also, the asterisk (*) means that if the airway is in jeopardy and the on-scene person cannot effectively manage the airway, the pati ent should be taken to the nearest medical facility or consider meeting up with an ALS unit. These factors are true regardless of the assessment of other vital signs and level of consciousness. E. The second step (2) is to as sess the anatomy of injury. The specific injuries noted require activation of the trauma system. Even in the assessment of normal vital signs or normal levels of consciousness, the presence of any of the specific anatomical injuries does require activation of the trauma system. F. Please note that steps 1 and 2 also require notifying Medical Control. G. The third step (3) for the prehospital provid er is to assess the biomechanics of the injury and address other risk factors. The conditions identified are reasons for the provider to contact, and consult with, Medical Control regarding the need to activate the system. They do not automatically require system activation by the prehospital provider. H. Other risk factors, coupled with a \"gut fe eling\" of severe injury, means that Medical Control should be consulted and consideration given to transporting the patient to the nearest trauma facility. I. Please note that certain burn patients (in a ddition to those listed in Step 2) should be considered for immediate transport or referral to a burn center/unit. Patient Care Procedures To the right of the attached schematic you will find the words \"according to DOH-approved regional patient care procedures. \"These procedures are developed by the regional EMS and Trauma council in conjunction with local councils. They are intended to further define how the system is to operate. They identify the level of medical care personnel who participate in the system, their roles in the system, and participation of hospital facilities in the system. They also address the issue of inter-hospital transfer, by transfer agreements for identification, and transfer of critical care patients. In summary, the Prehospital Trauma Triage Procedure and the Regional Patient Care Procedures are intended to work in a \"hand in glove\" fashion to effectively address EMS and Trauma patient care needs. By functioning in this manner, these two instruments can effectively reduce morbidity and mortality. If you have any questions on the use of either instrument, you should bring them to the attention of your local or regional EMS and Trauma council or contact 1-800-458-5281. 1994/Disc 1/triage.exp 47STATE OF WASHINGTON PREHOSPITAL TRAUMA TRIAGE (DESTINATION) PROCEDURES Prehospital triage is based on the following 3 steps: Steps 1 and 2 require prehospital EMS personnel to notify medical control and activate the Trauma System.
