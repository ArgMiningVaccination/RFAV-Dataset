While a healthy diet, regular exercise, and prenatal care are all important for a successful pregnancy, vaccination is one crucial step that should not be overlooked. Vaccines can help protect both the mother and her baby from a range of illnesses, including some that can be life-threatening. In this age of modern medicine, vaccination is an important tool for safeguarding the health of pregnant women and their unborn children. To know about vaccines that women should take during pregnancy, OnlyMyHealth reached out to Dr Sushma Tomar, Consultant-Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Fortis Hospital Kalyan(Mumbai).

Each year, the World Health Organization (WHO) determines which flu viruses are most likely to be circulating, and based on that, the Fluvac vaccine is updated to provide protection against those specific strains. It should be given close to 27 weeks, to develop immunity against flu, because flu can cause immense weakness, fever, cold and cough. COVID-19 Vaccine If the mother had not taken it before conceiving, then she should take it during pregnancy. But post this vaccine, it should be made sure that there is a gap of 14 days before taking another vaccine. This vaccination can be taken any time during the pregnancy If you are travelling internationally, then, according to the medical advisory for the country of visit and the disease burden there, one has to take the vaccine. Timing of taking any vaccination is crucial.

Before prescribing any immunisations during pregnancy, these experts thoroughly analysed the existing safety data. Takeaway Apart from the expecting mother, the father, and the other individuals of the family, caretaker, etc. who are supposed to be in regular contact with the baby, should also be vaccinated. As per Dr Tomar, after vaccination it takes a minimum of 14 days for the antibodies to start their work and post-delivery, these antibodies protect the new-born. Also, all vaccines are not safe to be taken during pregnancy, hence, the expecting mothers should consult their gynaecologists to know the vaccines that they are to take and the ones they should avoid. However, most of the vaccines are safe and play an essential role in protecting the mothers and child's health. "}
