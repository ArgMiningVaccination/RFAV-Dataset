In our feature on bioinspired engineering, we look to nature and what it has to offer engineers. professors satyandra gupta and sarah Bergbreiter are both in-volved with projects that were inspired by nature. professor gupta has looked to the skies and the abilities of birds in his development of drive mechanisms for groundbreaking micro air vehicles while professor Bergbreiter's project on autono-mous jumping microrobots was inspired by an article in Nature magazine about the froghopper insect. In other articles, we show how our research can inform industry. More specifi cally, dr. diganta das, a member of CalCe (Center for advanced life Cycle engineering), speaks frequently at conferences and symposiums attended by members of private industry, the government and the military on how to detect and prevent the use of counterfeit electronics and he is eager to share his research with us. We also focus on the eerC (energy education and research Collaboration), CalCe and Ceee (Center for environmental energy engineering). all of these organizations conduct research for industry and do so successfully and with high regard. finally, we focus on faculty involvement with academic journals and their impor- tance to the engineering profession; the recent success of our product Innovation and realization laboratory suite; the latest inductee into the Clark school's Innova-tion hall of fame; and a few other important updates. I hope you enjoy reading about our research efforts and how we're impacting indus- try - and impacting lives everywhere. dr. avram Bar-Cohen Chair and Distinguished university ProfessorMechanical EngineeringBar-CoheN dr. avram Bar-Cohen MetrICs is published for alumni and friends of the department of mechanical engineering at the A.

In addition, a mechanism for inspection of parts and materials from high-risk sources needs to be developed and implemented to detect and isolate nonconforming parts. \"One also needs to delve into the pedigree of the part to find out the path the part took from the original manufacturer to the product,\" says Das. \"It is possible that some of those parts made a detour through dumpsters and recycling centers. It is so impor-tant to be aware of what you are actually purchasing and to do so from a reputable source.\" \"This is a serious problem, and it is important to encourage an awareness of it as well as provide the tools to address and avoid it,\" says Das, who speaks frequently at conferences and symposia attended by members of private industry, government and the military. He has also organized two highly successful symposia on the subject of counterfeit electronics on campus in the last two years. And, due to high demand, he offered one symposium in Denmark in June 2009. Das has also been asked to join the anti-counterfeiting task forces of several industry groups such as the Semiconductor Industry Association and Aerospace Industry Association, among others. For more information on Dr. Das' research and his December 2-3, 2009 symposium in College Park, please visit: www.calce.umd.edu .During the last several years, the number of incidents of coun-terfeit electronic parts has grown steadily. Today, these items are being reported in the computer, telecommunications, automobile, avionics and military systems industries, with no areas immune from attack. \"It's an equal opportunity area,\" says Dr. Diganta Das, a member of the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) research team. It's also an expensive problem. \"Some market analysts estimate that the legitimate electronics companies miss out on about $100 billion of global revenue every year because of counterfeiting,\" says Das. As a researcher, Das not only wants to better understand the process of counterfeiting and its impact on industry, he is also using what he has learned to educate others. Some examples of counterfeit electronic products include items that have been relabeled, illegally manufactured or obtained from scrap salvaging. Das tells the story of a military parts supplier that went out of business a decade ago. \"Today you can buy parts that have the name of the company on them and a date code of 2008. How can that be if the company has been out of operation since the 1990s? It would be almost comical if it wasn't so serious.\" According to Das, the military and avionics industries are espe- cially vulnerable targets for counterfeit electronics due to the com-plex approval process required in creating new systems. Instead of redesigning the technology, these industries attempt to use the same systems as long as possible. \"When these parts go obsolete after many years, companies go begging around the world and online.\" Finding a broker for electronic parts is as easy as \"three keystrokes on a computer,\" adds Das. \"Does it mean counterfeit parts never work? No,\" says Das. But when a part doesn't work, the economic repercussions reach far beyond the cost of merely replacing the item. \"An electronic component that may be worth only $2 can cost as much as $20 to replace if it's detected to be counterfeit after it is mounted onto a circuit board,\" he says. \"Then there are the issues of when systems and parts fail, resulting in the loss of a mission, safety problems, and significant maintenance and logistics costs. The user of a coun-terfeit part may also have to bear the cost of liability completely.\" To prevent the purchase of counterfeit electronic parts, Das recommends avoiding unauthorized high-risk sources such as brokers. \"These individuals have no direct relation or any commit-ment to the manufacturer or the buyer of the parts,\" says Das. All das \"THIS IS A SERIOuS PRObLEM AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENCOuRAGE AN AWARENESS Of IT, AS WELL AS PROvIDE THE TOOLS TO ADDRESS AND AvOID IT.\" \u2014 DR. DIGANTA DASKeeping It real RESEARCHER EDuCATES INDuSTRy ON PERILS Of COuNTERfEIT ELECTRONICSMETRICS fAl l 20094 For ME researchers, Jeffrey Herrmann and Jaydev Desai, their work is about more than just research. Both are involved with proj- ects that directly impact the lives of countless individuals. Herrmann is one of 24 recipients, statewide, of the Maryland Daily Record's Innovator of the Year award. Hermann was selected for the award based on his development of a Clinic Planning Model Generator, or CPMG, an emergency preparedness planning model used by state and county public health departments nationwide. The Innovator of the Year award recognizes Maryland residents and companies who have introduced innovations that positively effect their business, industry or community. \"I began this project with the hope of helping the folks in public health prepare for an emergency that you hope never hap-pens,\" says Herrmann, an associate professor who holds a joint appointment with the Institute for Systems Research (ISR) and conducts research in the areas of operations research and engineer-ing decision-making. Hermann adds, \"However, if something bad does happen, perhaps this process can minimize the impact and keep people safe. That gives me a sense of satisfaction.\" \"The idea of having an impact on human life is very gratifying and the reason why I do this work,\" says Desai, an associate profes-sor and director of the Robotics, Automation, Manipulation and Sensing (RAMS) Laboratory, whose research focuses on medical robotics, haptic interfaces for robot-assisted surgery, surgical simula-tion, model-based teleoperation and cell manipulation. Desai recently received two grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct research on a more effective use of robotics in the detection and treatment of breast cancer and brain tumors. Professor Herrmann's Research The CPMG developed by Herrmann is a spreadsheet application that generates customized analytical models of mass dispensing and vaccination clinics also known as Points of Dispensing, or PODs. The CPMG software creates accurate models for planning mass dispensing or vaccination campaigns using PODs. Herrmann's work is part of an exciting and innovative process that uses operations research and applied mathematics to improve planning for bioterrorism attacks, pandemic flu or other events. \"Poorly conceived plans can cause confusion, delay responses to events, and reduce the effectiveness of responses, all of which increase the number of victims,\" says Herrmann.Emergency preparedness planners can use the models to answer the following questions: (1) Given a resident flow rate (calculated from population size and duration of campaign), how many people are needed to staff each station? (2) How much does each worksta-tion need to accommodate residents waiting in line? (3) How long will residents spend inside the POD? (4) How will the PODs opera-tions be affected if stations are eliminated or combined? \"The software automatically generates a spreadsheet from a minimal set of user inputs,\" says Herrmann. \"And, the software provides useful data that includes processing-time distributions for different types of workstations, but allows the user to make modifi- cations as necessary.\" Planners can easily adjust staffing levels and various inputs until they are satisfied with the efficiency of the clinics. Users can also accept default values if they have little information about their clinics or input more detailed information, such as routing probabilities and process times. \"In addition to its use for emergency preparedness planning, the software can be used to plan annual flu shot clin- ics and other similar medical applications,\" says Herrmann. \"The spreadsheet software approach has many benefits as planners do not have to create spreadsheets from scratch or understand the mathematics of queuing networks; yet, they generate a spreadsheet capacity planning and queuing network model that reflects the design they want to use.\" he aling ha nds...and Minds ME R E SEARCHERS WO RK T O DEvE LOP NE W TO OLS fO R HE ALTH CA RE IN DuS TRy herrMaNN flu c linic in m ontgomery county , mA ryl A n d A.

The CPMG software is available free of charge on Herrmann's website for public health emergency preparedness planners to down-load. Additionally, there is no charge to receive assistance on its use. Professor Desai's Research Professor Desai's research in the use of medical robotics to diagnose and treat breast cancer and brain tumors addresses areas with urgent needs. According to Desai, this became evident after both of his grant applica-tions received extremely positive reviews from the NIH. \"For example, the American Cancer Society states that 182,000 women would be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008,\" he says. \"And individuals diag-nosed with a tumor deep within the brain have a median survival of four to eight months due to primary or intrinsic malignancy or a sec-ondary or metastatic malignancy.\" The NIH funded Desai's work on a teleoperated feedback system for biopsy (Bx) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of breast tumors under continuous MRI with a $1.3 million grant. Desai is the principal investigator on this project, which is conducted in collaboration with Dr. Rao Gullapalli and other co-investigators at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \"The goal of the proposed haptics or sense of touch enabled tel- erobotic system is to operate under continuous MRI, for both breast biopsy and radiofrequency ablation of a breast tumor, in a manner that minimizes sampling errors during biopsy and delivers optimal therapy during radiofre-quency ablation,\" says Desai. According to Desai, the system will enable a patient to have the biopsy and treatment in the same sitting. Currently, there is no such teleoperated robotic sys-tem with haptic feedback capability avail-able for breast biopsy and radiofrequency ablation of breast tumor under continu-ous MRI. As a result, \"the patient has to be moved inside the MRI bore for imaging and brought outside so that the physician can insert the biopsy needle to the target location. The patient is then re-entered into the MRI bore to see if the needle has been accurately placed. This is a blind-targeting approach,\" says Desai. The robotic system, however, will allow the physician to guide the needle to the target location while continuously imaging under MRI. \"This will enable accurate guidance of the biopsy needle and/or radiofrequency ablation probe and hence improve the outcome of the procedure,\" Desai adds. Desai's second grant from NIH, in the amount of $397,541, will be applied to the development of a MRI-compatible, minimally invasive neurosurgical intracranial robot, or MINIR. Again, Desai is the principal investigator, working with fellow ME faculty member Satyandra Gupta and Drs. Rao Gullapalli and Marc Simard from the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \"As envisioned, MINIR will be under the direct control of a human operator, with targeting information obtained exclusively from frequently updated MRI,\" explains Desai. Unlike available technology, MINIR will require only a very narrow corridor to approach and resect the tumor and will be capable of operating outside the line-of-site entry trajectory. At its operating end, MINIR will be multidigited and highly maneuver-able, with all movements under the dynamic control of a human operator. \"Like any human neurosurgeon currently, MINIR will resect the tumor by positioning the end-probe comprised of, say, bipolar electrocautery to liquify tissue,\" says Desai. \"Dedicated irrigation and aspiration channels in the MINIR body will ensure washing out the debris and its removal.\" Desai is just beginning research on these two projects, but he is hopeful. \"This is an amazing time in which we live,\" he says. \"T echnology has taken such a leap in the last 50 to 70 years. We can do so much more now to help people.\" For more information on Dr. Herrmann or Dr. Desai's research, please visit: www.enme.umd.edu . desaI METRICS fAl l 20096Birds and Bugs ME R E SEARCHERS LO OK T O NA TuR E fO R IN SPIRATION role in future surveillance and reconnaissance missions. \"These remote-controlled MAVs are expected to be stealthy and highly maneuverable for operations in constrained spaces,\" says Gupta. The U.S. military hopes that someday these MAVs will be able to carry surveillance cameras and other payloads that will aid operations, according to Gupta. Until Gupta's research made it possible, ornithopters were gen- erating lift primarily by flapping their wings. Gupta's work on light-weight drive mechanisms has enabled his team to start testing designs with folding wings. \"When flying, larger birds like hawks or seagulls fold their wing on the upstroke,\" he explains. \"This slows their forward velocity and enables them to carry large payloads. Since it would be highly desir-able for surveillance MAV to fly slowly and carry a significant sensor payload, developing a folding-wing technology that actually flies is a large step forward in making these aircraft possible.\" The drive mechanism is a critical part of the MAV design because it transfers power from the motor to the flapping wings. Gupta's team has developed multipiece molding technology that enables develop-ment of geometrically complex structures. Using this technology they have developed a new lightweight drive mechanism. This drive mechanism minimizes moving parts by exploiting biologically-inspired compliant structures. The elimination of moving parts eliminates power loss during the transmission. \"Folding wings are heavier than nonfolding wings. So advances in lightweight, highly efficient drive mechanisms have been crucial in achieving folding wing flight,\" says Gupta. Gupta's team first developed four flapping-wing MAVs that did not have folding wings and demonstrated their capacity to fly. Each of these ornithopters was successively larger, so that increas-ingly heavy payloads could be carried. \"The length of flight is determined by the capacity of the batteries onboard the aircraft,\" says Gupta. \"The largest of these ornithopters, which weighs 1.5 ounces, can carry a video camera with a transmitter as well as its batteries, and stay aloft for 14 minutes in calm air. The video cam-ME researchers Satyandra K. Gupta and Sarah Bergbreiter view the natural world around them in different ways. As researchers who use bioinspired engineering in their research, they have a unique apprecia-tion for how nature works and what it can offer. \"About 10 years ago, when I began this work, we were discover- ing that the traditional robots were having difficulty in doing certain simple tasks,\" says Gupta, a professor who also holds a joint appoint-ment with the Institute for Systems Research and whose research focuses on computer-aided design, manufacturing automation and robotics. \"Then, you think about humans and other animals that can do these tasks fairly easily. I was intrigued by the whole idea of how things get done in nature and what can be learned from it and used for engineering.\" For his own recent research, Gupta has looked to the skies and the abilities of birds in his development of drive mechanisms for groundbreaking micro air vehicles. Bergbreiter's project on autonomous jumping microrobots, was inspired by an article in Nature magazine on \"the froghopper insect, which the article described as the new jumping champion of the insect world,\" recalls Bergbreiter, an assistant professor who holds a joint appointment with ISR and whose research focuses on microro-botics, networked multirobot systems and sensor networks. \"This insect could jump the highest for its size, and I began to think maybe this isn't too far off from what I could actually engi-neer,\" she says. \"That article and that insect pushed me in the right direction.\" Professor Gupta's Research Gupta, working with a team of students, has developed several versions of an orni-thopter, a birdlike micro air vehicle, or MAV , that both flaps and folds its wings. \"Ornithopters offer greater possibilities both for miniaturization and maneuver-ability in the field than their fixed-wing or rotary-wing MAV cousins,\" says Gupta. The research is funded in part by an Army Research Office Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative grant and the National Science Foundation. The MAVs are expected to play a big gupta th e omithopter is A birdlike micro Ai r vehicle developed by pr ofessor s At yAn drA gu ptA A.

The folding-wing MAV weighs 1.3 ounces with its batteries, and has a wing span of 22.5 inches. It is capable of carrying a pay- load (usually a surveillance camera) that weighs .35 ounces. Importantly, Gupta's MAVs do not use a propeller system to \"help\" the wings. Such motors are too loud for reconnaissance purposes, forfeiting the element of stealth. \"These MAVs are truly bird-inspired,\" Gupta says. \"I W AS I NTRIG uE D by T HE W HOLE I DEA Of H OW T HINGS G ET D ONE I N N ATuR E A ND W HAT C AN bE L EARNED fR OM I T A ND uS ED fO R E NGINEERING . \" \u2014 PR OFESSOR SA TYANDRA GU PTA Bergbreiter, who received a 2008 Young Faculty Award from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for her work on the autonomous jumping microrobot, says that jumping offers numerous benefits to millimeter-sized robots. \"As the robot size shrinks, obstacles around the robot grow comparatively larger and jumping provides a relatively simple mechanical means of deal-ing with those obstacles,\" she says. \"Ultralow power parasitic locomotion, in which the microro- bot uses other objects moving nearby to provide the locomotion power, becomes feasible when the microrobot can jump on and jump off.\" According to Bergbreiter, for basic functionality, a jumping microrobot benefits from its relative simplicity. \"It requires only a motor, an energy stor-age element to store and quickly release mechanical energy for a jump, a con-troller and a power supply,\" she says. However, while the robot itself is fairly simple, the com- ponents have performance requirements above those offered by current technologies. To achieve the performance and robustness necessary to make this vision feasible, microrobot mechanisms such as motors and springs will be fabricated in a silicon/elasto-mer process. Berg BreIter Professor be rgbreiter's Research The very tiny robots could be used in many ways, says Bergbreiter, from surveillance to search and rescue. Even environmen-tal studies, where robots would have a minimal impact on the environ-ment. For example, she tells of a study involving the monitoring of rare birds. \"The birds saw the sen-sors that were being used to monitor them and would bury them,\" she says. \"That made the sensor useless. They were glar-ingly obvious in their environment. Our robots on a millimeter scale could avoid that.\" And, perhaps bring the cycle of bioinspired engineering full circle - back to nature.

James Clark School of Engineering entered into a partnership with the Petroleum Institute (PI) of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2006, ME researchers and their colleagues at the institute have been addressing issues confronting the oil industry. The Petroleum Institute is sponsored by a consortium of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and its international partners (Shell, BP , T otal, and Japan Oil Development Company). \"The goal of the university's work with the Petroleum Institute is to move toward enhanced oil recovery and exploration,\" says ME department chair, Avram Bar-Cohen. \"We're doing this specifically by applying advanced ME knowledge to fossil fuels.\" \"By supporting this research now, the industry is investing in the future,\" says Azar Nazeri, research manager of the Energy Education and Research Collaboration (EERC), which was created on the UMD campus as result of the collaboration. The collaboration isn't just engaged in research, but looks to develop future researchers as well. \"Education is a key component of this partnership,\" says Bar-Cohen. This has resulted in students from PI attending school at UMD as students and interns, and students from UMD participating in internships at PI. \"Some of these PI students who are obtaining their PhDs in ME will return as faculty members at PI,\" says Nazeri. Current collaboration projects include: Robust Optimization of Petrochemical Systems will develop a framework for robust optimization of distillation column design while considering the net profit effect at the plant level. Dynamics and Control of Drill Strings on Fixed and Floating Platforms will develop and, analytically and numerically, study con- trol-oriented models for drill strings; investigate control of an under-actuated nonlinear system (drill string) that has complex interactions with the environment; and build a drill string testbed for the institute and university to test the theoretical findings. Thermally Enhanced Polymer Heat Exchanger for Seawater Applications will address the fundamental thermal performance issues associated with the use of thermal high-conductivity polymer materials in heat exchangers. EHD-Enhanced Gas/Liquid Separator will study hybrid inertia- EHD, gas/liquid separation phenomena for electrically conductive and nonconductive liquid particles suspended in a moving gaseous medium. Force-Fed Cooling of Photovoltaic Arrays for High-efficiency Solar Energy Conversion Systems will create a database of the available cooling techniques for the high heat flux solar concentrator arrays necessary for efficient conversion of solar energy to electric power and design and fabricate an experimental prototype and associated setup to verify the feasibility of this concept and the capacity for force-fed cooling. Condensing Flows in a Microscale Channel with a Microelement Array and Visual T echniques will investigate the fundamentals of the two-phase condensing flow phenomenon in submillimeter micro-channels. Sulfur Recovery from Gas Stream, Using Flameless and Flame Combustion Reactor will obtain fundamental information on the thermal process of sulfur recovery from sour gas by conventional flame combustion and flameless combustion using numerical and experimental studies. The ultimate goal is to determine the optimal operating conditions for sulfur conversion. Waste Heat Utilization in the Petroleum Industry will utilize waste heat in petroleum processing plants to minimize overall energy con-sumption.

G M experienced a 10% reduction in development time and an 80% reduction in design verification failures using CALCE PoF calcePWA software and accelerated-qualification approaches. As a result, CALCE software was made a requirement in GM Design Standard GM3172. N ASA's use of CALCE PoF models is enabling plans for extended manned missions to the moon and Mars. A erospace, telecommunication and medical equipment manufactur - ers use the solder fatigue model derived and validated by CALCE. T he top avionics equipment suppliers in the world use CALCE- developed models to assess the failure risk presented by tin whiskers. Ca lCe is recognized as the pre-eminent technical organization for up-rating, counterfeit electronic part management and electronic part obsolescence forecasting and management. T he core of the Electronic Components Management Plan (ECMP) for the commercial avionics industry is based on the parts manage- ment methodology developed by CALCE. C ALCE developed the concept of up-rating, a process for mitigating the risk of using semiconductor devices outside manufacturers' speci-fications. Up-rated components are now used in nearly all avionics, military and other extreme environment applications. C ALCE developed the first quantitative analysis of lifetime buy sizes for electronic parts, permitting major electronics integrators to reduce their safety stock inventory sizes, resulting in significant cost savings. Ca lCe is a leader in supplying tools and methodologies for the strategic management of long-field-life systems. C ALCE developed the most widely used strategic methodology for managing electronic part obsolescence. In one example, Motorola realized a $33 million cost avoidance by adopting the CALCE soft-ware generated refresh plan for a base station communications system. CalC e has formed the first collaborative research effort to address the application of prognostics and health management concepts to electronic systems. C ALCE developed a new paradigm for reliability prediction of elec - tronics based on prognostics, whereby sensor data can be integrated with models that enable in-situ assessment of the deviation or degradation of a product from an expected normal operating condi-tion, and the prediction of the future state of reliability. For more information about CALCE, please visit: www.calce.umd.edu .The reliance of modern technologies on complex electronics poses significant and growing challenges to managing life cycle risks. \"From the annoyed customer at the ATM or the business traveler on a delayed flight, to the dangerous malfunction of automobiles or the loss of $100 million satellites and aircraft, failure to adequately man-age the life cycle of electronic systems touches everyone,\" says George Dieter Chair, Professor Michael Pecht, founder and director of the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE). Since its inception in 1985 as a National Science Foundation (NSF) Center of Excellence, CALCE has been a leader in enabling technologies and providing solutions that mitigate life cycle risks for electronic products and systems. CALCE now conducts over $6 mil-lion in research per year for over 200 organizations worldwide and hosts a consortium of over 50 major companies. T oday, many lead-ing domestic and international best practices standards are based on CALCE research and publications. Additionally, CALCE prognostics and health management efforts for electronics are being implemented by leading international companies. Recently, CALCE received the NSF Schwarzkopf Award for its technological innovation, the highest award bestowed to an NSF center. \"If you go to any company that deals with electronics and ask about reliability, the first name that is mentioned is CALCE at the University of Maryland. All the faculty and researchers on our team are quite famous and highly respected by companies,\" says Pecht. In fact, Pecht was awarded the highest reliability honor, the IEEE Reliability Society's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008. Significant contributions made by CALCE include: processes and models developed by C alC e are the de facto standards for physics-of-failure ( po f )-based analyses of electronic systems. C ALCE developed the concept of organizational reliability capabil - ity as the measure of the effectiveness of an organization's reliability program, practices and activities in meeting customer requirements for product reliability. Companies in areas as diverse as telecom-munications, industrial control systems and power electronics have used CALCE organizational reliability capability reviews as the basis for organizational improvements.

After all, no one is more invested in that goal than industry, the ones who will implement these systems,\" says ME Professor Reinhard Radermacher, director and co-founder of CEEE. The center, which was established in 1991 by integrating the heat pump and refrigeration laboratories originally founded in 1983, is divided into four consortia based on the research pursued by each group. The consortia are: Alternative Cooling T echnologies and Application (ACTA), Integrated Systems Optimization (ISOC), Small Autonomous Energy Systems (SAES) and Advanced Heat Exchanger/Electronic Cooling (AHX/EC). Corporate sponsors involved with CEEE are: Baltimore Aircoil (BAC), Ballard, Carrier, Daikin, Danfoss, Delphi U.S., DOE, DuPont, Godrej, Gree, G\u00fcntner, Emerson, Honeywell, Ingersoll Rand, Johnson Controls, LG, Luvata, Marlow, Panasonic, Mitsubishi, Mitsubishi Plastics, Modine, Office of Naval Research (ONR), Petroleum Institute, T rane, and Specific areas of research and accomplishments include: C EEE's research has led to energy savings in refrigerators in excess of 50 percent. \"These were achieved by taking advantage of syner- gistic improvements resulting from cabinet, refrigeration system and working-fluid selection benefits,\" says Radermacher, who introduced ternary working-fluid mixtures for absorption heat pump technol-ogy. His contributions to the use of working-fluid mixture in vapor compression systems resulted in advanced cycles with a new degree of freedom for special applications. A CEEE-designed suction line heat exchanger is now in production in the automotive industry. C EEE faculty and students built the first carbon dioxide hot water heat pump in the United States. \"Since no suitable compressors were available we developed our own,\" says Radermacher. T he center developed a novel test method for measuring oil reten - tion within air-conditioning systems, applying it to a wide range of refrigerants and miscible and nonmiscible lubricants. The result-ing correlations are predicting oil retention in a wide range of systems. Then, CEEE, together with one of its sponsors, developed an oil concentration sensor. \"Furthermore, we've created a test facility and method for the measurement of vapor com-pression system performance under dynamic conditions,\" says Radermacher. \"An auto-motive air conditioner can be tested over an entire drive cycle without ever leaving the lab.\" C EEE is evaluating and designing cooling, heat-ing and power systems for natural gas and petroleum processing plants, leading to significant energy savings. Additional research extends to solar-cool-ing systems. \"We have developed the design for the most efficient solar-cooling concept to date,\" says Radermacher. F uel cell research by SAES has led to the creation of a new fuel cell test facility in cooperation with the U.S. Army and Ballard. C EEE installed some of the first building-sized cooling, heating and power systems in the U.S. Subsequent research led to the develop-ment of an air-cooled absorption chiller concept that accomplishes air cooling by skillfully integrating the chiller with the application. A side benefit is increased operating hours which greatly increases economic feasibility. \"Our research results and guidelines from this project con-tributed to the successful development of fully integrated packaged CHP (cooling, heating and power) systems,\" says Radermacher. R esearch by AHX led to the development of an electro-hydrody - namically-enhanced (EHD-enhanced) oil separator device, air-side heat transfer enhancement techniques, mechanical and thermal design of mcirochannel heat exchangers, EHD-enhanced tube bundle condenser and development of microevaporators and micro-condensers for use in ultracompact cooling systems. I SOC develops the tools for systematic optimization of thermal systems. This effort is based on the development of component-based, highly flexible and user friendly simulation packages for components, subsystems and systems. \"The unique strength of this effort is the inclusion of optimization routines that allow a system-atic search for better systems using gradient-based and/or heuristic approaches that are commercially available,\" says Radermacher.

For example, Bar-Cohen is currently the editor-in-chief of IEEE's CPMT (Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology) Society Transactions . Other faculty journal edi- tors include Reinhard Radermacher, editor the ASHRAE HVAC&R Research Journal , and Michael Pecht, chief editor of Microelectronics Reliability International . And, the editor- ial expertise does not stop there. Many faculty members are also involved in producing books, such as Ashwani Gupta, editor of the Energy and Engineering Science Series (CRC Press). \"Many of our faculty members are drawn to the idea of service and see themselves playing an important role in leading the academic community,\" says Bar-Cohen of these editorial efforts. This is particularly true in the case of those individuals who serve as editors, giving the final say on what papers will or will not appear in the journal and passing along this infor-mation to both industry and government. \"As an editor, for example,\" says Bar-Cohen, \"you are setting the direction of future research and defining the gaps between the technological needs of particular areas of research and the existing knowledge base. By identifying those gaps you can better address research fund- ing for such agencies as DARPA, NSF and DOE who can devote resources to closing that gap.\" Adding, \"You're vetting the results. In a way you are really shaping the whole field of research. You're becom- ing the thought leader. Our faculty here at ME does this very well.\" A.

Sandborn explains that in today's world, complex sys- tems are often maintained within \"sustainment stovepipes,\" where the same obsolescence issue may be resolved separately by the same organization for each of the different systems it supports. \"The research conducted in this program will help break down the stovepipes so that information can be read-ily shared, ultimately leading to more proactive obsolescence management throughout the product life cycle,\" he says. As part of his research, he is also developing funda- mental principles, teachable methods, and guidelines for designing product architectures that can facilitate informa-tion exchange and collaboration for technology obsoles-cence management and mitigation efforts between existing tools and databases, and across multiple organizations. \"My goal is to provide a platform for the exploration and understanding of interactions among the elements of product design and sensitivities to obsolescence,\" says Sandborn, who is also affiliated with CALCE and the Institute for Systems Research. \"The research will provide the knowledge base that enables designers to effectively develop and use the software tools they need to manage the issue of obsolescence.\"saNd B or N METRICS fAl l 200914 14gr eat Minds INvE NTOR Of Hyb R ID PO WER SyS TEM IN DuC TED I NTO IN NOvA TION HA LL Of f AME the Maryland T echnology Enterprise Institute (Mtech) at the Clark School in 1986 and enrolled Viteq, a company that developed uninterruptable power supplies for computer systems, in Mtech's T echnology Assistance Program. In 1992, he enrolled PAICE Corporation, which licenses the Hyperdrive technology, in the same Mtech program. He consulted with Clark School faculty members to develop and refine his ideas for Hyperdrive. Severinsky served as CEO and chairman of PAICE until 2006. He then founded Fuelcor LLC, an intellectual property development company focused on synthetic fuels, where he continues to serve as CEO. He holds 21 patents in the United States, with additional patent filings worldwide.Alex Severinsky , the inventor of the hybrid power system used in the T oyota Prius and in other hybrid vehicles, was inducted into the the A. James Clark School Innovation Hall of Fame. Severinsky, a visiting professor of mechanical engi-neering, was honored at a special induction ceremony in October. The Clark School's Innovation Hall of Fame was developed and funded by Stanford W . Berman, B.S. '50, to recognize great engineering and to inspire young engineers. Severinsky developed the Hyperdrive power-ampli- fied internal combustion engine powertrain, a unique successor technology to the conventional internal combus-tion engine powertrain, and founded PAICE Corporation to license Hyperdrive to hybrid vehicle manufacturers. The Hyperdrive system utilizes a unique combination of existing technologies, along with inventive functional-ity, significantly improving performance and decreasing the cost of the powertrain. Hyperdrive's key innovation is in the use of an alternating current electrical subsystem, which offers significant performance advantages over conventional powertrains and other hybrid technologies, with average fuel economy improvements of greater than 50 percent at equivalent cost, broad applicability across chassis sizes and vehicle types, lower environmental impact and ample power for all vehicle accessories. The Hyperdrive system is utilized in the T oyota Prius, Camry and several SUVs, and has made hybrid technology commercially viable and played a key role in moderating the increase in gasoline consumption.

Yu is an assis-tant professor of mechanical engineer-ing who holds an affiliate appointment with the Institute for Systems Research. Balachandran is a professor of mechanical engineering and associate chair of ME. The invention is a micro-optical fiber tip-based sensor system for pressure, acceleration and pressure gradient mea-surements over a wide bandwidth. The design, which allows for multiplexity on the system input side, is based on micro-electromechanical fabrication techniques. The optical portion of the system is based on low-coherence fiber-optic interfer-ometry techniques, and also has a sensor Fabry-Perot interferometer and a read-out interferometer combina-tion that allows a high dynamic range and low sensitivity to the wavelength fluctuation of the light source. A phase modulation and demodulation scheme takes advantage of the integrated optical circuit phase modulator and multistep phase-stepping algorithm for providing high-frequency and signal demodulation. The system includes fiber tip-based Fabry-Perot sensors, each of which has a diaphragm that is used as a transducer. This is the third patent for Yu and Balachandran in this particular area of research. Previous patents include one for the invention of a fiber tip-based sensor system for measurement of pressure gradient air-particle velocity and acoustic intensity (U.S. Patent 7,224,465) and another for the invention of fiber tip-based fiber-optic sensor systems (U.S. Patent 6,901,176). Both previous patents have been licensed by two companies, Odexia and Pervasive T echnology Engineering.Working to gether PR OD T A ND RE ALIzA TION LAbO RATOR y SuI AS SISTS AW ARD - WI NNING CO MPAN y When TRX Systems, a leading innovator in the development of personnel tracking solutions, placed first in the third annual Global Security Challenge (GSC) for \"Most Promising Security Start-up,\" the company gave a nod to ME's Product Innovation and Realization Laboratory Suite (PIRLS ). \"One of the reasons we won this award was because we showed our manufacturing viability and focus as a product devel-opment team,\" says David Lemus, the lead mechanical engineer at TRX, located in Greenbelt, Md., and founded by Gil Blankenship, a professor and associate chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \"Surely we could not have reached this point without the help of the PIRLS lab.\" TRX Systems placed first for creating an advanced personnel tracking system that provides first responders with accurate and real-time locations of individuals deployed inside a building. TRX's technology is self-contained, requires no preinstalled infrastructure and can create virtual floor plans in real time. For winning, TRX Systems, a recent graduate from the univer- sity's T echnology Advancement Program, the incubator facility for startups which is part of the Clark School's Maryland T echnology Enterprise Institute, received a $500,000 federal contract. In an email to the PIRLS lab, Lemus, wrote, \"Initial proto- typing with ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) was important in developing an alpha system for the TRX tracking system. Greg T eitelbaum, research graduate assistant and PIRLS lab manager, and I had countless interactions and went through several iterations to ensure that the enclosures I was designing met specified toler-ances and design for manufacturing/design for assembly guidelines. I have worked with a few different prototyping companies, and the PIRLS lab has delivered quality parts and has effectively communi-cated with TRX Systems.\" It is a working relationship with a future. \"Over the coming months,\" continues Lemus, \"I will be designing the next generation enclosures for our system, and I hope to come to the PIRLS lab for my initial prototyping needs.\" \"We are honored to have been involved in and to have offered assistance with this outstanding project,\" says Linda Schmidt, ME associate professor and lab director. yu Bala C ha N dra N Department of Mechanical Engineering 2181 Glenn L.

The repairs are designed to reduce roll-over risk as well as improve handling. According to the CPSC, 46 deaths and hundreds of injury claims had been reported with these vehicles before the recall. Schultz and his team, working at an Army testing facility in Maryland that uses a roadway simulator, \"have been run-ning kid-size ATV and off-road utility tests for the last year and half (under contract) for CPSC,\" says Schultz, who is also a senior test engineer at the facility. Cook and Ramsey are also employed full-time at the facility. \"We ran the tests, educated CPSC on how to interpret and use the data, and demonstrated potential improvements to the vehicle. This was strong data, indisputable data. In doing this type of work, you're just doing the best you can and hopefully you can help people out in the process,\" says Ramsey. Both Cook and Ramsey, who received their undergradu- ate degrees in ME, have been involved with the university's T erps Racing program, including the Formula SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) program and Baja SAE program. Schultz, the faculty advisor for T erps Racing says, \"I feel that they are taking what they learned from their experiences as undergraduates and members of the racing team and further developing those skills with projects such as this.\" He adds, "}
