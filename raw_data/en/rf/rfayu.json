Meditation can ease depression, lower your blood pressure and even reverse some chronic illnesses. Many Americans also are turning to meditation to handle stress. In fact, meditation apps reported a spike in usage in 2020, with Headspace seeing a 20 percent increase and Calm seeing its daily downloads double. Meditation is the practice of focusing attention to calm your nervous system. Think of it as restful awareness \u2014 you're relaxed but alert as you train your mind to focus on one thing. When the mind settles down, it literally changes brain wave patterns and opens the pathway for the mind, body and spiritual connection, says Dr. Israel Wojnowich, a family practice physician with Bayfront Health St. Petersburg Medical Group Wellness Clinic. Meditation Myths Think you can't meditate because it's too hard or your mind wanders? Think again. Meditation might not be our default mode because we're always thinking about what's next or what decision we need to make. But it provides the brain with a much-needed mental pause. It's a tool that's accessible to everyone. Plus, it's free and has zero negative side effects. And don't worry, it's perfectly normal for your mind to wander during meditation. It happens to everyone. \"Meditation doesn't mean your thoughts will stop,\" Dr. Wojnowich says. \"You're just trying to interrupt them, which helps your mind settle down.\" Stress and Its Effect on the Body When you don't consistently take time to quiet your mind, stress can accumulate. Stress might seem invisible, but you can certainly feel its mental and physical effects. Short-term effects of stress include: - Elevated heart rate - Muscle tension - Increased breathing - Spikes in blood pressure - Boosts in cortisol levels, the body's stress hormone Long-term effects include: - High blood pressure - Obesity - Diabetes - Impaired immune function - Decreased brain health - Decreased heart health Chronic stress can contribute to anxiety, depression, headaches, heart disease, insomnia and even death. How Meditation Helps By taking a moment to forget about your daily needs, wants and urgent matters, you allow the mind to focus on the present and enter a state of relaxation, thus reducing stress, Dr. Wojnowich says. When people routinely meditate, it can help reverse some chronic illnesses, lowering blood pressure by an average of five points. One study found that in depressed patients, meditation was about as effective as taking an antidepressant. While you might not see a reversal in diabetes, meditation can help improve symptoms. Studies have shown that diabetes patients who meditate have better glycemic control. If you can better control diabetes, you can reduce the risk of heart disease. How to Meditate Consistent practice is the best way to benefit from meditation, just like building muscle with regular exercise. Try these tips to jumpstart your meditation practice: Make time in your schedule. Creating a new habit takes time, but it's a matter of reprioritizing.
