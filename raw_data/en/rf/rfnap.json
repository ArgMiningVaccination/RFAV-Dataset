They are designed to support both the prenatal root of qi and blood, the kidneys, and the post natal production of qi and blood by supplementing the spleen and stomach. According to the writings of many Chinese doctors, this is the basis for prevention of disease and promotion of good health. In fact, the health of the spleen and stomach are so important in human physiology that volumes have been written on this subject. In the words of Tin Zi-jiu, a great doctor of the 19th century, The hundreds of diseases of the four seasons all originate in the stomach. As the stomach gets grain, improvement comes. Therefore, if the diet is improved one inch, the disease pathogen is forced back one inch.
