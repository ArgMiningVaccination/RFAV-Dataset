Nothing compares to the joy a young rider experiences once they start rolling solo on two wheels, not to mention the newfound sense of freedom and independence on the horizon (or at the end of the driveway). The best balance bikes can set young kids up for cycling success, by developing their skills and encouraging a love of bike riding. Balance bikes are a more common sight among children learning to bike these days, and, among some experts, they've usurped training wheels as a preferred teaching method. Doug Ballew, a certified League of American Bicyclists instructor, has been teaching children how to ride bikes for nearly 30 years and much prefers balance bikes over training wheels. \"When my own children were little... they were on training wheels for a few years, and when we were ready to remove them, it became a long struggle to \"ween\" them from the stabilizers,\" he says. \"I learned the concept of teaching new riders on a balance bike. Of the hundreds of children I've taught to ride since then, I have noticed that some of my toughest students have been on training wheels for an extended period of time. The fact that they have to \"unlearn\" their dependence on the training wheels adds an extra and unnecessary step in teaching children to ride.\" After speaking with Ballew, and reviewing the current bestsellers on the market, I've pulled together this group of the best balance bikes for kids learning to ride. You may also want to check out our stories on the best kids bikes for older children, and the best bikes for grown-up riders of every ability, so you can ride alongside them. Ballew calls this Woom model \"the perfect bike\" to teach new riders. \"The lightweight design and ergonomics geared specifically toward children riders greatly reduces the learning curve toward balancing and then pedaling,\" he says. This Woom balance bike is especially designed for older tots who didn't learn to ride right away, according to the brand, but it can truly be used for any child 18 months and older. This bike is the first offering in a succession of Woom bike options that grow with your child's stage of development and bike riding skills. It boasts a lightweight aluminum frame, making it easy for a young child to handle and maneuver, a low positioned seat so it's a cinch to climb on board, ergonomically designed saddle and handle grips for added comfort and ease of use. The adjustable handbrake lever can be tailored to fit your child's hand. The steering limiter prevents oversteering and accidents that may ensue, and the real rubber, air-filled tires provide traction for novice riders. Ballew also points out that any Woom makes six sizes of children's bikes and that any one of them can be made into a balance bike by simply removing the pedals and lowering the seat so that the new rider can place both feet flat on the ground. \"Starting the child on a quality, lightweight bike like a Woom will help to instill a lifelong love of biking,\" he adds. Best Value Balance Bike For Kids Strider's Bestselling Balance Bike Is An Affordable Option The Strider 12 Sport offers great value without skimping on quality and thoughtful features. Designed for kids ages 18 months to 5-years-old, this training bicycle has no pedals, a lightweight frame and flat-free foam rubber tires. Strider refers to the Sport as its \"best all-around model\" and says that's probably why it's the brand's bestselling balance bike. The seat and handlebars can be adjusted tool-free as your child grows, and the liberal seat height range and longer cushioned seat will accommodate kids as they go from baby to big kid. Built-in foot rests are a nice added detail that enable kids to learn to coast and balance like they eventually will on a pedal bike.

Specialized calls its balance bike \"the ultimate first ride,\" and while young riders might not understand its value, they're certain to love its sleek, impressive design and how great it is to ride.

The bike is ready for the elements thanks to its hardy diamond frame and forged dropouts. Its frame, fork hub, rims steerer, stem and handlebars are aluminum, and its hardened spokes (2o on each wheel) are made of steel to ensure they don't buckle.

The Big Foot 12 has 2.25 inch balloon tires with knobby treads, which will keep kids from feeling the bumpy terrain beneath them, and they'll also provide ideal traction.
