Rap\u00e9 is the preparation of powdered medicinal herbs, often with a tobacco base. Hap\u00e9 is typically made with mapacho - Hap\u00e9 elicits a feeling of alertness and elevation that surpasses most other natural plant-based effects. The effects of hap\u00e9 are experienced rapidly and intensely because the powdered snuff is administered through the nose. The practice of consuming powdered plant medicines through the nose is much more ancient than we realized (dating from the pre-Columbian days) and was first observed among the Brazilian indigenous tribes. In Europe, herbal snuff was introduced by the doctor and botanist Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de Boncalo in 1577 - and the elites of that time often took snuff as a headache treatment. During the XVIII century, inhaling snuff became fashionable among the European aristocracy. Today, indigenous tribes in the Amazon basin continue to use hap\u00e9 in all aspects of life, from formal ritual use in rites of puberty, initiation, cashiri drinkings festivals, social gatherings and healing ceremonies, to simply tuning into Nature and the healing power of sacred plant medicines alone or with friends. There are several tribes that traditionally used hap\u00e9 - which include but are not limited to Yawanawa, Kaxinawa, Nukini, Kuntanawa, Apurin\u00e3, Ashaninka, and produce their own specific kinds of Hap\u00e9 blend and have different ways of preparing the herbal snuff, from techniques to songs that are sung during the rap\u00e9 rituals. From the indigenous point of view, hap\u00e9 is a sacred shamanic snuff medicine with profound healing effects. Hap\u00e9 is made from different medicinal plants for different purposes - to induce visions, to have energy, and to enhance the senses with the aromatic fragrance of the plants used in the blend. Given that there are myriad medicinal plants you can blend into hap\u00e9, there are many various hap\u00e9 recipes in existence - and these recipes are often closely guarded by the tribes as secrets. Sharing hap\u00e9 - is traditionally a ritualistic practice among Amazonian tribes that may include specific chants to activate the force of the hap\u00e9 and to confer the healing power of the forest upon the hap\u00e9 recipient. The ritual use of hap\u00e9 is also making its way around the world, introduced to the West through ayahuasca ceremonies by traveling shamans and by visitors who have spent time in the jungle with indigenous communities.
