Sarah Scheerger Department of Agronomy and Horticulture at University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA Nancy Lewis Department of Agronomy and Horticulture at University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA | | Lesson Navigation Tips: This lesson discusses the risks and benefits of biotechnology as well as the common consumer concerns with biotechnology. The concerns include questions about antibiotic resistance, the potential for biotechnology products to be allergenic, as well as concerns for the environment. Some of the benefits of biotechnology include the ability of reducing specific proteins from foods that could be harmful to some individuals, improving nutrient content, and reducing the use of pesticides. After completing Module Two: Biotechnology and the Consumer, participants should: Development of this lesson was supported in part by USDA Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems (IFAFS) and the Cooperative State Research, Education, & Extension Service, U.S. Dept of Agriculture under Agreement Number 00-52100-9710. Any opinions, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the view of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Many studies have been conducted to assess consumers' opinions about biotechnology and food. Studies have shown that consumers are more accepting of using biotechnology to change plants vs. animals (3). More than 15 years of laboratory research and field trials with genetically engineered plants indicate that the risks posed by these plants are not any greater than or different from the risks posed by plants produced using traditional breeding methods used for more than 100 years (2). Labeling Foods with Biotech Components The guidelines the FDA finalized in 1992 require foods grown using biotechnology, or foods containing ingredients that were derived from biotechnology, to have special labels if (2): As educators, counselors, and professionals it is important to be aware of the consumer issues regarding labeling. Being aware of these issues will allow proper and truthful education to consumers. Pro-labeling Arguments Anti-labeling Arguments *If you have 'dial-up' internet service, are using a home computer, or do not have RealPlayer, the picture and voice-over may not be clear and will have limited ability. In this video clip, Dr. Steve Taylor acknowledges some of the consumer concerns that will be addressed in this lesson. Potential for biotechnology products to be allergenic Allergies are abnormal responses that some consumers have that involve unusual reactions of their immune systems to [protein](javascript:void(0);) components of food. All allergens are proteins. But only a few of the many millions of proteins that occur in nature are allergens. For example, most people can eat peanuts, but some people are allergic to peanuts. This is because their immune system perceives one or more of the many proteins in peanuts as an [allergen](javascript:void(0);). Researchers have demonstrated that you can potentially transfer an allergen by [genetic engineering](javascript:void(0);). One example of this was the transfer of a specific [gene](javascript:void(0);), from the Brazil-nut, into soybeans. Researchers hoped to increase the [methionine](javascript:void(0);) content in soybeans by inserting a gene from Brazil nuts, that produced a protein with very high methionine residues. Through a series of experiments, researchers were able to determine that the protein selected from Brazil nuts was in fact a major allergen to humans (6). In this video clip, Dr. Steve Taylor addresses the issue of allergenic properties in foods produced through biotechnology. It is important to assess the allergenicity of each one of the proteins in genetically engineered foods. Industries, and governments worldwide are paying particular attention to the characteristics of traits that may cause allergic responses. Many industries, as demonstrated by the Brazil-nut incident, are committed to thorough safety assessments. The following four specific recommendations were suggested by the FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Biotechnology and Food Safety (7). 1.) Unless the transferred gene can be documented and coded as a non-allergen, the transfer of genes from commonly allergenic foods should be avoided. 2.) Products containing an allergen from transferred DNA should have clear identification in the market-place, or they should not be considered for marketing approval. 3.) Industries, governments, and organizations involved with the biotechnology food industry should be aware of guidelines and actions needed to be taken if a food contains new proteins that are determined to have allergenic characteristics. 4.) For proteins that are food allergens, researchers are encouraged to identify the specific protein and its characteristics. Module 5 - Allergenicity; addresses food allergies, the mechanism of allergic reactions to food, testing of foods, and more! Use of [Marker](javascript:void(0);) Genes Antibiotic [resistance](javascript:void(0);) is a serious public health issue, but that problem is currently and primarily caused by the overuse or misuse of antibiotics. Careful consideration has been given to whether the use of antibiotic resistance marker [genes](javascript:void(0);) in crops could pose a public health concern and no evidence has been found that it does. There is little if any transfer of genes from plants to bacteria. Bacteria pick up resistance to genes from other bacteria, and they do it easily and often. The potential risk of transfer from plants to bacteria is substantially less than the risk of normal transfer between bacteria. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, FDA has advised food developers to avoid using marker genes that encode resistance to clinically important antibiotics. --FDA Commissioner Jane E. Henney, M.D. In this video clip, Dr. Tom Clemente explains the use of marker genes. | | Butterflies A study conducted at Cornell University raised concerns about the effects on Monarch butterfly larvae. Researchers reported that when butterfly larvae eat only pollen from Bt corn, many of them died or failed to thrive. In response to that laboratory study, more assessment was done. This close look indicates that in nature, most milkweed doesn't grow close enough to cornfields to be exposed to significant amounts of corn pollen. Also, Monarch larvae feed primarily on milkweed & preferentially eat milkweed without corn pollen. Furthermore, the vast majority of Bt corn now grown in the U.S. does not produce pollen that kills Monarch butterflies, so experts conclude that the risk to Monarch populations from Bt corn is low. Greater threats to Monarch butterflies are the use of externally applied Bt and destruction of wildlife habitats by humans. Pesticides are also more likely to harm non-target insects besides the Monarch butterfly because they get into the soil and may be carried by water to non-farmland areas (2). Resistance to Changes by 'Pests' Through the natural process of genetic change and adaptation, it is always possible for an insect population or a plant disease strain to build up resistance to a chemical insecticide or fungicide, to a protective trait in a plant, or to any number of the techniques used to fight plant pests. Gene products for pest control are usually more target-specific than pesticides - like vaccines compared to antibiotics. For example, Bt corn kills almost 100 percent of the corn borer and corn earworm, but traditional pesticides do not because these pests burrow into plants, where sprays cannot penetrate. The greater the number to pests that survive exposure to a pesticide, the greater the chance they will develop resistance. The pest-control mechanisms provided by genes tend to kill only insects that chew on the plant, not those in the plant's vicinity. Externally applied pesticides kill both pests and innocent and often beneficial insects that are in the field. Traditional pesticides have been brought to market for decades without plans in place to delay resistance. By contrast, years of research to minimize resistance has accompanied the introduction of plants modified through biotechnology. Weed Resistance to Biotech Crops: 'Super-weeds' The likelihood that transgenes will spread can be different for each crop in each area of the world. Gene movement depends on several factors: Self-pollinating plants, such as soybeans and wheat, are less likely to spread their transgenes than cross-pollinating plants such as corn and beets. Gene movement from crop to weed through pollen transfer has been demonstrated for both wild mustards in canola and jointed goatgrass in wheat. To reduce the risk of creating 'super-weeds' it has been proposed to include linking herbicide-resistance genes to other genes which are harmless to the crop but damaging to the weed, so that the offspring of the weed that acquired the herbicide-resistance gene would not survive. Thus, spread of the herbicide resistance gene through the weed population would cease. Outcrossing, the unintentional breeding of a domestic crop with a related plant, is considered by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) during review of new plant varieties. The agency ensures that herbicide-tolerant or pest-resistant plants do not become plant pests themselves by outcrossing to weedy relatives. New transgenic crops will need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with respect to the potential for crop-to-weed gene flow for each species in each geographical location. Like traditionally bred plants, genetically modified plants cannot transfer traits into unrelated species in nature. If transfer of the new trait to the weed could be problematic, APHIS has the authority to halt field trials or further development of the proposed new variety. It is also important to remember that traditionally bred plants also have the potential to create weeds (2). Environmental Regulations It is important to remember that crops produced through biotechnology are also regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA has oversight for pesticidal properties of plants developed through biotechnology. EPA has also implemented insect resistance management requirements for biotech crops, and are required for approvals of insect-protected plant varieties(2, 9). So biotech crops, foods, and products are subjected to a wide array of environmental laws, as well as state and local regulations and standards. Biotechnology raises questions and concern of food-labeling, allergens, antibiotic [resistance](javascript:void(0);), and effects on the [environment](javascript:void(0);), for consumers. But biotechnology also offers benefits. Biotechnology can help individuals that have immune responses to specific proteins by reducing a specific [protein](javascript:void(0);) level and diminishing the allergic response. Biotechnology can help to decrease the use of pesticides and herbicides on crops. Biotechnology has also helped to increase the nutrient content in certain foods to help alleviate health problems. Let's take a closer look at each of these consumer benefits. Using the tools of biotechnology to reduce known allergens in foods Although there is a concern about foods produced through biotechnology to be allergenic, there is also the possibility and potential for biotechnology to help reduce allergy problems. Researchers and scientists are working to decrease specific allergens in foods that elicit allergic responses. The tools of biotechnology have shown researchers what allergens are out there in a food product. So the potential of going into a certain food and reducing their level of a particular [allergen](javascript:void(0);) is possible, therefore reducing allergy problems. This could broaden the use of many food products, including peanuts and wheat products for example. In this video clip, Dr. Tom Clemente addresses the potential benefit of reducing allergens through biotechnology. Module 5 - Allergenicity; addresses food allergies, the mechanism of allergic reactions to food, testing of foods, and more! Through the tools of biotechnology it may be possible to engineer herbicide-resistant crops. Proponents of biotechnology claim that herbicide-resistant crops will enable the use of less inputs, less toxic herbicides, and more environmentally friendly herbicides and pesticides. While others disagree, and believe that herbicide-resistant crops will increase the use of herbicides and result in the use of herbicides with greater killing power, and will have a negative effect on the [environment](javascript:void(0);) (8). Biotechnology has the potential to improve the food supply by enhancing nutrient composition (12,13,16,17). By using biotechnology, we can increase the levels of nutrients, or alter the fatty acid content, that can help us live healthier lives and reduce the risk of chronic disease (13,17). The interest of the possible health benefits from [essential fatty acids](javascript:void(0);) has sparked research and advances in engineering of plant fatty acid metabolism. With biotechnology, it is possible to create a plant that produces more of a specific essential fatty acid (20). For example, the documented benefits of g-linolenic, an omega-6 fatty acid, include aiding in the treatment of eczema, psoriasis, and vascular disorders (18,21). The benefits of a-linolenic, an omega-3 fatty acid, have also been well documented. These benefits include aiding in the development of the brain and retina, reducing the risk of heart disease, modifying inflammation and benefiting inflammatory autoimmune diseases (22,23). Thus with biotechnology and developments in engineering, it may be possible to improve the health-giving benefits of plants, such that plants would be able to produce greater amounts of a given fatty acid. Biotechnology also enables production of plants with natural fortification of important nutrients (13,16,19). This becomes particularly important when populations are deficient in nutrients. For example, countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa are deficient in vitamin A. The food crops that are particularly high in this micronutrient, such as fruits and vegetables, are not regularly available to these populations at affordable prices, thus deficiency occurs, resulting in significant health problems. But with biotechnology, fortification of vitamin A into food crops that are readily available to that population, such as rice, is possible. Thus biotechnology has helped to improve world health by enhancing the nutrient content in foods. Further potential benefits of biotechnology include increasing the content of vitamin C, iron, zinc, and calcium in plant foods for human consumption (16,19). By increasing the content of these micronutients in foods, it is possible to reduce deficiencies and malnutrition in many populations, thus improving world health, and increasing protection against disease (13,16,19). The production of [transgenic](javascript:void(0);) crop varieties is expensive and requires resources that are unavailable to many developing countries. Some have criticized that ownership and control of the production of transgenic crops currently grown is in the hands of a few powerful corporations, often resulting in restrictive conditions on farmers buying their seed. The importance of biotechnology for developing countries has been debated. Some debate that biotechnology will not ensure food security, nor reduce poverty in the developing world, while others believe biotechnology will be important to the developing world.
