They don't return phone calls. They say to email them and they will respond; NOT. Waiting about 2 1/2 weeks now to see about getting an appt since I have had a Groupon. The last time I came into Sedona and wanted to use it; she said to call them and get my money back. Well, why don't they STOP running specials on Groupon; if they NEVER can get you in. I found Sedona Soul Sisters. They are fabulous, don't waste your time with this poorly run establishment that continues with the 'Covid' excuse how they can't find anyone to work. BS.. - Y9862REsarac00A must do when in Sedona!A WONDERFUL experience. There were 3 of us & we each had a private room. Our choices of aromatherapy scent was placed on a paper bib & draped around our neck throughout the treatment. Eye covering & head phones with soothing music played to allow our senses to take everything in. Our feet were placed in a copper bowl with a mild electrical current to remove any body toxins. At the end of the foot bath, our mineral colors were explained & then our chosen lotion was applied. A beautiful hot tea with honey was served to us in the relaxation area. Ours was a pomigranite flavor & awesome! We felt pure relaxation & a calmness that was freeing of daily interuptions of modern life. The Owner was very engaging, explaining the signifigance of the area, the vortexe energy & how her & her husband got started. A nice shop of products is available too. A true calling for them. We LOVED it. - Mamamarge800Inspiring, uplifting and educationalWe had an amazing experience with the chakra reading and vortex tour. Frank was informative, entertaining and quite lovely. I would highly recommend this experience, especially if you are traveling with a skeptic. Frank is a scientist first, so he grounds his information in facts and science which makes it even more interesting. But you can feel the passion behind it all. It's inspiring and enlightening. We will be back! - Nevuah00Healing in many levelsWonderful experience. Relaxing. Therapeutic. We were very well taken care of by knowledgeable people who were so sincere and kind. The location was beautiful with the most exquisite healing art made by the owner. Fascinating technology. I highly recommend this experience. - arielsD9909QH00Completely revitalized!I went in for a foot bath and had no idea what to expect. I didn't know I'd also be walking into one of the most calming and nurturing spaces I've ever been in! My foot bath was both relaxing and holistic as it removed toxins from my liver and gallbladder, and I feel a worlds difference to this day. The pomegranate detox tea they serve you after is a must-have which I was able to purchase from their array of quality wellness products. This is a must for anyone looking to increase their over health & vitality! - PhoenixSammie0045 minute whole body detox spa foot bathI loved this... the detox was unbelievable.. totality amazing results.. I have already made plans to return to Intuitive Wellness Center in Sedona!! - Elinor F00Totally RelaxingA total sensory treatment with essential oils, calm music and warm feet. It was a wonderfully relaxing experience from the beginning to the delicious tea at the end. The center is in a peaceful location right in the middle of town and has a very welcoming atmosphere. - Ola_Aloha_Life00An \"eye-opening\" experience!Beautiful center located in the heart of Sedona! Owners are lovely and very welcoming...feels like home A very unique foot detox in a completely relaxing environment (you get your own \"room\") which includes a wonderful guided meditation You will be shocked at what is released from your body at the end of your treatment This is a \"must do\" while in Sedona! - LauraGisel00Amazing customer service!I cannot say enough about how amazing the owner is! It was my first time going to Sedona and found her on Groupon. I called to make sure she had openings and not only did she accommodate my time but she also gave me the best directions to get Sedona and other activities to do there. When I got there, she welcomed me with a hug. She explained the foot bath to us since it was my first one and once it started, I felt so relaxed! I'm not sure when I'm going back but whenever I do go, I will make sure to go back there again. - bcandrocket00Beautiful, meaningful centerThe energy in this center is incredible. It is such a gift to the already magical Sedona. Frank and Shalayna are wonderful people who are there to help and bring people into their full awareness and power. Truly an incredible place. - karie25100Cleaning through a different set of eyesMy husband and I met Frank and Shalayna from intuitive Wellness on one of our weekend excursions. We scheduled an appointment on Sunday mid morning and did the 45 min foot detox. OHHEMMMGEEE The stuff that comes out of your body!!!! So disgusting!!! But so happy it's no longer in me! This was an awesome relaxing experience where you sit in a quiet setting with an eye mask on, ear phones playing meditation soothing music, and inhaling essential oils while your soaking your feet in the foot bath. At the end of the session you can see what has been detoxified from your body and will be totally amazed. After the treatment you tend to feel more \"Alive\" if you will.. I can personally say I am not feeling sluggish or exhausted, I want to get up n go. I am in a better mood and almost feel that I should be really doing this more often! If you don't want to get a foot detox, at least take a peek into this center where you will find essential oils, stones, Crystals, candles, necklaces and bracelets with different meanings and energies. This is a definite must go. I will be going back - sanyajaffer78600A Truly Spiritual Experience!!My partner and I both tried this for the first time together, and it truly exceeded our expectations and beyond. Frank and Shalayna are both very talented, intuitive, warm, and inviting people. They made our experience unforgettable! The holographic lights are customized and designed for your individual therapeutic experience, which helped us both with our own individual intuitive reflections. The sound activation aligned perfectly with the holographic lights, allowing for a beautiful meditative experience. It was truly a very spiritual experience for the both of us, and we both left feeling extremely relaxed, as if a weight had been lifted off of our shoulders. We will definitely be returning for another session soon, and HIGHLY recommend this to anyone and everyone who is wanting to try it! You definitely will not want to miss this, it is truly an unforgettable experience which we will remember forever. - PatriciaV220400PeacefulBeautiful space, knowledgeable and caring staff/owners, good energy I visited on their grand opening and was quite pleased and impressed with the thoughtful attention to detail - Christine G00Feeling so detoxedI loved this treatment, you can see all the toxins leaving your body, while you are relaxing and listening to a guided meditation on noise cancelling headphones. It was lovely! I really felt all the beneficial effects of the detox over the next couple of days, feeling lighting and more energized. It was amazing - Ccrtist00Rejuvenating experience!I went to In Intuitive Wellness in Sedona after seeing a Groupon for the Guided Meditation session. I called ahead since I live in Michigan and spoke with Shalayna who was so helpful and kind and I ended up booking a Vortex tour through her as well! When I got there I took my tour with Sheila, a psychic who was very informative about the area and told me about the different energies there. I had a private tour with her. Then I went back to Intuitive Wellness for my meditation session which worked out very well. I was able to relax like I had never been able to before. I then added the Foot Detox. That was amazing! After all of that plus drinking water which was energized with precious stones I was invigorated! I felt so rejuvenated and clear it was wonderful! Shalayna and Frank are great people and if you get to Sedona you must go there and have some services with them! I will definitely continue with the meditations on their website and I will see them again when I return to Sedona. It was truly a great experience.
