As a result, many Americans are self-prescribing and spending in excess of $30 billion annually on herbal and dietary supplements to address their health concerns. It is important for health care providers to receive timely, evidence-based information in order to address the risks and benefits of supplements with their patients. In this dynamic partnership with patients, providers also need information about regulatory issues, dosing and product potency. To address these needs, world-renowned faculty will present a concise, clinically relevant overview of natural supple - ments in evidence-based practice, with an emphasis on disease states. As part of this informative and comprehensive CME conference, attendees will have the opportunity to participate in a full day of highly interactive workshops in order to fine tune clinical applications. This medical education event is a must-attend for anyone wanting to acquire a wide-range of knowledge and expertise for addressing and managing dietary supplement use. Course Highlights Three days of evidenced-based educational courses presented by leading experts Full day of interactive workshops to fine tune clinical applications Emphasis on disease states Opportunities to interact with faculty and fellow attendees to establish a network of like-minded professionals Educational Objectives After attending this activity, participants should be able to: Recognize the potential role of supplements in preventive medicine and in the management of common medical conditions. Judge the regulatory aspects of the supplement industry and their implications for clinical and research practice. Discuss current research and literature related to natural supplements. Examine, through evidence-based summaries, key supplements used in clinical practice, including their indications, side effects, interactions and contraindications. Formulate a patient care treatment program that integrates supplements in preventive medicine and in the management of common medical conditions. Access and/or recommend resources for acquiring additiona l supplement related information for the clinician or patient. Increase proper supplement usage by patients by involving the patient as an active partner in care, with an emphasis on patient education, acceptance and compliance. Target Audience This course is intended for physicians, naturopathic doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses, nurse midwives, acupuncturists, chiropractors, dietitians, pharmacists, physician assistants, psychologists and any other health care professional who makes nutritional recommen - dations or manages dietary supplement use.
