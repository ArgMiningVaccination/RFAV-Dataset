They have benefited from my guidance, because of the extensive knowledge I have developed with the Master Cleanse and my experience in using it, as well as my relationship with its creator and developer (who will be profiled in Chapter 3) and one of his foremost students and teachers, Maynard Dalderis. Recent articles about the efficacy of the Master Cleanse have been featured in leading American newspapers and on top-rated television shows, with a variety of celebrity endorsements, bringing it the attention it so rightly deserves.\u00b9 The Master Cleanse is a marvelous gift to those tens or even hundreds of thousands of people who are looking for a simple, inexpensive, and amazingly effective way to improve their health, boost their sense of well-being (both physical and emotional), and change from their experience of dis-ease (as I will spell it throughout this book) to a steady state of feeling healthy and whole. What Is the Master Cleanse? The Master Cleanse is one of the most simple, effective, and inexpensive cleansing and healing programs available. It is a liquid monodiet (that is, one mixture only) designed to work with and complement your body's own cleansing and detoxifying processes, and at the same time to nourish your body with the things it needs to function. It is not a true fast (one in which there is no nutrition), nor is it a means to starve the body in order to lose weight dangerously fast. The cleanse is typically done for 10 days, but can be safely maintained for many more days in a row, even weeks, when desired. The ingredients of the monodiet are specified in detail in Part 2 of this book, but for now you will be glad to know that they are readily available, light on the wallet, and easy to combine and drink: good water, fresh lemon juice, maple syrup, and cayenne pepper. That's all. I have benefited greatly from this program! For more than two decades I have followed my own instructions for doing the Master Cleanse, correcting my steps as I learned from experience, tailoring the program to my clients with a variety of conditions, and on occasion testing and adding other therapies as adjuncts. I have completed over one hundred cleanses of my own body, and can bear personal witness to its health-giving benefits. I would not recommend it if it did not work for me. Among the most important benefits it has brought me: I have not seen a medical doctor for treatment from the first day I began training in this program, January 8, 1980. For over 25 years I have used this program to treat all of my own health conditions, including neck and shoulder pain, prostate issues, headaches, constipation, shingles, and other minor ailments. I have gained confidence and freedom by knowing that with the Master Cleanse I can deal with those health issues that arise for me. Despite the thousands of successful Master Cleanse treatments I have helped clients do in my practice, and the hundreds of success stories I have heard from colleagues and other reputable sources, there are still many naysayers of the program. No surprise here! This is how a society typically reacts to virtually any holistic or unconventional nonmedical health practice throughout history, as well as to scientific discoveries that are later borne out by careful research. Today, even though we are well launched into the 21st century and living in an age of supposed rationality, many people do not understand the simple concept of what causes, and cures, organic dis-ease. This is true partly because of the monopoly of the health care system by allopathic medicine, otherwise known as mainstream medicine. This monopoly makes every effort to discredit the alternative health care movement that has been carefully built on traditional folk-treatments dating back hundreds of years through myriad cultures. GOOD TO KNOW Dis-ease has its origins in the 14th century. The Middle English word disese, combining des- + eise, meant a condition of an animal, or one of its parts, that impairs normal functioning and is often manifested by outward signs or inner symptoms. The root ease derives from the Old French and Latin for adiacens, or lying down. Dis-ease implies the inability to rest comfortably and feel well. Doubters and Skeptics When I started practicing in my field of holistic health counseling, about a quarter century ago, the medical establishment held fast to the pervasive ideology that diet had little or no effect in causing dis-ease. Doctors treated patients as if their bodies had no necks to connect the mind and body, as one being. Their patients' diet and state of mind were believed to be of little or no consequence to their bodies' health. It was thought that people could eat whatever they desired, live however they wished, and if they developed symptoms of a dis-ease their doctor could prescribe a magic pill or potion, or do a little operation, that would fix all their problems, which seemed to be of unknown origin. In recent years, however, more and more of us in the holistic health field have learned that mind and body are connected and, therefore, that any dis-ease or illness must be treated in a unified and complementary manner that takes both into account. To give only one example, in February 2007 a medical study in Canada found that the children of women who took a prenatal multivitamin while pregnant went on to have significantly lower incidences of certain cancers.\u00b2 Brain tumors were reduced by 27 percent, leukemia by 39 percent, and neuroblastoma (an often fatal dis-ease of embryonic ganglion cells) by 47 percent. It would have been heresy, 25 years ago, to suggest that expectant mothers could, with a simple supplement, have such a dramatic impact on their children's health in the months or years to come. Some researchers have even reported that grants to study diet as a potential cause of cancer were in the past almost always turned down by funders who favor mainstream medicine, or who are financially linked to it in some way. Over the years, as I developed my holistic practice, many people have scoffed, even laughed in my face, telling me that I was crazy to suggest a link between dis-ease and diet...that no scientific evidence would support this...that my explanation was too simplistic...that the Master Cleanse had no basis in medical science...and on and on. In my view, such people simply did not want to hear the bad news: that they literally were making themselves sick by their own lifestyle choices. And they didn't want to hear the good news, either: that I could help them feel better with my program. The Key to Success: Doing the Cleanse Correctly I know the Master Cleanse works, when done correctly. I have talked to thousands of people about the Master Cleanse. I have often been astonished to realize that a large percentage of those who have done the Master Cleanse have done it wrong. Some people use poor or inappropriate ingredients, or in the wrong proportions, or add an idea of their own, or come off the cleanse too early, or sneak food when they feel hunger pangs during the cleanse. That is why I have written this book\u2014to present an easy-to-follow, complete program of cleansing, as well as supplemental information on adjuncts to cleansing. Recently I was in a health food store buying lemons. When the cashier said she was on a fast, I asked her which one. She said the Lemonade Diet\u2014that is, the Master Cleanse itself\u2014and she was on Day 3. I replied that, by coincidence, I too was on Day 3 just then. I then asked her a few questions. It quickly became clear to me that she was omitting one very important step, so I gently told her about it, and explained my practice a little to give her some confidence in what I was saying. (Of course, I was not treating her professionally.) This happens almost every day with me, and sometimes several times a day when I'm circulating at conferences or teaching workshops. The sad truth is that a great many people seem unable (or unwilling?) to follow the directions to do the Master Cleanse correctly. This virtually ensures that they will not succeed, and can even cause many who do the cleanse improperly to experience much grief and later feel disdain for trying any kind of cleanse ever again. Such unfortunate mistakes hinder the huge potential of the Master Cleanse to help those many people who are looking for answers to improve their health and well-being. Further, such mistakes make an already misunderstood concept of natural health seem even more suspect in many seekers' minds. How This Book Is Structured This book has been carefully designed to instruct you how to do the Master Cleanse in the most effective way possible, to achieve the greatest benefits to your health and well-being. The chapters in Part I will provide you the intriguing background of the visionary man who developed the Master Cleanse, tell you why today most of us need to cleanse our bodies regularly, help you understand the physical and emotional aspects of dis-ease, and explain how the cleanse works to detoxify the body. Part II lists step-by-step procedures for getting ready to do the cleanse, gathering the necessary ingredients and learning their properties, doing the cleanse correctly and safely, staying on it for the right duration for optimal results, coming off it feeling well, and dealing with any issues or concerns that might arise along the way. A day-by-day chart is presented, giving you a place to log your intake and to note how you feel each day; it will provide a helpful record for future cleanses as well. Part III contains chapters explaining several adjunctive therapies that can support the Master Cleanse. It also features chapters that increase your understanding of how the mind can help the body get better, explain how you can rid yourself of harmful parasites that treat your body as a host to feed on, and offer other useful information such as advanced cleansing techniques. Finally, the book contains a variety of answers to frequently asked questions, inspiring testimonials from people who now swear by the Master Cleanse, some of my favorite recipes for healthful eating after doing a cleanse, and lastly some resources and further reading to help you in your quest for better health. I devoutly hope that this book will inspire you\u2014and perhaps some of your friends or family as well\u2014to take your health safely back into your own hands. Doing a Master Cleanse can be one of the most empowering and satisfying things you could ever do for yourself! The rewards you experience from it will go far beyond what you might ever have expected or thought you deserved. And, believe me, I am confident that you will want to continue to do Master Cleanses regularly, for the rest of your happy and healthy life. I strongly support you in achieving your goals. So now plunge in, read on, and enjoy this book. Your life may never be the same again! CHAPTER 2 How I Found the Master Cleanse In my young adulthood I had taken a mindless job: working as the driver of a front-end loader moving steel around at a mill. My part-time job had became full time, and for a while I had put going back to school low on my list of priorities. My work afforded me the time to let my mind wander. One day I found myself saying, I want to be healthier, I want to be happier, and I want to be more fulfilled. I would then repeat this frequently, like a mantra. One day everything changed. But first I have to tell you how the pieces came together. Diving Into My New Life I had always had a desire to skydive\u2014that's right, jumping out of airplanes. OK, so call me crazy, call me a risk taker, but you know the adage: Nothing ventured, nothing gained. The desire to skydive led me to an instructor in the sport who later became a friend, named Michael Liggett. In his early years of skydiving Michael had spent time in California, where he met a woman who introduced him to an alternative lifestyle in which he chose to eat more consciously and to start taking nutritional supplements. After a couple of years of friendship, Michael moved in with my partner and me. While we were roommates he was dating a woman who gave him a book called Healing for the Age of Enlightenment, by someone named Stanley Burroughs. She had received the book from a former boyfriend, named Richard Grassie, who had just returned from Hawaii, where he happened to meet Burroughs and became intrigued with his work. Well, Michael's girlfriend passed the book on to him, he read it, and he talked to me about a so-called Lemonade Diet, or the Master Cleanser\u00ae, that the book claimed could heal your every ailment. Being very skeptical I replied, If it's so good, why don't doctors use it? (One of those questions that has no answer.) I said that I wasn't interested, but Michael persisted. I told him that I had reservations about doing the diet because of my work at the steel mill. I felt that it might be dangerous, because, as I said, What if I got weak and fainted? In those days I was eating meat twice or three times a day and drinking a quart of milk daily; at the time, I thought mine was a healthy diet. I believed my health to be good, so I certainly didn't need a weird lemonade diet. Truth be known, I had a bowel movement only every two to three days, which was called normal by medical standards. I was also experiencing a lot of pain in my neck and shoulders from injuries to my neck while playing football and from a compression injury I sustained at work. Around that time my doctor suggested that I have some vertebrae in my neck fused, to stop the pain\u2014a radical treatment. I was actually considering this as an option. This sounds crazy in retrospect, I realize, but we all do the best we can with what we know at the time. As fate would have it, the workers at my plant went out on strike. Now I had the time to do the Lemonade Diet while off work. So I told Michael that I would do it, mainly to prove to him that it wouldn't work! Then all three of us\u2014Michael, my girlfriend, and I\u2014decided to try the lemonade drill. On the third day of the diet, I went to my dentist to get my wisdom teeth removed, one per week for four weeks. After doing some surgery and removing the first tooth, the dentist gave me two prescriptions to take, an antibiotic and a painkiller. I told him that I was on a diet that recommended not taking drugs while doing it, and actually defended this position. He pressed me and said that an infection could spread from the gum to the heart and kill me. I knew someone who had died in this manner, so I acknowledged that this was a valid point. I then went on the antibiotics and stopped the Lemonade Diet for a while, perhaps for 4 to 6 days. Then I went back on it and continued to have my dental work done, but refused to take the drugs. Each socket healed so quickly that I would remove the stitches myself and never experienced any pain whatsoever. Not only did my gums heal quickly, but after doing the Master Cleanse I started having a bowel movement every day like clockwork, an important improvement in my health. When I started eating again after coming off the diet properly, I came to two realizations. First, after eating a small rib-eye steak one evening, I felt as if I had consumed a lead brick; how could I possibly digest that? Second, drinking a glass of milk the next day also made me feel uncomfortable. Hey, what was happening to me? My two favorite foods made me feel heavy, as if my insides were ill at ease. Years after this experience, as I began building my holistic health practice, I would recommend the Master Cleanse to many people who were having tooth or gum problems. One client who came to me mostly for weight loss was on the Master Cleanse and, on her 28th day of the diet, went in for a root canal. When the dentist removed the cap, she was so surprised at what she saw that she called in a second dentist to view the tooth; the infection in the root was now completely gone\u2014something they had never seen occur before. My client, of course, was happy to forgo the root canal and save herself the extra expense and pain. We Become How We Were Raised As children, we usually were not given choices about the food we ate. We were told to clean our plate, otherwise we wouldn't get dessert, or we should eat every last bit because children in Africa were starving. We learned to numb our feelings, even our bodies, to cope, and so we adopted our parents' way of eating as our own lifestyle. I have since learned that the Master Cleanse will resensitize your body to whatever you put into it. After some experimentation with the diet, I was now experiencing and enjoying many foods in a completely different way. There I was, a confirmed carnivore, now apparently unable to eat meat or drink milk in comfort. People would ask me what was wrong. I would reply that I just felt better if I didn't eat those things, and again they asked what was up with that. Eventually I would have to tell them, \"You can eat what you want, and I will choose to eat what feels good to me, thank you very much.\" Some of my clientele, when they are preparing to do the Master Cleanse, have said to me, Tom, I am not here to become a vegetarian, and I have responded that I had no intention of making them one, nor could I even if I wanted to. A month later these people would tell me that they had eaten meat only once that month and didn't miss it at all. I believe that everyone makes their best "}
