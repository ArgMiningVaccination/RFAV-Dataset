After a few years of dabbling with different modalities, she finally took a vinyasa yoga class and fell in love with the practice. In 2004, Kate signed up for her first 200-hour teacher training program at the Asheville Yoga Center, thinking it would be a great way to deepen her practice and learn all of the things she was eager to know about yoga. Shortly after graduating from teacher training, Kate left the software industry and set off to write her second act. This second act started with a 10-day silent Vipassana meditation course and a trip to the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute in Mysore, India. Soon after, Kate started studying under her current teacher, Baron Baptiste. In 2011, Kate opened [Savannah Power Yoga](https://savannahpoweryoga.com/) with the mission to create a space for the consistent practice of yoga. Since opening, Savannah Power Yoga has trained more than 100 teachers and offered more than 12,000 classes and workshops. In 2018, Kate developed the Spry Mind+Body methodology to bring the practices of Baptiste Power Yoga to students with osteoporosis and other age-related conditions.
