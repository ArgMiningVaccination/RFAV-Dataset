Former carer Sam Ravelle, 41, of Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, is also using homeopathic medicines, herbs and supplements in a bid to beat the illness. She was diagnosed with an aggressive grade three tumour in her right breast in August 2012. Doctors at Ashford Hospital, Middlesex, offered her a lumpectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy but she has rejected the treatments in favour of urine therapy and alternative medicines. Sam Ravelle has shunned conventional treatments in favour of alternatives therapies to treat her cancer 'I don't believe in chemotherapy - I think it's toxic,' she said. 'I've researched it and it seems like madness. If someone is healthy, you don't wipe out their immune system, so if someone has a problem you shouldn't wipe out their immune system either. 'Chemo isn't exclusive to cancer cells, it goes to healthy cells too, and you can be left with so many problems and no immune system. 'You get lots of people who have survived but have no quality of life.' Critics have argued the alternative therapies do not work and can put patients at risk by moving them away from more traditional treatments. Urine therapy is mentioned in the Bible and historical documents suggest that the Aztecs disinfected wounds with it, while the benefits are also mentioned in Indian and Chinese literature. Urine is highly sterile, consisting of water and five per cent nutrients such as proteins, vitamins and minerals. Advocates of the treatments believe these excreted ingredients have health benefits including a boosted immune system. The therapy meant Miss Ravelle fasted for a number of days while drinking only water and her own urine. 'I've done it about five times for a three to four day period and everything feels boosted,' she said. 'I do intermittent fasting with drinking urine and water to reboot the immune system; it cleans it up and gets rid of damaged cells. 'You collect it in a jug, and you drink all of your urine all day. If you're not eating it's very clear and doesn't taste of anything. It's crystal, it's like rain water. I also put it on a patch and it helps. 'Some people are shocked and some people are really interested.' The mother-of-one has turned to homoeopathic treatments and found covering the tumour site with herbs (right) helped 'bring out' the cancer - although she admitted the second application 'hurt like hell' Miss Ravelle, pictured here earlier this year, was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer in 2012 The mother-of-one, who has a son Kyle, 24, was diagnosed in August 2012 after noticing a lump on her breast. She was referred by her GP to Ashford Hospital where she was diagnosed with the illness and offered a lumpectomy. But Miss Ravelle said opting to turn down chemotherapy was an easy decision. HOW CHEMOTHERAPY HELPS CANCER PATIENTS Chemotherapy is a treatment using anti-cancer drugs - cancer cells grow by dividing in a disorderly and uncontrolled way. Chemotherapy gets in the way of their ability to divide and grow. There is a large amount of reliable research to show the effectiveness of chemotherapy in shrinking or delaying the growth of tumours and reducing the risk of the cancer coming back in the future. We know from women who ring our support line that side effects of breast cancer treatment can be extremely gruelling. So we understand why some patients may want to weigh up the benefits against the potential side effects. However, no alternative therapies have been proven to cure cancer or slow its growth. The most important thing is that people have all the information available before making a decision about their treatment. Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care 'The oncologist said the cancer was aggressive and one stage below terminal. They immediately recommended that I have surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 'I asked what the alternative was, and when he said there was none, I walked away.' Miss Ravelle said she felt well until February 2014 when she decided to start treating herself, despite having no formal medical training. She spread herbs over the tumour in her breast, which has left an 'apricot-sized hole' in her breast, in a bid to 'bring out' her cancer. 'The first time it worked well and brought three lumps out of me- it collects into a scab which falls off and then heals over- but the second time it was hell and I was in agony,' she said. She also turned to psychic surgery, where a psychic surgeon uses invisible 'spiritual instruments' to release trapped nerves, remove blockages and even shrink tumours, without making an incision, breaking skin or drawing blood. But Miss Ravelle, who has always been interested in self-help, admitted it has not worked as well as she had hoped. 'It just didn't seem to shift what I needed shifting, although it had worked previously with my back,' she said. Now the illness has left her feeling sick and having trouble breathing but she is still determined to go on without chemotherapy. 'I'm using homeopathic drops and I'm going to give that a chance now,' she said. The former carer is determined to continue with alternative therapies as she maintains traditional treatments like chemotherapy give people a poor quality of life But Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, said no alternative therapies have been proven to cure cancer or slow its growth, whereas chemotherapy has. 'Chemotherapy is a treatment using anti-cancer drugs - cancer cells grow by dividing in a disorderly and uncontrolled way. Chemotherapy gets in the way of their ability to divide and grow,' she said. 'There is a large amount of reliable research to show the effectiveness of chemotherapy in shrinking or delaying the growth of tumours and reducing the risk of the cancer coming back in the future.

Urine therapy is said to date back to the Bible. Historical documents suggest that the Aztecs disinfected wounds with it, while the benefits are also mentioned in Indian and Chinese literature. Urine is highly sterile, consisting of 95 per cent water and five per cent nutrients such as proteins, vitamins and minerals. During the digestive process, the liver deals with toxins and removes them to be excreted. The blood then goes to the kidneys where it is filtered again and extraneous components the body no longer needs are collected in a sterile solution which is then passed as urine. But GP Dr Rob Hicks said: 'Over the years many people have claimed health benefits from drinking their own urine, but as far as I'm aware there is no scientific evidence to back-up these claims. 'The kidneys are an efficient filtering system getting rid of what the body doesn't need, so to put this back into the body seems counter-productive. 'Personally, I believe there are better - and more palatable - ways to keep the body healthy including not smoking, eating a healthy diet, and keeping stress under control.'
