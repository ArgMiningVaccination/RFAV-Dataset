You have to be willing to make changes to the things that are making you unwell in order to heal now and in the long term. There are other things that also need to be addressed when detoxing, such as unaddressed trauma, the environment you are in, your sleep pattern, you water intake, the job you do, these are all part of the detox too. So how can you support your body when you are detoxing? It's vital that your lymph system, which is the bodies drainage system, so to say, is working well. Dry body brushing of the skin, bouncing on an exercise ball, using the sauna, working a sweat, getting a lymph massage, making sure you are well hydrated, jumping on a rebounder or trampoline and even just walking are great ways to get the lymph system up and running. Those who have desk jobs or are not as active, develop sluggish lymph systems because of the lack of movement. Cleaning is also a great form of simple exercise When the body is not able to detox, there are some symptoms which may occur, which show the body is struggling. Some of these are: headaches, flu like symptoms, skin breakouts, poor concentration, insomnia, irritability, and more. It's also important that you are well nourished. Eating good quality proteins, good clean liquids, such as water, raw milk, coconut water, bone broth soups, etc... are all necessary too. Your body will struggle to detox if it is under nourished, or if you are consuming too many processed foods. So before starting any kind of detox, make sure you are ready, mentally, physically and emotionally too. It's all one big puzzle, and there is no quick fix. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Having a healthy liver and being able to detox, is essential for proper thyroid function, good digestion and a healthy metabolism.
