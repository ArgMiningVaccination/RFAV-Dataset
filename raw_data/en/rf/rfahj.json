The entire teachings of the above application(s) are incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates generally to compounds and pharmaceutical compositions useful as antiviral and antiproliferative agents. Specifically, the present 10 invention relates to nucleoside derivatives with 2'-chloroacetylenyl substitution and methods for their preparation and use. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Synthetic nucleosides such as 5-iodouracil and 5-fluorouracil have been used for 15 the treatment of cancer for many years. Since the 1980's, synthetic nucleosides have also been a focus of interest for the treatment of HIV and hepatitis. In 1981, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was identified as a disease that severely compromises the human immune system and that almost without exception leads to death. In 1983, the etiological cause of AIDS was determined to be the 20 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1985, it was reported that the synthetic nucleoside 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) inhibits the replication of human immunodeficiency virus. Since then, a number of other synthetic 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (DDI), 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (DDC), and 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'- didehydrothymidine (D4T), have been proven to be effective against HIV. After cellular 25 phosphorylation to the 5'-triphosphate by cellular kinases, these synthetic nucleosides are incorporated into a growing strand of viral DNA, causing chain termination due to the absence of the 3' -hydroxyl group. They can also inhibit the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase. The success of various synthetic nucleosides in inhibiting the replication of HIV 30 in vivo or in vitro has led a number of researchers to design and test nucleosides that substitute a heteroatom for the carbon atom at the 3' -position of the nucleoside.

No. 5,047,407 and European Patent Publication No. 0,382,526, also assigned to BioChem Pharma, Inc., disclose that a number of 2-substituted-5-substituted- 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides have antiviral activity, and specifically report that 2- hydroxymethyl-5-(cytosin-l-yl)-l,3-oxathiolane (referred to below as BCH-189) has approximately the same activity against HIV as AZT, with little toxicity. It has also been disclosed that cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-l-yl)-l,3- oxathiolane (\"FTC\") has potent HIV activity. Schinazi, et al., Inhibition of Human and Enantiomers cis-5-Fluoro-I-[2- (Hydroxymethyl)-1,3-Oxathiolane-5-yl]-Cytosine\" Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, November 1992, 2423-2431. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,210,085; 5,814,639; and 5,914,331. Another virus that causes a serious human health problem is the hepatitis B virus (referred to below as \"HBV\"). HBV is second only to tobacco as a cause of human cancer. The mechanism by which HBV induces cancer is unknown. It is postulated that it may directly trigger tumor development, or indirectly trigger tumor development through chronic inflammation, cirrhosis, and cell regeneration associated with the infection. After a two to six month incubation period in which the host is unaware of the infection, HBV infection can lead to acute hepatitis and liver damage, that causes abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated blood levels of certain enzymes. HBV can cause fulminant hepatitis, a rapidly progressive, often fatal form of the disease in which massive sections of the liver are destroyed. Patients typically recover from acute hepatitis. In some patients, however, high levels of viral antigen persist in the blood for an extended or indefinite period, causing a chronic infection. Chronic infections can lead to chronic persistent hepatitis. Patients infected with chronic persistent HBV are most common in developing countries. By mid- 1991, there were approximately 225 million chronic carriers of HBV in Asia alone, and worldwide, almost 300 million carriers. Chronic persistent hepatitis can cause fatigue, cirrhosis of the liver, and hepatocellular carcinoma, a primary liver cancer. In western industrialized countries, high risk groups for HBV infection include those in contact with HBV carriers or their blood samples. The epidemiology of HBV is very similar to that of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which accounts for why HBV infection is common among patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex. However, HBV is more contagious than HIV. WO 2013/044030 PCT/US2012/056576 Both FTC and 3TC exhibit activity against HBV. Furman, et ah, \"The Anti- Hepatitis B Virus Activities, Cytotoxicities, and Anabolic Profiles of the (-) and (+) Enantiomers of cis-5-Fluoro-l-[2-(Hydroxymethyl)-l,3-oxathiolane-5-yl]-Cytosine\" Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, December 1992, pp. 2686-2692; and Cheng, et 5 ah, Journal of Biological Chemistry, Volume 267(20), pp. 13938-13942 (1992). Other compounds that exhibit activity against HBV in humans include Clevudine or CLV (L- FMAU) (Pharmasset, Inc. under license from The University of Georgia Research Foundation and Yale University), and L-dT and L-dC (Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). HCV is the major causative agent for post-transfusion and for sporadic non A, non 10 B hepatitis (Alter, H. J. (1990) J. Gastro. Hepatol. 1:78-94; Dienstag, J. L. (1983) Gastro 85:439-462). Despite improved screening, HCV still accounts for at least 25% of the acute viral hepatitis in many countries (Alter, H. J. (1990) supra', Dienstag, J. L. (1983) supra; Alter M. J. et al. (1990a) J.A.M.A. 264:2231-2235; Alter M. J. et al (1992) N. Engl. J. Med. 327:1899-1905; Alter, M. J. et al. (1990b) A. Engl. J. Med. 321:1494- 15 1500). Infection by HCV is insidious in a high proportion of chronically infected (and infectious) carriers who may not experience clinical symptoms for many years. The high rate of progression of acute infection to chronic infection (70-100%) and liver disease (>50%), its world-wide distribution and lack of a vaccine make HCV a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are three types of interferon and a 20 combination of interferon and ribavirin used to treat hepatitis C. Selection of patients for treatment may be determined by biochemical, virologic, and when necessary, liver biopsy findings, rather than presence or absence of symptoms. Interferon is given by injection, and may have a number of side effects including flu-like symptoms including headaches, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, 25 depression and thinning of hair. It may also interfere with the production of white blood cells and platelets by depressing the bone marrow. Periodic blood tests are required to monitor blood cells and platelets. Ribavirin can cause sudden, severe anemia, and birth defects so women should avoid pregnancy while taking it and for 6 months following treatment. The severity and type of side effects differ for each individual. Treatment of 30 children with HCV is not currently approved but is under investigation. While 50-60% of patients respond to treatment initially, lasting clearance of the virus occurs in only about 10-40% of patients. Treatment may be prolonged and given a second time to those who relapse after initial treatment. Re-treatment with bioengineered consensus interferon alone results in elimination of the virus in 58% of patients treated for one year. Side effects 3 of 274 WO 2013/044030 PCT/US2012/056576 occur but the medication is usually well tolerated. Combined therapy (interferon and ribavirin) shows elimination of the virus in 47% after 6 months of therapy. Side effects from both drugs may be prominent. A tumor is an unregulated, disorganized proliferation of cell growth. A tumor is malignant, or cancerous, if it has the properties of invasiveness and metastasis. Invasiveness refers to the tendency of a tumor to enter surrounding tissue, breaking through the basal laminas that define the boundaries of the tissues, thereby often entering the body's circulatory system. Metastasis refers to the tendency of a tumor to migrate to other areas of the body and establish areas of proliferation away from the site of initial appearance. Cancer is now the second leading cause of death in the United States. Over 8,000,000 persons in the United States have been diagnosed with cancer, with 1,208,000 new diagnoses expected in 1994. Over 500,000 people die annually from the disease in this country. Cancer is not fully understood on the molecular level. It is known that exposure of a cell to a carcinogen such as certain viruses, certain chemicals, or radiation, leads to DNA alteration that inactivates a \"suppressive\" gene or activates an \"oncogene.\" Suppressive genes are growth regulatory genes, which upon mutation, can no longer control cell growth. Oncogenes are initially normal genes (called prooncongenes) that by mutation or altered context of expression become transforming genes. The products of transforming genes cause inappropriate cell growth. More than twenty different normal cellular genes can become oncongenes by genetic alteration. Transformed cells differ from normal cells in many ways, including cell morphology, cell-to-cell interactions, membrane content, cytoskeletal structure, protein secretion, gene expression and mortality (transformed cells can grow indefinitely). AU of the various cell types of the body can be transformed into benign or malignant tumor cells. The most frequent tumor site is lung, followed by colorectal, breast, prostate, bladder, pancreas and then ovary. Other prevalent types of cancer include leukemia, central nervous system cancers, including brain cancer, melanoma, lymphoma, erythroleukemia, uterine cancer, and head and neck cancer. Cancer is now primarily treated with one or a combination of three means of therapies: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Surgery involves the bulk removal of diseased tissue. While surgery is sometimes effective in removing tumors located at certain sites, for example, in the breast, colon and skin, it cannot be used in the treatment WO 2013/044030 PCT/US2012/056576 of tumors located in other areas, such as the backbone, or in the treatment of disseminated neoplastic conditions such as leukemia. Chemotherapy involves the disruption of cell replication or cell metabolism. It is used most often in the treatment of leukemia, as well as breast, lung, and testicular cancer. There are five major classes of chemotherapeutic agents currently in use for the treatment of cancer: natural products and their derivatives; anthacyclines; alkylating agents; antiproliferatives (also called antimetabolites); and hormonal agents. Chemotherapeutic agents are often referred to as antineoplastic agents. The alkylating agents are believed to act by alkylating and cross-linking guanine and possibly other bases in DNA, arresting cell division. Typical alkylating agents include nitrogen mustards, ethyleneimine compounds, alkyl sulfates, cisplatin and various nitrosoureas. A disadvantage with these compounds is that they not only attack malignant cells, but also other cells which are naturally dividing, such as those of bone marrow, skin, gastrointestinal mucosa, and fetal tissue. Antimetabolites are typically reversible or irreversible enzyme inhibitors, or compounds that otherwise interfere with the replication, translation or transcription of nucleic acids. Several synthetic nucleosides have been identified that exhibit anticancer activity. A well known nucleoside derivative with strong anticancer activity is 5-fluorouracil. 5- Fluorouracil has been used clinically in the treatment of malignant tumors, including, for example, carcinomas, sarcomas, skin cancer, cancer of the digestive organs, and breast cancer. 5-Fluorouracil, however, causes serious adverse reactions such as nausea, alopecia, diarrhea, stomatitis, leukocytic thrombocytopenia, anorexia, pigmentation and edema. Derivatives of 5-fluorouracil with anti-cancer activity have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,336,381, and in Japanese patent publication Nos. 50-50383, 50-50384, 50- 64281,51-146482, and 53-84981. U.S. Pat. peroxidate oxidation product of inosine, adenosine or cytidine with methanol or ethanol has activity against lymphocytic leukemia. Cytosine arabinoside (also referred to as Cytarabin, araC, and Cytosar) is a nucleoside analog of deoxycytidine that was first synthesized in 1950 and introduced into clinical medicine in 1963. It is currently an important drug in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. It is also active against acute lymphocytic leukemia, and to a lesser WO 2013/044030 PCT/US2012/056576 extent, is useful in chronic myelocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The primary action of araC is inhibition of nuclear DNA synthesis. Handschumacher, R. and Cheng, Y., \"Purine and Pyrimidine Antimetabolites\" Cancer Medicine, Chapter XV-1, 3rd Edition, Edited by J. Holland, et al., Lea and Febigol, publishers. 5 5-Azacytidine is a cytidine analog that is primarily used in the treatment of acute myelocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. 2-Fluoroadenosine-5'-phosphate (Fludara, also referred to as FaraA) is one of the most active agents in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The compound acts by inhibiting DNA synthesis. Treatment of cells with F-araA is associated with the 10 accumulation of cells at the Gl/S phase boundary and in S phase; thus, it is a cell cycle S phase-specific drug. Incorporation of the active metabolite, F-araATP, retards DNA chain elongation. F-araA is inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, the key enzyme responsible for the formation of dATP. 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine is useful in the treatment of low grade B-cell neoplasms 15 such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins' lymphoma, and hairy-cell leukemia. In light of the fact that acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS-related complex, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus have reached epidemic levels worldwide, and have tragic effects on the infected patient, there remains a strong need to provide new 20 effective pharmaceutical agents to treat these diseases that have low toxicity to the host. Further, there is a need to provide new antiproliferative agents. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method and composition for the treatment of human patients or other host animals infected with HIV. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and composition 25 for the treatment of human patients infected with hepatitis B or C. It is a further object of the present invention to provide new antiproliferative agents. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a new process for the preparation of 2' -chloroacetylenyl-substituted nucleoside derivatives of the present 30 invention.

In another embodiment of the invention, the nucleoside derivative is in an enantiomeric mixture in which the desired enantiomer is at least 95%, 98% or 99% free of its enantiomer. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleoside derivatives are enantiomerically enriched. 117 of 274 WO 2013/044030 PCT/US2012/056576 In one embodiment of the present invention, the compounds of the formula (I) are in the -D configuration. In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, the compounds of formula (I) are in the -L configuration. The nucleoside derivatives depicted above are in the -D configuration, however, 5 it should be understood that the nucleoside derivatives can be either in the -L or -D configuration. The nucleoside derivatives of the present invention are biologically active molecules that are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of viral infections, and in particular human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or hepatitis B virus (HBV) 10 infection. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of abnormal cellular proliferation, including tumors and cancer. In another embodiment of the present invention, any of the active compounds are useful in the treatment of HCV. One can easily determine the spectrum of activity by evaluating the compound in the assays described herein or with another confirmatory assay. 15 For instance, in one embodiment the efficacy of the antiviral compound is measured according to the concentration of compound necessary to reduce the plaque number of the virus in vitro, according to methods set forth more particularly herein, by 50% (i.e. the compound's EC 50). In preferred embodiments the compound exhibits an EC 50 of less than 15 or preferably, less than 10 micromolar in vitro. 20 In another embodiment, for the treatment or prophylaxis of a viral infection, and in particular an HIV, HCV or HBV infection, in a host, the active compound or its derivative or salt can be administered in combination or alternation with another antiviral agent, such as an anti-HIV agent or anti-hepatitis agent, including those of the formula above. Alternatively, for the treatment of abnormal cellular proliferation, such as tumors 25 and cancer, in a host, the active compound or its derivative or salt can be administered in combination or alternation with another antiproliferative agent, such as an anti-neoplastic agent, including those of the formula above. In general, in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more agents are administered together, whereas during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each agent is administered serially. The dosages will 30 depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the drug as well as other factors known to those skilled in the art. It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens and schedules should be adjusted over time 118 of 274 WO 2013/044030 PCT/US2012/056576 according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. The compounds of the present invention can also be used to treat equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), feline immunodeficiency virus, and simian immunodeficiency 5 virus.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention formulated 20 together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. As used herein, the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient\" means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; 25 starches such as com starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, com oil and soybean oil; glycols such as propylene glycol; phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and 132 of 274 WO 2013/044030 PCT/US2012/056576 antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an 5 implanted reservoir, preferably by oral administration or administration by injection. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may contain any conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. In some cases, the pH of the formulation may be adjusted with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, bases or buffers to enhance the stability of the formulated compound or its delivery form. The term 10 parenteral as or infusion techniques. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the 15 active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, particular, groundnut, com, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, 20 tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous 25 suspensions, may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents.

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and 30 isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. 133 of 274 WO 2013/044030 PCT/US2012/056576 The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. 5 In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed 10 absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide- polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of 15 other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non- 20 irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at 25 least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or: a) fillers or starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium 30 carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium 134 of 274 WO 2013/044030 PCT/US2012/056576 lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art.

In general, treatment regimens according to the present invention comprise administration to a patient in need of such treatment from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of the compound(s) of this invention per day in single or multiple doses. The compounds of the invention described herein can, for example, be 5 administered by injection, intravenously, an ophthalmic preparation, or by inhalation, with a dosage ranging from about 0.1 to about 500 mg/kg of body weight, alternatively dosages between I mg and 1000 mg/dose, every 4 to 120 hours, or according to the requirements of the particular drug. The 10 methods herein contemplate administration of a therapeutically effective amount of compound or compound composition to achieve the desired or stated effect. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered from about I to about 6 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be 15 combined with pharmaceutically exipients or carriers to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Alternatively, such preparations may contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound. 20 Lower or higher doses than those recited above may be required. Specific dosage and treatment regimens for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity and course of the disease, condition or symptoms, the patient's disposition to the 25 disease, condition or symptoms, and the judgment of the treating physician. Upon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the 30 symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms. When the compositions of this invention comprise a combination of a compound of the invention described herein and one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agents, both the compound and the additional agent should be present at dosage levels of 137 of 274 WO 2013/044030 PCT/US2012/056576 between about I to 100%, and more preferably between about 5 to 95% of the dosage normally administered in a monotherapy regimen. The additional agents may be administered separately, as part of a multiple dose regimen, from the compounds of this invention. Alternatively, those agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together 5 with the compounds of this invention in a single composition. The said \"additional therapeutic or prophylactic agents\" includes but not limited to, immune therapies (eg. interferon), therapeutic vaccines, antifibrotic agents, anti\u00ad inflammatory agents such corticosteroids agents (eg ribavirin and amantidine).

HBV or HCV It has been recognized that drug-resistant variants of HIV, HBV and HCV can emerge after prolonged treatment with an antiviral agent. Drug resistance most typically occurs by mutation of a gene that encodes for a protein such as an enzyme used in viral 5 replication, and most typically in the case of HIV, reverse transcriptase, protease, or DNA polymerase, and in the case of HBV, DNA polymerase, or in the case of HCV, RNA polymerase, protease, or helicase. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the efficacy of a drug against HIV infection can be prolonged, augmented, or restored by administering the compound in combination or alternation with a second, and perhaps third, antiviral 10 compound that induces a different mutation from that caused by the principle drug. Alternatively, the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, or other parameter of the drug can be altered by such combination or alternation therapy. In general, combination therapy is typically preferred over alternation therapy because it induces multiple simultaneous stresses on the virus. 15 The second antiviral agent for the treatment of HIV, in one embodiment, can be a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (a \"RTI\"), which can be either a synthetic nucleoside (a \"NRTI\") or a non-nucleoside compound (a \"NNRTI\"). In an alternative embodiment, in the case of HIV, the second (or third) antiviral agent can be a protease inhibitor. In other embodiments, the second (or third) compound can be a pyrophosphate analog, or a fusion 20 binding inhibitor. A list compiling resistance data collected in vitro and in vivo for a number of antiviral compounds is found in Schinazi, et al, Mutations in retroviral genes associated with drug resistance, International Antiviral News, 1997. Preferred compounds for combination or alternation therapy for the treatment of HBV include 3TC, ribavirin. Preferred examples of antiviral agents that can be used in combination or alternation with the compounds disclosed herein for HIV therapy include cis-2- 30 vicriviroc, aplaviroc and maraviroc. 10 A more comprehensive list of compounds that can be administered in combination or alternation with any of the disclosed nucleosides Merck). The active compound can also be administered in combination or alternation with ribavarin, interferon, interleukin or a stabilized prodrug of any of them. More broadly described, the compound can be administered in combination or alternation with any of the anti-HCV drugs listed below.
