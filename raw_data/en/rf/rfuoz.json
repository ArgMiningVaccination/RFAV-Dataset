When you achieve mental, emotional and physical harmony the body is primed for health. When one area is out of balance (from mental, physical or emotional stress) this upsets the rest of the body and symptoms show up in other areas. Homeopathy is used by over 500 million people worldwide [to treat both acute and chronic conditions](https://homeopathy.md/about-homeopathy/homeopathy-works-acute-chronic-diseases/).
