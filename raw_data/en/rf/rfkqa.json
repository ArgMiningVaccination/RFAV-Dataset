About Reiki Practitioner Ashley Kay Zeller In addition to teaching yoga, Ashley teaches Pilates Reformer and is a Reiki Master. She is a certified yoga instructor (E-RYT\u00ae 200) with over 20 years of teaching experience. She formerly managed two wellness studios and was the Wellness School Manager at the JCC of Indianapolis for four years. Her personal testimony of using the healing arts to ease anxiety, depression, and physical pain brings raw authenticity to her teaching style. Whether teaching Power Vinyasa or Restorative Yoga, Ashley's classes always have a basis of healing, freedom, and play. Ashley's students are often reminded to truly be still. She encourages students not to pass judgment on any challenges within or around the body; it is essential to accept contrast by asking what can be learned. Participants are encouraged to set their own pace and listen to their own bodies. All levels are welcome in every yoga class. Ashley's first formal training was with the founder of All People Yoga Center and creator of Heartland Yoga Therapy, Nancy Schalk, in 2005. She spent the next seven years mentoring and training with Master Yoga Teacher, Linda Marques, and Grand Master Yoga Teacher, Jean Pierre Marques, at Coronado Yoga and Wellness Center in Coronado, California. She later studied Reiki with Christine Eartheart in Bloomington, Indiana. Ashley also studied PHI Pilates with Susan Holewinski in Indianapolis, IN, and with Christine Romani-Ruby in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Ashley not only offers services onsite but can provide a yoga class, workshop, or Reiki session at your workplace, home, retreat, or event. Fitness Is a Core Jewish Value At the JCC, fitness isn't just something we do; it's who we are. Although exercise is not mentioned in the Torah, taking care of one's health is. In fact, while other belief systems advocate for the healing power of prayer, Judaism encourages people to look after their health and seek counsel from medical experts. In Judaism, good health is not a goal in itself. Rather, it is a means to an end - to serve the Creator. "}
