What remains unchanged, however, is an unswerving commitment to providing a quality education experience for every student. This calls us to do \"what must be done\" while striving to keep the DePaul University community healthy and safe. The information in this employee guide provides strategies to take care of ourselves and each other. In following these measures, we will Take Care DePaul. In accordance with the guidance from our state and local governments, DePaul will adhere to the principles of public health and hygiene measures, physical distancing and reduced density of staff, faculty and students on campus during the summer quarter. Please note that DePaul guidelines may change over time in accordance with guidance from health and governmental officials. DePaul's direction and practices are developed in close partnership with medical experts at our partner AMITA Health Medical Group. For the most up-to-date information, visit DePaul's COVID-19 Updates and Guidance website at go.depaul.edu/covid. PLANNING PRINCIPLES Promoting the health and safety of the university community and of the communities where we study, work and live; Ensuring that DePaul's diverse community of learners has access to our nationally ranked academic programs and support services that will enable them to thrive; Supporting and maximizing student academic and personal success; Strengthening our university both now and for the future.TAKE CARE OF D EPAUL, TOGETHER: AN EMPLOYEE COVID-19 SAFETY GUIDE FOR SUMMER 2021 TAKE CARE OF D EPAUL, TOGETHER: An Employee Guide for Summer 2021 | July 2021 | 3EMPLOYEE SAFETY The university will continue to take precautions aimed at protecting the health and safety of employees who work on campus. DePaul may adjust its guidelines over time in accordance with guidance from health and governmental health authorities. At this time, DePaul's precautions include: 1) the recommended use of face masks while on university grounds, 2) the implementation of tactics for physical distancing, 3) the wide availability of hand sanitizer for hands as well as for disinfecting personal spaces, 4) the use of plexiglass shields on service desks, and 5) a mandatory online training required to be completed by all faculty, staff and students. EMPLOYEE TRAINING Employees must complete a mandatory COVID-19 online training . This 20-minute online training is required even if you have already been on campus or do not currently plan to return to campus. Contact training @depaul.edu with any questions or issues. FACE MASKS Fully vaccinated individuals who are on campus will be highly encouraged\u2014though not required\u2014to wear a face mask indoors. Individuals who have not been vaccinated are expected to wear a mask at all times. Units/departments and individuals within the university should not create separate requirements. Individuals may respectfully ask others to wear a mask, for example when they are in a crowded setting or close proximity. Since the start of the pandemic, DePaul has become a mask-friendly campus\u2014and we will continue to be a mask-friendly campus out of concern and care for our fellow students and colleagues. The DePaul community is expected to support all individuals' choices, including vaccinated individuals who may choose not to wear a mask (although it's strongly encouraged). Disposable masks will remain available in all building lobbies at the Loop Campus and in select locations throughout the Lincoln Park Campus. Face masks continue to be required on public transportation. The Chicago Transit Authority and Metra have established new protocols to welcome back riders safely. Please visit their websites to learn more. HEALTH MONITORING To prevent the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the potential risk of exposure to our DePaul community and visitors, we ask students and employees who come to campus to conduct a daily self-screening process using the #CampusClear app , which includes a questionnaire and a medical symptoms check. The DePaul community is no longer required to show a completed #CampusClear survey prior to entering a DePaul facility. However, to continue to Take Care DePaul, it is highly recommended that you complete the quick survey. That way you can take a moment to reflect on how you're feeling. If you're showing symptoms, stay home to avoid putting others at risk of getting sick. You can find information to download #CampusClear on DePaul's Health Monitoring webpage , or download it directly from the Apple Store or on Google Play . You will be asked to authenticate with your @depaul.edu email address. HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDANCE TAKE CARE OF D EPAUL, TOGETHER: An Employee Guide for Summer 2021 | July 2021 | 4REPORTING A CASE OF COVID-19 All faculty, staff and students (including student employees) must inform the university if they have tested positive for COVID-19, received a COVID-19 diagnosis, suspect they were exposed to COVID-19 or if they learn of a positive case of COVID-19 at DePaul. This will allow the university to provide the resources and support people need, and also determine if others were exposed and may be at risk. Report your COVID case or the case of another person at DePaul here. COVID-19 TESTING A variety of COVID-19 testing locations and options are available throughout Chicago and Illinois. Visit the COVID-19 testing options site here for more information. If you: Have symptoms: Get tested right away. Make an appointment in advance, stay at least 6 feet from others and wear a face mask. Don't have symptoms and are NOT vaccinated: Get tested five to nine days after your last known contact with the infected person or since your last high-risk activity, such as attending a large gathering. Chicago-area Residents Visit the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) website for information about testing locations. Check the CDPH website prior to visiting a location for the most up-to-date information. If you need assistance locating a testing location, please email DePaulCommunityHealth @depaul.edu . Illinois Residents Visit the Illinois Department of Public Health website for COVID-19 testing locations. Out-of-state Residents Check your local and state public health departments' websites for more information. Mail-in kit Option DePaul offers a mail-in COVID-19 test kit for faculty, staff and students who need testing. The program is meant for those community members who have symptoms or known exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 AND are having difficulty getting to an in-person testing site. COVID-19 Testing On Campus On-campus COVID testing will be paused for the summer. Plans for fall are being finalized. CONTACT TRACING Contact tracing is a process that local health departments use to control and prevent the spread of diseases, like COVID-19. By identifying and isolating cases, and quarantining close contacts (as defined by the Chicago Department of Public Health) , the spread of COVID-19 may be averted. To help monitor health and safety on campus and to assist our students, faculty and staff, DePaul has formed a contact tracing team. To learn more about contact tracing and DePaul's process, visit the online FAQs . COVID-19 VACCINE In the spirit of caring for each other and for our surrounding community, DePaul strongly encourages all faculty and staff to be vaccinated for COVID-19. The vaccines are safe, and our best hope for ending the pandemic. Please visit the COVID-19 Vaccine webpage and follow Newsline for the latest information and access to resources. DePaul's Hybrid Work Guide provides guidelines and policies related to DePaul's plans to welcome more employees back to campus throughout the summer. The following public health measures also are being implemented. AIR QUALITY As has been the case throughout the pandemic, all air handlers capable of accommodating MERV-13 filters were upgraded to such. In addition, the percentage of outside air drawn into buildings has been increased, and the start and stop times for all building fans has been extended to ensure that any particles not trapped in filter media are diluted with fresh air to the extent possible. These measures were taken in DePaul-owned buildings, including residence halls, and in 55 E. Jackson Blvd. Some buildings on the Lincoln Park Campus do not have centralized air handlers. Offices and classrooms in O'Connell Hall, Steans Center, and 2343 and 2347 Racine will be provided HEPA air purifiers prior to the larger campus reopening on July 19. Corcoran and McCabe halls will be supplied with HEPA air purifiers in communal lounges. All rooms also have operable windows to facilitate fresh air intake. The Sheffield Square and Courtside apartment buildings do not have centralized air handlers. There are, however, no communal lounges in these buildings to address. Residents of these buildings have both operable windows and window air conditioners to supply fresh air and ventilation within their own apartments. Residents of Corcoran and McCabe halls, Sheffield Square, and the Courtside apartments may bring and utilize their own personal air purifiers within their rooms if they wish.RETURNING TO THE WORKPLACETAKE CARE OF D EPAUL, TOGETHER: An Employee Guide for Summer 2021 | July 2021 | 5GENERAL OFFICE CLEANING All DePaul offices and cubicle areas will be cleaned during the week of July 12 in preparation for the larger return to campus during the week of July 19. This also includes rented spaces in 55 E. Jackson Blvd. Effective July 19, office and cubicle cleaning will resume following the same weekly schedule, and to the same specifications, that was in place prior to the pandemic. Additionally, Facility Operations will no longer require (or accept) e-mail requests for office or cubicle cleaning. Those wishing to clean or disinfect their working surfaces more frequently are encouraged to do so. Departments may order disinfecting wipes from Staples or Amazon. For everyone's safety, please do not order or use any bleach-based cleaning products. COMMON AREA CLEANING Common area cleaning has already reverted to pre-pandemic levels. Common touch points such as elevator buttons and door handles are disinfected on a nightly basis in compliance with CDC guidelines. CLASSROOM AND LAB CLEANING Classrooms and laboratory spaces used for official summer session courses will be cleaned prior to each instructional session just as they have been throughout the pandemic. Sanitizer stands in computer labs will continue to be stocked with paper towels to enable users to disinfect peripheral devices prior to use. SPECIAL EVENT SPACE CLEANING Departmental meeting rooms and other special use spaces will be cleaned nightly as they were pre-pandemic. These spaces will not be sanitized between events throughout the day. COVID-RESPONSE CLEANING Facility Operations has procedures, equipment and necessary supplies readily available to disinfect spaces if a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case scenario is reported. FURNITURE MOVING Throughout the summer, Facility Operations will restore all classroom and common area furniture that its personnel moved as part of social distancing back to its pre-pandemic state. Classrooms used for summer I and summer II courses will be reset back to pre-pandemic conditions following the conclusion of all in-person teaching sessions. All common area furniture moved by individual departments or areas, within their respective suites, will remain as it is. Each area will decide when and how best to reset these items. Outdoor tables and seating at the Lincoln Park Campus will be reinstalled to their pre-pandemic locations as time permits throughout the summer. HAND SANITIZER The 700+ hand sanitizer stands that were deployed at the onset of the pandemic will remain in place and will be stocked with sanitizer through at least the end of winter quarter. As the CDC is no longer specifying disinfection of common high-touch areas multiple times per day, Facility Operations will phase-out stocking paper towels in the sanitizer stands, with the exception that paper towels will continue to be provided in computer labs to facilitate disinfection of peripheral devices. Hand sanitizer gels are now readily available and departments may procure individual-sized bottles for placement on employee desks through Staples and Amazon. Because hand sanitizer is readily available, Facility Operations will not be taking requests for placement of additional hand sanitizer stands on campus. WATER FOUNTAINS/BOTTLE FILLERS Water fountains will be reactivated as soon as the CDC guidance allows for such. In the meantime, faculty and staff are encouraged to bring a reusable water bottle to utilize the many bottle refill stations on campus. RESTROOMS Restrooms will be spot cleaned and stocked throughout the day, as needed, and to pre-pandemic standards. All restrooms will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected during regular nighttime cleaning service. ELEVATORS AND STAIRWELLS All DePaul elevators were equipped with UVC technology to disinfect the air entering the elevator cabs. There are no COVID-related capacity limits in elevator cabs as this time. Most academic buildings have open stairwells available for those who prefer not to use an elevator to reach their destination. The southeast stairwell of the DePaul Center will remain open for general circulation to all DePaul floors, with the exception of the tenth floor library, for security reasons. SIGNAGE Much of the general signage related to mask wearing and social distancing will be removed over the summer. New signage, reflecting the latest guidance, will be placed in high-traffic areas in due time. Signs pertaining to proper handwashing will remain posted near restroom and break room sinks. TAKE CARE OF D EPAUL, TOGETHER: An Employee Guide for Summer 2021 | July 2021 | 6PLEXIGLASS SHIELDS Plexiglass shields were installed in all areas originally designated by area vice presidents and deans. They will remain in place indefinitely, unless removal is requested. Work orders may be placed to remove unwanted shields from departmental desks. Requests will be fulfilled by Facility Operations as time permits. Note: as each installation was custom-made, and given the lack of storage space, removed shields will be discarded. Facility Operations will not custom make shields for additional desks or areas at this time. Ready-made products are widely available online and may be ordered to fill a specific departmental need. DEPARTMENTAL OFFICE AREA KITCHEN RECOMMENDATIONS The applicability of the following recommendations varies depending on if (and how frequently) office kitchen appliances were utilized during the COVID-19 closure period. Any equipment not utilized for at least several weeks should be thoroughly flushed prior to resumption of normal use. Facility Operations has prepared these recommendations as a courtesy; it does not service or repair kitchen appliances. Kitchen sinks: Run both the hot and cold water taps for at least three minutes each to flush out the lines and to circulate water through any small point-of-use hot water heaters that might be servicing the sink. Dishwashers: Run at least one cycle, using the proper soap, and without any dishes in the machine to both clean the machine internally and to remove any stagnant water that might be in the supply line and in the drainage system. All refrigerators: Unused refrigerators were cleaned out and unplugged during the initial campus closure period. They will remain unplugged until departments resume normal occupancy of their spaces. Refrigerators should be plugged in by departmental staff and allowed up to twenty-four hours to reach the proper temperature prior to use for food storage. Refrigerators with ice/water functions: Dispense several large cups of water through the old filter to remove any sediment in the water line. Then replace the water filter in the refrigerator (if applicable) and continue to flush the water line as per the instructions that came with the replacement water filter. Finally, make and discard at least two batches of ice. Coffee machines plumbed with a water line: Place a service call with the company supplying the machine. Have the coffee service technician properly flush the machine's internal reservoir and change any filters, which may be in-line with the water supply. Standalone coffee machines: Any coffee machine with an internal water reservoir should be cleaned and flushed as per the instructions provided in the owner's manual. Instructions for cleaning Keurig machines, in particular, are also available online. Bottle-less water coolers plumbed with a water line: Place a service call with the company supplying the machine. Have the service technician properly flush the machine's internal reservoir and change any filters, which may be in-line with the water supply. Bottle-type water coolers: Flush out and discard all water in the current water bottle, install a new water bottle, and then draw several additional cups of water to fully flush the inside of the machine with new water. If water bottles were stored for a prolonged period near a window, the ultraviolet light could impact the water quality and it is recommended to request replacement bottles from the water supply vendor. UNIVERSITY VEHICLE RECOMMENDATIONS University vehicles that were not used during the pandemic, will require professional servicing. Facility Operations will not jump-start or otherwise repair any such vehicles. Responsible departments are required to have any such vehicles towed to a qualified automotive repair shop for servicing and a safety inspection prior to returning them to the road. Responsible departments should also ensure that license plate stickers, emissions testing, City of Chicago vehicle stickers and insurance cards are updated as needed prior to use. CONSIDERATIONS FOR FACULTY Academic departments will have minimal in-person staffing during the summer terms. The few faculty who are teaching in-person will come to campus to teach their course(s) but may conduct other work remotely. Faculty who are teaching online may continue to work remotely. Student Absences Students who are ill should notify their professors that they are unable to attend class. They should work directly with professors regarding options for academic accommodations or flexibility related to the absence. TAKE CARE OF D EPAUL, TOGETHER: An Employee Guide for Summer 2021 | July 2021 | 7PERSONAL TRAVEL The university follows CDC guidance, as well as guidance issued by federal, state and local government officials regarding travel. Please be sure to check appropriate guidance, including the City of Chicago's travel order , the CDC's travel guidance and the CDC's international travel requirements before planning travel. Guidance and requirements are subject to change. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION Per federal and state mandates, all employees and riders are required to wear a face mask over their nose and mouth at all times while traveling on CTA and Metra . Furthermore, CTA and Metra implemented a variety of efforts to ensure a safe environment for riders and employees, including: Air on CTA buses and trains is filtered and exchanged about every minute, and doors are frequently opened to bring in fresh air into the cabin. As for Metra, they use hospital-grade MERV-3 filters and are currently installing high-tech air filtration and purification systems . Ridership Dashboards are available for CTA and Metra services to help riders determine the least congested times to travel by date and time. Buses, trains and stations are cleaned multiple times each day. TELEHEALTH Employees who receive health benefits from DePaul may access telehealth services, or virtual visits, as outlined in the health plan design, meaning that the normal deductibles, copays and coinsurance will apply. PPO and CDHP members may access telehealth services offered by their healthcare provider for non-urgent medical care, or they can access care through MDLive. MDLive is primarily for those who would not use their own regular provider for telehealth services, or whose providers do not offer it. MDLive is essentially a pool of registered doctors who provide non-urgent medical and behavioral health services. PPO and CDHP members are encouraged to register with MDLive in advance of needing this service to enable a smoother process when care is needed. HMO-IL members interested in virtual visits may do so for medically necessary services from providers in their medical group who offer telehealth, subject to HMO rules, such as using your Primary Care Physician for a referral. Contact your Primary Care Physician for more information and to coordinate your medical care services.MENTAL HEALTH All employees have access to wellness and educational resources through DePaul's employee assistance program, offered by ComPsych\u00ae GuidanceResources\u00ae (the organization web ID to log-in is EAP4DPU). Confidential counseling sessions are also available for employees, spouses and dependents (up to six free sessions per employee/spouse/dependent, per \"incident\"). To speak with a counselor or schedule an appointment, employees may call (800) 621-4124 anytime. Specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, ComPsych\u00ae GuidanceResources\u00ae has developed a Coronavirus Digital Toolkit to offer resources and guidance on how to remain healthy and deal with the emotional impacts of the pandemic. CAREGIVING RESOURCES Benefits-eligible full-time and part-time faculty and staff have access to back-up care services for children or adults through Bright Horizons Care Advantage Program . The service includes center-based and in-home care for children and adults. The usual copays that apply to back-up care services provided by Bright Horizons are being waived for the remainder of 2021. Benefits-eligible employees receive up to 15 days of back-up care per calendar year. The back-up care benefit now can be used to reserve an experienced tutor to help 5- to 18-year-old children with homework or dedicated support in a specific subject. Each back-up care use can be exchanged for up to 4 hours of virtual tutoring.
