In this introductory lesson, we'll demystify the hard facts about minerals, and explore their use as an energetic pairing with herbals. Meet your teacher Annie is a mineral nerd and an herbal student. She can be found outside foraging for mushrooms and crystals, making art, or working at the herb shop. She grew up in the woods camping and looking for crystals, and can't wait to share the wonder of it with you.
