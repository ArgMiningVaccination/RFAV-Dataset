This systems toolkit is designed to help professionals working in health care settings such as emergency departments, hospitals, clinics, private offices, or school based health centers develop a protocol to respond to potential victims of human trafficking who present to their facility. The toolkit presents an ambitious, comprehensive approach to protocol development, portions of which may be adopted for particular contexts based on capacity. The document is based on existing guidelines and recommendations from experts in this field. The toolkit serves to mobilize an interdisciplinary response to human trafficking that respects patient autonomy. While ultimately we hope that the implementation of anti-trafficking protocols at the local level will enable the identification of victims of labor and sex trafficking so that they may be brought to safety, the goal of protocol implementation in health care settings is not to foster disclosure by trafficked persons. Rather, we aim to guide health care facilities through the process of creating safe procedures and spaces where professionals can provide exploited adults and minors not only the health services they need, but also education about their options and empowerment to seek assistance.
