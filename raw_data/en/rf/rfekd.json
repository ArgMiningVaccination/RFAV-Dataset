Never stop prioritizing this work and remain accountable to its fruition The Role of the Parent /Guardian Spring Garden Waldorf School is a community where cooperation and collaboration between parents /guardians , teachers, and staff create a supportive educational environment. Our community embraces active parent /guardian involvement, openness, economic and social di versity, consensus, and teamwork. Our families, teachers, and staff share the responsibilities and rewards of participating in our school community. Parents and guardians play essential roles as advocates for their children and as partners in enriching our community with their ideas, interests, talents, resources, and concerns. As part of the enrollment contract, parents /guardians complete mandatory Service Contract hours. This commitment to the school builds community and offsets operating costs. Parents /Guardians make an especially significant contribution to the school in the area of enrollment by inviting friends to events at t he school. Simply talking about the school and how Waldorf education works for their children will bring other interested families into contact with the Waldorf community. Parents /Guardians contribute to the health of the school by supporting school polic ies and procedures. This allows families to experience the warmth of a community , working together with shared values and a common interest in its students ' education. In recognition of being part of the larger community, paren ts/guardians agree to abide b y the Parent /Guardian's Pledge . SPRING GARDEN WALDORF SCHOOL PARENTS AND GUARDIAN'S PLEDGE: There are many diverse personalities, qualities, and experiences that make the Spring Garden Waldorf School community unique. By respecting and embracing these seeming differences , we can unite our hearts with those seeking the same goal of educating our students in a compassionate environment. As a member of the Spring Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 6 Garden community, I pledge the followin g: I will ADHERE to the policies outlined in the Parent /Guardian Handbook . I will stay informed about community life at Spring Garden Waldorf School by reading school communications . I will ATTEND class meetings and teacher conferences to ensure that my child's class has an informed, active, and supportive parent /guardian body that understands the curriculum and its foundations. I will PARTICIPATE in fundraising. I recognize that tuition alone does not meet the school's budgeted expenses and will strive to participate in fundraising with heartfelt gifts to the best of my ability. I will DIRECT any question, concern, or complaint to the appropriate person or group according to the Communication Section in the Parent /Guardian Handbook. I will RE SPECT others in the Spring Garden community and strive to hold each member in the best light. I will value and tolerate others' differences and recognize that each member of the community brings unique talents and insights to all situations. I will ENCOUR AGE volunteerism through my actions and words. As a member of the community, I am called to serve and will do so to the best of my abilities. I am ever mindful that Spring Garden could not exist without volunteers who are similarly giving of themselves for the goal of educating our children. Therefore, I will treat every other volunteer with respect and appreciation. I will COMMUNICATE openly and honestly. Because Waldorf Schools do not have a hierarchal institutional structure, I recognize that it is the quality of our interpersonal relationships that sustains and nourishes the school. By connecting with another person and perhaps overcoming a difficult situation, I strengthen the Spring Garden community as well as myself. Therefore, I will speak and behav e toward others as I would have them speak or behave toward me. My written correspondence will be respectfully worded and signed. I will be vigilant against gossip and guard against its destructive nature. I will work toward understanding, clarity, resolut ion, and if necessary, healing. Most importantly, I will SET an EXAMPLE for our children. As an adult, I serve as a role model at all times. So charged with that responsibility, I will engage in speech and behavior that are worthy for our children to imitate. Part I: About Spring Garden Waldorf School The History of Spring Garden Waldorf School Spring Garden Waldorf School is an independent, self -administered school linked to other Waldorf schools by a shared philosophy. The faculty teaches in an age -appropriate manner, as indicated by Rudolf Steiner's philosophy of meeting each student where he or she is developmentally. The Waldorf school movement was founded by Rudolf Steiner (1861 -1925), based on his study of Anthroposophy, the study of mankind. Steiner was an Austrian scientist, philosopher, artist, and educator who founded the first Waldor f school in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1919. Steiner created a curriculum that provided a comprehensive academic, artistic, cultural, and practical education that encouraged students to develop into creative, balanced, responsible, and free -thinking individual s. His ideas included educating the whole child - Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 7 addressing cognitive, social, and creative development together - and meeting the needs of each child through a challenging and multi -sensory environment. Spring Garden opened in 1981 in a private home wit h an initial enrollment of 17 students divided into three multi -age classes from kindergarten through third grade. The emphasis centered on a balanced, multi - sensory education that integrated spiritual ideals with academics. In September of 1982, the scho ol moved into the education wing of the Margaret Park Presbyterian Church on Russell Avenue in Akron. In 1985, Spring Garden became a member of the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA). Fundraising, recruitment, and community outreach e fforts were enormously successful, and enrollment increased to the point where the school eventually outgrew the church facility. In August of 1990, Spring Garden moved to a beautiful rural setting southeast of Akron, in an extensively remodeled former pub lic elementary school. Highlights of our years there included our first Children's Festival and Annual Benefit Auction, and professional development in Waldorf education for our teachers. In the fall of 1994, the Spring Garden community had the opportunit y to purchase its own school building, where we are currently located, on twelve acres in Copley, Ohio. After countless hours spent by the Spring Garden community cleaning and preparing the building, the school opened its doors. We are proud of our school, which offers us permanent roots and room to grow and prosper in the Waldorf tradition. Spring Garden currently serves students from preschool through Grade Eight with an integrat ed curriculum of world languages , choral and instrumental music, art and han dwork, wood working, movemen t, gardening, and extra lesson. Our current student body represents a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, gender identities, and family structure. We are seeing a growth in ethnic diversity as we strive to be a place wher e all feel welcome and can see themselves reflected in the educational experience. How Spring Garden Waldorf School Is Organized Governance in a Waldorf school is not concerned with exercising authority, but with addressing the real question of how the children and the spirit of the school are best served. The organizational structure of Spring Garden consistently strives to uphold Rudolf Steiner's principle of the threefold social order, in which the sphere of rights, the sphere of economics, and th e sphere of spirit each operate independently of one another while still supporting the work of the others. The need for these separate yet interconnected spheres at Spring Garden has led to an organizational structure in which each constituent group withi n the school holds representation in each sphere of the threefold order. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 8 The school is made up of three major working groups: the facult y, the Board, and parents /guardians . The administration coordinates the flow of information and resources between th ese three bodies. The functions of the school are divided among these groups with intentional overlap in certain areas so that the activities of the school can be carried out effectively with collaboration between groups, where it is appropriate. The form of leadership in Waldorf schools is republican, which means that smaller groups are empowered, through mandate, to carry out tasks determined by the larger bodies of the school. These smaller groups, including committees, work within current policies or br ing recommendations to the larger bodies of the school. Working committees are structured with representation from the Faculty, the Board, and Parents /Guardians to ensure representative collaboration between the bodies of the school. School Personnel and Working Groups Administration The administration carries out the day -to-day business of the school. It is responsible for ensuring organizational integrity while carrying out agreed -up policies. It is the connective tissue between the bodies of the schoo l, helping to hold the parts together and keep everything in place. The Director of Administration (DA) is the leader of the school's administrative functions. The DA has two broad areas of responsibility: communication and administration. As the communication hub for the school, the DA serves as the point person for, and ensures the flow of communication between, all of the school's constituent groups, including the f aculty, administrative staff, Board members, parents /guardians , and the broader community. The Pedagogical Director (PD ) is a leadership position that supports a culture of collaboration and communication among constituencies of the school. The PD is ac countable for ensuring an exemplary Waldorf student experience and carries a combination of teaching and administrative responsibilities. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 9 The Finance Director handles questions or concerns about tuition assistance, tuition payments, the Miscellaneous Char ges Account, buy -out of Contract Service Hours, or billing for uncompleted Contract Service Hours. The Finance Director can also answer questions related to the school's financial and operational matters. The Director of Admissions and Marketing (DAM) is the initial point of contact for all families exploring Spring Garden for their children. The DAM is also responsible for developing and implementing a school marketing plan. The Director of Development (DoD) is responsible for planning, develop ing strategies, goal setting, coordination and evaluation of all key Development efforts and serves as the school's chief fundraiser. The Facilities Manager is responsible for managing people and processes that will ensure the proper maintenance of the building and grounds. The Administrative Assistant provides administrative support to the faculty and administrative staff and is responsible for maintaining school directories, student records, and all other records pertaining to the operation of the school. The Administrative Assistant also maintains the school calendar and sets appointments for the DA. The Assistant to the Director of Admissions and Marketing assists the DAM with admissions and enrollment for all families and assists the DAM in implementing a school marketing plan. Faculty The faculty are staff members directly involved in the education of the students. They represent the thread of continuity within the school, assuring that all practices within the school are rooted in the ant hroposophical basis of Waldorf education. The faculty includes all classroom teachers in the grades, all subject teachers, all Early Childhood teachers and assistant teachers, and all members of the Educational Support Team. In addition to their classroom work, faculty engage in administrative and pedagogical leadership at the school. Each member of the faculty participates in one of the following sections: governance, personnel, community, curriculum, and leadership of Early Childhood and the Grades. Educational Support Team (EST) The EST is made up of the Academic T utor, Extra Lesson Teacher, Speech Pathologist, and Education Services Coordinator. This team works in collaboration with teachers, parents /guardians , and outside service providers to dev elop and implement accommodations to support the academic success of all students. Accommodations may include modifications within the classroom, strategies and techniques implemented by the classroom teacher, and interventions by EST members. Parent /Guard ian permission is needed before any child can work with the EST, and the EST and the student's teacher will monitor the student's progress and the effectiveness of the accommodations and communicate this to the student's parents /guardians . The EST reports to the Administrative Faculty. Administrative Faculty The Administrative Faculty is comprised of a group of faculty members , the DA and the PD , who together are responsible for making pedagogical and curricular decisions on behalf of the College of Teachers, based on an understanding of Waldorf education. College of Teachers The College of Teachers includes the entire faculty. Through regular meetings, the College of Teachers deepens individuals' understanding of Waldorf education specifically as it pertains to Spring Garden. This group is also responsible for providing input on the school's policies and curriculum through interaction with the Administrative Faculty. Parent /Guardian Council Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 10 The Parent /Guardian Council is a supportive body of the school that promotes community enrichment and communication. It also acts as a constructive link between the Board of Trustees, the faculty, and the parent /guardian body at large. All parents of enrolled students are members of Parent Council and each cla ss is represented by one or more parents. Parent /Guardian Council is led by a leadership team of three members, one of whom serves as a member of the Board of Trustees. Board of Trustees The Board of Trustees is the publicly recognized body of the school, responsible for the school's overall financial and legal health. Its membership consists o f three members of the faculty; a representative of Parent /Guardian Council; and up to thirt een members elected at -large. The DA and the PD are ex officio mem bers of the Board. The Board of Trustees meets monthly; twice yearly these meetings are held as Joint Board -Faculty Meetings to support the school's mission and purposes. Curriculum The Waldorf curriculum provides a comprehensive academic, artistic, cultural, and practical education that encourages students to develop into creative, balanced, responsible, and free -thinking individuals. The curriculum stimulates the mind with a full spectrum of traditional academic subjects. It nurtures healt hy emotional development through conveying information experientially as well as academically. It teaches the hands to be valued members of the student's being through a broad range of artistic and handwork activities. Rudolf Steiner's educational philosop hy enhances traditional learning with a sense of connection to cultural, moral, and spiritual values. This philosophy emphasizes respect, wonder, and reverence for human existence and the natural world. The Early Childhood C omponent Creative Play Time: The children are encouraged to imagine and play both indoors and outside daily with a wide variety of open -ended toys and natural materials, following their own initiative. During this period, the teacher is involved in preparing the snack, sewing a doll, or any number of activities that the children are welcome to help with or just experience. An atmosphere of work permeates the entire room. Being able to follow a train of thought or carry a task to completion is extremely important to later school ing. For example, this is a skill set necessary to solve a complicated math problem or write a report. Circle Time: The class is brought together to sing songs and recite verses together with the teacher. These may be connected to the seasons, a particu lar fairy tale or story, or just part of the general lore of childhood. Repeating and remembering verses sets the stage for the more intense memory work that will be required in the grades. Artistic Activity: These activities may include woodworking, wet -on-wet watercolor painting, beeswax modeling, beeswax crayon work, and some form of handwork, are done as a group activity, although each child is individually absorbed in their own work. Only the highest quality materials are used. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 11 These activities encourage the child's natural sense of beauty and color and lay the groundwork for artistic techniques which will be needed later. Attention to detail, focused work habits, and fine motor skills are developed through these artistic activities. Snack Time Snack time is a group activity. The children eat a nutritious snack that they may help prepare during play time. This is a time of coming together as a classroom community to enjoy a snack and polite conversation with our manner. We take a m oment to share our gratitude for the food before us and the children help with preparing the space for snacks and cleaning up when the snack is over. Sharing meal time in a respectful, grateful manner is an integral part of life. This is a time dedicated to developing appropriate social skills, group cooperation, and personal responsibility for the good of all. Outdoor Play Similar to indoor creative play time, the children are taken outdoors to experience the natural world in all its different seasons. You will find a Waldorf early childhood class outside in all but the most formidable weather. A child who has had an experience out of doors all school year develops a respect, resiliency, sense of responsibility, and appreciation for nature. This allows them to enter very deeply and comfortably into later studies of plants and animals, weather, geology, and astronomy. Story Time At the end of the morning, the children are gathered to hear their teacher tell a special nature story or fairy tale that is f illed with wonder and imagination. The length and intricate details in the stories continue to evolve during the school year with opportunities for the students to participate in the recall of the story by acting out the stories they have been listening t o as way to develop listening and memory skills. The ability to listen to an adult for a sustained period of time is a skill that is gradually developed. The telling of a story, as opposed to reading it, fosters the person -to-person relationship between t he teacher and his or her children, as well as providing an opportunity for the children to experience rich language in a very pure and beautiful form. In addition to the daily activities described above, there is an ongoing celebration of the seasons wit hin the early childhood classes. For example, Children may gather a harvest in the fall, build a seasonal garden on the nature table as winter draws near, plant grass seeds, or skip around a Maypole in the spring. The joy of the human experience is deepl y felt by the young child and is reflected in the classroom. The emphasis in a Waldorf early childhood class is on the skills and experiences mentioned above as well as many others. The ability of a child to learn in the grade school will be enhanced by the foundation and strengths gained in this type of early childhood setting. Building Foundational Skills Personal Responsibility and Self -Help Skills Children hone self -help skills such as tying shoes, putting on and taking off outdoor gear independently, cleaning up after play, food preparation, setting the table, cleaning up after a meal, dish washing and more. Each day, we allow the time needed for the children to practice these essential skills that teach them to care for themselves, for others and the environment of the classroom. Environmental Stewardship Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 12 Daily access to time outdoors allows the children to develop a relationship with and reverence for nature. The child ren will help care for the raised bed garden including watering, pulling weeds and harvesting vegetables to be used in the classroom. They will notice and be encouraged to think kindly towards the spiders, insects, and plants recognizing each play a role in the healthy workings of the garden. The children will help to fill our bird feeders and watch in awe as the birds flit to and fro chirping thank yous for the fine meal. Nature walks allow us to observe how nature changes through the seasons. As the p oet Mary Oliver spoke so eloquently: \"Teach the children. We don 't matter so much, but the children do ... Stand them in the stream, head them upstream, rejoice as they learn to love this green space they live in, its sticks and leaves and then the silent, beautiful blossoms. Attention is the beginning of devotion.\" Gross and Fine Motor Skills Movement is integral in the healthy development of the young child. Gross motor skills are incorporated into circle time as the children jump, spin, crouch, roll, and move their bodies to the verses they are reciting. These skills are also given time to develop through natural, child -created outdoor play including tree c limbing, digging, teeter tottering, creating natural obstacle courses and more. All of these activities help develop the child's sense of their body and how it works while building physical stamina. Balance, proprioception, and the ability to develop an understanding of how to care for the well -being of their body through experience are core basics in the Waldorf early childhood program Fine motor skills are developed through artistic activities such as finger knitting, painting, coloring, cutting vegetab les, tying shoes, and more. These activities develop the muscles in the hands and eyes and provide a foundation for reading and writing in first grade. Self -Regulation and Social Skills The children will have an opportunity to practice self -regulating the ir emotions and behavior as they interact with their peers and teachers daily. Social skills are learned through modeling as the teacher helps the young children find their words and then offers quiet support as necessary when children are navigating a co nversation that might be challenging. Whether the child is waiting their turn to climb the tree, planning what to play with their peers, sharing toys, navigating working with a partner, etc., the day is filled with lessons that will develop their social emotional intelligence supported by the teacher's modeling and emphasis on respect for all. Academic Skills All of the experiences in our early childhood program set a solid foundation for academic learning in first grade. The students learn the ability t o sit and listen to stories while creating, in their minds, a picture of the story being told. The development of self -regulation skills and language comprehension allows the children to be very receptive to new concepts. Early math skills are experienced through concepts such as cooking, sharing, gathering, and counting in songs and stories. These conceptual experiences allow an interest and understanding to develop that is built upon in the grade school. Curriculum in Grades One through Eight Students \"in the grades\" at Spring Garden begin their day outside on the playground. At 8:30, a bell rings and students line up with their classes to come inside and begin their day. Once inside, students take off their outdoor clothing and greet their tea cher at the classroom door with a handshake. This is a good way for the teacher to gauge how the student's day is beginning, and it teaches students how to shake the hand of an adult and make eye contact when greeting someone. When the students enter the classroom, they take care of their personal belongings and join their teacher and classmates in a verse to begin the day. Because studies have demonstrated that children learn best when their Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 13 whole bodies are engaged, students generally begin their day wit h speech, music, or gross motor skills combined mental academic work - for example, students in Grade Three might jump rope while working with multiplication tables, while students in Grade Seven might engage in intricate ball passing and catching games. In Grades One through Five, Main Lesson follows these initial opening activities. In the Main Lesson, academic concepts are taught in \"blocks,\" where a particular theme (for example, math or language arts) is studied for a number of weeks. The goal is for students to engage with the material, not to pass tests or earn grades. Main Lesson lasts for approximately two hours. After Main Lesson, students in grades one through five have a short break to eat a snack (supplied from home) and to go outside and \"brea the out\" for a few minutes. When students come back inside they are energized, refreshed, and ready to start their next lesson. The remainder of the day is made up of subject classes that support the curriculum of the Main Lesson. These subjects are not op tional; they are an integral part of the broader Waldorf curriculum. In Grades Six through Eight, the students open with their class teacher or as a group of upper grades students. Following the opening, the upper grades students have two subject classes , followed by a short break for snack and recess. After snack recess, upper grades students have Main Lesson, which is taught in two hour blocks as in the lower grades. After Main Lesson, upper grades students have lunch followed by additional subject clas ses. Subject periods include topics that reinforce concepts covered in Main Lesson, such as math, grammar, and reading as well as art, music, orchestra, Spanish, handwork, woodworking, gardening, and physical education. Additional information about our su bject classes is detailed below. World Languages - Spanish is taught in Grades One through Eight. In the early grades, language is taught through immersion in stories, songs, rhymes, and movement. As students progress through the grades, they develop skil ls in grammar, reading, translation, and conversation. Music - Students begin choral instruction in Grade One, and chorus is a part of students' weekly schedule through Grade Eight. In Grade Three, all students learn to play the violin. As they progress t hrough the grades, students are given the opportunity to change to a different stringed instrument or to a woodwind. Students perform both choral and symphonic pieces at assemblies, Winter and Spring Programs, and graduation, as well as a number of other s pecial occasions. Physical Education - In the lower grades, students engage in games and activities that provide the enjoyment of physical activity in a non -competitive environment. Competitive play begins in Grade Five, where physical education and Main Lesson studies merge and students prepare for and compete in a traditional Greek Pentathlon. Similar integrative experiences may be afforded to students during the Grade Six Medieval Games and the Grade Seven Renaissance Faire. Gardening - Gardening begins with nature studies in the early grades then progresses to the study of soils and plants. In Grade Three students plan and plant their own small garden plot as part of their Main Lesson work, and students continue to study gardening in our greenhouse and gardens through Grade Eight. Handwork - Through knitting, crocheting, cross -stitching, felting, and sewing, all students learn the enjoyment of making practical and beautiful objects with their own hands. Handwork supports literacy in t he early grades, as knitting develops left -to-right eye -tracking; mathematics are supported by handwork throughout the grades, from the simple counting of stitches in the early grades to understanding geometry by creating a 12 -sided ball in the upper grade s. Woodworking - Taught in Grades Five through Eight, the Woodworking program allows students to form relationships with a material, with their environment, and with their classmates. Woodworking can be used to increase students' threshold of frustration and hone their power to push against limitations, expanding the students' capabilities to change the physical world and perhaps help them to carve a place for themselves in it. Art - Painting, drawing, and modeling deepen students' experience of the curriculum and awaken possibilities for self -awareness and self -expression. Drama is a key part of our curriculum, as students starting in Grade One prepare and present a dramatic performance each year, building up to a full production of a Shakespeare pla y in Grade Eight. The Spring Garden curriculum is carefully planned to maintain a balanced schedule that is in harmony with the needs of growing students, and it is essential that all students participate in all of each day's activities. Full participatio n allows each child's innate capacities and strengths to shine through during the school day and affords children the opportunity to feel a high degree of self -esteem and self -confidence while teaching them how to recognize and collaborate with the strengt hs of their classmates. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 14 Assessment, Testing, and Promotion Criteria Student Assessment The Waldorf approach to student assessment is based on the student's performance in a variety of domains. It looks at the development of the human personality as w ell as the acquisition of academic tools; it aims not only to measure skills and accomplishments but also to create a whole picture of the student. Waldorf teachers strive to know each student very well, and they are trained to observe children carefully and with a warm interest. This relationship begins in the initial interview, where the teacher and parents /guardians can share the family and life circumstances of the student. In the classroom, the Class Teacher greets and shakes the hand of each student to observe his or her demeanor at both the start and end of the day, and determined observations take place throughout the day. To create a more nuanced portrait of each student, the Class Teacher seeks input from his or her colleagues regarding different perspectives, while continued input from parents /guardians reveals other facets of each child. Teachers use this input to think in a meditative, reflective way about each student and his or her particular needs. To quantify and communicate the teachers' observations, a written student assessment is presented to parents /guardians during the mandatory parent /guardian -teacher conferences in the fall and spring. This in -depth report contains far more detail than the traditional report cards used in many schools. Main Lesson teachers create a narrative profile of each student's capacities, including strengths and weaknesses. Subject teachers also complete written assessments with comments regarding the child's progress. Testing and Grades Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 15 While stud ents are assessed in a variety of ways at Spring Garden, traditional written testing and grades are used with much less frequency than in other educational settings. In the early grades, students are generally encouraged to work to the best of their own ab ility rather than to an external standard of performance. In the middle and upper grades, however, students begin to have a more concrete understanding of their teachers' expectations, which are assessed with graded tests and quizzes. Standardized Testing Each spring, students in Grades Three through Eight are given the IOWA Test of Basic Skills, a professionally scored standardized test. Students in Grade s Three and Four take only a few sections of the test, untimed . As students pass through the grades, additional sections are added until students in Grades Seven and Eight are taking the full test while timed. This gradual introduction of high -stakes testing can lessen the anxiety that standardized testing can sometimes breed. Waldorf students tend to pe rform well on standardized tests, both in the Waldorf setting and after they have moved into mainstream education where standardized tests play a key role in student and school evaluation. Waldorf students perform well not because they have been drilled on test-taking but because their schooling has nurtured their capacity to assess and respond to new situations with clear, creative thinking. Results from the IOWA tests reveal yet another facet of the whole child and help teachers with the overall assessme nts of the skills of each student and of the class as a whole. Test results are shared with parents /guardians during the spring parent -teacher conference. Parents /Guardians are strongly discouraged from sharing these test results with their children. Addi tionally , students in Grades Three through Eight receiving the EdChoice scholarship through the Ohio Department of Education must participate in all required state achievement tests. Promotion and Retention Promotion or retention of students at Spring Garden will be based upon a certain level of competency in all subject areas: language arts, social studies, mathematics, and science. Academic competency levels will be determined and supported by documentation, including but not limited to participation with achievement in the classroom, standardized testing, and pupil performance objectives. Social and emotional competencies also play a role in promotion and retention. Observations by the student's teacher, subject teachers, academic tutor, speech ther apist, or extra lesson teacher may be used in reviewing a student's competency. The school reserves the right to place a student on probation at any time due to social, behavioral, or academic performance concerns. When this occurs, there will be a meeting with the parents /guardians and a document noting the conditions of the probation. First Grade Readiness The Waldorf curriculum uses chronological age to determine a child's grade level. Children entering kindergarten must be five years old by June 1. Children entering Grade One must be six years old by June 1, and must undergo a First Grade Readiness Assessm ent to determine whether or not they are ready for academic learning and to respond to the authority of teachers. The First Grade Readiness Assessment is not a test. It is conducted as a playful game, which children find enjoyable. This assessment helps to develop a whole picture of the child in relationship to his or her own development, and it helps identify early signs of physical challenges that might stand in the way of learning. The teachers will look for right -left laterality, mid -line crossing, ha nd-eye coordination, verbal and visual memory, and other indicators of readiness for Grade One. A First Grade Admissions Team, which includes the kindergarten teachers, the Extra Lesson teacher, the Director of Admissions, and an experienced grades teacher , meet in the spring to make a decision about promotion to first grade for all students currently enrolled in kindergarten. The decision about promotion to Grade One is communicated to parents /guardians in the May Parent /Guardian - Teacher Conferences. Home work One of the purposes of homework is to develop the discipline of carving out a time outside of school in which the student works at something requiring an act of his or her will. Doing work at home is a habit that can be Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 16 developed when students enter school and will create capacities to help students become lifelong learners. A general guideline for the amount of time that should be spent doing homework is ten minutes per grade each weekday. In the early grades, this homework time can be spent in a va riety of ways that would be initiated by parents /guardians or by the students themselves, since traditional homework assignments are not usually given until about Grade Three. Some suggestions are reading to your child or having your child retell the Main Lesson story or another story they heard at school that day. Another possibility might be to have them spend time doing \"homework,\" whatever they interpret that to be. In the middle and upper grades, some of the students' homework time will be spent on t raditional assignments such as spelling, math, reading, writing, memorization, and research. Other types of homework might be making observations, conducting informal interviews, creating artwork, studying Spanish, or creating handwork projects. Students i n the middle and upper grades all play musical instruments, and regular practice should be part of their homework as well. The parent /guardian's role in homework should be limited to finding a time and place for their child to complete his or her homework and being available to answer occasional questions. If the student appears to need more direction than just occasional answers to questions, please discuss this concern with the Class Teacher. Instrument Guidelines Our instrument guidelines support students in developing basic skills in violin as a group with opportunities for students to move to other instruments in later grades if their skills have progressed sufficiently. For those students wishing to play a different instrument, it is imp ortant that they first demonstrate their ability with the violin during class, including reading music, before making any changes. It is important to note that students are permitted to switch instruments only once during their time at SGWS - once they hav e changed to another instrument they may change back to violin but not to a third instrument. Instrument Rental and Outside lessons: In third grade students will be slowly introduced to the violin and school instruments are available for use. Beginning in the fourth grade, students will be expected to practice at home in addition to work in class and will require their own instrument both at home and at school. Families are required to provide, and keep in good working order, their child's instrument. S ome possible rental opportunities are listed below. It is not recommended that students have outside instrument lessons before the fifth grade. Students who are interested in changing to another instrument are required to have outside lessons before pla ying their instrument in class, and to continue these lessons for the following years. It is the responsibility of the family who chooses another instrument to arrange for and continue these outside lessons. Instrument Options by Grade Third Grade - When the class is ready to use instruments, the school will provide a violin for each student. Students are not permitted to bring their own instruments into school during the third grade year. Fourth Grade - All fourth graders play violin, no one may switch to another instrument during this year. Beginning in this school year students will need to rent or purchase their own violins, as the school violins will be used by the third graders. Fifth Grade - The music teacher may invite some students who demonstrate aptitude in violin, exemplary behavior, and fluency in reading music to switch to cello. These changes are initiated solely at the discretion of the teacher, please do not request these changes in the fifth grade year. Viola or bass are not used in fifth grade, as they require fluency in different musical clefs. Sixth Grade - Students may audition to demonstrate proficiency before changing to viola, cello, bass, flute or clarinet. See \"auditioning for a new instrument\" below for further information. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 17 Seventh Grade - Students may audition to demonstrate proficiency before changing to viola, cello, bass, flute or clarinet. See \"auditioning for a new instrument\" below for further information. Eighth Grade - Students may audi tion to demonstrate proficiency before changing to viola, cello, bass, flute, or clarinet. See \"auditioning for a new instrument\" below for further information. Auditioning for a new instrument: In order to change to a new instrument, a student must initiate the following process: 1. The student must continue to play violin in class while the new instrument is being learned. They should have a discussion with the strings teacher to inquire whether the instrumen t in which they are interested would be permitted in the current arrangement. As the balance of instruments in a class or combined orchestra is important, the teacher may decide not to permit the switch at this time. 2. If the teacher has expressed openness t o adding the new instrument to the orchestra, the student's family is responsible for renting the instrument. Suggested rental facilities are listed below. 3. The student must take at least 6 private lessons with an instructor on the new instrument. The lesso ns should be at least 30 minutes long, once per week. This may depend on the availability of the instructor. 4. The student must provide the strings teacher with electronic or hard copy documentation of the six lessons, including a signature of the instructor and the parents /guardians . 5. Once documentation of the six lessons has been presented, the student must set up a time to audition their new instrument for the strings teacher. This audition will include both a prepared piece as well as a sight - reading exerc ise. The audition time may be at lunch, recess, or another time convenient for all parties involved. This is the most important part of the process, and at this point it will be determined if the student may begin to use their new instrument with the rest of the class. It is important to note that SGWS does not provide direct instruction in instruments other than violin. Students wishing to play other instruments are required to maintain private lessons outside of school in order to allow their skills to m atch the level of material presented to the classes. Students whose skill levels in a new instrument do not meet the expectations of the class may be required to change back to violin in order to allow individual instruction. Remedial and Intervention Services Support Services The educational Support Team (EST) is a group of SGWS educators and intervention specialists consisting of: Education Services Coordinator Speech Language Pathologist Academic Tutor Extra Lesson Teacher This team meets periodically with each Main Lesson teacher to review individual stude nt progress and works in collaboration with teachers, parents/guardians, and outside service providers to develop and implement accommodations to support the educational success of students. The EST reports to the Administrative Faculty. Members of the EST perform the following tasks : 1. Review new student application documents and attend related meetings. 2. Conduct classroom observations and screenings; share findings with Main Less teachers. 3. Develop and impleme nt service plans and intervention plans. 4. Review and maintain the EST records , including confidential documents such as reports from outside service providers. 5. Record and maintain a log from meetings with Main Lesson teachers. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 18 6. Mainta in a spreadsheet of student progress as a shared document for teachers to reference and Admini strative Faculty to review. 7. Reference data from the spreadsheet and information from teacher checklists to create and maintain educational support plans. 8. When possible, attend parent /guardian /teacher conferences of students receiving services or upon request by teachers. 9. Interface with Copley -Fairlawn City Schools as needed. 10. Administer 1st Grade Readiness and 2nd Grade assessments. 11. Proctor normed -based skills tests, such as the IOWA and the Ohio Achievement. 12. Develop and implement annual EST goals. Educational Services Coordinator The Educational Services Coordinator (ESC) manages the activities of the EST and serves as a resource to parent s/guardians and faculty. This includes development and communication of student educational support plans. The ESC also serves as the EST liaison to the Administrative Faculty and Copley -Fairlawn Pupil Services. When students demonstrate educational concerns, Copley -Fairlawn City Schools provide SGWS with research -based interventions to determine if a disability is suspected. The ESC coordinates standardized testing for SGWS and administers academic scree nings to stud ents. Speech and Language Servi ces The Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) informally screens all students entering 1st Grade as well as all students new to SGWS at any grade level. Screenin g is also provided for Early Childhood and the grades based on teacher recommendations. Students who may benefit from speech intervention in the areas of articulation, voice , and fluency are identified by the SLP based on developmental norms and/or evidence -based best practice. The SLP provides school -base d trial interventions. Parents/gua rdians agree to, or waive, the intervention plan before servi ces begin . Students with language disorders are identified through Copley -Fairlawn City Schools . If a student qualifies to receive speech and language services, a Service Plan is developed and implemented. Four times over the course of the year, a written progress report is provided to the parents/guardians and Main Lesson teacher. The SLP works with students individually or in small groups. Tutoring Services The Academic Tutor (AT) administers an academic assessment to all students in the spring of 2nd Grade. In the autumn, the AT administers individual reading fluency screening to all 3rd Grade students to determine if tutoring services would be recommended. After 3rd Grade , Main Lesson teachers may recommend that students receive tutoring services to help strengthen skills in the areas of reading foundation, reading comprehension, written expression, and math. Observations by the AT in the classroom may also lead to recommendations for periodic screenings of individual students. If services are recommended, the AT works with Main Lesson teacher to develop a tutoring plan. This plan is formally communicated by the AT to parents /guardians who agree to, or waive, these services before sessions begin. Twice over the course of the year, in conjunction with student eval uations, the AT provides reports, desc ribing progress made towards the established goal. Extra Lesson Each week, the Extra Lesson Teacher (ELT) conducts developmental movement classes for students in kindergarten and 1st and 2nd Grades. These activities provide the opportunity for long -term observation by the ELT to identify students who may require additional services in later grades. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 19 After 2nd Grade, students requiring remedial develop mental movement services, individually or in small groups, are identified by the ELT with input from the Main Lesson teacher. Observations by the ELT or the Main Lesson teacher, apart from the formal assessments, can also lead to identificati on for services. If services are recommended, the ELT works with the Main Lesson teacher to develop an Extra Lesson plan . This plan is formally communicated by the ELT to parents /guardians who agree to, or waive , these services before sessions begin. Twice over the course of the year, in conjunction with student eval uations, the ELT provides reports, describing progress made towards the established goal. In the winter, the ELT administers developmental movem ent and memory assessments for each 2nd Grade student. In the spring, the ELT participates in First Grade Readiness Assessments (FGRA) and formally summarizes FGRA observations for teachers and parents/guardians. The ELT administers developmental movement assessments for new students entering the grades as part of the enrollment process. Festivals and Celebrations Festivals and programs at Spring Garden celebrate the living rhythms of the year, taken up in each class in different ways, and help provide a common foundation for students and the Spring Garden community to mark time and expe rience traditions through the year. Our festivals provide imaginations of archetypal truths about human nature, life, and experience, and we strive to bring a global nature to our celebrations. Dates for all festivals can be located on the yearly school c alendar. However, please remember that all dates are subject to change, and you should watch the Tuesday Note and Weekly Announcements to stay apprised of any changes to our schedule. Please note that all Health and Safety guidelines will be followed dur ing festivals, celebrations, and student performances . SGWS leadership may decide to cancel or change details of these offerings to mitigate risk due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Rose Ceremony - This all -school assembly welcomes students into Grade One. During the ceremony, the new Grade One students \"cross over\" a bridge from their parents /guardians to join their class, where they are met at the other end of the bridge by a student in Grade Eight with a rose as a symbol of welcome. This Grade Eight student will be the Grade One student's \"buddy\" throughout the school year and will assist the Grade One student during activities such as lunch, Michaelmas kite -flying, and ice skating. Michaelmas -Each September, near the autumn equinox, the sch ool celebrates Michaelmas. Archangel Michael is celebrated for inspiring strength and courage. In his battle against an evil dragon, Archangel Michael represents the unconquered hero fighting against the powers of darkness. It is a time of year when we face the quickly darkening days leading up to winter and nurture our inner light to face the cold months ahead. In the weeks preceding the festival, students in all classes hear stories and sing songs about the brave knight who overcame the dragon with hi s sword of light, and these stories are also represented through students' artwork. Much preparation leads to an event celebrating this arch -type of courage and overcoming fear and evil. Children's Festival - This is a highly anticipated annual event, op en to the public, where children and their families come together to enjoy puppetry, make -and-take crafts, live entertainment, an artisan's market with vendors from around Akron, and delicious food from the Spring Garden Cafe. Spiral of Light - This rev erent, candle -lit ceremony takes place during the school day. Students enter a dark room, laid with fresh pine boughs in a spiral pathway. At the center a large, lit candle is placed on a table. Accompanied by soft singing and the ringing of bells, each st udent walks slowly and thoughtfully to the center of the spiral, lights their candle, then walks back outward, placing their lit candle somewhere along the spiral path. With each student, the light grows brighter, illuminating the room and reminding us of the eternal light that is within each of us and within all of mankind. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 20 May Day Festival - During the first week of May, the fullness of spring and the impending arrival of summer are celebrated with flowers, music, dancing, and singing. This festival is celebrated during the school day and involves a celebration of spring, acts of service and a garden blessing. Graduation Ceremony - Each graduating class works together to develop its own unique graduation ceremony. Held the evening preceding the last da y of school, this is an important event for the graduating Grade Eight students, who are given a special send -off by the entire community. This emotional, heartfelt evening includes the Grade One students giving their Grade Eight Buddies a rose, bringing t he year to full circle, and the passing of the torch to the Grade Seven students who will enter Grade Eight the next year. Birthdays - Student birthdays are very special occasions in Waldorf classrooms. Each child's birthday celebration is carefully coo rdinated by the Class Teacher. Please contact your child's teacher for more information about how birthdays are celebrated in his or her classroom and to schedule a day to celebrate your child's birthday with the class. Assemblies - Assemblies are held periodically throughout the school year. See the school calendar for assembly dates. Assemblies are an opportunity for the students in Grades Two through Eight to share some of the songs or activities they have been working on as a class. Parents/Guardians are welcome and encouraged to attend, as these assemblies offer insight into the depth of the experiences children receive through Waldorf Education. Student Performances Class Plays - Drama is part of Waldorf education from Grade One, and children in all grades prepare for and perform a play each year. Students in the early grades perform in their classrooms, generally for parents /guardians only. In later grades, student productions are staged in the gym and are open to ever -wider audiences. Finally, in Grade Eight, students perform a full production of a Shakespeare play as the culmination of their drama experience at Spring Garden. Musical Programs - Each year, two seasonal evenin g programs are presented in which students in Grades Three through Eight perform both choral and orchestral pieces they have been learning. Programs are wonderful opportunities for parents /guardians , families, and friends to see how music is woven int o the Spring Garden curriculum. Part II: Communication At Spring Garden Waldorf School we cherish human connection. There are many diverse personalities, qualities, and experiences that make our community unique. We value and model direct, personal interactions which respect and embrace this diversity. We set time aside for real -time conversations. We grow from the wealth of other people's ideas and perspectives. When we are in agreement, there is space for great creative potential. It is especially important to use direct conversation when we experience conflict or disagreement with another person. Sharing perspectives may seem difficult in these instances. It is in these difficult conversations where we can see a larger picture, develop deeper conn ections, and restore trust. By communicating honestly and listening with empathy, we can address our particular concerns while contributing to the overall health of our community. This is a powerful practice which allows us to unite ourselves with those seeking the same goal of educating our students in a compassionate environment. Communicating With Spring Garden Waldorf School Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 21 If you have questions or concerns, we encourage you to speak with the appropriate person as soon as possible so they can be answered or resolved quickly. Curricular, pedagogical, or classroom concerns should be addressed directly to your child's teacher. Should you feel that you have not received appropriate resolution to your question or c oncern from the teacher, you should make an appointment to meet with the DA. Concerns about financial matters , including tuition payments, tuition assistance, or MCA account charges, should be addressed to the Finance Director. Please note that the Board -directed Tuition Assistance Committee, not the Finance Director, is responsible for decisions concerning Tuition Assistance. Also, it is essential that you read and follow the school's Tuition Assistance Policy, including application deadlines, to be cons idered for tuition assistance. Questions about Contract Service Hours can be addressed to the Finance Director. Work Days and other specific volunteer opportunities are announced as they are scheduled, and there are many opportunities for Service Hours d uring the school year (driving for and chaperoning field trips, working in the School Store, and tending the garden, to name a few). If you are unsure how to fulfill your Service Hours, please ask your child's teacher or your classroom Parent /Guardian Coun cil Representative to help find the best way to put your talents to use in service of the school. Questions about admissions or enrollment , including questions about paperwork and the application and admissions process in general, should be directed to t he DAM. Ethical or legal concerns - Should parents /guardians have an ethical or legal concern with respect to school activities, they should set an appointment to meet with the DA. Following the meeting, the DA will determine whether the matter can be resolved using current policy or if the Board of Trustees should be involved. The DA will follow up with parents /guardians when the matter is resolved. General comments or suggestions - We are always interested in receiving constructive feedback about the school and its operations . Our administration and faculty have an o pen-door policy , and you are welcome to approach them at any time with general comments or suggestions. Additionally, we solicit anonymous feedback each year via our P arent /Guardian Survey . Guidelines to address performance concerns - Situations arise at times when parents /guardians or colleagues may have concerns regarding the performance of a faculty or staff member. In those cases , we strive to work with direct warmth to address the situation and come to a resolution that meets the c oncerns. However, at times concerns directly addressed may not be resolved, and there may be need for further action by the school as an organization. Toward that end, we have developed the following guidelines for addressing concerns as they arise. Facul ty and staff, including the Director of Administration and Personnel Committee members, will direct concerns along this process when brought to their attention. During this process, all parties are welcome to bring an advocate . 1) Direct Communication - The best way to work through a concern is directly between the people involved. The person with the concern will bring it to the faculty or staff member in question at an appropriate time and place, making clear their concern and their desire to f ind resolution. 2) Report to the DA - When the concern has been discussed directly and continues to exist, or when the person bringing the concern does not feel it has been addressed, the concern will be brought to the Director of Administration (DA) for discussion and next steps of action. Based on the discussion and the concerns, the DA will work with the people involved to resolve the concern. The DA will review t he concern with the faculty member. Other possible steps include involving the mentor and setting up a meeting to include a neutral party. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 22 3) Formal Complaint - If the concern has been directly addressed following the previous two steps and resolut ion are still not found, the concern will be brought to the Director of Administration or a member of the Personnel Committee. This person will ask directly if this is being brought as a formal complaint and if steps one and two have occurred. Wh en this is the case, they will find out in as much detail as possible what has occurred. The person bringing the complaint will be asked to describe, in writing, what events have led to their complaint. At this point in time the person bringing t he formal complaint will be informed that they will no longer be involved in the situation, nor will they be informed of what action the school will take as this will now become a confidential internal personnel matter. The faculty or administrati on member will be made aware that a complaint about them has been submitted. The faculty/administration member will have the opportunity to know the nature of the complaint and be given the opportunity to respond in writing. The information regarding the concern will be brought to the Personnel Committee as a whole. This group will evaluate the concern as well as any other connected incidents to identify patterns and implications for future action. Concerns regarding Administrative staff will be directed to the President of the Board of Trustees. When a faculty member is involved the Personnel Com mittee will determine future actions to be taken, including but not limited to watching the situation for further developments, direct conversation with the faculty member involved, bringing the matter to the Administrative Faculty for further dis cussion, or recommending actions to be taken to the Administrative Faculty. Documents, including the written formal complaint, will be kept by the Director of Administration in a Personnel Committee file for future reference. Conflict with a n on-staff member of the Spring Garden Community - The first step in resolving conflict with a non-staff member of the Spring Garden community is to attempt direct resolution by talking to the person involved. Third -party dispute resolution is reserved for g rievances directly related to school operations, students, or curriculum and is not used for personal disagreements between community members. A Grievance Form may be submitted to the Administrative Faculty through the DA. The grievance will be evaluated b y the Administrative Faculty, without prejudice, and a response will be given within two Administrative Faculty meetings (typically three weeks) after receipt of the grievance. When an impasse is so severe that the parent /guardian involved cannot remain a s a constructive member of the community, consideration should be given as to whether another school would be a better match for the family. Continued conflict caused by a member of the Spring Garden community may be cause for the family to be asked to lea ve the school. Communication from Spring Garden Waldorf School We communicate with parents /guardians in a number of ways. It is essential that you read all correspondence from the school promptly , so you stay informed about school events. Emergency Communications : The school uses OneCallNow, an automated dialing system, to alert parents /guardians of school closures d ue to inclement weather or other emergency situations, including early closures (which are rare b ut do occur). Please make sure the office has up -to-date contact information so our system can reach you. We make every attempt to inform you of school closure s by 6:30 a.m. Please note that, in the event of a closing, all school events and activities for the day are canceled as well. In addition to OneCallNow, school closings will also be listed on the following local television and radio stations: WKYC Chan nel 3 WEWS Channel 5 Fox 8 WNIR -100 FM Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 23 Community Directory : Each year we publish a directory with contact information for all our families. This is provided for your personal use only. This information is not intended to be used for business purposes and should not be given in whole or part to any other person, school, or organization without express written permission from Spring Garden Waldorf School. Email : The Tuesday Note is a brief newsletter published weekly throughout the school year and as needed during the summer. It contains essential information about classroom activities, Waldorf education, and upcoming events. www.sgws.org : Our website contains not only a wealt h of information about our school but also a blog with information on Waldorf education, alumni accomplishments, parenting, and child development. The Parent /Guardian Directory and many of our standard forms can be downloaded from our website. We also have a strong social media presence on Facebook and Twitter. Parent /Guardian Meetings : Attendance at Class Meetings and parent /guardian -teacher conferences is mandatory because these meetings are the most efficient way for teachers to communicate directly with parents /guardians . Please see \"Meetings\" in Daily Procedures and Policies (page 28) for more information. Parent /Guardian Handbook : All parents receive a copy of the Parent /Guardian Handbook, which describes the school's philosophy, policie s, and procedures. The Parent /Guardian Handbook can also be downloaded from our website or the Tuesday Note in PDF format. Part III: Admissions Admissions Policy - Spring Garden Waldorf School strongly believes that a Waldorf education should be available to all children. The school seeks students who can contribute to and benefit from its Waldorf curriculum. Spring Garden Waldorf School accepts enrollment applications for all students throughout the year. Students are selected for admission to t he school on the basis of academic potential, developmental maturity, school achievement, and readiness for the school's program. In all cases, the school retains the right to determine, in its sole discretion, whether or not to select a student for admiss ion or to re -enroll a student. For early childhood students, the early childhood faculty and the EST (Educational Support Team, consisting of the Academic Tutor, Extra Lesson Teacher, and the Speech Pathologist) are responsible for making the decision rega rding probationary acceptance . For grades students, the main lesson teacher, along with subject teachers and the EST, are responsible for making the decision regarding probationary acceptance . Typically those decisions are based upon multiple criteria: academic readiness or qualification maturity size and composition of the current class affiliation with the school appropriateness of the match between the family and the school When the school cannot offer a place to a child, we may of fer counsel on other schools that may be able to accommodate the student. When there are more qualified candidates than openings available, the school will continue to accept enrollment applications and place those names on a waiting list. If an opening becomes available, students from the waiting list will be interviewed following the criteria below: A current student who should be moved to a higher or lower class (rare occurrence) A student of a teacher or staff member at the school A student with a si bling already at the school A legacy student (child) of a former Waldorf student or relative of a current parent /guardian A student transferring from another Waldorf school Overall profile of the class and the match between the needs and qualifications of the student with the needs of the school. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 24 Spring Garden Waldorf School recruits and admits students and personnel of any racial identification, ancestry, nationality, native language, socioeconomic background, family structure, age, religious beliefs and/or belief system, gender, sexual identity, appearance, occupation, and political affiliation, or any other protected class or group, to all the rights and privileges of all of our programs and activities. In addition, the school will not discriminate on the basis of any racial identification, ance stry, nationality, native language, socioeconomic background, family structure, age, belief system, gender, sexual identity, appearance, occupation, and political affiliation or any other protected class or group in the administration of our educational po licies, scholarships, loans fee waivers, educational programs, and athletic or extracurricular activities. All are encouraged to apply. Admissions Procedure (each step will follow completion of the previous) : Application - An application and authorizat ion to release records is submitted to the Director of Admissions and Marketing (DAM) along with the application fee. The DAM requests records from the current school. Records Review - When records are received, a file will be placed in the office for review. A review sheet will be placed in the mailbox of each faculty member (lead teacher and subject teachers) involved in the admissions decision as well as each EST member. These review sheets will provide an opportunity for feedback based on the records. All feedback must be returned to Admissions within 48 business hours. School Visit/Interview Grades 1 -8 Applicants : The DAM will schedule a two day visit for grades students and a private meeting for the parents /guardians and teacher. The DAM will inform the faculty of the student's visit dates. The DAM will also notify the applicable faculty to update the review sheets in the student's file, provid ing an opportunity for written feedback during the visit. The EST may set up an observation and/or evaluation of the student during this visit time. Following the visit, an admissions decision will be made based on the feedback from faculty and EST . The DAM will communicate the admissions decision to the family within two business days of the student's visit. The DAM will schedule a First Grade Readiness Assessment for incoming first grade students not currently enrolled in our kindergarten. Early Ch ildhood Applicants : Parent/Guardians of Early Childhood applicants will participate in a scheduled interview as part of the admission process. Within two business days of the Early Childhood interview, the class teachers will communicate an admission decision to the DAM who will in turn communicate it to the family. Toilet Training Polic y for Early Childhood Children: Children attending both the three - and five-day preschool/kindergarten program at SGWS must be toilet trained before attendance to the program commences. A fully toilet trained child can: Recognize his/her need to use the toilet without being prompted by an adult Tell the teacher of his/her need to use the toilet in time to prevent an accident Also attempt to use the toilet when asked by the teacher Maintain independence while disrobing, aiming, wiping, flushing, washing hands, and redressing Wake up dry from a nap Rarely, if ever, have accidents* *An 'accident ' can be defined as the soiling of clothing by urination or defecation. If an accident does happen, a toilet -trained child can report to his/her teacher the need to change clothes and can complete this task without adult assistance. If the accident involves a bowel movement, parents /guardians will be called to clean/change their child at school or pick up their child. If accidents begin to happen regularly, enrollment may be affected. f Admissions Policy Approved by Administrative Faculty 5/2019 Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 25 Part IV: Financial Obligations Tuition Before a student can attend class, a financial contract for tuition must be completed, signed, and returned to the school. There are three tuition payment options available: Annual Tuition - Payment in full is due on August 15 of the current school year. Semester Payments - One half of the tuition is due by August 15; the other half is due by the first day school resumes after Holiday Break in January of the current school year. Twelve Monthly Payments -File a completed Form 8 for Automatic Bank Draft Withdrawal and pay monthly installments starting on July 16 and ending on June 16 of the current school year. Payment s must be made by automatic bank draft only. Once a contract has been signed, tuition payments for the full year are required whether or not the student starts or completes the academic year. Please note that students will be withdrawn from school if any payments due are not paid in full within two months of the due date. All financial terms for current tuition and fees are set forth in the School -Parent/Guardian Contract. If you have questions about contracts or billing, please contact the Finance Director. Continued enrollment is subject to yearly review by the Board of Trustees and the faculty, with consideration given to the following: 1) All previous financial obligations were met on time. 2) All recommendations and requirements for the stude nt were met. 3) The family has acted in a supportive and cooperative manner with Spring Garden Waldorf School policies and procedures. Any request to change your family's contractual obligation during the school year should be directed to the Finance Director. EdChoice Ohio Spring Garden Waldorf School participates in the EdChoice Ohio program. For more details, visit www.education.ohio.gov. Tuition Assistance Policy Spring Garden Waldorf School (SGWS) is committed to providing tuition assistance t o qualified families, based on its ability to do so. Assistance in the form of tuition reduction is provided on the basis of need, which is determined by comparing the income and resources of applicants against their assets and liabilities. It is our expectation that parents /guardians applying for tuition assistance will first thoroughly assess their financial status and will t urn to other sources before requesting tuition assistance from SGWS. Please know that, while it is our aim to make the possibility of a Waldorf education a reality for as many students as possible, our ability to do so is limited and, as a result, parents /guardians must be prepared and able to shoulder the majority of their tuition obligation. Those interested in applying for tuition assistance should set an appointment to meet with the Finance Director, who will review the school's philosophy and policy f or tuition assistance. During this meeting, parents /guardians will also be informed of alternative ways to fund their child's education. If the parents /guardians and the Finance Director determine that an application for tuition assistance is appropriate, the Finance Director will review the requirements of the application with the parents /guardians . Families seek ing tuition assistanc e must submit an application online through FACTS which must include: signed copies of all pages and schedules of the previ ous year's federal tax returns for both parents /guardians ; all W-2 and/or 10 99 and/or business tax returns; and the FACTS application fee. All applications must be submitted by the deadline. Any application that is late will be reviewed by the Tuition As sistance Committee after all applications that were turned in on time have been reviewed. If there are remaining funds at the end of this process, the committee will review remaining applications in the order that they were received. The Tuition Assistanc e Committee will not become involved in any financial arrangements with parents /guardians . It is typical to consider both natural parent /guardian's financial resources in evaluating the need for tuition assistance. In the case of separated, divorced, or ne ver married parents /guardians , the parent or Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 26 guardian responsible for paying tuition, whether family or court designated, must fill out the Financial Aid Application with FACTS . Each parent /guardian is expected to contribute income if there are no pre -school children at home. Families with outstanding tuition arrears are not eligible to apply for tuition assistance. Additionally, SGWS has the right to cancel contracts for families whose arrears remain unpaid at the beginning of the school year for which the award was granted. Committee Review : The Tuition Assistance Committee (which is a subcommittee of the Finance Committee and comprises the Finance Director, the Director of Administration and a Finance Committee member) will review the recommendation o f the FACTS along with the cover letter submitted by the parents /guardians as the basis for making a recommendation for assistance. After review, discussion, clarification, and comparison to similar family situations, the Committee will v ote on the amount of the award. The committee will send a written letter of award to the applications informing them of the amount of tuition assistance, as well as the remaining balance that will be required to be paid. Clarifications/Exceptions : It shou ld be noted that n o tuition assistance is provided to pre -school families unless they have siblings in the upper grades. Parents /Guardians must reapply on an annual basis for tuition assistance. Further, an offer for tuition assistance in any given year is no guarantee of any future commitment to tuition assistance. The Tuition Assistance Committee, in tandem with the Finance Committee, will review procedures and policies annually, and reserves the right to make changes as required. Appeals : If no assistan ce is granted, or if the award received is less than is required to enroll, applicants may write a letter of appeal to the Tuition Assistance Committee. This letter must include detailed information concerning any expenses or financial obligations which we re excluded from the original application. Additionally, the letter should include the amount of assistance needed in order to enroll in or remain at the school. Contract Service Hours As part of their contract with the school, each family is obligated t o provide a number of mandatory Contract Service Hours. Service hours help reduce the overall operating costs for the school while providing students with a positive model of community service. They also build our community by providing parents /guardians and teachers opportunities to become better acquainted in a supportive, informal setting. Service Hour opportunities are posted on our website, announced in weekly emails, and publicized throughout the building. If you have an idea for a special project yo u wish to pursue to fulfill your Service Hours, check in the school office for information on how to submit a proposal. Parents /Guardians are responsible for keeping track of their Service Hours by docume nting them using the Google Form listed in the Tuesday Note. Record your activity as soon as possible to keep your record up to date. The number of Service Hours required is based on the student's enrollment status and is indicated in the contract. A buy -out option is available; contact the Finance Director for more information. Families who receive tuition assistance of any kind may not buy out of Service Hours. Work Days Scheduled work days are opportunities for faculty, staff, alumni, and current families to mitigate the costs of building maintenance by working together to perform a variety of routine tasks, both inside and out (depending on the weather). The Parent/Guardian Contr act requires each family to complete 10% of their Contract Service Hours on scheduled work days. Work days are scheduled according to the season and to the building's needs, and they are announced to the community by email. Fundraising Fundraising plays an essential role in keeping tuition costs down and in strengthening our community. Various fundraisers held throughout the school year reduce tuition fees by approximately 10% per student. Your contract obliges you to support our two major fundraisers, t he Annual Giving Campaign and the Annual Benefit Auction. We ask that you also consider supporting additional fundraising programs and events to the best of your ability, whether financially or through volunteerism. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 27 Part V: Daily Procedures and Policies Arrival and Dismissal The school day begins promptly at 8:30. Students are encouraged to arrive at 8:15 to allow them time to prepare for the start of the day. It is extremely important that students arrive on time. Students who arrive late disr upt the class, and the late student faces a disadvantage in entering a class that has already begun. Please note the following: Arrival: -If you have students in early childhood and the grades to drop off, please park in the Early Childhood parking lot and allow the grades students to walk along the sidewalk to the front doors of the bui lding.

Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 28 - When a driver is picking up or dropping off a student in front of the school, the driver MUST remain in the car. Should you need to leave your car, please park in the lot near th e early childhood meadow or in the Sportsman's Club parking area. - Double parking is not permitted. Students should not walk between cars to get to their ride. Students must always exit and enter their vehicle on the curb side. -Students in grades 1 thr ough 8 must be picked up directly from the carpool lane unless the family also has a student(s) in early childhood. Transportation Busing or public transportation is not available to Spring Garden students. Carpooling is a convenient and sometimes nece ssary arrangement for parents /guardians . The easiest way to create a carpool is to review the Community Directory and find the families closest to you. You may be able to join an existing carpool or you can start a new one. Parents /Guardians are asked to w ork together in transporting students to and from school. Carpooling parents /guardians should remember to notify drivers of absent students so they do not wait or look for that student. It is also important for your child's teacher to be aware of your transportation arrangements. Should a change in the arrangements occur, please notify both the office and the teacher. Some local school districts do offer yearly financial compensation fo r transportation to and from private schools. To see if your family qualifies, cont act your local school district. Student Attendance The Spring Garden Waldorf School calendar is based on the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) requirements for attendance for chartered nonpublic schools. The school calendar is established and communicated to parents /guardians in May of the preceding school year. Each parent, guardian, or custodian having charge of a child of compulsory school age must send the child to sch ool for the entire time school is in session. The Administrative Faculty will reserve the right to review attendance issues on a case -by-case basis. Records of attendance are included in the student's evaluations and are a part of each stu dent's cumulativ e file. Parents/guardians are expected to call the school when their child is absent. Parents /guardians are expected to provide a written explanation to their child's teacher for planned absences or tardies. Pupils will be expected to make up work missed during absences if required by their teacher. This may be completed at school or at home, as arranged by the teacher and pupil. Absence and Tardy Policy All absences, regardless of reason, will be recorded on the student's attendance record. Absences are designated as excused and unexcused. An excused absence or tardy is accompanied by a doctor's note or note describing a family illness or circumstance. Excused absence: *Illness of student *Serious illness of immediate family member *Death of family member *Observance of religious holidays *By request of the school (suspension, lice, strep throat, etc.) Unexcused absence or tardy: *The result of family travel plans that extend b eyond the published starting and ending dates of the school holidays and vacations. * The result of willful truancy on the part of the student * Those that are not excused by the standards. * Any excused absence without a note of explanation w ill be considered unexcused. Tardy Students All children should arrive between 8:1 5 and 8:30 a.m. Punctuality plays an important role in the rhythm of the opening and closing of the school day. When students arrive for class after the prescribed time , they create a Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 29 disruption to the natural flow of the lesson that all of our teachers endeavor to develop in each and every one of their classes. Classes begin promptly at 8:30 a.m. If a student is going to be tardy, a parent or guardian will call to no tify the office prior to arrival. Students who arrive for school after 8:30 am must go to the office to secure a late pass . A faculty or staff member will assist younger grades students in joining their class. Early Childhood parents /guardians will walk with their student to the front door where they will be given a late pass by a staff member . Parents /Guardians of Early Childhood students will accompany them to their classroom. Results of Absence or Tardiness : A student may not exceed 20 combined absences or times tardy, either excused or unexcused , in any school year. Students who accumulate more than 20 combined absences or tardies may be put on probation at the discretion of the Administrative Faculty. It is the responsibility of the class teacher to bring this to the attention of the Administrative Faculty. A six -year -old kindergarten student who is age ready for first grade the following year, but has exceeded the limit of 20 combined absences or tardies in the kindergarten year may be promoted to grade one on a probationary basis. The duration of this probation, based on attendance, will be for the first 6 weeks. This will be determined by the first grade readiness group and the kindergarten lead teacher will bring the concern to their attention. Participation in Extracurricular Activities for Absent Students : A student may not participate in extracurricular activities if they were absent from school that day. EdChoice and EdChoice Expansion Attendance Records SGWS is required by the ODE to report the attendance of students receiving the EdChoice or EdChoice Expansion scholarship at the end of each month. We must report whether the student 's absence is excused or unexcused. SGWS require s all absences to include a written excuse in order to be considered an \"excused\" absence. Excused absences include, but are not limited to: illness of student, serious illness of immediate family member, death of family member, observance of religious h oliday. SGWS will not excuse absences due to vacations/tr ips or extracurricular activities . If we do not receive your written excuse by the end of the week of the student 's absence, it will be considered \"unexcused. \" If a student accumulates more than tw enty (20) unexcused absences, they may not be eligible to renew their scholarship the following school year. Before Care and Aftercare Program Before and aftercare is available for children from the age of 4 through 8th grade as a pre -registered and prepaid service. Space is limited. Before care begin s at 7:30 a.m. and students remain in before care until they transition to morning recess at the start of the school day. Aftercare begins at 3:30 p.m. and is available until 6 p.m. The minimum amount of use is be 50 hours ($300) for before care and 100 hours ($600) for aftercare. After minimum usage, before and aftercare fees are: $6.00 per hour for the first student; $4.80 per hour for each additional sibling. Lunches and Snacks Early Childhood : Students receive a nutritious, filling snack in the morning program. Parents /guardians of students in the full -day program must pack a lunch and an afternoon snack for their child. Please refer questions about lunches and snacks to your child's afternoon teacher. Grades One through Eight : Parents /guardians are encouraged to provide wholeso me, nutritious lunches for their children and not pack candy or sweetened drinks. Chewing gum is not allowed at any time during the school day. Time is allotted each morning for a break, and we suggest parents /guardians provide something extra, such as a piece of fruit, for a snack at this time. Spring Garden Waldorf School is a nut -free facility . Please see the school's Allergy Policy for guidelines, as well as suggestions for nut -free lunches and snacks. Meetings Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 30 Several important meetings are scheduled regularly every school year. Some are mandatory, others are optional but highly recommended. All the meetings in this section can be counted toward your Contract Service Hours (see page 24), so please be sure to kee p track of your hours and record them . Parent /Guardian -Teacher Conferences are scheduled twice yearly, in the fall and late spring. Parent /Guardian attendance at Parent /Guardian -Teacher Conferences is mandatory. Additional conferences may be arranged at any time throughout the school year at the request of parents or teachers. Dates for Parent /Guardian -Teacher Conferences are listed on the School Calendar. Class Meetings are held throughout the year to inform parents /guardians about and discuss issues re levant to the class. These meetings are an essential aspect of parent /guardian participation in the life of the school, and at least one parent /guardian from each family is expected to attend each meeting. Dates for scheduled Class Meetings are listed on t he School Calendar, but your child's teacher may schedule additional Class Meetings if necessary (for example, to plan a class project or trip). Parent /Guardian Council meetings are held monthly to discuss relevant issues and to plan community events. Though each class has a designated Parent /Guardian Council Representative, all parents are welcome to attend Parent /Guardian Council meetings. Dates for all Parent /Guardian Council meetings can be f ound on the School Calendar. Parent /Guardian educational opportunities such as lectures, workshops, and discussion groups are offered throughout the school year. All parents are encouraged to attend these events, which both deepen parents' understanding o f Waldorf education and strengthen bonds in the school community. Parents /Guardians are encouraged to bring family and friends for these special events. As events are scheduled, they will be announced to the community via email. School committees meet as necessary throughout the year to organize events. The contribution of skills by parents /guardians and teachers is vital to the functioning of the school, and all parents /guardians are welcome to serve on the Festivals Committee, Auction Committee, Site Com mittee, or Marketing Committee. If you are interested in serving on a committee, please pick up a Committee Application from the Parent /Guardian Information Board in the SGWS School Store. Student recruitment efforts provide an excellent opportunity for parents /guardians to share their experience with prospective families or to bring friends and relatives to learn more about Spring Garden. Walk Through the Grades is a monthly scheduled tour of the school while class is in session. Open House events are he ld three times during the school year, typically on a Sunday afternoon. Outside Play Outside play is important to our curriculum. Recess time is an opportunity to work off excess energy in a healthy way. The children also get to experience the healing as pect of the ambient light and benefit from experiencing the natural world through the four seasons. During outside play, the students also engage in social interactions and have the opportunity to work through conflicts. Outside play is an important part of the rhythm of the school day for all of our students. The children are prepared to do meaningful work in preschool and through the grades when given the opportunity to play outside at regular intervals. Even a quarter of an hour of play is gre atly bene ficial to the children, and also a safe amount of time for them to be outside in all but the most extreme situations. We closely monitor the temperature and wind chill forecasts. If the temperatures are not safe to allow for outside play, we will close or delay school. While school is in session, the students will go outside for recess. Please ensure that your child is prepared for the weather with gloves, hats, and scarves. Clothing - Students in preschool through Grade Four are expected to wear appropriate clothing and footwear for the weather or they will not be allowed to participate in all aspects of outdoor play. Students in Grades Five through Eight will experience the natural consequences of poor clothing choices, within reason. Please see Student Dress Standards below. Supervision - During snack recess (following Main Lesson), each class is supervised by a teacher. During lunch recess, four teachers are assigned supervisory l ocations throughout the playground. One teacher is also available in a study hall to proctor students making up missed work. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 31 Playground Rules - Playground rules are consistent with school rules and are posted in the upper grades hallway. Behavior on the playground that does not conform to school rules is initially redirected. Failure to follow the request of playground supervisors will result in removal from play and any other steps as necessary under the Behavior and Discipline Policy (page 31). Athletic/Sports Program Students in grades 5 through 8 have the opportunity to participate in organized sports which are managed by our Athletic Director. Students in grade 5 participate in practices and non -competitive events only, while students in grades 6 through 8 may choose to participate on the practice team or participate in all scheduled events, including regular games and meets. This approach alig ns with our pedagogy, meeting the needs of children as they grow and develop new capacities. G ood sportsmanship, camaraderie, and a positive attitude are stressed throughout students' participation in the sports program, with the goal of inclusion in mind. Currently, Spring Garden offers cross country in the fall, basketball during the winter and track/field during the spring. Practices are held at least twice weekly and are coached by volunteer community members. We participate in the CYO program and a dhere to the appropriate rules and regulations attached to this program. There is a fee associated with participation in these programs. Additionally, the athletic program conducts several fundraisers to help offset costs. Student Dress Standards A Wald orf curriculum is designed to help students develop socially as well as academically. Student attire is particularly important because many school activities include movement. The standards below allow all the students to be able to fully participate in th e curriculum. We have listed these requirements having to do with safety, warmth, range of motion, and our media policy. Please know that our students engage in play and work that involves mud, dirt, paint, and other activities. Our students do get dirty, so plan accordingly. SGWS respects clothing choices that reflect religious beliefs, cultural beliefs, and gender identity.

We appr eciate parent /guardian's support of the dress code and all policies. It is up to the discretion of faculty and staff whether students are in compliance with the dress code. If a student violates the dress code, a teacher or staff member may take the follow ing actions: Speak to the student individually. Require the student to exchange the item of clothing in violation of the dress code for an appropriate item. If the dress code concern prohibits safe participation in the school activity, the student may not be allowed to participate in the activity and may be required to complete make -up work. If dress code violations are a repeated concern, the teacher or staff member may call the parents /guardians , ask for a meeting with student and parents /guardians , bring to the attention of the Administrative Faculty, or send a student home. -Approved by Administrative Faculty on 6/18/18 Media We recognize that technology and media are in a state of constant evolution in today's world. With this in mind, we are focused on educating our children to think beyond the limitations of current technology and media influence. Both our experience with children and a growing body of research in brain development indicate that early exposure to tec hnology and media has a negative effect on a child's development and learning ability. With this in mind, we ask families to work in partnership with us by limiting the children's exposure to technology and media. This allows for a mood of reverence, wo nder, and beauty in the classroom that can live in the students and be expressed in their work and play. To this end, any items with media characters are not permitted in the school. We also ask that parents /guardians seek alternative forms of entertainmen t for their children at home which enliven each child's individual thinking, feeling, and physical capacities, rather than entertainment provided on the television, gaming device, or computer. If you need some ideas for creative play, your child's teacher can help you identify age -appropriate creative games and activities to share with your child. Toys and Electronic Items Students should not bring any toys, radios, or electronic items to school. This includes but is not limited to puzzles, mechanical toys, dolls, computerized games, alarms, calculators, video games, MP3 players, iPods, and cell phones. Students in the ful l-day Early Childhood program are allowed to bring a blanket and one small soft toy that does not light up or make sounds for naptime. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 33 General Information and Guidelines When visiting Spring Garden Waldorf School, families of students should be aware of and observe the following guidelines: - We are a nut -free facility . No products with peanuts or tree nuts should be brought to any school events. - Firearms or weapons of any kind are prohibited on school grounds at all times. - Alcoholic beverages a re prohibited on school grounds , except for school -sponsored, adults -only events. Illegal substances are prohibited on school grounds at all times. - Service animals for persons with disabilities will be permitted on school grounds. However, b ecause ev en the most well -behaved pets can cause anxiety in children who are generally fearful of animals, pets are not permitted on school grounds at any time, even if they are leashed. However, individual classes may h ave \"class pets\" upon mutual agreement of stu dents, parents /guardians , and the class teacher. Student Code of Conduct Spring Garden's policy regarding student behavior and subsequent disciplinary actions is an interdependent plan of mutual support maintained by all faculty, staff, and parents /guardians . The goal of this policy is to maintain an environment that is safe and conducive to learning while nurturing an atmosphere of cooperation and mutual respect. The policy speaks to both the student's behavior and to the parent /guardian's responsibility for that behavior. Self-discipline, respect, and behavior in accordance with an orderly, energetic pursuit of studies are necessary from all students. Actions in accordance with this code of conduct are expected of all students in all activi ties of the school day as well as at all school -related events and activities. Students are expected at all times to honor the schools statement of non-discrimination, and to work in a cooperative and positive manner with all those around them. - Be courteous and respectful in words and deeds at all times toward teachers, staff, and students. - Exhibit self-control in all situations, avoiding physical or verbal forms of aggression. - Use appropriate language, avoiding vulgar expressions, wor ds, or gestures. - Seek opportunities to be of service to others and to the community of the school. - Maintain orderly conduct in classrooms, building, and grounds. - Respect the materials in the building, grounds, and classrooms. - Conduct your self in ways that actively promote a positive learning experience for those around you. - Follow all class, playground, and safety rules established by teachers and staff. - Do not bring to school any personal items not required for classes, includ ing toys, sports equipment, or games - Keep all your pets at home; they may not be outside of a car on the school premises. - Do not bring to school any product containing tree nuts or peanuts, or chewing gum of any kind. - Dress according to the school dress code, including footwear appropriate to school activities. - Do not use any electronic devices on the school premises, or while participating in school events. These devices include, but are not limited to, cell phones, music players, and tablets. - Do not bring any weapon of any kind to school or any school function. - Follow directions given by teachers and staff during school and all school related events. - Participate in all parts of the full program as directed by the teachers, unless a written excuse from a doctor has been provided to the office. - Complete all work and assignments for classes within assignment due dates. - Give a positive and genuine effort in all activities. - Report all instances of inappropriate behavior to a supervising teacher. - Remain in the direct supervision of faculty or staff unless permission to leave has been given. - Report to before -care or after -care if present on the school grounds without a parent Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 34 or guardian outside of school hours. - Attend school on time according to the attendance policy. The staff and faculty of the school are responsible for identifying, addressing, and taking action to correct student behavior. This is to be conducted within the parameters of the school's Behavior Policy which guides the response to breaches of the expected conduct outlined above. Faculty and staff will work with students on these aspects in pedagogically and age appropriate ways. Parents /Guardians should support teachers in this regard, and discuss these guidelines with their children. Repeated actions that are not in accordance with this Code of Conduct, or single actions that are gross violations, as determined by the Administrative Faculty, may resul t in disciplinary actions, probationary enrollment, and/or termination of enrollment. (Student Code of Conduct Approved 8/22/16) Behavior Policy Learning to participate productively as part of a social group is an important part of childhood development. Many of the activities pursued in a Waldorf school are intended to consciously cultivate the capacities needed for positive relationships and resp ect. Waldorf teachers are expected to understand the subtle developmental differences in the needs of each child as well as different ways to encourage him/her to develop in a healthy way. Establishing predictable routines and consistent daily rhythms h elp children feel safe, promote cooperation, encourage expression of feelings in an appropriate manner, and lessen the need for discipline. Modeling appropriate behaviors and communicating through clear verbal messages with limited choices help children le arn healthy habits, make sound decisions, develop a sense of self -control and respect for others, and build problem -solving skills. It is expected that each child, through the support of his/her family and teachers, live up to the Student Code of Conduct in a way that is developmentally appropriate. However, there will be times when behaviors need to be addressed in a more structured way. In these instances, teachers will work as deemed appropriate within these guidelines while coordinating with parents /guardians , other teachers, and the Administrative Faculty. In specific circumstances, responses to violations of the Student Code of Conduct may be considered by faculty members per their understanding of the anthroposophical picture of the developing hu man being - including the individual child, age and development of the student, and pedagogical indications. Spring Garden Waldorf School does not condone corporal punishment. Specific consequences expressly deemed intolerable are outlined in the Prohibit ed Behavior Management Techniques section of the Faculty Manual and Parent /Guardian Handbook. In cases involving gross violations of the student code of conduct, the response by the teacher may not follow the indicated responses but can result in immedia te removal from the classroom setting and/or suspension from school. These gross violations include, but are not limited to, aggressive or violent actions, either physical or verbal, actions that pose a safety risk to self or others, possession or use of d rugs, alcohol, or weapons. Student removal from the classroom setting for any reason will follow the guidelines outlined later in this policy. Parent /Guardian Responsibilities in Supporting the Disciplinary Process The cooperation between parents and guardians and the school is crucial to the successful implementation of any discipline plan. A discipline problem is seen as a disturbance of the cooperative and respectful environment of the classroom. It must be kept i n mind that a Waldorf school considers the whole student during the educational journey, and this is true in the area of behavior and discipline as well. Teachers handle situations based on the individual child's development. Step One: Read and review th e Student Code of Conduct and discuss these ideas in an age -appropriate way with your child. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 35 Step Two: Communicate with your child's teachers. If you become aware of a circumstance that may be affecting your child's behavior in school or at home, respect fully let your child's teachers know in a timely fashion. Healthy, respectful communication between parents /guardians and tea chers, as outlined in the Parent /Guardian's Pledge , is essential to helping the student. Step Three: Participate in the process for any behavioral incidents or concerns as follows: Read all Behavioral Incident Reports regarding your child and acknowledge your receipt of each report by signing and returning it to the school office within 24 hours. Atte nd all meetings arranged with teachers or staff to address any behavior issues your child may have. Monitor your child's compliance with any at -home portion of a discipline or probation plan. Sign and return to the school office in a timely fashion all fol low-up reports that are required by the plan. Behavior that is severely disruptive will result in the immediate removal of your child from the classroom. If this were to happen, you would be expected to transport your child from the school for at -home su spension. Failure to provide transportation for your student in a timely fashion may result in your being charged for the cost of hiring a monitor to watch your child during in -school suspension. Parents /Guardians are expected to assist their children i n complying with the consequences of disciplinary actions, for example, providing transportation for the child to participate in an assigned detention or overseeing the repair or replacement of any property stolen or damaged by the child. The cooperation of parents and guardians is crucial to the school's successful implementation of any response to inappropriate behaviors or behavior plans. Failure to show parental support for the Student Code of Conduct and Behavior Policy through noncompliance with its procedures and follow -up steps may result in termination of enrollment. Responses to Inappropriate Behaviors In many cases, teachers at SGWS work with students in an individualized way through an understanding of the students in their care. Behaviors o utside the expectations outlined in the student code of conduct and in individual classroom rules are handled initially at the discretion of the supervising teacher(s). Following are typical steps that may be taken to address inappropriate behavior. Unique cases, however, may follow a different process. Teachers who encounter unexpected or inappropriate behaviors will work to understand the child, and to engage them through loving support and care. In doing so, the teacher seeks to work with all aspects of the child, not to change or eliminate a single behavior. Step One : Teacher works from a pedagogical basis with the class as a whole to build the habit life of the student through the habit life of the class In a Waldorf classroom, teachers work with the behavior of an individual student in the context of the group or the whole class. Each individual's behavior is seen in part as a manifestation of the life of the group as a whole. Meeting the behavior of the individual through work with the group as a whole acknowledges the social fabric in which every action takes place, and emphasizes the role of the class in supporting each individual member. Some methods of working with the group that can occur before individual consequences might include: Conversations with those involved or with the class as a whole, allow the students to work together to gain an understanding from the perspective of another and to learn to work together to overcome difficulties without assigning blame. Reinforcing to the class in advance what behavior is expected and what consequences will follow if they choose not to comply. Games and group activities to promote positive behaviors help to build a strong class dynamic in which there is a feeling of inclusivity and success on the part of all students. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 36 Curative stories can be used to address concerns without bringing specific attention to a behavior or student. Changing or altering the class schedule, including loss of recess time as a class, to allow discussion of and/or reflection on the behaviors of the individual or the group. Noting and commenting on appropriate behaviors, especially when done by the student who has struggled in the past. Step Two : Teacher works directly with the individual student If inappropriat e behaviors continue, the teacher begins to work directly with the student to address the behaviors through consequences. Waldorf teachers are working out of a living understanding of the archetypical development of each individual student. Through this un derstanding, behaviors that are not in accordance with the student code of conduct or healthy social interactions are worked within a manner fitting the age and stage of the child. These consequences are intended to allow the student to develop appropriate behaviors and the underlying capacities needed to engage in those behaviors. The goal of consequences is to provide structure, support, guidance, and role modeling so that the child is able to develop the constructive behaviors for classroom participation . Encouraging conscious social development between individuals and as a class is a supportive gesture, not a punitive measure. In the Early Childhood classes Some developmentally appropriate consequences include: redirecting the child to an alternative activity, a quiet reminder, hand on the shoulder, resting in a specific location in the classroom to help the child calm down and collect himself/herself, being held by the teacher for a short period of time until the child calms down (when the child throws a tantrum), limiting play space, being near the teacher during transitions and class activities, being a helper to another child involved in an incident, purposeful work such as cleaning or helping with a task. Behavioral incident report for ms may be used in an Early Childhood class for behaviors that may include biting, kicking, hitting, or other physically aggressive or unsafe behavior, as well as refusing to come to the teacher in a potentially dangerous situation. It is important to note that these behaviors can also be developmentally appropriate among young children. In the early grades classes (generally classes 1 -3) Some developmentally appropriate consequences include a quiet reminder, hand on the shoulder, moving position of the s tudent or their desk, spending time near the door inside the classroom, being a helper to another child involved in an incident, limiting play space, being near the teacher during transitions, having a separate classroom space, making a card, engaging in p urposeful work such as cleaning or helping with a task. Behavioral incident report forms may be used in these classes for behaviors that may include biting, hitting, kicking, or other repeated physically aggressive or unsafe behavior. Physical reactions b etween young children may occur as part of a developmentally appropriate response and the teacher may work with these responses repeatedly before deciding to file incident report forms. In the middle grades classes (generally classes 4 -5) Some developme ntally appropriate consequences include a quiet reminder, hand on the shoulder, moving position of the student or their desk, spending time near the door inside the classroom, being a helper to another child involved in an incident, limiting play space, ha ving a separate classroom space, writing a letter, engaging in will - work or extra purposeful work, spending time with another class, time off of activities, time off from recess, time off of specific classes (including gym or other subject classes), requi ring that he or she accept responsibility for actions, working at home with parents /guardians , placing the student's initials on the blackboard, having collaborative discussions with the goal of a positive outcome for all involved (class meetings) Behavio ral incident report forms may be used in these classes for behaviors that may include physically aggressive or unsafe behaviors, disrespectful or inappropriate language towards peers or adults, or damage to property. By Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 37 this age, students are expected to h ave a firm grasp of the expectations of their behavior, and less leniency will be given by the teachers before incident reports are filed. In the upper grades classes (generally classes 6 -8) Some developmentally appropriate consequences include purposefu l work, time off of recess, time off from another class, research or writing assignments, mediated conversations between involved students to resolve issues, conversations between students/teachers/parents /guardians , missing activities or field trips, jobs that provide help or promote well -being for the community, having collaborative discussions with the goal of a positive outcome for all involved (e.g. \"class meetings\"), requiring that he or she accept responsibility for actions, working at home, and/or b eing asked to sit or work at a desk in the hallway until the behavior can be addressed by the teacher. In some circumstances students may be sent home or suspended from school. Behavioral incident report forms may be used in these classes for behaviors that may include physically aggressive or unsafe behaviors, disrespectful or inappropriate language towards peers or adults, inappropriate conduct around younger children, damage t o property, and uncooperative or distracting behavior in classes. In mixed age groups, particularly during recess, before -care and aftercare, the older children are in a position to protect, reassure, and serve the experience of younger students. As such they are expected to follow the expectations placed on the younger students. Consequences will be in accordance with the above guidelines, with care toward supervision of the student to monitor future actions. Incident Reporting: Behavioral Incident Reports are used as a method of communication with parents /guardians , a way to track student behavior, and an indicator that the behavior exhibited has been unacceptable. These behaviors require further direct work with the individual. A Behavioral Inciden t Report Form will be filled out and shared with parents /guardians when: A behavior is repeated after an initial consequence beyond redirection (quiet reminders, hand on the shoulder, etc.) has been imposed. The developmental age of the child will be take n into account in considering the time between repeated behaviors. (Note, the initial incident, with or without a consequence, may not be communicated to parents /guardians .) Violation of the Student Code of Conduct requiring removal from the classroom. It has been indicated in a behavioral plan that a report will be shared for a specific behavior. Step Three : Behavior plan for communication and consistency is created When i ndividual consequences do not seem to be effective, or when behaviors are consistently demonstrated after re-direction from the teacher(s), the teachers and parent /guardian (s) will work collaboratively to develop a behavior plan to address specific targete d behaviors of the student. This plan may include parameters for both home and school to assist clarity and consistency in behavior expectations and consequences. The plan may also include a request for additional services to be provided by parents /guardia ns. A meeting will be organized by a teacher to allow input from all teachers working with the student. At this meeting the targeted behaviors will be identified, tracking methods will be determined, and some consequences will be suggested. Next, a repre sentative of the faculty will communicate the faculty consensus to the parents /guardians . Plan parameters for school and home will be established and a timeline for communication and implementation will be agreed upon. A document detailing targeted behavi ors, plans to address those behaviors, goals for future behaviors, and timelines for communication will be prepared and agreed to by parents /guardians and faculty. The Administrative Faculty receives a copy of the Behavior Plan prior to implementation. Step Four : Further support from colleagues is sought Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 38 When a teacher requires further help in addressing the needs of the student, he/she will seek assistance from other resources at our school. Colleagues, administration, Education Support Team members, and /or staff can provide new suggestions and opportunities to work with the student. One aspect of collegial support may be a child study. A child study is a collaborative effort on the part of the faculty to observe and hold in consciousness the individua l student. Generally held during a faculty meeting, a detailed description of the student is given by the teachers working with the child. After reflection by all faculty members on the nature of the child and their developmental stage, suggestions are mad e for possible ways to better support the child. A child study can be initiated and led by any teacher who works with a given student, and may be initiated for a variety of reasons. In the context of this policy, the child study is an opportunity for th e entire faculty to be apprised of the concerns of the teacher and to be involved in holding the child as he/she faces difficulties in meeting school expectations. Step Five : Referral to Administrative Faculty When a behavioral plan has been implemented and the concerns remain, the situation may be referred to the Administrative Faculty for their direction, including the option to impose a probationary period of enrollment. During the probation the behaviors will be monitored by all faculty wo rking with the student, and an opportunity for input by the faculty will be given before the conclusion of the probation. At the outset of any probation, the parents /guardians will be notified of the terms of probation in writing. Parents /guardians are exp ected to acknowledge the terms by signing the document outlining such terms. Probation will be structured to include a timeline, identification of behaviors needing attention, and specific goals related to those behaviors. Probationary terms may include a cademic, social, and behavioral aspects. The probationary document will include input from the teacher or teachers bringing concern about the child. The document will include a timeline for the probation including a date to conclude the probation and mak e a decision about future steps. Timeline may include meetings with the teacher(s) and parents /guardians to give feedback throughout the probationary period. Upon conclusion of a probationary period the Administrative Faculty will review the probationary document to determine whether the conditions of probation have been met. Administrative Faculty may request input from parents /guardians , teachers, and in some cases the student. The determination will be made to discontinue probation, to extend the given probation, to impose a new probationary period with revised terms, or to terminate enrollment of the student. A student whose enrollment has been terminated can reapply for admission to SGWS with written documentation from the parents /guardians of the s teps taken to address the behaviors that led to the termination of enrollment. This document must be submitted with the student's application for admission and non -refundable application fee. The document will be reviewed by the Administrative Faculty duri ng the admissions process. In some cases involving gross violations of the Student Code of Conduct or Parent /Guardian's Pledge , the Administrative Faculty reserves the right to effect a review of the enrollment of the student or family. This review is no t required to follow the steps outlined above, and can lead to immediate termination of enrollment of the student or family. If it is found that a student's conduct poses a threat to his or her own safety, or to the safety of others, or that student's co ntinuing demeanor prevents the effective learning of other students, that student may be suspended, or enrollment can be terminated, at the discretion of the Administrative Faculty. Following such an incident, a behavioral incident report form will be comp leted for documentation. In these cases, the parent /guardian (s) will be given an opportunity for a conversation with the supervising teacher, the Director of Administration , and/or a member of the Administrative Faculty to discuss this process and the next steps. The decision of the Administrative Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 39 Faculty regarding suspension or termination of enrollment will be communicated to the parent /guardian (s) in writing. Communication Guidelines Communication with Parents /Guardians : It is the goal of SGWS fac ulty and administration to communicate effectively with all parents /guardians , though not all events that occur at school will be communicated. If a parent /guardian would like more information about a situation that has happened, he/she is encouraged to communicate directly with the faculty member involved. If this communication is not sufficient, the parent /guardian is encouraged to bring the concern to the Director of Administration . Teachers are encouraged to communicate with parents /guardian regarding concerns they may have about students' behavior. In most cases, a direct conversation with the parent /guardian of the student involved is the best way to build a cooperative relationship needed to have a positive effect on the behavior of the child. Behav ioral incident report forms are a valuable tool for reporting specific incidents, but the relationship between the parent /guardian and teacher is invaluable in helping to meet the child where they are. It is the policy of SGWS faculty and staff to not en gage in discussion regarding behavioral or disciplinary issues with parents /guardians about students other than their own children. This includes any behavioral incidents involving more than one student. While teachers will discuss with parents /guardians issues regarding the behavior of their child, teachers will not discuss the actions of another child or the actions taken on the part of the school to work with any other child. A Behavioral Incident Report Form will be filled out and shared with parents guardians when: A behavior is repeated after an initial consequence beyond redirection (quiet reminder, hand on shoulder, etc.) has been imposed. The developmental age of the child will be taken into account in considering the time between repeated behavio rs. For instance, repeating a behavior within a week may be developmentally acceptable in the first grade but not in the eighth grade. The first incident, even with a consequence, may not be communicated to parents /guardians . Any gross violation of the St udent Code of Conduct requiring removal from the classroom. If it has been indicated in a behavioral plan that a report will be shared for a specific behavior. Behavioral Incident Reports are used for individual students throughout all the steps of the disciplinary process. Communication with other Teachers: An informal conversation or written document will be shared by a teacher with other SGWS teachers when: There is a concern about a student's behavior in other classes. A consistent response to student behaviors is needed. A child has had a difficult day or has had incidents earlier in the day. This communication often occurs during transition between classes. An aggressive interaction has occurred between students, req uiring ongoing attention to their interactions. Communication with the Administrative Faculty: Notification of behavioral concerns is brought to the Administrative Faculty by faculty or staff when: Behavioral Incident Reports are filed, they are reviewe d by a member of the Administrative Faculty. A meeting regarding behavior is being held with the parents /guardians . A Behavior Plan is implemented. Probation or termination of enrollment is initiated. Student Removal from the Classroom When a behavior i s deemed by the supervising teacher to be severe and aggressive or a gross violation of the Student Code of Conduct, a student may need to be removed from the classroom immediately. In these cases, the following procedures are indicated. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 40 Immediately addr ess the situation to assure the safety of all students. This may include physically intervening to hold a student if it is necessary to avoid physical harm to themselves or others. Contact another adult for assistance. The intercom in the classroom can be used to contact the office so they can arrange for another faculty or staff member to assist. Remove the student from the situation and bring him/her under direct supervision and to a safe location. The assisting faculty or staff member who will be observ ing the student will be apprised of the situation, approximate time the supervising teacher will be able to address the situation directly, and what other support might be needed. The supervising faculty or staff member will remain the person directing the response to this behavior. Address the student directly and give the student an opportunity to express his/her viewpoint on the situation. Consult with the Director of Administration and at least one other colleague to determine whether the student need s to be sent home immediately or can return to the classroom. File a Behavioral Incident Report Form that documents what has occurred. Prohibited Behavior Management Techniques At all times a faculty or staff member is in charge of a child or group of children and is responsible for their discipline. The first response of the adults who become aware of a behavior or discipline concern is to ensure the safety and physical and emot ional well -being of all individuals on the premises. Spring Garden Waldorf School's methods of discipline shall apply to all persons on the premises and shall be restricted as follows: There will be no cruel, harsh, corporal punishment or any unusual pun ishments such as, but not limited to, punching, pinching, shaking, spanking, or biting. No discipline will be delegated to any other child. No physical restraints will be used to confine a child by any means other than holding a child for a short period of time, such as in a protective hug, so the child may regain control. No child will be placed in a locked room or confined to an enclosed area such as a closet, a box, or similar cubicle. No child will be subjected to profane language, threats, derogatory r emarks about the child or the child's family, or other verbal abuse. Discipline will not be imposed on a child for failure to eat, failure to sleep, or toileting accidents. Techniques of discipline will not be intended to humiliate, shame, or frighten a c hild. Discipline will not include withholding food, rest, or toilet use. Separation, when used as discipline, will be brief in duration and appropriate to the child's age and developmental ability. Preschool aged children will always be within sight and h earing of a staff member in a safe, lighted, and well -ventilated space. SGWS staff members will not abuse or neglect children and will protect children from abuse and neglect while in attendance at school. The parent /guardian of a child enrolled at SGWS receive the Behavior Policy as part of the Parent /Guardian Handbook. All SGWS staff members receive a copy of the school's Behavior Policy as part of the Faculty Manual. Approved by Administrative Faculty on January 26, 2017. Anti -Discrimination and Harassment (Bullying) Policy Spring Garden Waldorf School believes that all students and employees have the right to a safe, healthy, and caring learning environment. We know this is vital for students to learn, grow, and become responsible citizens of the world. SGWS prohibits any and all forms of discrimination and harassment which includes behaviors commonly recognized as bullying, hazing, sexual harassment and sexual abuse/assault. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 41 Harassment is distinguished from an isola ted threat by its recurrent nature: it implies a habit of belittling, harmful behavior. Harassment, including bullying, is any gesture or act that is reasonably perceived as being motivated either by an actual or perceived characteristic, involves a power imbalance, and is repetitive. Characteristic examples are: race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, socioeconomic status academic status, mental, physical, developmental or sensory disability or impairment, creed, political belief, age, linguistic or language differences, height, weight, marital status, parental status, or by any other distinguishing characteristic or because of an association with a person who has or is perceived to have one or more of these chara cteristics. Harassment can be experienced through gesture, verbal, online, graphic, written or physical expression. Offensive conduct may include, but is not limited to, offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, physical assaults or threats, inti midation, exclusion, ridicule or mockery, insults or degrading statements, offensive objects or pictures, and interference with the education of the students or work performance of the employees. It can occur on or off school property, at any school -sponso red function, in a vehicle being used for school purposes, or by students, family members, or staff. This policy applies to all activities at the school; to all school -sponsored and affiliated activities and events, including, but not limited to, special events, field trips, overnight trips, sporting events and practices. Furthermore, because students' and employees' behavior, whether inside or outside of school, reflects on SGWS and can have a significant impact on life at school, there are tim es when it is appropriate and important for SGWS to respond to concerns that occur outside of school and beyond school hours. Therefore, SGWS reserves the right to discipline those who engage in discrimination or harassment of SGWS students at any location and at any time if such discrimination or harassment causes a substantial disruption to the SGWS community. Behavior identified as harassment will not be tolerated from SGWS students, their parents/guardians, SGWS employees (faculty, administration, ath letic personnel, and other staff), SGWS volunteers, employees of contracted service providers, and independent contractors working at SGWS. Retaliation in any form against any complainant or participant in the complaint process will not be tolerated. Res ponse to Harassment Involving Students Any student who feels he or she is being subjected to harassment should immediately report this to a teacher or other trusted adult. It is this adult 's responsibility to report the concern to the class teacher and Director of Administration . The following steps are to be followed when concerns regarding harassment or bullying are reported. The concern should be acknowledged and those involved assured that it will be investigated. All staff members will be made aware of the concerns to add needed supervision for students involved. Play boundaries may be limited to better monitor interactions. The class teacher and Director of Administration will carry out a prompt and complete investigation of the alleged harassment. Within one week, depending upon the extent and complexity of the investigation, the investigation will be summarized in writing. Behavioral Incident Reports will be completed for the students involved The written summary will be reported to the Administr ative Faculty who will determine the extent of harassment. The class teacher will develop a plan for remediation by consulting with other teachers who work with the students. The goal of remediation is to transform a situation in order to make it impossi ble for the harassment to continue. Remediation may include meeting with the parents /guardians of the student who engages in harassment, making amends with the student who was harassed, or establishing a behavior plan. If the issue is not resolved, furthe r disciplinary action up to and including dismissal may be implemented by the Administrative Faculty. During the process of remediation, the Administrative Faculty and College of Teachers will be kept informed as needed to provide support for the students. Following these types of concerns, parents /guardians may be eager to know if the steps the school has taken are working. Parents /Guardians of the students involved will be kept informed about how the teachers and staff are working with their child. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 42 Any student who engages in bullying or harassment is subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. The Administrative Faculty will take into consideration the whole child when determining disciplinary action and to ensure support is being prov ided to the student who reports being harassed. If the issue is not resolved, further disciplinary action up to and including dismissal may be implemented by the Administrative Faculty. Response to Harassment Involving Employees Any faculty or staff member accused of harassment will be suspended with pay, pending the outcome of the investigation. Based on the results of the investigation, the employee may be reinstated or terminated. Approved by Administrative Faculty on January 26, 2017. Volun teer Background Check Policy Purpose : It is the intent of this policy to establish certain guidelines to protect the safety of the students and school community by screening the background of volunteers who have the potential of extended unsupervised cont act with students. A criminal history check serves as a means to review an individual's background in respect to their volunteer participation with school activities. Knowing an individual's background can provide more certainty that people with a history of inappropriate behavior will not have access to the students and school community. The objective of our background checks is to ensure the safety and well -being of students. Policy : All adults volunteering as overnight chaperones for SGWS activities wil l be subject to a background screening consisting of a fingerprint scan submitted to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (BCI). Volunteer background checks are NOT required for attending class meetings, assisting the teacher in the classroom, driving on field trips, attending school activities as a spectator, providing help with the auction, or Children's Festival or other similar volunteer tasks. These volunteers are under the supervision of a faculty or staff member. Screening Process : 1. The volunteer completes a BCI check and ensures that the results are submitted to Spring Garden Waldorf School. The volunteer must provide his or her name, address, and Social Security number and present a valid Ohio Driver's Li cense at the time of the background check. It is also important to have the school's address available when completing the check so that the results can be sent to the school. SGWS 1791 S. Fax: 330 -666-9210 2. The results of the check are reviewed by the Director of Administration . 3. If any disqualifying offenses are reported in the background check, the DA will notify the volunteer that he or she is disqualified and review the BCI report with the volunteer. Any volunteer whose history demonstrates a risk to the safety or well -being of students and staff will be denied participation in activities that put the volunteer in direct contact with students. Guidelines for disqualification : - Failure to complete the background screening process - All felony offenses - Past history of sexual victimization of children (regardless of whether the individual subsequently completed therapy) - Conviction for any crime in which children were involved (regardless of successful completion of probation or incarceration) - History of violence or any sexually exploitative behavior, including acts against Adults - Termination from a paid or volunteer position as the direct result of misconduct with a child - Lying about criminal history - More than one DUI within 5 years Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 43 Confidentiality : To help ensure confidentiality, the results of the check will be limited to the DA or an individual identified by the Board of Trustees. The criminal background checks will be maintained and secured as confidential records. Appeals Process : If a volunte er's background check includes a disqualifying charge, the DA will contact the volunteer and review the BCI report. If the volunteer wishes to dispute the content of the background check, the volunteer must provide documentation to the SGWS Board President regarding the dispute. The Board President will make a final decision regarding the status of the volunteer. Health and Medical Procedures All health and medical procedures related to COVID -19 are detailed in the Health and Safety Plan. This document i s updated frequently on the website and in a link on the Tuesday Note. School Nurse Spring Garden Waldorf School does not have an on -site school nurse. All Administrative staff, all Early Childhood staff, and most faculty are trained in first aid and CPR, and there is a sick room with cots in the school office. Spring Garden has a visiting nurse who reviews student medical records; conducts hearing, vision, an d scoliosis screenings; and is available to the school for consultation regarding illnesses and communicable diseases. Medical Emergency Form An Emerge ncy Medical Contact & Authorization (Form 2 in the yearly enrollment paperwork) must be completed and signed for each student's file. This form must contain the names and telephone numbers for at least three adults to contact in case of an emergency. This form must also contain the name, address, and phone number for your doctor and/ or dentist. This form is where you should indicate any and all medical information regarding your child, including medications, chronic illnesses, diabetes, allergies, or any other pertinent information. Early Childhood Child Medical Statement Under state law, students in Early Childhood must be seen by a physician once every 12 months. Early Childhood enrollment paperwork includes Form 2a, which contains a statement that the child is healthy and free of communicable diseases, which must be signed by a physician . Early Childhood students will not be permitted to attend school unless a current completed Form 2a, signed by a physician, is on file. Special Health Concerns Special dietary concerns, food allergies, or other health concerns such as asthma should be c learly spelled out in writing for both the teacher and the administrative staff. Students with life -threatening allergies must have a current Allergy Action Plan, signed by their physician, and all necessary medications for treatment on file in the office . Students with other life -threatening medical conditions must have the appropriate care instructions and medications for treatment on file in the office. Faculty and staff are trained by the visiting nurse in the proper administration of student medicatio ns. (Please see Medications at School and the SGWS Allergy Policy below for more information.) Medications Policy Whenever possible, students are encouraged to receive medications at home. If medications are required during the school day, SGWS must comply with the State of Ohio law and school policy. Prescription Medications : Medications will not be administered until paperwork and medication are brought in to the school. It is the responsibility of the parent /guardian to provide the appropriate pap erwork and medication. All medication will be secured in the school office. Exceptions are: - Inhalers, which a student may carry if the physician approves and signs the Authorization for Student Possession and Use of an Asthma Inhaler. - Epi-Pens, or epinephrine auto -injectors, which a student may carry if the physician Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 44 approv es and signs the Authorization for Student Possession and Use of an Epinephrine Auto -Injector. Per our Allergy Policy, a student may only self -carry an Epi - Pen, or epinephrine auto -injector, if it is in addition to the Epi -Pen, or epinephrine auto -injector, kept in the office. No other medications are to be self -administered or carried by a student. Prescription medications may be administered by personnel designated by the Director of Administration . Prior to administration of any prescription medication, Form 4: Request for Administration of Medication by School Personnel must be completed by the physician who prescribed the medication. All prescription medication must be brought to the school by the parent /guardian in the original bottle in wh ich it was dispensed either by the physician or the pharmacist, with the label correctly corresponding to the physician's order. Non -prescription Medications : No non -prescription medications will be given by school personnel without an order from the ph ysician. Prior to administration of any non -prescription medication Form 4: Request for Administration of Medication by School Personnel must be completed by the physician who prescribed the medication. Any medications left in the office after June 15 will be discarded. Emergency Care There are first aid kits in the office and in every classroom, and faculty are trained to handle minor emergency care. In the event of serious accident, illness, or injury, at least one member of the faculty or administ rative staff will remain will the student at all times, while another adult contacts the local paramedics. The parents /guardians of the ill or injured child will be contacted after the paramedics are on their way to the school. Illness and Injury Policy Illness : Most children with mild illnesses can safely attend Spring Garden. But a child is too sick to attend if: 1. The child does not feel well enough to participate comfortably in the program's activities. 2. The staff cannot adequately care for the sick child without compromising the care of the other children. 3. The child has any of the following symptoms unless a health provider determines that the child is well enough to attend and that the illness is not contagious: Temperature of one hundred degrees Fahrenheit taken by the auxiliary method when in combination with other signs of illness Diarrhea (three or more abnormally loose stools within a twenty -four -hour period) Vomiting more than once in the last twenty -four hours Sore throat or difficulty swallowing Rash with a fever or behavior change Severe coughing, c ausing the child to become red or blue in the face or to make a whooping sound Difficult or rapid breathing Yellowish skin or eyes Redness of the eye or eyelid, thick and purulent (pus) eye discharge, matted eyelashes, burning, itching or eye pain Untreate d infected skin patch(es) Unusually dark urine and/or grey or white stool Stiff neck with an elevated temperature Evidence of untreated lice, scabies, or other parasitic infestation 4. The child has any of the following diagnoses from a health provider (until treated and/or no longer contagious): Infectious conjunctivitis/pink eye (with eye discharge) until 24 hours after treatment started Scabies, head lice, or other infestation - until 24 hours after treatment and free of lice Impetigo - until 24 hours after treatment started Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 45 Strep throat , scarlet fever or other strep infection - until 24 hours after treatment started and the child is free of fever Tuberculosis until a health care provider determines that the disease is not contagious Spring Garden foll ows the Ohio Department of Health's \"Communicable Disease Chart,\" which is posted in the sick room, for the appropriate identification and management of suspected illnesses. The following precautions are taken for students suspected of having a communicabl e disease: When a student has been observed with signs or symptoms of illness as detailed above, the teacher or staff will isolate the student and immediately notify the parent or guardian of the student's condition and to arrange for the student to be pic ked up from school. SGWS has a small sick room for students who may need to rest for a short time or are awaiting pick up due to illness. All early childhood students are cared for in sight of an adult at all times either in the classroom, sick room, or in the main office. Grades students are within hearing distance of a supervising adult. After each use, the sick room cots are disinfected with an appropriate germicidal agent. Mildly ill children are observed in the classroom or sick room for worsening of symptoms. All parents /guardians will be notified by the school when their children have been exposed to a communicable disease. While not a communicable disease, lice are a nuisance, and our goal is to prevent lice from spreading. If a child is suspected of having lice, we will inspect the student's head for confirmation and call parents /guardians regarding treatment. When multiple cases of lice are present, we will check the heads of the entire class. Guidelines for return to school after illness: The student has been fever -free or has not had a loose bowel movement for at least 24 hours. The student has been treated with antibiotics for at least 24 hours (if the disease or illness warrants such treatment). Parents /Guardians have taken appropriate treatment measures for the disease or illness. For example, a child with lice may return once parents /guardians have treated the condition with an effective over -the- counter lice removal product and there are no remaining live lice. The incubation or contagion period for the disease is complete. The child's physician has signed a release for the child to return to school. Please provide a physician's release for all diagnosed communicable diseases. Injuries : Students are e xpected to participate in all activities during the school day. Students that are unable to participate in activities are required to provide a doctor's note to the Administrative Assistant outlining any limitations to participation. The doctor's note shou ld include the anticipated duration of the limitations or provide a follow up note releasing the student from the limitations. In all cases, the parents /guardians should consult with their child's teacher, and if necessary, the DA, to review the limitation s and ensure that SGWS can provide adequate accommodations. Immunizations Spring Garden Waldorf School recognizes that immunizations prevent the occurrence and spread of certain communicable diseases. We also recognize that immunizations are a safegu ard to the school community in preventing the spread of disease. The school follows immunization requirements put in place for all schools (public and private) chartered in the State of Ohio by the Ohio Department of Education. These requirements con sist of keeping detailed records of each student's vaccine history. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 46 We recognize that health education, hygiene, adequate nutrition, and immunizations are essential to preventing infectious disease and that a parent /guardian 's decision how to support their child's health is a decision made in consultation with their family doctor. In the case of an outbreak, our school community would be required to follow the guidelines established by the State of Ohio, which includes exclusion from school for st udents exempting from certain vaccinations. Every student must have a current, dated, and signed immunization record or immunization exemption form on file. Spring Garden Waldorf School Allergy Policy Intent Spring Garden Waldorf School is committed to providing a safe and nurturing environment for students. The school 's administration, board of trustees, and faculty understand the increasing prevalence of life threatening allergies. Recognizing that the risk of accidental exposure to allergens can be reduced in the school setting, SGWS is committed to working in cooperation with parents /guardians , students, and physicians, to minimize risks and provide a safe educational environment for all students. SGWS's p osition is not to guarantee an allergen -free environment, rather it is to encourage self -responsibility and plan for an effective response to possible emergencies. The focus of allergy management shall be on education, awareness, communication, risk reduct ion, and emergency response. As mandated by Section 3313.719 of the Ohio Revised Code, this policy is intended to create a framework for protecting students with allergies and to reduce the likelihood of allergic reactions of students with known allergies while at school. Allergy awareness is particularly relevant to students whose allergies cause an anaphylactic reaction. This is a life threatening reaction, which can cause death by suffocation within minutes of a reaction commencing. Anaphylactic reac tions occur when the body's sensitized immune system overreacts in response to the presence of a particular allergen. Anaphylaxis affects multiple body systems, including the skin, upper and lower respiratory, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular system. The recommended emergency treatment for a student suffering an anaphylactic reaction is the administration of epinephrine (adrenaline) by an auto -injector (e.g. EpiPen). The person affected must then be rushed to the hospital to receive further medical a ttention, even if the symptoms decrease with the administration of epinephrine. In the school environment, SGWS believes that the greatest risk of exposure is in new situations or when normal daily routines are interrupted, such as birthday parties or sch ool trips. The board, administration, faculty, parents /guardians , medical providers and students all have a role in preventing and managing allergies in our community. While this document focuses on life threatening food allergies, treatment of any allergi c reaction is the same when caused by food, insect sting, latex or exercise. This policy focuses management of life threatening allergies. Students that have mild or non -life threatening allergies should refer to the SGWS medication policy. It is the obje ctive of our allergy plan to enable students with allergies, including anaphylactic causing allergies, to attend Spring Garden Waldorf School. The Allergy Policy outlines the responsibilities of the affected bodies of our community and the reasonable step s that can be taken to promote the safety of students with allergies. Spring Garden Waldorf School also recognizes that the school is an environment that is allergy aware and not allergen free, and as such, cannot guarantee the safety of a student with an anaphylactic causing allergy and some level of risk is still inherent and must be understood by and acceptable to the student's parents/guardians. It is not the intent of this policy to change the SGWS curriculum or program of activities. In developing th e SGWS risk reduction plan, we considered the special circumstances of the environment at our school, and determined that a key element of risk reduction was eliminating all nuts from our school. This decision was based on the age of our students, the oppo rtunity for interaction across EC and the grades, the classroom setting, the role food plays in our community, and the prevalence and severity of nut allergies. This decision to be nut -free is not a guarantee to those individuals with nut allergies, but ra ther a preventative step taken by the school to minimize the exposure to this allergen. This measure, along with the other steps noted in the risk reduction plan, will help to provide a safer environment for students with allergies. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 47 Risk Reduction Plan Anaphylactic students must learn to avoid specific triggers. While the key responsibility lies with anaphylactic individuals and their family, in the case of an anaphylactic student, the school community must also be aware. The approach is to regularly educate the parent /guardian community, solicit the cooperation of families and to set in place procedures that are designed to safeguard the anaphylactic student as much as possible. The school cannot assume responsibility for pro viding a completely allergen -free environment. Peanuts and Tree Nuts Spring Garden Waldorf School is a nut -free school. This commitment allows SGWS to increase the safety and health of all our students. There will be no outside food with nuts, includi ng but not limited to: Peanut butter, granola bars, snacks, or other foods containing nuts, packaged food with labels that read \"may contain traces of peanuts and tree nuts\". Milk, Egg, Soy, Shellfish, and Other Allergens The school's policy is to reasonably adapt the classroom to protect anaphylactic students to the extent possible. In the Classroom: Establish a safe eating area in the classroom, as established by the faculty and administration. Safe eating area procedures within the classroom, incl uding cleaning and hand -washing before and after eating. Education about the allergens hidden in non -food materials will be provided when possible (i.e. play materials, soap, counting aids, science projects, special seasonal activities). School festivals w ill follow the nut free policy. Parents /guardians will be asked to label products, although it should not be assumed that an unlabeled product is allergen free. Anaphylactic students will be required to eat only food prepared at home or approved for consum ption as indicated on the Allergy Risk Acknowledgement Form. An anaphylactic student will take precautions, such as placing food on a placemat, or napkin rather than direct contact with a table or desk. An anaphylactic student will not be allowed to share food, utensils, containers, or towels. An anaphylactic student will not leave food unattended An anaphylactic student will not share musical instruments that go in the mouth. Communication, Education, and Awareness Ensuring the safety of anaphylactic stu dents in a school setting depends on the cooperation of the entire school community. To minimize risk of exposure, and to ensure rapid response to an emergency, parents /guardians , students, and school personnel should all understand and fulfill their resp onsibilities. BOARD The Board will be familiar with federal and state laws, including regulations, and policies relevant to the obligations of schools to students with food allergies and make sure school policies and practices follow these laws and policies. Support and all ocate resources and time for professional development and training on food allergies. ADMINISTRATION The administration will be familiar with federal and state laws, including regulations, and policies relevant to the obligations of schools to students with food allergies and make sure SGWS policies and practices follow these laws and policies. On a regular schedule, review and evaluate the school's food allergy policies and practices and revise as needed. Identify students with allergies through the y early enrollment process Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 48 Once identified, the administration will contact parents /guardians of an anaphylactic student to gather medical information related to the condition. The administration will review required documentation for anaphylactic students with parents /guardians and provide examples of documentation. Required documentation includ es the Allergy Action Plan, the Authorization for Student Possession and Use of an Epinephrine Auto injector, and Allergy Risk Acknowledgement Form. Prepare and maintain a student file including consent forms, waiver, physician's instructions and Allergy Action Plan (AAP) for each anaphylactic student Ensures the AAP is distributed to the child's classroom, front office, applicable subject teacher rooms, and before and after school program areas Ensure parents /guardians comply with required documentation an d medication requirements prior to student attending school. Ensure a doctor or registered nurse reviews all Allergy Action Plans to ensure that needed information is included. Responsible for an annual staff training session for all school personnel on ho w to recognize and treat anaphylactic reaction, on school procedures to protect anaphylactic students from exposure, and on school protocol for responding to emergencies. This session will also include training in the emergency administration of the auto -injector. Educate parent /guardian community to increase awareness of anaphylaxis, its avoidance and treatment. Communicate food allergy -related policies to all school staff, families, and the community. Review data and information (e.g., when and where me dication was administered) from incident reports of food allergy reactions and assess the effect of the incident on all students involved. If a lunch program is made available to students, the administration will provide a communication link between the lu nch provider and parents /guardians of students with allergies to ensure ingredient information is made available. The administration will ensure the lunch provider has appropriate food safety and allergy training. FACULTY Be aware of the essential actions needed to help manage food allergies for students with food allergies, including classroom activities, when meals or snacks are served in the classroom, on field trips, or during extracurricular activities. Seek guidance and help from the school administr ator as needed. Participate in annual medical and safety training, including being aware of the Emergency Allergy Response Plan. Seek additional guidance from school administrator as needed. Read and regularly review each student's Allergy Action Plan. Nev er hesitate to activate the plan in an emergency. Be trained and ready to use an epinephrine auto -injector. Keep copies of student Allergy Action Plans in the class medical binder and ensure you can access the binder easily in an emergency. Share informati on from the Allergy Action Plan with substitute teachers and other adults who regularly help in the classroom to help them know how to respond to a food allergy emergency. Prior to the beginning of each school year, notify or reinforce to class parents /guardians about student allergies including encouraging students not to share food, to wash hands before and after eating, and the dangers of bringing allergen products to school. Communicate ahead of time with family of allergic student when any food related or possible allergen related event is happening in the classroom to allow the family time to prepare something similar that is safe to be sent in with the student. Know which s tudents are not able to consume food prepared outside of the classroom. Have rapid access to epinephrine auto injectors in case of food allergy emergency. Establish class rules on: o Not sharing food o Washing hands before and after eating with soap and water o Clean -up of food spillages Plan for ability to access epinephrine auto -injector and Allergy Action Plan on any field trip or excursion. Use non -food incentives in the classroom. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 49 Include information about children with special needs, including those with kn own food allergies, in instructions to substitute teachers. Make available to the parents /guardians of an anaphylactic student the vendor/product information for foods being prepared in classroom. This is especially important in the Early Childhood where food is made daily in the classroom. If product is unsafe, family can suggest another vendor for the School to consider. Family will be responsible for sending in similar, safe food for student to consume during class or agreeing to participate in classr oom related food activities and cleaning procedures as delineated on the Allergy Risk Acknowledgement Form. Consider students' needs on trips (i.e. ride in car or is in group with teacher who knows how to use auto injector. PARENTS /GUARDIANS OF AN ANAPHYL ACTIC STUDENT Notify the school of your child's allergies Prior to the student starting school parents /guardians must provide: Allergy Action Plan. The Allergy Action Plan should be completed yearly by the parent /guardian and physician and include: o Contact information for emergencies o Current photo of the child o Details of the student's allergies and known trigger factors o Generic and proprietary names of drugs and possible cross -sensitivities to drugs, if relevant o Signs and symptoms of mild, moderate and seve re reactions and how to act in each case o Medication prescribed and when it should be used o When to call emergency services Complete any necessary Emergency Medical Authorization Forms. Provide written medical documentation, instructions, and medications as directed by a physician Ensure that the office receives a minimum of one epinephrine auto -injector and/or other medication. The medication must be identified in the AAP and be clearly labeled with the child's name, year, classroom and dosage required and show a current use by date. One auto -injector will be stored in the office. Additional auto -injectors can be provided by family for the student to self -carry or to be kept in the classroom with the teacher. The following are all ideal and we recognize the need to implement each in the context of what is age -appropriate for the child. Provide student with a second auto -injector to be stored in the classroom or for student to carry in body pouch or fanny pack at all times on his or her person. Note: Students that will carry their own auto -injector must have a form signed by parents /guardians and physician on file. Provide a Medic Alert bracelet for their child Teach their child: o About their allergies and the substances that trigger it o To recogni ze the first symptoms of an anaphylactic reactions o To know where medication is kept and who can inject it o To communicate clearly when he or she feels that a reaction is starting o To carry his/her own auto -injector, in a body pouch or fanny pack o Not to shar e food politely and explain why o To understand the importance of hand washing o To take as much responsibility as possible for his/her own safety Recognize the inherent risk associated with a child in a school environment that is \"allergy aware\" and not \"alle rgen free.\" Parents /Guardians will be asked to sign an Allergy Risk Acknowledgement Form. Provide safe food from home for their student for any food related school activities or participate in classroom related food activities as delineated on the Allergy Risk Acknowledgement Form. ALL PARENTS /GUARDIANS Do not send any foods with peanuts or tree nuts into the school. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 50 Label all foods brought in to the school for sharing with class and community. Inform themselves and participate in parent /guardian information sessions as appropriate. Encourage their own child to respect a student with allergies and follow school risk reduction plan. Do not purchase or serve food to students on field trips. ALL STUDENTS {Recognizing the age -related limitations for our youngest students:} Learn to recognize symptoms of anaphylactic reactions Avoid sharing food, especially with anaphylactic students Follow school and class rules about keeping allergens out of a classroom and washing hands Refrain from teasing a student with a food allergy. Emergency Allergy Response Plan Signs of an Anaphylactic Reaction An anaphylactic reaction can begin within seconds of exposure or after several hours. There is NO DANGER of reacting too quickly and p otential danger in reacting too slowly. Any combination of the following symptoms may signal the onset of a reaction o Hives o Itching (on any part of the body) o Swelling (of any body part, especially eyes, lips, face, tongue) o Red watery ey es o Runny nose o Fainting or loss of consciousness o Diarrhea o Stomach cramps o Coughing Symptoms do not always occur in the same order, even in the same individuals. The time from onset of first symptoms to death can be as little as a fe w minutes if reaction is not treated Anaphylactic children usually know when a reaction is taking place. School personnel will listen to the child. If she or he complains of any symptoms that could signal the onset of a reaction, staff will implement the emergency response steps. Child complaints may include: o Throat tightness or closing o Difficulty breathing o Difficulty swallowing o Sense of doom o Dizziness o Itching o Swelling o Vomiting o Change of Color o Change of Voice Emergency Response 1. Recognize sign of an anaphylactic or other reaction. 2. Stay with child, keep them calm. 3. If help is needed, contact office using intercom. If outside, send two students to office to get help and retrieve auto -injector. 4. Assess the child, referring to the student's Allergy Action Plan. If the child has not been identified with allergies and is exhibiting signs of a severe allergic reaction, call 911. Spring Garden Waldorf School Parent /Guardian Handbook - Page 51 5. Following the guidance of the Allergy Action Plan, administer medication. O bserve the child and continue to follow the direction of the Allergy Action Plan. 6. If epinephrine is administered, call ambulance. Save used auto -injector for emergency responders. 7. Contact parents /guardians . 8. Administration conducts post -anaphylaxis reaction review of policies and procedures. Allergy Policy Approved by the SGWS Board of Trustees August 10, 2015 "}
