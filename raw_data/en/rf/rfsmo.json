His is also investigating the development of vaccines against drugs of addiction such as cocaine. Biomaterials immunoengineering is a multidisciplinary field that lies at the intersection of materials science, chemistry, immunology and vaccinology. His lab collaborates with virologists, immunologists, and clinicians not only to develop synthetic vaccination platforms but also to understand how biomaterials interact with the immune system and continue to develop novel materials and creative tools to tackle multidisciplinary problems in vaccine development and immunotherapy. Biography Rudra joins Washington University in St. Louis from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, where he has been an assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology. Previously, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Chicago in the Department of Surgery. At the University of Texas, he was a member of the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development, the Center for Addiction Research and of the Human Pathophysiology and Translational Research Graduate Program.
