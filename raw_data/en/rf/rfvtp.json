What Happens During Crystal Root Canal Therapy? Untreated dental decay and infection can move into the root of the tooth. For this reason, you will likely experience pain and severe discomfort due to the infection. Sometimes, an abscess can form as the infection spreads into the gums around the tooth. When the infection is so severe that it impacts the root of the tooth, it's necessary for the dentist to access the central area of the tooth to remove the infection. During a root canal, the decay and pulp of the tooth are removed. Then, the dentist can seal the interior section of the tooth and fill it in. Delaying treatment could lead to loss of the tooth, so it is better to choose a root canal treatment in Crystal, MN to maintain the overall structure of the tooth. Modern technology can be used to save the tooth so that you can enjoy a beautiful smile. After the root canal is finished, it is common to add a dental crown or inlay to strengthen the remainder of the tooth.
