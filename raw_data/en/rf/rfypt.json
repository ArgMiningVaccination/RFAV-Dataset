[Drinking plenty of water](https://packhealth.com/staying-hydrated-with-cancer) and [getting enough](https://packhealth.com/staying-hydrated-with-cancer/) of the right nutrients can be incredibly helpful for your recovery. One nutrient worth paying a little extra attention to is protein - and not just because it's satisfying and keeps you full. Why Protein? When your body isn't getting enough protein, it begins to break down muscle tissues for energy. This can result in a major decrease in energy, as well as the threat of going into catabolism, a state of destructive metabolism. Protein plays an essential role in cell repair and cell growth, and helps to maintain your strength and combat unintentional weight and muscle loss. Eating Protein The best way to eat protein is accompanied by fats and fiber. This will insure a stable blood pressure, which will result in more fluid energy throughout the day. When meal planning, it's important to begin with what you like! Whether you're a vegetarian or a meat-lover, it's crucial (and more fun) to enjoy what you're eating! Animal sources of protein are great - examples include lean beef, poultry, and fish- but you can actually get plenty of protein on a vegetarian diet as well.
