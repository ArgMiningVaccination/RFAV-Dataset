We go through it every year, but the scratchy throat, itchy eyes, and runny nose are still an unpleasant harbinger of spring. Some allergens are around us all the time in the form of dust mites, pet dander, or food sensitivities. Allergies trigger histamines, which are incredibly helpful for the body - they help the body get rid of something bothering you, like an allergy. They're part of the body's defense system and want to get rid of the stimulant, which is why you might sneeze, tear up, or itch. When your body is triggered by an allergen, your immune system signals mast cells in the skin, lungs, nose, mouth, gut, and blood to release histamines. The histamines boost blood flow in the affected area, causing inflammation and inviting other parts of the body's defense system to engage. Sometimes, the histamine response is dramatic and prolonged, such as when a tick bite triggers an Alpha Gal response and an allergic response to animal products. Acupuncture is one of the only techniques that can effectively reduce the severity of an Alpha-Gal response - there are no drugs, vaccines, or allergy shots available. Acupuncture Treatments with Affinity Acupuncture Acupuncture treatments can help with other environmental, seasonal, and food allergies also - by up to 80-95%. A simple protocol involves an exam, one visit, and one needle. We help identify the allergen, place a small needle in the ear for several weeks, and then allergens can be carefully and systematically reintroduced. For allergies severe enough to anaphylactic shock - the goal is not to intentionally reintroduce, but to lessen the severity of response if the body is exposed to the allergen. If you're interested in finding out if you're a good candidate for acupuncture to help relieve your allergy symptoms, call 615-939-2787 today, or [click on this link.](https://www.affinityacupuncture.com/acupuncture-nashville/) Contact [Affinity Acupuncture](https://www.affinityacupuncture.com/contact-us/) for [Nashville Acupuncture](https://www.affinityacupuncture.com/) treatments and techniques.
