Mandatory Minimum Investment of Trust Fund Proceeds for Vaccine Research and Development ......................................... 2239 CONCLUSION ................................................................................................. 2241 The United States is in the midst of a vaccine crisis. States utilize their police power to establish vaccine mandates , but the federal government\u2014via the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (\"Vaccine Act\")\u2014maintains responsibility for incentivizing vaccine innovation, ensuring a stable vaccine market, and affording compensation for vaccine-related injuries. Although the Vaccine Act may have been the cure for the vaccine woes of the 1980s, the law has failed to keep pace with technolog ical advancements and evolving public policy concerns. As was the case during the 1980s, today's vaccine market is highly consolidated and the public depends on one or two manufacturers for most childhood vaccines. This has led to vaccine shortages and a lack of competition in vaccine design. Rather than incentivizing timely adjustments to vaccine formulas, the Vaccine Act's broad legal immunities for vaccine manufacturers have created a regulatory vacuum whereby manufacturers are not obligated to incorporate scientific developments into marketed vaccines. Furthermore, the Act's complex compensation mechanism has failed to resolve vaccine-injury claims fairly and expeditiously. Meanwhile, declining public trust in government and industry fuels vaccine hesitancy and creates population health challenges for public health officials. Recalibrating vaccination laws can help remedy these imbalances. While the Vaccine Act may not be a primary cause of vaccine hesitancy, amendments to the law can be part of the solution. Grounded in a comprehensive analysis of the historical context preceding the enactment of the Vaccine Act, this Article details how statutory levers can address modern-day concerns in vaccine policy and provides draft legislation that furthers the Vaccine Act's public health, compensation, and market stabilization goals. Using law as a means of furthering the public health and building public trust in vaccines, the proposals focus on increasing sa fety and efficacy research, adjusting preemption provisions, and expanding the safety net for vaccine-related injuries. I NTRODUCTION Just as the health benefits of vaccines cannot be questioned seriously, neither can the shortcomings of the legal framework governing immunizations be ignored. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (\"Vaccine Act\")\u2014 the federal regime governing vaccine innovation, the vaccine market, and compensation for vaccine-related injuries \u2014was established over three decades ago, at a time when there were fewer vaccine doses and vaccine-preventable diseases, 1 electronic health records and health information technology were in 1For children eighteen and younger, in 1986 there were seven vaccine-preventable diseases and eleven total doses, while in 2017 there are sixteen vaccin e-preventable diseases and fifty-two total doses.

Manufacturers enjoy robust immunity from tort claims for vaccine-related injuries. 5 However, once a vaccine is approved and made available to the public, a manufacturer does not have a statutory obligation to actively collect and analyze safety and efficacy data, nor are manufacturers obligated to update vaccine formulas in light of new scientific advancements. 6 RECOMMENDED SCHEDULE FOR ACTIVE IMMUNIZATION OF NORMAL INFANTS AND CHILDREN 1 (1983) [hereinafter 1983 CDC VACCINE SCHEDULE ], with U.S. CTRS.

As has been the case with many public health laws, the Vaccine Act was born amidst a crisis. According to congressional debates from the 1980s, the two key aspects of the crisis were vaccine manufacturers leaving the market because of litigation risk stemming from vaccine-related injuries and uncompensated vaccine-related injuries stemming from the legal roadblocks that injured plaintiffs faced. 7 To address these concerns, the Vaccine Act established a compensation program for vaccine-rela ted injuries and granted manufacturers broad legal immunities that significantly mitigate the risks from vaccine-related litigation. 8 The legal immunities include preemption of state tort claims\u2014most notably, claims alleging design defects and warning defects.9 As a comprehensive report succinctly concluded, however, \"[m]any of the [Vaccine Act's] promises have gone unfulfilled.\"10 Although lawmakers indicated their goal was to help injured children by providing a \"no fault\" compensation scheme for vaccine-related injuries, the program \"has simply failed to offer compensation as consistently, as quickly, as easily, or as simply as its proponents had predicted.\" 11 Over the past decade, there has been increased criticism regarding \"the adversarial nature\" of the compensation program, the massive surplus in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund (\"Trust Fund\"), and the slow pace of li sting on-table vaccine-related injuries; yet, no amendments to the Vaccine Act have materialized. 12 As health policy 7Id. at 227-28 (majority opinion).

On-table injuries are injuries that federal regulators have previously determined are caused by a vaccine. 15 To receive compensation for an off-table in jury, however, a petitioner must prove that a vaccine caused their injury.16 While in theory this may seem like a reasonable requirement, in practice it creates a nearly insurmountable burden for petitioners. Prior to enactment of the Vaccine Act, the Institute of Medicine (\"IOM\") warned that the \"difficulty of proving or disproving a causal relationship between a given vaccine and a particular injury suggests that . . . outcomes will depend on who is required to carry the burden of proof.\" 17 Following the Vaccine Act's enactment, the Federa l Circuit candidly remarked that demonstrating causation for off-table in juries requires \"h eavy lifting\" on a petitioner's part, and \"it is not surprising that petitioners have a difficult time proving off-table cases.\" 18 Speaking in the context of on-/off-table injuries, even the Chief Special Master of the vaccine injury compensation program \"chastised the government for 'alter[ing] the game so that it's clearly in their favor.'\"19 Notwithstanding the extensive challenge s in demonstrating an off-table vaccine injury, between 1999 and 2016 six vaccines were added to the vaccine table, none of which had an on-table injury.20 Moreover, the table has been CLAIMS QUICKLY AND EASILY 2-3 (1999) (criticizing pro cedures associated with compensation fund for being too slow). 13Mello, supra note 7, at 34. 14See Claire Laurier Decoteau & Kelly Underman, Adjudicating Non-Knowledge Proceedings , 45 S OC.

In 1999, off-t able petitions comprised 25 % of all claims; by 2005 and 2014, the figures were 59% and 98%, respectively.23 Although the Vaccine Injury Table was recently expanded in light of findings from a 2012 IOM study, 24 several fundamental issues remain. Of the 158 potential vaccine-related adverse events that the IOM examined, the committee rejected causality in five (3.2%) cases, accepted causality in four (2.5%) cases, and found that the evidence convincingly supports causality in fourteen (8.9%) cases; notably, the committee concluded that more data were needed to evaluate causality for 135 (85.4%) of the identified adverse events. 25 Yet, the Vaccine Act does not mandate that data integral to evaluating causation be collected by manufacturers, submitted to regulators, or made available to the public. 26 As experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") and Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") note, \"[no] vaccine is perfectly safe or effective,\" and risk-benef it analysis for each vaccine is \"a dynamic process\" that requires continuous monitoring. 27 This is particularly true for vaccine-related injuries that are rare, materialize over time, or manifest only if a vaccine is combined with other medical treatments or at 42 C.F.R. pt. 100).

As CDC and FDA officials explain, however, \"no active effort is made to search for, identify and collect information [on vaccine adverse events], but rather information is passi vely received from those who choose to voluntarily report their experience.\" 29 Although \"Congress assumed that better evidence regarding harms caused by vaccines would develop over time,\" this assumption has not manifested due to serious limitations in vaccine adverse event collection and analysis. 30 In turn, the extent of vaccine risks is not entirely known, and it is immensely difficult to succeed on a claim alleging an off-table injury. Furt hermore, whereas Congress intended for vaccine-injury compensation claims to be handled \"quickly, easily and with certainty and generosity,\"31 several special masters32 have indicated that the government is \"'over-litigating' and 'behaving like an adversary,' contrary to the intent of the program.\" 33 The average petition takes more time to adjudicate than the average tort or medical malpractice case.34 Moreover, in some cases where a petitioner successfully proved that a vaccine caused an injury, the government threatened to appeal the matter if the petitioner did not agree to keep the decision confidential. This quid pro quo served to prevent disclosure of evidence that could be used in other cases. 35 In practical terms, this has resulted in a large decrease in the percentage of compensation awards and a large increase in the time, cost, and effort needed to 281985 IOM R EPORT , supra note 17, at 65-68 (addressing challenges associated with determining accurate frequency of vaccine-related adverse events).

In one case, the govern ment argued that a fourteen-year-old girl who suffered vaccine-related \"profound mental retardation and severe spastic quadriplegia\" was not entitled to forty-dollar high-top tennis shoes; in another, the government disputed whether a ten-year-old girl who was crippled by a vaccine was entitled to eight hours per day of a nurse assistant\u2014the government urged the special master to grant only five hours. 39 According to Congressman Henry Waxman, a sponsor of the Vaccine Act, the Trust Fund was not intended to be a moneymaker, but rather was created to \"err on the side of compensating the victim.\" 40 Taken together, there are important ques tions as to whether the Vaccine Act adequately encourages research into vaccine safety and efficacy, and whether the law affords children who suffer vaccine-related injuries appropriate remedies. Questions also remain as to whether the Vaccine Act has incentivized competition in the vaccine market. In 1982, for the three recommended childhood vaccines\u2014polio; measles, mumps, and rubella (\"MMR\"); and diptheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine (\"DTP\")\u2014there was one manufacturer for polio and MMR, and three for DTP. 41 By 1985, litigation risk drove two of the DTP manufacturers out of the market, leading to higher costs and a temporary shortage. 42 Though one of the DTP manufacturers returned, lawmakers argued that the Vaccine Act wa s necessary to incentivize competition and avoid the risks of a consolidated market, such as unstable supply, vaccine shortages, higher costs, and stunted research and development. 43 36Id.

Between 1986 and 2014, the cost to vaccinate a child rose from $100 to $2192.47 Of the childhood vaccines marketed in the United States in 2017, eleven vaccines have one manufacturer and ei ght vaccines have two manufacturers.48 As was the case prior to the Vaccine Act, today's vaccine supply is largely dependent on a very small number of manufacturers, and market consolidation remains a factor that threatens public health. 49 The Vaccine Act's legal protections for manufacturers are sufficient to ensure that litigation risk is unlikely to be a factor that drives a company out of the market. However, the consolidated market also means that companies have little to no competition, and thus little incentive to allocate resources to improve their products, particularly because federal law preempts design defect claims. 50 Moreover, manufacturers often have encountered disruptions in production or contamination of vaccine lots, and vaccine shortages have resulted. Since 2000, the United States \"has experienced an u nprecedented series of shortages\" for thirteen vaccines, and none of the shortages was caused by litigation or fear of litigation. 51 Although the economic forces that have led to a consolidated market 44Engstrom, supra note 8, at 1716 n.394; Elisabeth Rosenthal, The Price of Prevention: Vaccine Costs Are Soaring , N.Y.

Yet, notwithstanding rising costs and frequent vaccine shortages, lawmakers have not stepped in to remedy the vaccine regime, let alone with the zeal exhibited three decades ago. Meanwhile, the past decade has witnessed intense public debate surrounding vaccine mandates and a rise in vaccine-hesitant parents. 53 While commentators often portray vaccine hesitant parents as ill-informed dilettantes clinging to unscientific Internet chatter or a deb unked study that linked vaccines and autism, 54 there is much more to the story. One recent study found that thirteen percent of parents believe that vaccines are most likely a cause of autism (a claim for which there is no scientific evidence), 55 yet other studies have found that more than seventy-five percent of parents have concerns with vaccine safety and that four percent of pediatricians have refused a vaccine for their own child. 56 AMERICA 'S FIRST POLIO VACCINE LED TO A GROWING VACCINE CRISIS xii (2005) (\"Since 1998, there have been severe shortages of nine of the twelve vaccines routinely given to young children.\"); Evans, supra note 4, at S134 (asserting that re cent vaccine shortages are not due to liability concerns); Ridley et al., supra note 48, at 235-38 (examining how price fluctuations impact vaccine supplies).

Politics aside, declining public trust in government creates massive hurdles for public health officials. 62 The question of whether vaccine laws need recalibration commands serious attention. Although there are significant public health implications in reduced vaccination rates\u2014concerns that do not remain within state borders\u2014the Vaccine Act does little to address the core reasons underlying vaccine hesitancy. To be sure, the unique federal-state dynamic surrounding immunization laws further complicates the inquiry. Each state uses its police power to establish vaccine mandates, yet federal law affords vaccine manufacturers preemption from state tort claims for vaccine-related injuries. At the same time, the Vaccine Act's mandate is to \"achieve optimal prevention of human infectious diseases through immunization and to achieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions to vaccines.\" 63 In this hybrid model, the state mandates that citizens engage in conduct that the state has determined is necessary for the public health and welfare, but the federal government maintains integral public health goals and precludes state tort claims should an injury occur from the state-mandated action. Few areas of the law are analogous. 64 Notwithstanding the imminent need to address vaccine-related issues, there are frequent and consistent roadblocks to debating the limitations of immunization law and policy. In the face of challenges to vaccine orthodoxy, scholars, commentators, and public hea lth officials are quick to characterize dissent as mere propaganda of \"anti-vaxxers.\" 65 Even suggestions for reform 61El Amin et al., supra note 58, at 14; see generally Michelle M. Mello et al., Pharmaceutical Companies' Role in State Vacc ination Policymaking: The Case of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination , 102 A M. J. PUB. HEALTH 893 (2012) (examining Merck's role in shaping vaccine policy). 62This impact is exacerbated by the hyper-politicization of health care and health law, which has spillover effects in the context of vaccine mandates and may exacerbate the perceived risks of vaccines. See, e.g. , E ULA BISS, ON IMMUNITY 37 (2014); Diekema, supra note 56, at 1428. The ubiquity of social me dia compounds these concer ns, as theories of vaccine safety can spread quickly prior to scientific inquiry. See Douglas J.

ENGINEERING ETHICS 143, 152 (2015). 2017] RECALIBRATING VACCINATION LAWS 2165 have led to ad hominem attacks.66 If the mere questioning of vaccine law or policy leads to stereotyping as an anti-vaxxer,67 rather than an y serious inquiry into the underlying issues, there can be little room for intelligent debate regarding the merits and demerits of the current regime. Focusing contemporary vaccine policy debate on anti-va xxer rhetoric detracts from adequate consideration of important vaccine-related issues. Although the shortcomings of the Vaccine Act may not be a primary cause of vaccine hesitancy, 68 addressing the shortcomings can be part of the solution. However, rather than exploring the use of legal levers to adjust aspects of the Vaccine Act, hard paternalism has be en the typical response to vaccine hesitancy. This has included more stringent enforcement of vaccine mandates, 69 elimination of non-medical exemptions to vaccine mandates,70 and deprivation of rights and welfare benefits for th e families of vaccine-hesitant parents.71 Often lacking from the policy response is a mean ingful examination into the reasons for diminishing public trust in vaccine safety, and whether amendments to the legal and regulatory framework can help make vaccines safer or more effective\u2014something that might help rebu ild public trust. While the government should be mindful not to allocate undue resources to combating junk science, the public health can benefit from additional scientific inquiries into vaccine safety and efficacy, particularly becaus e of the known limita tions of premarket review and post-market surveillance, and the fact that legal immunities fail to incentivize incorporation of scientific innovations into vaccine design. 72 Given the complexity of the vaccine regime, recalibrating vaccine laws requires an analysis that goes beyond the headlines. In this Article, I explain how adjusting levers in the Vaccine Act can help fill compensation and scientific innovation gaps while maintaining legal immunities for vaccine manufacturers. Bridging scholarship in law, medicine, bioethics, and public health, this Article also provides draft legislation that can be utilized by lawmakers, public health 66See, e.g. , Watkins, supra note 55 (discussing how politicians and other public figures, who simply question aspects of vaccine policy, have been s ubject to swift criticism). 67See, e.g. , id.

The proposals include: (1) adjusting the requirem ents for adverse event reporting and post-market analysis of vaccine safety and efficacy , (2) predicating limited liability for vaccine manufacturers on compliance with post-market analysis requirements, (3) exempting design defect claims from the preemption provision of the Vaccine Act in cases of negligent failure to utilize a safer alternative design, (4) restructuring the burden of proof for claims alle ging off-table vaccine-related injuries, and (5) mandatory minimum investment of Trust Fund proceeds for vaccine research and development. At its core, this Article is a law reform piece that draws on a thorough historical investigation of the nuanced legal and political developments leading up to th e enactment of the Vaccine Act. The non- partisan proposals in this Article endeavor to promote the public health goals of immunizations by aligning the interests of patients, public health officials, and vaccine manufacturers, and in doing so, aim to build and maintain public trust in vaccinations. I. P LACING THE VACCINE ACT IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT The common narrative is that the Vaccine Act was necessary to provide adequate remedies for injured plaintiffs and to ensure a stable vaccine supply because litigation risk was driving manufacturers out of the vaccine market. 73 Although this depiction is not false, a more accurate description considers the broader legal, political, and public health issues preceding the enactment of the Vaccine Act. Contemporary vaccine debates largely have failed to place the Vaccine Act in accurate historical context, notwithstanding the benefits that may be gained from serious reflection on the development of doctrinal nuances and evolving public health challenges. I focus my historical framing using a tripartite analysis. First, I explore the issue of manufacturer liability for vaccine-related injuries. From the 1950s through the 1980s, courts across the country were mixed on several key issues such as: (1) the contours surrounding the causation elements of a negligence claim; (2) the availability of products liability causes of action for manufacturing, warning, and design defects; and (3) whether market share liability should apply to vaccine-related injuries. Second, I explain how vaccine-injury litigation following the 1976 swine flu immunization program caused the federal government to be cautious about assuming financial responsibility for compensating vaccine-related injuries, and how the swine flu program led manufacturers to demand indemnification from the government for all vaccine-related injuries. Third, I unpack the 1980s-era perfect storm of dissent created by patient advocacy groups, think tanks, and industry lobbyists, whereby the FDA was portrayed as an unnecessary bureaucratic hindrance to access to 73See, e.g. , HEALTH RES. & SERVS .

During this period, lawmakers and the public questioned the value of federal regulation of medical products, which provided ample fuel to the Reagan Administration's deregulatory agenda. Understanding this multi-faceted histor ical framework not only helps place the Vaccine Act in context, it provides important insights into whether, and to what extent, the Vaccine Act should be amended to account for contemporary issues and trends in vaccine innovation, vaccine-related injuries, and public health policy. A. Manufacturer's Liability for Vaccine-Related Injuries 1. The Cutter Incident and Vaccine-Induced Polio Lawsuits against manufacturers for vacc ine-related injuries were extremely rare during the first half of the twentieth century. 74 That would change after 1955, the first year that Jonas Salk's polio vaccine became commercially available in the United States. 75 Cutter Laboratories\u2014one of the five manufacturers licensed to produce the vaccine\u2014employed an unsatisfactory 74After considerable research, I could locat e only two published opinions prior to 1955 where a vaccine manufacturer was named as a defendant in a case alleging a vaccine-related injury. Carmen v. Eli Lilly & Co., 32 N.E.2d 729, 732 (Ind. App. 1941) (finding for manufacturer because plaintiff was warned of risk of death from vaccin e); Tremaine v. H.K. Mulford Co., 176 A. 212, 214 (Pa. 1935) (finding for manufacturer because plaintiff did not demonstrate vaccine caused his injury). Notwithstanding the dearth of cases against vaccine manufacturers, throughout the first half of the twentieth century, it was not uncommon for employers to provide vaccination programs fo r their employees (sometimes pursuant to a program initiated by a state or local public health aut hority); individuals who suffered vaccine-related injuries under such program s sometimes brought claims for compensation against their employer, their insurance company, or both. See, e.g. , Jefferson Printing Co. v. Indus. Comm'n, 144 N.E. 356, 357 (Ill. 1924); Neudeck v. Ford Motor Co., 229 N.W. 438, 439 (Mich. 1930); Krout v. J.L. Hudson Co., 166 N.W. 848, 848 (Mich. 1918); Alewine v. Tobin Quarries, 33 S.E.2d 81, 82 (S.C. 1945); Te xas Emp'rs' Ins. Ass'n v. Mitchell, 27 S.W.2d 600, 601 (Tex. Civ. App. 1930). The case s typically proceeded under state workers' compensation laws, with plaintiffs alleging th e vaccine-related injuries were employment- related. In many cases, compensation was awarded if the vaccination program was not conducted pursuant to an immunization mandate fro m a public health authority, since courts deemed the vaccination programs to be employment-related. See, e.g. , S.W.2d at 603. However, when employers conducted or sponsored immunization programs pursuant to a request or mandate from a public health authority, compensation typica lly was unavailable on the grounds that the program was not employment-related but, rather, related to the public health goals as set forth by a governing public authority.

For example, in a consolidated action surrounding oral polio vaccine (\"OPV\") and Lederle Laboratories, plaintiffs alleged that DBS vi olated regulations governing vaccine production by: (1) issuing a product license to Lederle on the basis of inadequate epidemiological data and laboratory test results whic h demonstrated that Lederle's original strains and seeds were not sufficiently safe, (2) approving for us e and/or not retesting the seeds from which the doses injuring them were derived and (3 ) approving for release the specific lots containing the injurious doses. In re Sabin Oral Polio Vaccine Prods. Liab. Litig., 743 F. Supp. 410, 413 (D. Md. 1990). The court dismissed the case in part, finding that DBS's issuance of the license constituted a \"discretionary function\" under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and thus the court was precluded from reviewing DBS's decision. Id. at 414-16.

As the court noted, the vaccine label contained \"a clear disclaimer as to the efficacy of the vaccine, but th at is not an issue here. Plaintiffs do not claim that the vaccine failed to protect them against poliomyelitis. They do assert that the vaccine itself caused the disease.\" 92 The court rejected Cutter's position that the disclaimer on the vaccine bottle was sufficient to negate plaintiff's allegations that Cutter breached implied warranties of merchantability and fitness. Specifically, the court found th at the argument carries \"little weight where, as here, the warranty is limited to an assurance that the product will not actively cause the very disease it was designed to prevent.\" 93 At the same time, however, the court theorized that Cutter' s argument \"might have merit if the warranty involved had to do with the mere failure of a medicine to cure or of a vaccine to prevent.\" 94 In drawing this line, the court distinguished a claim related to a vaccine-induced adverse event from one related to the failure of a vaccine to confer immunity, allowing damages for the former but suggesting that the latter may not be actionable. 95 The court also addressed the policy impact of its decision, noting that Cutter \"strongly argues that public policy will best be served by denying recovery in warranty for 'new' drugs. The argument is that development of medicines will be retarded if manufacturers are held to strict liability for their defects.\" 96 The court rejected this contention, indicati ng that the California legislature was aware of the issue but decide d not to incorporate an exception to strict liability for vaccine-related injuries.97 The Cutter Incident, as this tragic episode would later be known,98 is important for several reasons. First, Gottsdanker set a precedent that manufacturers may be liable for vaccine-induced diseases. Insofar as all five manufactures of the polio vaccine had difficultly inactivating the polio virus, 91Id. at 323. In finding that a relaxed privity requirement was appropri ate, the court cited to Vaccarezza v. Sanguinetti , 163 P.2d 470 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1945). In Vaccarezza , a mother and her two children suffered food poisoning after eating c ontaminated salami. Id. at 472. Even though the salami was purchased at a reta il market, the plaintiffs successfully sued the salami manufacturer. Id. 92Gottsdanker , 6 policy requ ires extension of this exception to biologics generally, or to polio vaccine specifically, the argumen t properly is one for the Legislature.\"). 98See generally OFFIT, supra note 51. 2017] RECALIBRATING VACCINATION LAWS 2171 this was a significant holding that led to several settlements in analogous cases.99 Second, the California court opened the door to strict liability claims for vaccine-related adverse events. Although the facts in Gottsdanker were limited to a vaccine-induced disease, the court did not preclude extension of its reasoning to other vaccine-related adverse events. Indeed, the court's distinction between a vaccine-induced disease and the failure to confer immunity may be characterized as a demarcation between vaccine safe ty and vaccine efficacy\u2014with liability attaching to the former but not the latter. Third, following the Cutter Incident, a congressional committee found that the National Institutes of Health (\"NIH\") Laboratory of Biologics Control\u2014the government entity responsible for certifying the Cutter poli o vaccine\u2014received advance warning of the problems with the Cutter vaccine but failed to take appropriate measures to address them. 100 The congressional committee's findings underscored the importance of robust regulatory oversight in the licensing, production, and distribution of vaccines, and the negative impact on public health that may flow from insufficient oversight. Fourth, the court squarely rejected Cutter's argument regarding the policy impact of legal liability on vaccine innovation. 101 Indeed, one year after the lawsuits, Cutter executives boasted of the company's \"financial soundness,\" and by 1962 co mpany assets were \"80% greater than when the polio disaster had occurred.\"102 As is often the case following a public health catastrophe, the Cutter Incident motivated action from public officials and regulators. Within days of the Cutter Incident, the Surgeon General recommended th at all polio vaccinations be halted \"pending inspection of each manufacturing facility and thorough review of the procedures for testing vaccine safety.\" 103 Shortly thereafter, \"every senior US government employee involved in the Cutter incident lost his or her job, right up to the director of the [NIH] and the secretary for health, education, and welfare.\" 104 In addition, the NIH Laboratory of Biologics Control \"was raised to 99See, e.g. , id. at , CENTURY 6 Cal.

In the 1970s, Cutter Laboratories was purchased by the German pharmaceutical firm, Bayer. History of Bayer, 1974-1988 , B AYER , ACTION COALITION , explains, \"[i]ronically the Cutter Incident\u2014by creating the perception among scientists and the public that Salk's vaccine was dangerous\u2014led in part to the development of a polio vaccine [OPV] that was more dangerous.\" O FFIT, supra note 51, at 124. 104Meredith Wadman, Germ Warfare: The Battle for the Key to Modern Vaccines , GUARDIAN (Feb. 2, 2017, 1:00 118. 2172 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 97:2153 division status within NIH,\" a move that permitted expanded oversight of vaccines.105 Thereafter, Congress enacted the Polio Vaccination Assistance Act of 1955.106 This Act provided grants to states for creating immunization programs and purchasing and distributing polio vaccines.107 The public, however, was alarmed by the Cutter Incident and hesitant to receive polio vaccines.108 At the same time, the government feared a shortage would ensue because of virus inactivation challenges faced by vaccine manufacturers. 109 As the chief of the Public Health Service's Bureau of State Services stated, the new program afforded \"the public health profession . . . the opportunity and obligation to achieve widespread acceptance and use\" of the newly marketed polio vaccine. 110 Notwithstanding the importance of Gottsdanker and the public health measures implemented in the wake of the Cutter Incident, courts in most states disagreed with the California court's holding . For example, many courts denied vaccine-injury claims, concluding that privity of contract did not exist because the injured patient did not buy the vaccine directly from the manufacturer. 111 This legal loophole insulated vaccine manufacturers and made compensation for vaccine-related injuries nearly impo ssible in many states. Indeed, the Gottsdanker court noted that, as of 1960, a relaxed privity requirement was the \"minority rule\" that was \"followed in some 15 to 18 states.\" 112 Consequently, many individuals who died, became paralyzed, or otherwise suffered vaccine-related injuries had no legal recour se against the vaccine manufacturer. 2. Cancer and SV40 Contaminated Polio Vaccines The Cutter Incident was linked to fo rty thousand cases of vaccine-induced polio, but in its wake a new polio-vaccine-related scare was unfolding. Between 1955 and 1963, over ninety-eight million Americans were inoculated with a polio vaccine that was potentially contaminated with simian virus 40 (\"SV40\"), 113 a virus that has been found in certain types of cancer such as 105IMMUNIZATION ACTION COALITION , supra note 103. 106See Otis L.

Although regulators required vaccine lots produced after 1961 to be SV40-free, they did not recall lots produced prior to that date.118 This was despite the fact that, at least as early as 1962, studies had found SV40 to be \"oncogenic in rodents and capable of transforming human cells in vitro .\" 119 Since regulators did not recall the potentially contaminated lots, \"vaccine -related human exposure to SV40 may have continued until 1963.\"120 At the same time, however, experts do not know how many individuals who received SV40- contamined vaccines actually were infected with SV40.121 Moreover, because SV40 can be transmitted human-to- human, experts posited that the virus was likely to have spread substantially.122 vaccine lots administered to millions of US residents between 1955 and 1963 was contaminated with small amounts of infectious simian virus 40 (SV40), a polyomavirus of the rhesus macaque.\").

It is not clear why there was such a long delay, though it may be attributed to factors such as the latency period in developing an SV40-associated disease and the lack of conclusive evidence that SV40 causes cancer in humans. The enactment of the Vaccine Act further complicated litigation surrounding SV40-contaminated vaccines, because it does not apply to claims if the vaccine-related injury occurred more than eight years prior to the statute's enactment. 130 At the same time, however, for more than twenty-five years prior to the enactment of the Vacc ine Act, patients, manufacturers, and the government feared the fa r-reaching consequences should SV40 contaminated vaccines be causally linked to cancer in humans.131 For these reasons, potential litigation surrounding SV40 contaminated vaccines was an important consideration when the Vaccine Act was debated and enacted. In many respects, the legal concerns mirrored those of the vaccine-induced polio cases. A review of SV40-related litigation is illustrative. Plaintiffs struggled with identification issues (namely, identifying which manufacturer supplied their vaccine) and causation issues (whether SV40 causes cancer, and, if so, whether SV40 caused the plaintiff's cancer). Plaintiffs in SV40 cases also questioned whether the government could be held liable for allowing SV40-contaminated vaccines to remain on the ma rket or for failing to exercise due care in the oversight of vaccine production. In Asker v. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , 132 a California appellate court considered Alan Asker's claim that an SV40-contaminated polio vaccine was a substantial factor in his developing mesothelioma. 133 The complaint alleged that SV40 was found in his tumor, and Asker's only known exposure to SV40 was a polio vaccine he was admini stered in the early 1960s. 134 Asker alleged that defendants' \"selection of monkey kidney tissue for the growth and harvest of polio virus was based on, inter alia , monetary gain, ease of kidney removal and a ready supply, rather than science or public safety,\" and that the vaccine had a \"failure rate\" of sevent y-five percent or more. http://fortune.com/2016/03/29/robert-de- niro-anti-vaccine-documentary/ [https:// Cal. 1987). note 104 (\"Tens of millions of Amer ican children had already received contaminated injections, and while the jury wa s still out on the tainted vaccine's long-term health consequences, the risks were of great concern to regulators in the US and further afield.\"). 132No. A112658, 2007 WL 61912, at *1 (Cal.

American Home Products, Inc. , Lindsay Rivard received four oral live-virus polio vaccines during the 1990s, and upon her death scientists found SV40 in her tumor cells. 143 The vaccine administered to Rivard was developed using the original Sabin strain, which was known to be contaminated with SV40. 144 Although federal regulations permitted use of the Sabin strain, notwithstanding the fact th at the FDA knew the strain contained SV40, the regulations also required that vaccine manufacturers utilize a neutralization process to rid the vaccine of SV40. 145 At issue was whether the 136Id. at *1. 137Id. 138Id. 139Id. at *3. 140Id. at *1.

The trial court disagreed, finding that the Vaccine Act exempted the administrative process claim requirement where a \"vaccine-related injury or death\" is \"associated with an adulterant or contaminant intentionally added to such a vaccine.\" 147 As the trial court reasoned, by using the original Sabin strain, which the manufacturer knew was likely to contain SV40, the manufacturer intentionally added SV40 to the vaccine that was administered to the young girl. A New Jersey appellate court disagreed. Attempting to neutralize SV40, the court held, is evidence that the manufactur er tried to remove the contaminant; even assuming arguendo that the manufacturer employed a deficient neutralization process or was negligent in carrying out the neutralization, the manufacturer did not intentionally place SV40 into the vaccine. 148 Therefore, the court inferred, \"[t]he possible inclusion of SV40 within the monkey tissue can be considered a risk the FDA was willing to assume in order to produce the vaccine.\" 149 Five years after Asker and Rivard , the New Jersey Supreme Court reviewed a case wherein Jamie Gannon alleged that SV40-contaminated polio vaccines he was administered in the 1970s caused hi s brain cancer, which was diagnosed in 2000.150 Gannon brought claims in both state and federal courts.151 In the federal matter, Gannon alleged that the federal government was negligent in allowing the vaccine to be sold to the public because the government violated regulations by failing to confirm the absence of SV40 at various production stages. 152 Although the federal court did not find that the matter was barred by the Federal Tort Claims Act or the Vaccine Act, the court held that Gannon failed to provide facts from which a reasonable fact finder could determine that SV40 causes cancer in humans, or that SV40 caused his brain cancer. 153 146Id. at 292.

They also represent a subset of vaccine-related injury claims that was contemplated by Gottsdanker \u2014namely, an adverse health condi tion other than a vaccine-induced disease that the vaccine was intended to protect against. 3. Products Liability Claims for Vaccine-Related Injuries The 1960s marked the beginning of a \"nationwide trend toward strict products liability.\" 154 Unlike with negligence claims, under products liability a manufacturer can be held \"strictly liable in tort when an article he places on the market, knowing that it is to be used without inspection for defects, proves to have a defect that causes injury to a human being.\" 155 Over the years, products liability claims have been subcategorized into manufacturing defects, design defects, and warning defects, 156 though the extent of liability under each type of claim varies considerably according to state law. Notwithstanding divergent legal remedies throughout the United States, several cases involving vaccine-related injuries have included products liability claims. Some of the earliest such cases stem from polio vaccine-related injuries. Jonas Salk's inactivated polio vaccine (\"IPV\") was derived from a strain of the polio virus that had been \"killed.\" 157 The Sabin oral polio vaccine (\"OPV\") entered the market in 1960, five years after IPV.158 Unlike IPV, \"OPV is produced from a live [polio] virus attenuated but not killed during the development process.\" 159 In simple terms, those vaccinated with OPV are \"[p]laintiffs also have failed to demonstrat e by a preponderance of the evidence that SV40 caused Mr. Gannon's medulloblastoma\"). The Third Circuit affirmed. Gannon v. United States, 292 F. App'x 170, 175 (3d Cir. 2008). In the parallel state cour t action, Gannon brought products liability claims against four vaccine manufacturers that sold polio vaccines at the time that Gannon recei ved his immunizations. Gannon , 48 A.3d at 1095-96. The state trial court granted summary judgment for defendants, finding that plaintiff lacked sufficient evidence to prove which defendant produced the vaccines that he was administered; the court also held that Gannon was collaterally estopped from bringing the state claims because of the decision in the federal case. Id. Thereafter, a state appellate court reversed both aspects of the trial court's decision, and remanded the case for additional discovery and a trial. Id. (citing Gannon v. Am.

Since the court's ruling on collateral estoppel was sufficient to uphold the state trial court's decision to terminate the litigation, the court did not consider the issue of defendant identification.

Thus, a person vaccinated with OPV, or a person who comes into close contac t with the vaccine's virus (usually by exposure to the vaccinated person) may develop polio.\" 165 During the early 1960s, after balancing the risks and benefits of the two options, public health officials selected OPV \"as the vaccine of choice for mass immunization.\" 166 Shortly after the decision, cases of OPV vaccine-induced polio began to emerge, and in 1964 the Public Health Service convened a special 160As its name suggests, OPV is administered orally; IPV is administered via injection. See generally WORLD HEALTH ORG., ORAL POLIOMYELITIS VACCINE : QUESTIONS & ANSWERS (July 218 Cal. Rptr. 453, 455 (Cal. Ct. App. 1985). For an overview of the deliberations, see O FFIT, supra note 51, at 124-31. Up to th e enactment of the Vaccine Act, OPV continued to be the CDC-recomme nded vaccine for preventing polio, though the CDC changed its position in 1999. W ORLD HEALTH ORG., supra note 160. Because OPV utilizes an attenuated polio virus, a small percentage of those inoculated with OPV will contract polio. According to the World Health Organization, of every 2.5 million doses of OPV, one will lead to polio. Id. Although this is a miniscule risk, it played a role in the CDC's 1999 decision to recommend elimina ting OPV from the United States, and using IPV in its stead. See U.S. CTRS. FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION , Poliomyelitis Prevention in the United States , MORBIDITY & MORTALITY WKLY. REP., Jan. 24, 1997, at 2. While the CDC's decision meant that, in the United States, only Salk's inactivated polio vaccine would be administered, OPV continues to be used in many parts of the world and American manufacturers supply many countries with OPV. As of 2017, OPV is the leading cause of polio worldwide. See Jason Beaubien, Mutant Strains of Polio Vaccine Now Cause More Paralysis Than Wild Polio , NPR (June 28, of vaccine- derived polio [in 2017]\"). 2180 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 97:2153 advisory committee to examine the issue.167 The committee confirmed that OPV was the cause-in-fact for several cases of polio, but \"emphasized the need to continue mass immunization at full speed.\" 168 Meanwhile, cases of vaccine- induced polio continued. In some instances, injured patients sued the vaccine manufacturer. One notable case is Kearl v. Lederle Laboratories , 169 which was brought in a California state court. Shortly after receiving OPV, five-month old Elizabeth Kearl began to develop paralysis. 170 Kearl alleged design and warning defect claims against the vaccine manufacturer, and the jury awarded her $800,000 at trial. 171 On appeal, however, the verdict was set aside.172 As to the design defect claim, the California appellate court indicated that a plaintiff may demonstrate that a product was defectively designed in one of two ways: (1) \"the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect,\" or (2) if a plaintiff can show that the product's design proximately caused an injury, then the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the benefits of the product's design outweighed the inherent design risks. 173 The second category of design defect cl aims focuses on what are known as unavoidably unsafe products.174 The key question in a vaccine-related design defect claim is whether the vaccine's risks could have been avoided had the defendant used a different design that did not materially alter the vaccine's effectiveness. 175 The California appellate court considered the policy implications of holding vaccine manufacturers liable for design defects. According to the court, the availability of strict liability for design defect claims may \"substantially affect a 167Kearl , 218 Cal. Rptr. id. at 463-64. 175See id. at 464. Although manufacturing defect claims were not at issue in Kearl , other courts have examined such claims in the c ontext of vaccine-related injuries. A product has a manufacturing defect when it deviates \"from th e manufacturer's intended result or from other ostensibly identical units of the same produc t line.\" Morris v. Parke, Davis & Co., 667 Manufacturing defects result from \"error[s] in the production process.\" Id. (citing Finn v. G.D. Searle & Co., 677 P.2d 1147, 1163 (Cal. 1984) (Bird, C.J., dissenting)). A common example is a product that \"comes off the assembly line in a substandard condition.\" Id. at 1335-36 (citing Barker , 573 P.2d at 454). Unlike with design defect claims, the unavoidably- unsafe defense is inapplicable to manufacturing defect claims. As courts have noted, a product \"t hat has a manufacturing defect is, by definition, not 'unavoidably unsafe.'\" Id. at 1336. 2017] RECALIBRATING VACCINATION LAWS 2181 product's availability.\"176 Coupled with a \"problem of delayed release (or nonrelease),\" the court specul ated that the cost to insure against design defect claims would be prohibitively high, and thus would impact research and development of new products, particularly for smaller manufacturers. 177 High insurance costs, according to the court, would translate to higher prices, which \"might 'place the price of necessary [products] outside the reach of those who most need them.'\" 178 The court also noted that high costs \"might cause manufacturers to remove some products from the market, or decline to develop them.\" 179 Taken together, the court reasoned that \"with regard to some special products the scale may tip away from enhanced accountability,\" and thus \"some special products should be exempted from the normal strict products liability design defect analysis.\" 180 Vaccines, the court held, constitute one such product.181 Importantly, however, Kearl did not conclude that design defect claims were categorically precluded in cases alle ging vaccine-related injuries. Rather, although the court held that vaccine-related design defect claims should not be analyzed \"in the light of ordinary consum er expectations or present scientific knowledge,\" the court indicated that such claims \"should be reviewed according to the state of the art,\" which the court defined as \"the manufacturer's actual or constructive knowledge\u2014at the time of marketing.\" 182 According to the court, in practical terms this meant that \"some special products should be analyzed for design defects under a negligence standard, rather than a strict liability standard.\" 183 For example, Kearl highlighted a First Circuit case where a manufacturer produced two different oral contraceptives\u2014one contained fifty milligrams of estrogen while the other contained one hundred milligrams. 184 The manufacturer produced the one hundred milligram contraceptive despite the fact that scientific evidence showed that additional estrog en provided no additional efficacy but came with additional risks. 185 In the contraception case, the First Circuit \"held that . . . it was proper for the jury to have been instructed on a strict products liability design defects theory.\" 186 The Kearl court agreed with the First Circuit's analysis because, as it held, prescription drugs \"should not be exempt from strict 176Kearl , 218 Cal.

The Kearl court did not disagree with First Circuit's rationale, and in fact further noted that, in the contraceptive case, the plaintiff also could have prevailed had there been a negligence standard for design defects. 188 Thus, while Kearl acknowledged that the unavoidably unsafe product exemption for medical products was justified as a general matter, the court was careful to elucidate the contours of the exception. 189 Kearl took issue with the \"routine and mechanical fashion by which many appellate courts have concluded that certain products, particularly dr ugs, are entitled to such special treatment.\" 190 The court also noted that the \"analysis poses a mixed question of law and fact and can be made only after evidence is first taken, out of the jury's presence, on the relevant factors,\" 191 which include: (1) whether, when distri buted, the product was intended to confer an exceptionally important benefit that made its availability highly desirable; (2) whether the then-existing risk posed by the product was both \"substantial\" and \"unavoidable\"; and (3) whether the interest in availability . . . outweighs the interest in promoting enhanced accountability through strict lia bility design defect review. 192 As to the second factor, the court further explained that \"substantial\" risk involves an inquiry into whether \"the risk posed permanent or long-term disability . . . as opposed to mere temporary or insignificant inconvenience.\"193 In determining whether a risk is \"unavoidable,\" Kearl indicated that courts should examine (i) whether the product was designed to minimize\u2014to the extent scientifically knowable at the time it was distributed\u2014the risk inherent in the product, and (ii) the availability\u2014again, at the time of distribution\u2014of 187Id. at 462 (emphasis omitted). 188Id. 189Id. at 463. 190Id.

Lederle Laboratories ,196 likewise held that a plaintiff could bring a negligence claim for design defect against a vaccine manufacturer. 197 The Kearl and Toner opinions are notable not only for their analyses, but also for their timing\u2014the cases were pending as Congress debated the Vaccine Act, and thus the issues raised received considerable attention from lawmakers, the vaccine industry, and advocates. In addition to a design defect claim, the Kearl court also considered two instances that could give rise to a warning defect claim. The first involves cases where a dangerous aspect of a product can be avoided if the consumer \"is alerted to it and instructed how to avoid it.\" 198 The second includes cases where a \"product creates a danger that cannot be eliminated, but its utility is so great that it may be marketed without subjecting the manufacturer to liability, provided the user is made aware of the danger and is given the opportunity to make an informed decision whether to\" use the product notwithstanding the potential danger. 199 The second category of claims relates to warnings that are necessary for unavoidably unsafe products. This was the category of warning defect claims at issue in Kearl . 200 Although the court noted that it was \"the commonly assumed and often asserted proposition\" that warning defects \"may be a basis for imposition of strict liability,\" the court indicated that, as a practical matter, warning defect claims are reviewed pursuant to a negligence standard. 201 This is because, with warning defect claims, the core issu e is whether the warning reflects the defendant's actual or constructive knowledge of the product's risks.202 The focus on the defendant's conduct\u2014as opposed to the defendant's product\u2014is what renders the analysis one based on negligence. 203 The court then explained: \"Just as liability for failure to warn of product risk is based on negligence, the 194Id.

First, the case affirmed that vaccine-related adverse events are ac tionable under either negligence or products liability. Second, Kearl elucidated the contours under which design defect and warning defect claims could be brought for vaccine-related injuries. Third, the court underscored that, for a vaccine to be deemed unavoidably unsafe, the relevant inquiry involves an examination of what the manufacturer knew, or should have known, at the time it marketed the vaccine. As the court highlighted, in instances where a manufact urer could have used an alternative vaccine formula that was safer and no less effective, liability under a design defect theory is actionable. While the California state court in Kearl considered and dismissed the plaintiff's warning defect cl aims, the availability of warning defect claims was underscored decades earlier in cases fro m the Ninth and Fifth Circuits. In a landmark case from 1968\u2014 Davis v. Wyeth Laboratories, Inc. 207\u2014the Ninth Circuit held that a manufacturer has a duty to warn the patient, or to make adequate provisions for the health-care provider to warn the patient, as to vaccine risks. 208 In Davis , the plaintiff contracted polio after a pharmacist administered OPV in an immunization clinic.209 Neither the drug company nor the local public health officials conv eyed any risks to the pharmacist who administered OPV, and the pharmacist did not independently provide any warnings to the vaccinees. 210 The court held that, under Montana law, notwithstanding the fact that OPV was an unavoidably unsafe product and the 204Id. at 466 (citing Sterling Drug, Inc. v.

The manufacturer directly warned plai ntiff about the risk of contracting polio from OPV, described the availability of IP V, noted that IPV does not cause polio, and indicated that most experts favor OPV over IP V because they believe that OPV is more effective. The court did not give merit to plai ntiff's contention that the warning should have said OPV \"is the best way to get polio today, \" nor did the court find that the manufacturer should have indicated that the risk of contract ing polio from OPV was similar to the risk of contracting wild polio virus.

When, after further experience, the danger became apparent, a duty to warn attached.\" 213 The court recognized that the nature of medicine is evolving and that new data becomes available almost constantly. 214 On this point, the court noted that if newfound risks are \"trifling\" or \"de minimis,\" no duty to warn would arise.215 Although the court found that the chance of contracting po lio from OPV was small, the information was relevant to a patient's decision to accept the vaccine.216 The court also found that warning the distri butor was insufficient.217 Rather, the court held, \"it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to se e that warnings reach the consumer, either by giving warning itself or by obligating the purchaser to give warning.\" 218 In Davis , the manufacturer actually \"knew that warnings were not reaching the consumer.\"219 Specifically, the manufacturer assisted in the development and administration of the immunization program, and failed to convey any warnings to vaccinees. 220 Six years after Davis , the Fifth Circuit reached a similar conclusion. In Reyes v. Wyeth Laboratories, Inc. ,221 an eighteen-month-old infant contracted polio after receiving OPV, and the court ru led that the vaccine was unreasonably dangerous as marketed because of inadequate warnings.222 Although the nurse who administered the vaccine read the warnings provided by the manufacturer, the nurse did not convey those warnings to the child's mother. 223 Specifically, the nurse testified that it was not the office's practice to disclose warnings to patients or their families. 224 The court held that, notwithstanding the fact that OPV was unavoidably unsafe due to the chance that one who receives the 211Id. at 127-31. 212Id. at 129. 213Id. 214Id.

Vaccine-Related Injuries and Market Share Liability Market share liability aims to account for special situations where a plaintiff is harmed by the wrongful conduct of one or more defendants but is unable to identify which defendant caused the harm. Under such circumstances, the plaintiff seeks to hold several defendants responsible in relation to each defendant's market share for the injury-causing product. Although the concept of market share liability firs t appeared in the early 1970s, 232 in the context of FDA-regulated products the theory gained doctrinal traction in 1980 in response to the public health catastrophe surrounding diethylstilbestrol (\"DES\"), a drug that was prescribed to pregnant women to prevent miscarriages. 233 225Id. at 1273 (\"Although the living virus in the vaccine does not make the vaccine defective, it does make it what the Restatemen t calls an 'unavoidably unsafe product', one which cannot be made 'safe' no matter how carefully it is manufactured.\" (quoting RESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF TORTS \u00a7 402A cmt.

About two hundred manufacturers produced DES, and each utilized a \"mutually agreed upon\" formula. 235 DES manufacturers \"collaborated in marketing, promoting and testing the drug, relied upon each other's tests, and adhered to an industry-wide safety standard.\" 236 Moreover, \"it was customary for doctors to prescribe the drug by its generic rather than its brand name and . . . pharmacists filled prescriptions from whatever brand of the drug happened to be in stock.\"237 Given the unique properties of the DES market, plaintiffs typically could not specify which defendant supplied their DES, which meant that plaintiffs could not prove an integral component of their tort claims. 238 In turn, claims against DES manufacturers often were dismissed, and injured plaintiffs were left with no other legal remedies. 239 By some estimates, up to three million women ingested DES and \"[h]undreds, perhaps thousands,\" of children suffered from DES-related adverse health consequences. 240 Accordingly, the uncompensated harms were significant. It was in this context that market share liability entered the legal picture. In the landmark case Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories , the California Supreme Court ruled that market share liability was a viable legal option for harms caused by DES. 241 Sindell also set forth a general framework for market share liability that 234Sindell , 607 P.2d at 925. 235Id. at 926, 935. 236Id. at 926.

Id. at 928-36. The doctrines examined by the court included joint and several liability, concert of action, and enterprise liability. Id. An example of joint and several liability 2188 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 97:2153 applies when: (1) all defendants produce a drug from an identical formula and (2) the plaintiff\u2014through no fault of their own\u2014is unable to prove which manufacturer provided the harm-causing product. 242 Under these circumstances, the burden shifts to the defendants to provide exculpatory evidence.243 In the absence of such evidence, however, the defendants are liable for damages in proportion to their respective market share for the harm-causing product.244 The California court's decision was adopted by courts in some states (such as Illinois, New York, Washington, and Wisconsin) an d rejected by others (such as Iowa and Missouri). 245 Public policy considerations were a significant motivating factor underlying the application of market share liability in the DES cases. Specifically, the court reasoned that \" [t]he manufacturer is in the best position to discover and guard against defects in its products and to warn of harmful effects; thus, holding it liable for defects and failure to warn of harmful effects will provide an incentive to product safety.\" 246 As the California Supreme Court further detailed, \"[t]hese considerations are particularly signific ant where medication is involved, for the consumer is virtually helpless to protect himself from serious, sometimes permanent, sometimes fatal, injuries caused by deleterious drugs. \" 247 Given the is the famous case of Summers v.

First, the court found that joint and several liability was in applicable because, unlike in the classic case, the DES defendants were not in a better positio n to identify which of them supplied the DES that actually led to plaintiff's injury. Id. Second, the court held that concert of action was not a good fit since the \"allegations do not amount to a charge that there was a tacit understanding or a common plan among defendants to fail to conduct adequate tests or give sufficient warnings, and that they substantially aided a nd encouraged one another in these omissions.\" Id. at 932-33. Third, the court hesitated to apply the traditional concept of enterprise liability, given the large number of DES manufacturers, the lack of evidence that the DES defendants jointly controlled the risk of DE S, and the fact that DES was a product regulated by the FDA.

Deanna Marrero's case, Shackil v. Lede rle Laboratories , 249 is illustrative. Two days before her second birthday, Marrero received the DTP vaccine.250 Within twenty-four hours the toddler was in ex treme pain, and shortly thereafter she experienced a \"rapid deterioration of her condition [that] resulted in the loss of her then-acquired ve rbal, motor, and mental capacities.\" 251 She later was diagnosed with \"chronic encephalopathy and severe retardation,\" and at the time of the lawsuit she was \"institutionalized and require[d] constant care.\" 252 Twelve years after the inoculation, Marrero's parents learned of a link between Marrero's injuries and the pertussis component of the DTP vaccine.253 Marrero argued that the vaccine was defectively designed because the pertussis component utilized a \"whole-cell\" preparation, whereby whole cells of the pertussis organism are \"isolated and inactivated.\" 254 Other designs for the pertussis vaccine included: (1) \"split-cell\" preparation, whereby the pertussis cells are \"split or fragmented by a chemical process\" or (2) \"acellular\" preparation, whereby all the toxins of the pertussis organism are eliminated. 255 The whole-cell version that Marrero received had the highest rate of adverse events, followed by the split-cell and acellular versions, respectively. 256 In 1972 (the time of Marrero's inoculation), five companies produced the whole-cell version of the DTP vaccine and on e produced the split-cell version. 257 The acellular version gained widespread use in Japan beginning in 1981, but as of 1989 it was not licensed in the United States.258 The severe injuries that Marrero 248Id. 249561 A.2d 511 (N.J. 1989). 250Id. at 512-13. 251Id. at 513.

Assuming arguendo that the DTP vaccine was defectively designed and directly caused Marrero's injuries,264 the court nonetheless held that dismissing the lawsuit was appropriate.265 The court's decision was based primarily on p ublic policy grounds; specifically, the court noted that tort law is \"designe d to accomplish certain social objectives\" and that \"innocent victims\" should be afforded \"avenues of legal redress, absent a contrary, overriding public policy.\" 266 The court believed that the public policy goal of incentivizing vaccine development and marketing would be severely hindered by the application of market shar e liability to design defect claims for the DTP vaccine. 267 By the late 1980s there were only three additional reported cases where courts addressed the viability of market share liability to vaccine-related injuries.268 The Shackil decision was in line with two of the three cases. In one case, the Oregon Supreme Court rejected market share liability for a design defect involving the DTP vaccine. 269 Although the plaintiff was able to distill the number of potential manufacturers down to two,270 the Oregon Supreme Court 259Id.

In Sheffield v. Eli Lilly & Co. ,273 plaintiff alleged that the vaccine she received was defective because the manufacturer failed to properly neutralize the polio virus. 274 Similar to the plaintiffs in Gottsdanker (the vaccine-induced polio case), shortly after receivin g a polio vaccine, Kathryn Sheffield contracted a neurological and muscular disorder that left her paralyzed.275 Unlike the plaintiffs in Gottsdanker , however, Sheffield could not identify which manufacturer supplied the vaccine that she was administered, notwithstanding her good faith attempts and \"extensive efforts\" to do so.276 Under these circumstances, a California appellate court ruled that market share liability did not apply, and the court dismissed the case. 277 The Sheffield court declined to apply market share liability for three reasons. First, unlike in Sindell (which involved a design defect that impacted all DES tablets), the polio vaccine at issue in Sheffield had a manufacturing defect.278 The court reasoned that it would be unfair to hold four innocent defendants responsible for an injury caused by one negligent defendant. 279 Second, unlike in Sindell , in Sheffield's case the \"delay in discovering the alleged causation was in no way related to the nature of the defective product or any other act or omission of the unknown tortfeasor.\" 280 To the contrary, the Cutter Incident and cases of vaccine-induced polio were widely publicized; thus, the court opined, patients knew, or should have known, of the potential to contract polio from the vaccine. 281 Third, the court offered a policy reason to dismiss the case\u2014namely, that imposing liability would \"inhibit drug research and development, 271Id. at 223. 272Recall that Shackil and Senn were design defect claims in the context of market share liability. 273192 Cal.

Parke, Davis & Co. \u2014was similar to Shackil in that it involved the DTP vaccine (though recall that Shackil involved an allegation of a design defect, not a manufacturing defect).285 The Morris court held that market share liability applied if the manufacturers of a vaccin e shared a manufacturing defect that resulted \"from common (perhaps for reasons of economy) substandard means of production, storage, transportation or marketing.\" 286 The \"shared common inadequacies\" distinguished the allegations in Morris (regarding the DTP vaccine) from Sheffield (regarding the polio vaccine).287 Thus, the Morris court held, there \"is no unfairness\" in allowing the plaintiff to proceed under a theory of market share liability.288 While the Morris court was mindful of the potential impact of its holding on the vaccine market and the availability of vaccines, the court afforded greater weight to providing legal recourse in cases where a plaintiff can demonstrate that a marketed vaccine contained a manufacturing defect.

The committee concurred with the CDC's recommendation. 307 In April 1976, Congress authorized $135 million for a swine flu immunization program.308 Prior to the authorization, industry executives lobbied for governmental indemnification for vaccine-related injuries, but Congress did not include this indemnification in the authorization bill. 309 Several significant issues with the immunization program arose, including vaccine supply problems and continued de bate as to whether the vaccine should be administered immediately or stockpiled until there was a \"gr eater certainty of the threat.\"310 In June 1976, Dr. Sabin, who advocated earlier for a mandatory immunization program, publicly stated that stockpiling was the better option.311 Field trials on children and adults were conducted with two versions: a \"whole\" and \"split\" vaccine. 312 For children, the whole version had significant adverse events, but the split version did not confer immunity.313 The CDC later announced that children would not receive the vaccine.314 Many public health officials cautioned against this approach, since children are considered to be 302Id. 303Rebecca Kreston, The Public Health Legacy of the 1976 Swine Flu Outbreak , DISCOVER MAG.

On August 2, 1976, deaths fro m an \"influenza[-]like illness\" surfaced from elderly men who attended an American Legion convention in Philadelphia. 326 Although swine flu was ruled out within two days (the men succumbed to a bacterial pneumonia that later would be termed Legionnaires' disease), the outbreak revitalized the swine flu vaccination program. 327 In the wake of the Legionnaires' outbreak, vaccine manufacturers provided the government with an ultimatum \"that the federal government indemnify them 315Id. 316Id. 317See, e.g. , Michael Pound Gorilla Sleeps: The Federal Government's Lackadaisical Liability and Compensation Policies in the Context of Pre-Event Vaccine Immunization Programs , 8 J.

A wave of swine flu vaccine administrative claims and lawsuits ensued, alleging vaccine-related injuries such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, neurological disorders, and other adverse reactions. 372 By April 1985, 4165 administrative claims had been filed.373 Of these, 2813 (68%) were denied without compensation and 691 (17%) were settled for a total of $41,923,744, an average of $60,671 per settled case.374 In total, 1604 swine flu vaccine lawsuits were filed.375 Of the lawsuits, 706 (44%) were dismissed and 372 (23%) cases were settled for a combined amount of $35,208,225, an average of $94,646 per settled case. 376 In cases where liability was contested, the government won 259 of 307 cases (84%); in the 48 cases (16%) that the government lost, the total award equaled $24,310,114, an average of $506,460 per successful case. 377 By April 1985, compensation judgments and awards totaled approximately $90 million, which nearly matched the $100 million that the government had earmarked for purchase of the vaccine itself. 378 As the IOM succinctly concluded in a report published in 1985, the \"swine flu program was not a public health success.\"379 During the swine flu scare, public health officials faced a \"no-win situation.\"380 If the government failed to acquire the necessary vaccines and there was a deadly swine flu outbreak, the government would have been accused 369Reitze, supra note 43, at 183-84. 370Id.

At the same time, as public health law expert Wendy Parmet explains, the 1976 swine flu vaccination program \"set a precedent and taught a lesson. The precedent was that vaccine manufacturers would demand and receive liability protection in order to maintain an adequate supply of vaccine. The lesson was that the government's assumption of liability created significant costs for the federal treasury.\" 382 During the time that Congress was debating the Vaccine Act, the swine flu episode was fresh in the minds of lawmakers, the vaccine industry, and pub lic health officials, and thus had a \"substantial influence on the development of public policy concerning vaccination programs.\" 383 C. 1980s Public Health Politics: Portraying the FDA as a Bureaucratic Hindrance to Health and Safety The reputation and power of the FDA has waxed and waned for decades.384 This oscillation often has aligned with the political will of lawmakers, who have had to balance business interests with public health concerns, and the public's perception of the proper role of the FDA in regulating access to, and the quality of, medical products. To understand the political climate that enveloped the FDA during the 1980s, however, one must be mindful of the social, medical, and political underpinnings surrounding prior regulatory milestones. For vaccines, the first regulatory milestone dates back to 1813, shortly after Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine became commercially available in the United States. 385 The Vaccine Act of 1813 authorized the president \"to appoint a federal agent to 'preserve the genuine vaccine matter, and to furnish the same to any 381Id.

Whenever a controversy over a new drug is resolved by its approval, the Agency and the individuals involved likely will be investigated. Whenever such a drug is disapproved, no inquiry will be made.\" 428 This would change abruptly.

Throughout the 1980s, several influential publications\u2014including the Wall Street Journal , Washington Post , and Science \u2014published editorials that characterized the FDA as an agency with \"blood on its hands\" due to unnecessarily high standard s and slow review times. 430 One respected media outlet, Barron's , characterized FDA officials as \"angels of death\" who worked for a government ente rprise that was \"a clear and present danger to the nation's health and welfare.\"431 While some articles in the mainstream media focused on specific decisions of products under FDA review, others targeted the \"entire regulatory structure.\" 432 In particular, the Wall Street Journal tackled head-on the public's high regard for the FDA, lamenting that \"[t]he public has been given to believe that the Food and Drug Administration is, of its nature, a social good.\" 433 In one editorial, the Wall Street Journal claimed that the FDA's delay in approving one drug \"had killed 100,000 Americans;\" the authors th en argued that this \"raised the question of 'whether we should even have an FDA.'\"434 In lieu of a federal agency with expertise in analyzing the safety and effi cacy of medical products, the journalists suggested that \"responsibility for safety could be merely returned to the drug makers and doctors.\" 435 The pages of the Wall Street Journal had significant influence, and the opinions of the newspaper's editors \"seemed quickly to spill over into the journalism of industry-focused trade reporters, and before long it would influence the internal structure of the [Reagan] Administration itself.\" 436 A cascade of congressional commit tee and subcommittee meetings contributed to the war on the FDA; while some praised the agency, others sought to \"tarnish\" or \"influence\" its reputation. 437 The anti-regulatory voices gained particular prominence during the 1980s, as attacks on regulation \"won allies and seized political and cultural momentum.\" 438 This framing was, in many respects, \"irrevocably altered by the AIDS crisis\" of the 1980s, which pitched a clash between \"dying protestors and white-coated bureaucrats.\" 430Id. at 4. 431Id. at 367 (citing Angels of Death , BARRON 'S NAT'L BUS. & FIN.

Rather, the nation al media widely portrayed the moral claims of AIDS activists as something that challenged the \"modus operandi\" of the FDA itself. 441 As political scientist and FDA expert Daniel Carpenter succinctly explains, \"[i]n the anti-regulatory moment of the late 1970s and 1980s, national politicians began to single out the FDA as overly intrusive in the doctor-patient relationship and in the entrepreneurial process of drug development.\" 442 These perspectives are embedded in the Vaccine Act. At the time the Vaccine Act was enacted, the FDA did not maintain a robust system for collecting and reviewing vaccine-related adverse events. This was notwithstanding the fact that, during the 1976 swine flu immunization program, the government created an adverse event surveillance system that utilized the latest technologies in data collection and analysis. 443 Indeed, it is not unreasonable to conclude that because of the success of the swine flu vaccine adverse event analysis (e.g., the discover y that the vaccine caused Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome at a rate far higher than other vaccines), the government was reluctant to structure a comprehensive national program that closely monitored all vaccine related adverse events. 444 The CDC Director, along with the director of the swine flu vaccination program, candidly wrote that the swine flu vaccination program's \"innovative surveillance system would prove to be [the program's] Trojan horse.\" 445 Thus, rather than acknowledge that robust data collection and analysis serve important public health goals, leading public health officials characterized diligent adverse event surveillance as something that appears beneficial but in reality can undermine immunization effort s. The extent to which the swine flu vaccine program influenced lawmakers no t to incorporate into the Vaccine Act provisions that require robust data coll ection and analysis is unknown, though no one can seriously doubt that the swine flu vaccine program and litigation were fresh in the minds of lawmakers and public health officials at the time of the Vaccine Act's enactment. 440See Carpenter, supra note 423, at 56 (explaining that pharmaceutical firms regularly seek alliances with pati ent advocates in pressing cases for priority status and FDA approval).

T HE VACCINE ACT FRAMEWORK A review of the landscape leading up to the enactment of the Vaccine Act reveals a potpourri of legal, political, economic, and public health factors that influenced the structure of the law. He alth officials sought to maximize the public health benefits of immunization, but the public increasingly grew wary of official statements given the prevalence of vaccine-related side effects and haphazard disclosures of vaccine risks. 446 The public's concerns were exacerbated by significant legal challeng es that injured plaintiffs faced in litigating claims against vaccine manufacturers.447 Litigation risks\u2014particularly when coupled with unpredictable manufacturing costs and revenues\u2014led manufacturers and investors to question whether vaccines were financially worthwhile, while challenges in assessing risk caused insurance companies to increase premiums or refuse coverage for certain vaccines. Government indemnification of the swine flu vaccine underscored the immense costs that might arise from a comprehensive compensation program for vaccine-rela ted injuries. 448 The swine flu vaccine litigation also confirmed that the economic concerns of manufacturers and insurance companies were not unreasonable. 449 At the same time, state and local public health officials were tasked with convincing the public that immunizations serve essential individual and public health goals. 450 Meanwhile, judges, lawmakers, and commentators questioned the costs and benefits of allowing market share liability or products liability claims for vaccine-related injuries. A parallel, though not entirely unrelated, movement portrayed government agencies (including the FDA) as superfluous, if not harmful to the health and welfare of society. It was not just politicians and 446As to the latter, social scie ntists have characterized th is phenomenon as a \"struggle or competition between actors and institutions, vying to valorize their own capital, control the distribution and exchange rate of capital in the field, and thus control what counts as legitimate scientific inquiry and research.\" Decoteau & Underman, supra note 14, at 474-75. Along these lines, one must distinguish knowledge, unknown risks, and insufficiently explored risk theories. See id. at 475-76 (explaining that when scie ntific community or public advocates disagree, \"the boundaries of the field are none theless at stake\" and those involved try to \"impose the definition of science that best conforms to their specific interest\") . 447See Greenberger, supra 11-14. 449Id. at 13-14 (explaining that increase in vaccine tort litigation meant that \"vaccine manufacturers faced grave difficulty in obtaining liability insurance, which caused one vaccine manufacturer to stop produci ng vaccines temporarily in 1984\"). 450Cold War-era fears of attacks with biol ogical weapons compounded the public health concerns, as an undervaccinated population would be particularly susceptible to weaponized infectious diseases. See generally Susan Wright, Evolution of Biological Warfare Policy, 1945-1990 , in PREVENTING A BIOLOGICAL ARMS RACE (Susan Wright ed., 1990) (surveying post-war evolution of United States' biological warfare policy and use of biological sciences for military purposes). 2017] RECALIBRATING VACCINATION LAWS 2209 industry executives who shared these vi ews\u2014to the contrary, a significant and growing proportion of Americans adhered to core principles of libertarianism and conservatism,451 both of which highly value individual choice, including the choice of whether to be vaccinated. In terms of legislative history, the Vaccine Act was \"put together at the last minute from pieces of legislation discussed in both Houses.\"452 The Senate passed the bill on voice vote and House members did not even receive a copy of the bill prior to voting. 453 The Vaccine Act was not enacted as standalone legislation; rather, it was a component of an omnibus health measure, the central feature of which was a law that allowed for the export of American medical products that had not earned FDA approval. 454 President Reagan signed the omnibus health bill \"with mixed feelings.\"455 He strongly supported the export provision and a separate law that eliminated federal health planning authorities, but noted his \"serious reservations\" with the Vaccine Act. 456 Specifically, Reagan raised concerns that \"there continues to be the opportunity for very substantial and inequitable differences in liability judgments awarded similarly situated plaintiffs.\" 457 The Department of Justice\u2014which was responsible for representing the government in vaccine in jury cases\u2014lobbied for a presidential veto of the bill on the grounds that th e Vaccine Act would be \"the first step toward no-fault compensation\" for other claims, such as Agent Orange and the military's radiation experiments.458 It was in this complex cloud of public policy that the Vaccine Act was launched.

The amount of the excise tax was based on anticipated compensation awards and related administrative costs, 471 but the Trust Fund has a net balance of over $3.6 billion.472 B. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The rules and procedures governing claims for compensation under the Vaccine Act stem from four sources: (1) the statute; (2) Vaccine Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims; (3) Guidelines for Practice Under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program; and (4) decisions of the Court of Federal Claims, Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and Supreme Court. To commence a claim under the compensa tion program, a claimant must file a petition with the Court of Federal Claims and pay a $400 filing fee. 473 Petitions eligible for compensation are those where the vaccine-related injury: \"[1] lasted for more than 6 months after the vaccine was given; or [2] resulted in a hospital stay and surgery; or [3] resulted in death.\" 474 These threshold requirements limit the realm of vaccine-related injuries that are eligible for compensation. The petition must outline the vaccine that allegedly caused the injury, where it was administered, and the nature of the petitioner's injuries.475 The court then forwards the petition to a special master, who reviews the petition, admits and considers evidence, and issues a ru ling on the merits of the claim. 476 The Vaccine Act allows for no more than eight spec ial masters for the entire compensation program.477 Initially, the Vaccine Act afforded special masters a \"limited role of only making proposed findings of fact, proposed conclusions of law, and [a] recommended decision to a judge of the Court of Federal Claims.\"478 Within a few years, however, amendments to th e Vaccine Act granted special masters 1988. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(i)(2).

Specifically, causation is presumed for on-table injuries, and the government has the burden of disproving causation. 514 For off-table injuries, however, the petitioner is responsible for proving that a vaccine caused their injury.515 This includes general causation\u2014a medical theory linking the vaccine 508Bruesewitz v.

III. M ODERNIZING THE VACCINE ACT Three decades of experience have provided a wealth of data from which to analyze the Vaccine Act an d consider the extent to which the Act addresses modern-day vaccine policy concerns. Insofar as it is unwise or unrealistic to call for a reframing of the entire regime, it is essential to structur e reforms that can work within the system. For any reform pr oposal to have a realistic chance of implementation, it also must account for the current economic and political climate. While the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have taken a strong deregulatory stance, they also have called for inquiries into vaccine safety. 559 Additionally, many Democrats have questioned the need for broad legal immunities for the pharmaceutical industry.560 As such, it is not unreasonable to think that amending the Vaccine Act can be achieved, particularly if the amendments address safety concerns without unduly burdening industry. The proposals outlined herein aim to achieve this balance. There are three guiding principles: (1) using law as a tool to promote public health by encouraging vaccine research and incorporating scientific innovations into vaccine design, (2) ensuring that an appropriate safety net exists for individuals who suffer vaccine-related injuries, and (3) instituting legal levers that can help build and maintain public trust in immunizations. While this Article focuses on five reform s, they are by no means an exhaustive list of areas that need recalibration. 561 Rather, I selected the five reforms because 558Bruesewitz , 562 U.S. at 231-32 (\"[P]rovided that there was proper manufacture and warning, any remaining side effects, including those resulting from design defects, are deemed to have been unavoidable.\"). 559See, e.g. , Hotez, supra note 54. As such, there is reason to think that the Trump Administration may call for the cr eation of a vaccine commission. Id. 560Cf. Joanna B. Apolinsky & Jeffrey A. VanDetta, Rethinking Liability for Vaccine Injury , 19 C ORNELL J.L PUB. POL'Y 537, 559-62 (2010). 561Additional areas for reform include: (1) incr easing damages caps (at the very least, to account for inflation); (2) allowing courts de novo review of special ma sters' factual findings; (3) updating the Vaccine Injury Table automatically to include injuries where a special master or court has determined an injury is vaccine-related; (4) increasing the number of special masters so as to help expedite adjudication of petit ions; (5) eliminating the $400 filing fee for petitions; (6) increasing the incentives for atto rneys to take cases where there is credible evidence that a vaccine caused an injury; (7) extending statutes of limitations; (8) allowing parents or guardians to right to sue for their children's injuries; (9) clarifying evidentiary admissibility standards in vaccine-injury petitions; (10) including all vaccines in the compensation program, and not just those routinely recommended for children; and (11) allowing petitions to be brought for inju ries caused to unborn children when a pregnant woman is vaccinated. Of these, issues (1) and (2) are discussed in Parasidis, supra note 68, at 2222 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 97:2153 they are politically palatable and are areas where statutory tweaks can address serious shortcomings of the Vaccine Act. The proposals\u2014which aim to harmonize the interests of patients, physicians, public health officials, and the vaccine industry\u2014include: (1) adjustin g the requirements for adverse event reporting and post-market analysis of vaccine safety and efficacy, (2) predicating limited liability for vaccine manufacturers on compliance with post-market analysis requirements, (3) exempting design defect claims from the preemption provision of the Vaccine Act in cases of negligent failure to utilize a safer alternative design, (4) restructuring the burd en of proof for claims alleging off-table vaccine-related in juries, and (5) mandating a minimum investment of Trust Fund proceeds for vaccine research and development. For each proposal, this Article provides draft legislation that may serve as a foundation from which to amend the Vaccine Act. A. Adjusting the Requirements for Adverse Event Reporting and Post-Market Analysis of Vaccine Safety and Efficacy The Vaccine Act contains a mandate for creating safer childhood vaccines. The HHS Secretary must \"promote the development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions\" and the \"refinement of such vaccines.\" 562 The mandate also requires the Secretary to \"make or assure improvements\" in \"licensing, manufacturing, processing, testing, labeling, warning, use instructions, distribution, storage, administration, field surveillance, adverse reaction reporting, and recall of reactogenic lots or batches, of vaccines, and research on vaccines, in order to reduce the risks of adverse reactions to vaccines.\" 563 To help achieve these goals, the Act places recording and reporting requirements on physicians and vaccine manufacturers. Each patient's medical records must identify all vaccine doses, 564 and providers are obligated to report all on-table vaccine-related injuries, any contraindicating reaction to a vaccine that is identified in the vaccine package insert, and \"such other matters\" as the HHS Secretary may require. 565 According to a study by CDC officials, however, 63.1% of pediatric healthcare providers indicated that they were unlikely to report a minor vaccine-related adverse event, and 3.6% indicated that they were 1141-50; issues (1), (6), (7), and (8) are discussed in Meyers, supra note 21, at 847-50; issue (9) is discussed in Grey, supra note 30, at 412-13; and issues (10) and (11) are discussed in OFFIT, supra note 51, at 187-88. I thank Marc Sp for suggesting issue (3). 56242 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-27(a). 563Id.

Underreporting masks the actual rate of vaccine-related side effects and can have serious public health implications, such as hindering health-care decision-making and impeding redesign innovation. 569 Underreporting also hinders injured parties' ability to prove causation in cases alleging vaccine- related injuries.570 To address these concerns, lawmakers should incorporate penalties into the Vaccine Act for failure to comply with the reporting requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-25(b). Such penalties could be fines or reductions in reimbursements for failure to report. The former is the paradigm that the Vaccine Act applies if a manufacturer fails to comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements, 571 while the latter is the model used in other health-care settings, such as failure to comply with meaningful use requirements.572 Although physicians likely will challenge this proposal, incentivizing compliance with reporting requirements is necessary to address physicians' well-documented underreporting of vaccine-related adverse events. 573 Electronic health records (\"EHRs\") a nd health information technology systems simplify a physician's ability to comply with the reporting requirements; for example, a program could be structured to automatically report any adverse event that is identified in a patient's me dical records. Insofar as such a system requires a financial investment on the part of physicians, lawmakers can allocate 566Michael M. McNeil et al., Who is Unlikely to Report Adve rse Events After Vaccinations to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) , 31 V ACCINE 2673, 2676 (2013).

In addition to adjusting physicians' reporting incentives, lawmakers should amend the Vaccine Act to incentivize manu facturers to analyze post-market data on vaccine safety and efficacy. Manufacturers currently are responsible for documenting \"the history of the manufacturing, processing, testing, repooling, and reworking\" of vaccines, \"including the identification of any significant problems encountered in the production, testing, or handling.\" 576 If safety testing reveals \"a potential imminent or substantial public health hazard,\" manufacturers must notify the government within twenty-four hours of the test. 577 Failing to comply with these recording and reporting requirements may result in civil penalties, fines, and jail time.578 While these recording and reporting requirements are important, a key element is missing. Specifically, the Vacci ne Act does not mandate that vaccine manufacturers collect or analyze safety an d efficacy data from patients in which their vaccines are administered. Rather, the bu lk of this work is left to regulators. As detailed, however, VAERS\u2014the FDA's primary mechanism for post-market review\u2014is a \"passive\" surveillance system and \"no active effort is made to search for, identify and collect information.\" 579 As public health experts have detailed, the \"greatest limitation of VAERS . . . is its general inability to determine whether a vaccine actually caused the reported adverse event.\" 580 Other post-market adverse event tools include (1) Phase 4 studies (often required for newly licensed vaccines), (2 ) the Vaccine Safety Datalink (\"VSD\") and Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment, which are collaborations between the CDC and various health-care organizations, and (3) the FDA's Sentinel Post-Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring System. 581 574See infra Section III.E. 575See 29, at 4398. While VAERS has limitations, its strengths include a nationwide reach and an ability to generate safety signals that can be evaluated further. However, for VAERS data to be meanin gful, follow-up studies ar e essential. Chen et al., supra note 27, at 548. 580Chen et al., supra note 27, at 548. 581Meghan A.

For example, VAERS data typically does no t contain laboratory or clinical findings specific to vaccine administration. Chen et al., supra note 27, at 548.

In addition to underreporting, these biases include \"stimulated reporting, which is elevated reporting that might occur in response to intense me dia attention.\" Shim abukuro et al., supra note 29, at 4402. Because reporting to VAERS is voluntary and anyone can submit a report, VAERS also \"may be manipulated inappropriately to influe nce litigation and public policy.\" Michael J. Goodman & James Nordin, Vaccine Adverse Event Reportin g System Reporting Bias: A Possible Source of Bias in Longitudinal Studies , 117 P EDIATRICS 387, 388 (2006). As CDC and FDA officials candidly ackno wledge, \"[t]he background rates of many adverse events, particularly rare adverse events and their distribution in either vaccinated or unvaccinated populations are unknown, which ma kes the assessment of repres entativeness difficult.\" James A. Singleton et al., An Overview of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) as a Surveillance System , 17 V ACCINE 2908, 2914 (1999). Moreover, \"VAERS usually cannot be used to determine whether an adverse event is caused by a vaccine or is simply coincidental.\" McNeil et al., supra note 581, at 5391. Nor can VAERS identify \"[r]ates or relative risks of vaccine adverse events.\" Id. Notwithstanding these significant limitations, VAERS is \"the nation's frontline post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring system.\" Shimabukuro et al., supra note 29, at 4403. At the same time, innovations in health- information technology have led to advanced signal-generating mechanisms. For example, the CDC's VSD has tested \"rapid cycle analys is, which may flag sa fety signals requiring further study very soon after vaccin e introduction.\" John Iskander et al., Data Mining in the US Using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System , 29 D RUG SAFETY 375, 381 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). 5852017 CDC V ACCINE SCHEDULE , supra note 1, at 2. 2226 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 97:2153 Anecdotally, I called the F DA with a handful of v accine lots (from vaccines that were administered to my children) to see what the reported adverse events were for the lots. The FDA agent with whom I spoke was able to quickly locate the vaccine lots in the FDA database, but unable to say with any confidence whether the reported adverse events were linked to vaccines from the lots. As the FDA agent explained to me, because children often receive multiple vaccines during a single office visit (in accordance with the CDC-recommended vaccine schedule), even when adverse events are reported, the FDA is unable to determine which vaccine is associated with the adverse event, let alone whether a given vaccine may be causally related to the adverse event. Although regulators have expanded their efforts to collect and analyze vaccine-related adverse events, the government's heavy reliance on passive post-market surveillance fails to capitalize on the state of the art in health information technology. A twenty-first century post-market framework must leverage recent and emerging advancements in health information technology, and should place a legal burden of diligent post-market analysis on vaccine manufacturers. As an additional component to the existing post-market regime, all vaccine manufacturers should be required to actively monitor their products to evaluate safety and efficacy. Given the proliferatio n of EHRs and the established need to document vaccine doses (to provide to educational institutions), manufacturers (in conjunction with physicians and public health officials) could create vaccine registries that are linked to the medical records of children. Regulators could mandate that manufacturers monitor and an alyze the registries, and subsequently impose penalties for failure to conduct timely and diligent analysis. 586 586Insofar as many children receive multiple vaccines during a doctor's visit, causation issues are likely to remain. To a certain extent, increased use of alternative vaccine schedules may help address causation hurdles, particularly since many parents limit vaccines for their child to one per visit. See, e.g. , Kiera Butler, My Interview with a Pediatrician Who Thinks Vaccines Are \"Messing with Nature ,\" M OTHER JONES (Mar. 31, 2014), http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/03/ pediatrician-believe s-vaccines-are-mess ing-nature/ [https://perma.c c/6CL2-VLXZ]; Alice Park, Many Doctors Give in When Parents Want to Space out Vaccines , TIME (Mar. 2, 2015), http://time.com/3726887/doctors-space- out-vaccines/ [https://perma.cc/KE7U-5WKU]. 2017] RECALIBRATING VACCINATION LAWS 2227 Instituting a requirement for manufacturer-sponsored, active post-market analysis of vaccine safety and effica cy can be accomplished by adding a subsection (d) to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-25. The new subsection could be based on the following: \u00a7 300aa-25. Recording and reporting of information . . . . (d) Analysis of vaccine safety and efficacy (1) In consultation with the Secretary, a vaccine manufactur er shall conduct analysis of vaccine safety and effi cacy for each of the manufacturer's licensed vaccines. (2) The analysis shall be based, in pa rt, on reported information as referred to in subsection (b). (3) If a vaccine manufacturer fails to comply with this subsection, the limited liability provisions of sectio n 300aa-22(b) of this title shall not apply. 587 In turn, the Secretary, via the FDA and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which is a collaboration between the CDC, FDA, and NIH,588 should issue guidance on best practices for active post-market analysis. The actual studies to be conducted for each vaccine should be created via collaborative efforts between the manufacturer and the FDA, and should incorporate information from EHRs, patient registries, the Sentinel network, VAERS, VSD, and other data sources. The Advisory Commissi on on Childhood Vaccines also should play a role in advising the Secretary on appropriate post-market research. The Advisory Commission is composed of a diverse group of nine members, and includes health professionals, pediatricians, experts in epidemiology and infectious diseases, attorneys, and legal representatives of children who have suffered vaccine-relate d injuries or death. 589 A component of the Advisory Commission's mandate is to \"advise the Secretary . . . regarding the need for childhood vaccination products that result in fewer or no significant adverse reactions.\" 590 Insofar as the vaccine m a r k e t i s s t r o n g ,591 the costs of a manufacturer-led active post-market analysis system are un likely to have a substantial financial impact on manufacturers. While total costs per vaccine will vary, a typical observational study that relies on primary and secondary data costs between $100,000 and $250,000 for small studies lasting less than two years, and $1.5 587The rationale underlying proposed subsection AM., supra note 28, at 45 (reporting that global vaccine market was valued at $27.3 billion in 2012 , and projected to grow significantly). 2228 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 97:2153 million to $3 million for larger and lengthier studies.592 Industry representatives estimate annual costs of observational studies based on registry data at $1.5 million. 593 Though not insignificant amounts, these figures represent a fraction of the total cost for vaccine development, which typically runs in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 594 At one extreme, these costs may be passed entirely on to patients. At the other, the vaccine industry would fully absorb the costs and decrease its return on investment. As discussed in the fifth proposal of this Article, proceeds from the Trust Fund may be allocated to help defray the research costs. 595 Furthermore, insofar as manufacturers are conducting analogous post-market studies in accordance with regulatory requirements outside the United States, 596 it may be the case that the costs of the increase in responsibilities in the United States are less than the projected costs outlined herein. Taken together, adjusting the requirements for vaccine-related adverse event reporting and analysis: (1) helps address significant underreporting of adverse events, (2) shifts part of the costs of post-market analysis from regulators to the entity that gains financially from vaccine sales, (3) helps address challenges that arise from the fact that the FDA has long been plagued by limited resources to address its expansive mandate, and (4) furthers the Vaccine Act's mandate for creating safer childhood vaccines. A twenty-first century post-market framework also can help facilitate inde pendent research on vaccine safety and efficacy, which might help alleviate the fears of vaccine-hesitant parents, and thus increase immunization rates and the public health benefits that follow. B. Predicating Limited Liability for Vaccine Manufacturers on Compliance with Post-Market Analysis Requirements Subsection (d)(3) of the proposed amendment to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-25 promotes the Vaccine Act's mandate to encourage safer child hood vaccines by predicating the limited liability pr ovisions of the Vaccine Act on a manufacturer's compliance with post-market analysis responsibilities. As detailed, the Vaccine Act provides vacc ine manufacturers with valuable legal and economic benefits via its limited li ability provisions: a manufacturer is 592ERIN HOLVE & PATRICIA PITTMAN , ACADEMY HEALTH , A FIRST LOOK AT THE VOLUME AND COST OF COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES 7 fig.3 (2009). 593Id. 594PHARM .

The economic uncertainty from the 1980s is no longer present, and manufacturers consistently yield robust earnings; in addition, the vaccine market is predicted to expand significantly over the next five years, from $24 billion to $61 billion. 604 Furthermore, the Vaccine Act contains a \"mandate for sa fer childhood vaccines\" that requires promoting \"the development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions.\" 605 This mandate includes efforts to refine existing vaccines.606 Accordingly, Congress should realign the incentives of the Vaccine Act to reflect contemporary concerns in the v accine market, such as ensuring 237-39. at 250. 604Timothy Guzman, Big Pharma and Big Profits: The Multibillion Dollar Vaccine Market , G LOBAL RES.

This can be accomplished by predicating legal imm unities on a vaccine manufacturer's compliance with active and continuous post-market analysis requirements. As courts have recognized, \" [t]he manufacturer is in the best position to discover and guard against defects in its products and to warn of harmful effects.\" 607 Moreover, \"recent advances in immunology are beginning to sh ed new light on the mechanisms of vaccine-mediated pr otection and development of long-term immunity.\"608 Realigning the quid pro quo of preemption laws will maintain legal protections while encouraging timely integration of the latest immunological findings into vaccine design. C. Exempting Design Defect Claims from the Preemption Provision of the Vaccine Act in Cases of Negligent Failure to Utilize a Safer Alternative Design Another statutory lever to promote the Vaccine Act's mandate is exempting design defect claims in cases where a vaccine manufacturer was negligent in failing to utilize a safer vaccine design. This exemption should apply in cases where there is a preponderance of the evid ence that the increased safety is more than de minimis, any decrease in vaccine efficacy is de minimis, and the vaccine manufacturer could have manufactured the vaccine with the alternative design. The third component relates to manufacturing process, and aims to ensure that manufacturers have a reasonable time period during which to obtain the necessary vaccine ingredients or alter th eir manufacturing processes in order to accommodate a new design. 609 This would include any necessary FDA clearances on altering the vaccine formula.610 In cases where a safer alternative design exists and the manufacturer has made good faith efforts to transition to the new design, the manufacturer should not be liable. The Supreme Court's decision in Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC 611 was grounded in a false dilemma\u2014that allowing design defect claims would eviscerate the Vaccine Act's preemption pr ovision because a \"side effect of a vaccine could always have been avoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element.\" 612 However, the Court's rationale presumes 607E.g., Sindell 607 P.2d 936 (Cal. 1980). 608Mark K. Slifka & Ian Amanna, How Advances in Immunology Provide Insight into Improving Vaccine Safety , 32 V ACCINE 2948, 2948 (2014) (outlining potential to \"elicit more effective and long-lived immunity with fewer vaccinations\"). 609For example, building and validating a new ma nufacturing facility takes, on average, five years. P HARM . RESEARCH & MFRS.

Rather than eliminate design defect claims entirely, the Court should have incorporated legal and scientific nuance into its holding\u2014along the lines of that provided by the First Circuit in Brochu v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. , 613 the Idaho Supreme Court in Toner v. Lederle Laboratories ,614 and the California appellate court in Kearl v. Lederle Laboratories615\u2014whereby design defect claims would be permitted for a negligent failure to incorporate a safer alternative design.616 Incorporating an exemptio n to design defect claims could be accomplished by adding a paragraph (3) to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(b). The new paragraph could be based on \u00a7 300aa-22. Standards of responsibility . . . . (3) For purposes of paragraph (1), a side effect shall not be unavoidable if the plaintiff shows that a vaccine could have been manufactured using an alternative design, where (A) the increased safety of the vaccine due to the alternative design is more than de minimis, (B) any decrease in the efficacy of the vaccine due to the alternative design is de minimis, and (C) the vaccine manufacturer had, or re asonably could have been expected to have, the ability to produce the vaccine with the alternative design. This provision accounts for the regulatory gap that Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor highlighted\u2014specifically, that the Vaccine Act's broad preemption provision fails to ensure that manufacturers incorporate scientific advancements into vaccine design. It permits design defect claims in very limited circumstances\u2014namely, in cases where the manufacturer has failed to take reasonable steps to update their vaccine formula in light of scientific evidence that a safer design exists that would not compromise vaccine efficacy. Notably, this carve-out fo r allowing design defect claims was contemplated by courts prior to the Vaccine Act's enactment. Recall Kearl , where the plaintiff alleged that the polio vaccine was defe ctively designed. There, a California appellate court indicated that design defect claims for vaccines may be appropriate if a manufacturer were negligent in failing to incorporate a safer 613642 F.2d 652 (1st Cir. 1981). 614732 616See supra Section I.A.3 (discussing various judi cial approaches to design defect claims). 2232 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 97:2153 alternative design.617 Similarly, the First Circuit held that prescription drugs \"should not be exempt from strict liability design defect analysis if the evidence shows inter alia availability, at the time of distribution, of an alternative product that would have as effectively accomplished the full intended purpose of the subject product.\" 618 And, in Toner , the Idaho Supreme Court held that a claim for negligent failure to utilize a safer alternative design was actionable, indicating that such claims are necessary to incentivize manufacturers to create and market safe and effective vaccines. 619 The proposed paragraph (3) to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(b) reflects these principles. Specifically, it precludes design defect claims in instances where the adverse effect was unavoidable and permits design defect claims in cases where the adverse effect was avoidable. Allowing for manufacturer liability in instances of negligence is also in line with the government's indemnification agreement during the swine flu vaccin e program, where the vaccine industry agreed to assume liability in instances of \"any negligent conduct.\" 620 It is important to note that design defect claims were not the primary cause of litigation fears during the 1980s. Indeed, cases finding manufacturers liable for selling defective vaccines were \"very rare.\" 621 To the contrary, it was the legal uncertainty surrounding warning defects, in large part due to the decisions in Davis and Reyes , that caused industry executives to worry. 622 As such, the provision of the Vaccine Act that broadly preempts design defect claims addressed a non-issue (in terms of litigation-influenced market destabilization), and can be seen as a political handout to manufacturers who lobbied for \"greater insulation from liability.\" 623 To be sure, satisfying the level of proof necessary to bring a claim under the proposed new model would be challenging. Moreover, the foregoing amendment is not aligned with Section 6(c) of the Restatement (Third) of Torts, 617Kearl , 218 Cal. Rptr. at 460. As the Kearl court suggested, a de minimis safety concern is one that results in a \"mere temporary or insignificant inconvenience.\" Id. at 464.

The vaccine market is high ly consolidated, there is little-to-no competition for individual vaccines, pre-market FDA review is limited in scope, post-market analysis is lackluster, and the Vaccine Act largely insulates manufacturers from legal or financial liability in the event of vaccine-related injuries. Indeed, seventeen years after pu blication of the Restatement (Third) of Torts, the co-reporters identified more states rejecting Section 6(c) than those adopting it. 628 In short, market and regulatory imperfections do not provide adequate incentives for vaccine manufacturers to update their products. Legal levers\u2014including the availability of design defect claims\u2014can help fill this void. Although updating vaccine design may impact vaccine pricing, safer and more effective vaccines will result in fewer adverse events and better protection against disease. 629 Incentivizing manufacturers to update their vaccines in light of new scientific developments is partic ularly important given the fact that, as the IOM explains, \"the need for a vaccine to deliver lifelong or long-lasting immunity is at odds with the prospect of multiple or repeat sales.\" 630 As such, 624See, e.g. , James A.

Nonetheless, subparagraph (C) of the proposed amendment to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(b) should be interpreted to incorporate the cost of production.

D. Restructuring the Burden of Proof for Claims Alleging Off-Table Vaccine- Related Injuries When the Vaccine Act was enacted, \"the expectation was that most cases would involve [on-table] injuries.\"631 During the \"early days\" of the compensation program, \"that expectation was borne out.\"632 In recent years, however, the majority of v accine compensation cases have involved off-table injuries.633 For example, as of April 2016, o ff-table injuries accounted for more than ninety-eight percent of the av erage caseload of a special master.634 Under current law, the pe titioner's burden in claims alleging an off-table injury is to demonstrate, by a preponde rance of the evidence: \"(1) a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the va ccination was the reason for the injury; and (3) a showing of a proximate temporal relationship betw een vaccination and injury.\"635 Even if a petitioner can meet this high burden, compensation is not available if the government can demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, \" that the injury was in fact cau sed by factors unrelated to the vaccine .\" 636 Challenges in demonstrating vaccine-injury causation were well-documented prior to the enactment of the Vaccine Act. The IOM noted that the \"difficulty of proving or disproving a causal relationship between a given vaccine and a particular injury suggest[] that . . . outcomes will depend on who is required to carry the burden of proof.\" 637 As the IOM further expl ained, efforts to prove causation \"will be time-consuming, expensive, and probably inconclusive.\"638 Thereafter, the Federal Circuit observed that demonstrating causation for off- table injuries requires \"heavy lifting\" on the petitioner's part, and \"it is not surprising that petitioners have a difficult time proving off-table cases,\" 639 while the Chief Special Master \"chastised the government for 'alter[ing] the game so that it's clearly in their favor.'\" 640 Moreover, between 1999 and 2002, several 631NVICP G UIDELINES , supra note 475, at 43; Grey, supra note 30, at 357-64 (detailing legislative history and concluding that \"[t]he legislative history of the Vaccine Act suggests that the off-Table claims mechanism was an afterthought\"). 632NVICP G UIDELINES , note 475, at 43 . 633Id. at 45. 634Id. at 43.

Arguably, th e high bar for off-table inju ries can be traced to the government's experience with compensation claims following the 1976 swine flu immunization program, where \"t he government became increasingly reluctant to assume the financial risks associated with vaccination initiatives.\" 642 Causation was a controversial issue in the swine flu cases.643 For example, the government was willing to settle most cases if Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome manifested within ten weeks of vaccination, though some plaintiffs were successful when they were diagnosed with the disease after twelve weeks. 644 On the other hand, many plaintiffs experienced causation problems because Guillain-Barr\u00e9 symptoms are amorphous and difficult to diagnose. 645 Lawmakers established a causation bar in the Vaccine Act that reasonably could have been predicted to result in few off-table compensation awards. A petitioner's ability to prove an off-table injury is further compromised by the lackluster system of adverse event reporting and analysis. One study found that, based on VAERS data alone, only three percent of VAERS reports could be identified as \"definitely causally related to vaccine received.\" 646 As CDC and FDA officials acknowledge, with rare exceptions, \"it generally cannot be determined if a vaccine caused an adverse event using VAERS data.\" 647 A recent IOM report underscored this conclusion, finding that, in many cases, \"the evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship\" between a vaccine and an injury. 648 If the CDC, FDA, and IOM acknowledge that the data often are insufficient to make meaningful conclusions about vaccine-related adverse events, how can injured parties be expected to meet the high legal standard for compensation? 641See Grey, supra note 30, at 363-65. 642Greenberger, supra note 317, at 13. 643Reitze, supra note at 186. 644Id. at 185-86. 645Id. at 186. 646Anita M.

This may be accomplished by adding a paragraph (3) to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(a). The new paragraph could be based on the following: \u00a7 300aa-13. Determination of eligibility and compensation (a) General rule . . . . (3) In a petition for compensation wherein it is alleged that a person sustained, or had significantly aggravated, any illness, disability, injury, or condition not set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table but which was caused by a vaccine referred to under section 300aa-11(c)(1)(A) of this title, compensation shall be awarded under the Program to a petitioner if the special master or court finds on the record as a whole\u2014 (A) that the petitioner has provided credible evidence linking the alleged illness, disability, injury, or condition with the vaccine, unless (B) the respondent has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the alleged illness, disability, injury, or condition is not caused by the vaccine. Under this burden-shifting approach, the petitioner would have the initial burden of providing credible scientific evidence linking their injury with vaccination, but would not be required to prove causation by a preponderance of the evidence. If the petitioner provides credible evidence, the government would be responsible for demonstrating that the injury is not linked to the vaccine. In essence, this proposed revision to the Vaccine Act expands the safety net for vaccine-related injuries where there is credible evidence of a causal link. At the same time, it incentivizes research on vaccine-related adverse events\u2014at least on the part of the government\u2014by providing the government with an ability to deny compensation if the government can produce evidence to refute a causal link. Insofar as the legal tools th at can require collect ing and analysis of vaccine-related adverse events are in the hands of government agencies (i.e., the CDC and FDA), this burden-shifting framework also encourages robust data collection and analysis. Burden-shifting in a compensation fund is appropriate where, as is the case with immunizations, there are important publ ic health goals, there are significant challenges to proving causation, and a ma jority of the population benefits while the costs of injury fall on the few. Fu rthermore, unlike requiring that a party prove a null hypothesis, the aforementioned proposal would force the government to respond to credible scientific evidence or pay the claim. A burden-shifting paradigm also accounts for the immense challenges that petitioners face in terms of finding expert witnesses. In some cases, highly-qualified physicians who have opined that the data strongly suggest a causal relationship between a vaccine and an in jury have experienced intimidation and 2017] RECALIBRATING VACCINATION LAWS 2237 shaming.649 For example, one Harvard physician who was an expert for a petitioner was told that his testimony would ruin his reputation and jeopardize his ability to receive govern ment funding for research. 650 Although the physician initially opted to continue with the case, once the expert witness for the government reached out to the physician' s supervisor at Harvard, the physician dropped out of the case. 651 While the extent of such practices is unknown, the roadblocks faced by challengers to vaccine orthodoxy are well-documented.652 Furthermore, the compensation program guidelines contemplate a relaxed burden of causation in cases involving off-table injuries. For example, the guidelines indicate that a special master ma y evaluate \"new or novel theories of causation, particularly those involving new vaccines or rare conditions, [which] may lack any support in current medical literature.\" 653 In such cases the guidelines indicate that compensation may be appropriate even if \"the available epidemiological evidence suggests that the alleged injury is not one casually connected to a vaccine,\" so long as the petitioner can demonstrate that \"such studies, pre- or post-licensure for the vaccine in question, should not be relied upon in the case.\" 654 Shifting the legal burden of demonstrating causation also makes sense in light of the significant increase in the number of vacc ines, and the increase in the number of doctor visits during which children receive multiple vaccines. As CDC officials succinctly explain, not only has the number of vaccines increased, the number of combination vaccines ha s increased, as has \"the number of potential vaccine permutations that may be given simultaneously.\" 655 For example, in 1989, children received no more than two vaccines per visit, and no more than six vaccines in the first two years of life.656 Today, children receive up to five vaccines in a single visit and twenty-seven va ccines by age two.657 An adjusted standard of causation is unlikely to place a significant strain on the vaccine-injury compensation fund, as the fund has a net balance of over $3.6 billion. 658 From fiscal years 2014 to 2016, there were 247 petitions dismissed as non-compensable, 189 of which were non-autism claims.659 Even if all of the 649Myron Levin, Witnesses for Petitioners Are Often Tough to Find , L.A.

The excise tax has not been adjusted in over thirty years. 661 In the alternative, manufacturers could add resources to the Trust Fund, wh ereby funding could be linked to the incidence of vaccine adverse events for that manufacturer's vaccines.662 The filing of frivolous claims is unlikely to be a serious issue. Because of stringent guidelines surrounding the availability of attorneys' fees for vaccine petitions, vaccine court attorneys serve as gatekeepers against frivolous claims. Attorneys are legally precluded from taking vaccine petition cases on a contingency basis, and thus rely entirely on the attorney fee provision of the Vaccine Act. 663 However, the statute only allows for attorneys' fees if there existed an objectively reasonable basis for bringing the claim.664 Thus, there are strong incentives for attorn eys to take only those cases for which there is substantial evidence that a vaccine caused an injury. A burden-shifting framework that is grounded on the petitioner's ability to provide credible evidence of causation is unlikely to lead to frivolous claims, as attorneys' fees would be available only if credible evid ence of causation exis ted at the time the petition was filed. According to Dr. Geoffrey Ev ans, the Director of th e National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program from 1989-2012 , Congress created the program \"to compensate individuals quickly, easily, and generously,\" and \"it is only simple justice that individuals\" receive compensation for vaccine-related injuries. 665 Instituting a burden- shifting framework for off-tab le vaccine-rela ted injuries will help further these fundamental goals by expanding the safety net for 660Id. at 5-7. 661I.R.C. \u00a7 4131 (2012) (containing excise tax enacted in 1987). 662Indeed, the Vaccine Act does not punish manuf acturers, in a legal or economic sense, when a vaccine-injury petition is successful, but rather provides compensation to injured parties from the Trust Fund, which is funded entire ly from an excise tax paid by vaccinees or their health insurers. The notion of linki ng funding from vaccine manufacturers to the incidence of adverse events is di scussed in Schwartz & Mahshigian, supra supra note 4, at S130-31. As one comp rehensive report concluded, it is imperative that the Vaccine Act provides \"equitable treatment, transparency, and justice to those children who have the grave misfortune to be injured by the very vaccines intended to keep them healthy.\" Mary Holland et al., Unanswered Questions from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program: A Review of Compensated Cases of Vaccine-Induced Brain Injury , 28 P ACE ENVTL . L. REV. 480, 481 (2011). 2017] RECALIBRATING VACCINATION LAWS 2239 vaccine-related injuries, which in turn might help build public trust in immunization programs.666 E. Mandatory Minimum Investment of Trust Fund Proceeds for Vaccine Research and Development Consider again that the Vaccine Act's Trust Fund has a net balance of over $3.6 billion.667 Although the Vaccine Act indicates that one of the responsibilities of the National Vaccine Program is to \"coordinate and provide direction\" for vaccine research and development, 668 there is no statutory obligation to use Trust Fund revenues for vaccine research. In part, this may be because Congress anticipated that the tax revenue would be needed entirely to account for compensation awards and ad ministrative costs of the program. 669 To further the Vaccine Act's mandate \"to achieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions to vaccines,\"670 lawmakers should establish a mandatory minimum of Trust Fund proceeds that are allocated annually for vaccine research. This may be accomplished by adding a subparagraph (C) to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9510(c)(1). 671 The new subparagraph could be based on the following: \u00a7 9510. Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund . . . . (c) Expenditures from Trust Fund (1) In general . . . . (C) payment for vaccine research and development as may be recommended by the Director of the National Vacci ne Program under section 300aa-2 of title 42, provided that annual payments under this subparagraph shall be no less than one percent of the Trust Fund. In turn, the Director of the National Vaccine Program, in consultation with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (comprising offi cials from CDC, FDA, and NIH), can determine which vaccine proj ects to fund. The research program could be administered through the NIH, which has extensive experience and expertise in reviewing and funding research. Funding priorities also may be suggested by vaccine innovation reports mandated by the 21st Century Cures 666Apart from the burden-shifting approach outli ned in this Article, some commentators have called for other methods of relaxing the petitioner's burden of proof. See, e.g. , Grey, supra note 30, at 410-13; Meyers, supra note 21, at 845-47. 667TRUST FUND addition to the new subparagraph (C), the period at the end of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9510(c)(1)(B) should be deleted and replaced with: 2240 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 97:2153 Act; these reports establish vaccine innovation priorities and consider vaccine information dissemination to key stakeholders.672 If implemented, the first year under this proposal would lead to an injection of at least $36 million in funding for vaccine research and development. In years where the total value of fund-worthy research proposals do not meet the mandatory minimum in funding allocations from the Trust Fund, the NIH can carry forward the remaining balance. In sofar as the mandatory minimum is a small percentage of the Trust Fund, the funding amount is unlikely to cause economic disruption to compensation program funds. That said, the one-percent mandatory minimum can be revisited should the funding amount become unsustainable. To align Trust Fund investments in vaccine research with the Vaccine Act's mandate, the Director should work to ensure that funding projects include research related to vaccine developmen t, safety and efficacy evaluations, refinement of existing vaccines, improvements in vaccine production, public health outreach, and ethical issues in immunizations and immunization policy. This research also might include inquir ies into alternative vaccine schedules. 673 Although research into alternative vaccine schedules is not risk free and may serve to challenge established precedent (and perhaps exacerbate lack of public trust), using science to dire ctly address the concerns of vaccine-hesitant parents is, in the long run, likely to help answer questions and alleviate fear. 674 As the IOM concluded, assessments of safety and efficacy concerns regarding \"global assessments of [the] entire sequence of immunizations\" is \"fragmentary and inconclusive on many issues.\" 675 Physicians and vaccine manufacturers s hould not be preclu ded from receiving funding pursuant to this program. In fact, providing physicians and manufacturers with funding may be a fruitful means of offsetting part of the costs of increased post-market reporting and analysis, as proposed in Section III.A of this Article. In a sense, this w ould underscore the sy mbiotic relationship and shared goals amongst physicians, industry, government, and the public. 67221st Century Cures Act, Pub. L.

Building and maintaining public trust is a fundamental principle of public health ethics. 679 The proposals outlined in this Article leverage the \"amazing array of new techniques for vaccine design and delivery\"680 to address the government's failure to institute and enforce robust reporting and analysis of vaccine safety and efficacy. Three decade s of experience have provided a wealth of information that should be used to analyze which parts of the Vaccine Act work well and which do not. Recalibrating vaccination laws to account for twenty-first century innovations will help build public trust and further the public health goals of immunization policy. 6761985 IOM REPORT , supra note 17, at 8, 80.
