Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Division, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 20 Glossary for Homeopathic Products: Active substance: Active substances are considered to be source materials processed by one or a sequence of homeopathic manufacturing procedures listed in pharmacopoeias in official use and other off icially recognized documents (e.g. mother tinctures, dilutions or triturations). Diluent: Substance used for the preparation of a stock/ starting material or the potentisation process and which may also represent the substance of the dosage form. Liquid d iluents usually consist of purified water, aqueous solution, glycerol or ethanol of a suitable concentration or for which there is an appropriate monograph. The commonest solid diluent is usually lactose monohydrate. Dilution: Dilution has two meanings i n homeopathy: For a product, a dilution is a liquid homeopathic preparation which is potentised as described below (see the definition of potentisation). Individual dilutions are also called potencies; As a procedure, dilution means the de -concentration pr ocess of a liquid or a solid preparation. One part of each stage in the preparation of a homeopathic medicine from its stock or previous dilution (potency) by adding one part of a previous solid or liquid phase to a predetermined weight or volume of the di luent (see Potentisation below). Dilution occurs at all stages of production of the homeopathic medicines whether by addition of solid excipient in trituration or the addition of diluent in the liquid phase and succussion. Dosage form: a dosage form in ho meopathy complies with any relevant specifications for that dosage form for which an appropriate characterization exists in a pharmacopoeia in official use, or in other officially recognized documents. The most commonly encountered homeopathic dosage form, the globule (pillule or pellet) , is a solid spherule which consists of lactose, sucrose or any other suitable vehicle. Usually, preformed globules are impregnated with a dilution or directly by a mother tincture. The homeopathic dosage form tablet is a so lid preparation which complies with any relevant characterization in the pharmacopoeia in official use (or in other officially recognized documents) for tablets. Homeopathic medicines in tablet form are either prepared by impregnation of preformed tablets or by compression of triturations with the vehicle. The most commonly used liquid homeopathic medicines are either alcoholic solutions or oral liquids. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Division, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 21 Excipient: Substance needed for manufacturing a dosage form (used after potentisation) such as wheat st arch and magnesium stearate for tablets. It may also represent the substance of the dosage form. Homeopath: A qualified provider (practitioner) of homeopathic treatment. Homeopathic medicines: Any medicine prepared in accordance with a homeopathic manuf acturing procedure described by a pharmacopoeia in official use or other officially recognized documents. A homeopathic medicine may contain a number of homeopathic preparations. Homeopathy: Classical homeopathy is a system of medicine using preparations of substances whose effects, when administered to healthy subjects, correspond to the manifestations of the disorder in the individual pat ients. Mother tincture (also called tincture): The initial homeopathic preparation made from source material that can be further potentised (also called \"liquid stock\"), sometimes used as homeopathic medicines, is regarded as the most concentrated form of a finished homeopathic medicine. Mother tinctures are obtained classically by maceration or percolation (sometimes also by digestion, infusion, decoction or fermentation) techniques from source materials according to a procedure prescribed by a recognized homeopathic pharmacopoeia. Sometimes a mother tincture corresponds to the first decimal dilution, \"1D\" or \"1X\" (10 -1), mostly when dry plant material is used as starting material. Nosodes: Homeopathic medicines prepared from disease products from humans or animals; from pathogenic organisms or their metabolic products; or from decomposition products of animal organs . Potency: The denominated degree of serial trituration or dilution and succession that is reached for each homeopathic medicine. The degrees of dilution or potencies are normally indicated by the letters D, DH or X for successive 1 to 10 (decimal) diluti ons, the letters C, CH or K or CK for successive 1 to 100 (centesimal) dilutions while Q or LM denote successive 1 to 50 000 (Hahnemannian quinquagintamillesimal) dilutions. Dilution by 1 to 10 denotes 1 part processed with 9 parts of diluent (Hahnemannian decimal), dilution by 1 to 100, 1 part processed with 99 parts (Hahnemannian or Korsakovian centesimal), and so on. The number preceding the letters (e.g. D, C or LM) normally indicates the number of dilution steps employed (Table 1). Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Division, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 22 As a consequence of different views in various approaches in homeotherapy and because the notion of these terms may depend on the nature of the starting materials, the terms \"high potency\" and \"low potency\" cannot be defined unambiguously. Potentisation called dinamiz ation): The combined process of serial dilution and succussion or trituration at each step in the manufacture of homeopathic medicines from stocks. (According to the tenet of homeopathy, potentisation represents the process by which the activity of a homeo pathic medicine is developed.) Table I: Potency the Hahnemannian method of ma nufacture (multi -flask method) is used. bFor 1:100 dilution ratios a C potency is assumed to use the Hahnemannian method of manufacture (multi -flask method) and can also be denoted as CH. When the Korsakovian method of manufacture (single -flask method) is used, the potency is designated as CK or K. Sarcodes: Homeopathic medicines made from healthy animal tissues or secretions. In Greek, sarcode means fleshly. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Division, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 23 Source material (raw material, starting material, mother substance): Source material is the origi nal raw material used for the production of homeopathic medicines. This material is obtained from natural sources, e.g. of botanical, zoological, microbiological, mineral, chemical, animal and human origin, or synthetic procedures. Source materials may und ergo preliminary treatment in order to be further processed. Stock: Substances or preparations made from the source materials (e.g. by maceration, succussion or trituration) used as starting points for the produc tion of homeopathic medicines.

Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 47 1.2.2 BIOLOGICS 1. Definition: The term 'biopharmaceutical' was coi ned in the 80's to define proteins that were made by recombinant DN A technology [which includes hybridoma technology for monoclonal antibody (mAb) production] . 1.1 Biologic/ Biological product refers to a product whose active substance is made by or de rived f rom a living organism (plant, human, animal or microorganism) and m ay be produced by bi otech nology methods and other cutting -edge technologies. This product imita tes natural biological substances in our bodies such as hormones, enzymes or antibodie s. 1.2 Biological substance is defined as a substance that is produced by or extracted from a bi ologi cal source and that needs, for its characterization and the determinati on of its quality , a combination of physicochemical - biological testing together with t he prod uction process and its controls. 1.3 Biopharmaceuticals/ Biologics/ Bi ological products ca n als o be defined as: \"a protein (including antibodies) or nucleic acid -based pharmaceuticals used for therapeutic, which is produced by means other than direct extract ion from a native (non -engineered) biological source\". This corres ponds to the new bio techn ology view (that is, by elimination, it is largely restricted to recomb inant/ genetically engineered and mAb -based products) term 'Biotechnology produ ct' and 'Biological product' are used to broadly refer to all biopharmaceu ticals (by the broad biotechnology view). Note: Today, biologics have become inextricably int ertwined with biopharmaceuticals, to the point where they are synonymous. The general consen sus is that the term 'Biologic' and 'Biopharmaceutical' are in terch angeable . Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Division, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 48 Biolo gics include a wide range of products such as: vaccines , blood products , monoclonal antibodies (therapeutics) , recombinant proteins (including but not limited to i nsulin s, hormones, erythropoetins and other hematopoietic factors), cytoki nes (including but not limited to interferons, interleukins, colony -stimulating factors, tumour necrosis factors), cell and gene therapy products (CGTPs). But does not include: Metabolit es from microorganisms; e.g antibiotics nucleotides produced by chemical sy nthesis; Whole blood or cellular blood components. 2. For detail on registration of Biolo gics p roducts, please refer Appendix 3: Guidelin e on Registration of Biologics. Note: This document is not intended to app ly on the control of genetically modified live organisms designed to be used directly i n huma ns, e.g. live vaccines 3. Unlike small -molecule generic drugs, exact c opies of biologics are impossible to produce because these are large and highly complex molecul es produced in living cells. A 'biosimilar'medicinal product (a short designation for 'simil ar biological medicinal product') is considered as a new biological medicinal product d evelo ped to be similar in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to an alread y registered, well established, medicinal product. For details, please refer to Guideline on Registration for Biosimilars in Malaysia. 4. Cell and gene therapy products (CGTPs) is regulated as Biolo gic products. Unlike biotechnology products which are mostly purifi ed proteins of cells, CG TPs contain living and functional cells. Therefore, CGTP is regulated under a separate framework. For details, please refer to: Guidance Document and Guidelines F or Registration of Cell and Gene Therapy (CGTPs). This document provides infor mation for manufacturers, applicants, healthcare professionals and the general public o n leg al arrangem ents in Malaysia for the registration of CGTPs. The impleme ntation of the guideline will be compulsory on 1 January 2021 as stated in the Directive No. BPFK/PPP/07/25(11)Jld.1: Direktif Untuk Menguatk uasakan Penggunaan Guidance Document And Guideline For Registration Of Cell And Gene Therapy Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Division, Ministry of Health Malaysia.

In recent years, many consumers al so rely on a variety of \"dietary supplements \" to improve their health. These diverse products are freely available through a myriad of outlets. A variety of products are available in the market, supposedly for the maintenance, prevention and even treatment of chronic diseases. These products may ran ge from food s modified to have s pecial properties or pure forms of vitamins an d minerals to extract of various botanical or anima l products. It is important to monitor and regulate the marketing and sale of the se pr oducts so as to protect the interest an d health of the consumer. Some o f these products are not clearly defined as \"f ood\" or \"drugs\" but are freely marketed. Such produ cts include a variety of so -called health products and have been termed as \"food -drug in terphase (FDI) products\". In order to better defin e and regulate the F DI products, both the NPRA and the FSQD, Minis try of Health Malaysia formed the Committee for the Classification of Food - Drug Interphase Products in 2000. The main Terms of Referen ce of the Committee is to assist both Divisi ons in class ifying, in a consist ent manner, an application from the industry w hich is not clearly defined either as a food or dru g product. The Committee also serves as a platform in strengthening and updating th e relevant regulations as well as to provide scientific input on these produ cts.

Studies comparing availability or establishing equivalence of similar products would be useful. B) BIOEQUIVALENCE (BE) STUDY Note: This requirement is applicabl e to generics (scheduled poison) only . With the increasing availabili ty of generic products, a mechanism is required to ensure that such products are th erapeutically equ ivalent to the innovators' products and are clinically interchangeable. In practice, demonstration of bioequivalence (BE) is generally the most appropriate method of substantiating therapeutic equivalence between medicinal products. A lis t of drug substan ces, which, when formulated in oral solid dosage forms, require BE data as a prerequis ite for registration, has been establ ished by the authority (please re fer to NPRA website at https://ww w.npra.gov.my ). This list is updated based on the requirements. Bioequivalence (BE ) Study Requirem ents for Generic Product in Immediate Release, Oral Solid Dosa ge Form Submitted as a Second Source Application In general, for a second source application of a generi c product (immedi ate release, oral solid dosage form), BE study report fr om the actual ma nufacturing site must be submitted during the submission of ap plicatio n for registra tion. The base of this requirement is due to the difference in manufacturing site f rom the first sou rce that may change the characteristic and specification s of a second so urce product. However, biowaiver ca n be considered, provided that Co mparative Diss olution Profile (CPD) report against the registered first source product is submitt ed as a surrogate to bioequivalence study conducted for the second source product and all the following conditions sh all be fu lfilled: Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 213 a) Bioequivalence study co nducted using the registered first source product has been evaluated by the NPRA and found satisf actory. b) The seco nd source product is the same as registered first source product used in the bioequivalence study in terms of : i) Product formulation; ii) Equipment used in the m anufacturing process; iii) Source and supplier of raw material; iv) Quality control and spec ifications of raw material; v) Manufacturing process of product and standard operating proce dures; vi) Environmental conditions durin g the manufacturing proce ss of pr oduct; vii) Quality control and specifications of finished product. c) Comparative Dissolution Profile m ust be conducted in accordance to ASEAN Guidelines for the Conduct of Bio availability and Bioequivalence Studies including the calculation of similarit y factor (f2) to prove the similarity of these two products. d) Process validation has been conducted on 3 pilot or commerci al batches of the second source product and found satisf actory by the NPRA. This exemption is not applicable for any new submission o f applic ation for regi stration of a first source product. BE study must be conducted for this produ ct which is manufactu red at the actual manufacturing site submitted for regis tration . (Refer ence: Circular Bil.(10)dlm.BPFK/PPP/07/18Jld.1 , 2 Jun 2011 ) Starting on 1st of January 2012, bioequivalence (BE) study is re quired for all a pplication of registrations for gener ic products containing sc heduled poison in the form of immediate release, oral, solid dosage form whereas renewal of registered pr oducts, the effec tive date is on 1st January 2013.

Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 218 3.1 GENERAL I NFORMATION 3.1.1 DEFINITIONS: i) Biopharmaceutical/ Biotechnology Product ii) Biologic/ Bio logical Produc t The term 'biopharmaceutical' was coined in the 80's to defi ne proteins that were made by recombi nant DNA technology [whic h includes hybridoma technology for monoclonal antibody (mAb) production]. Biologic/ Biological product refers to a p roduct whose a ctive substance is made by or derived from a living organism ( plant, human, animal or microorganism ) and may be produced by biotechnology methods and other cutting -edge technologies. This product imitates natural biological substances in our bodies such a s hormones, enzymes or antibodies. Biopharmaceuticals/ Biolo gics/ Biological prod ucts can also be \"a protein ( including antibodies) or nucleic acid-based pharmaceuticals used for therapeutic, which is produced by means other tha n direct extra ction from a native (non - engineered) biological source\". Thi s corresponds to the new biotechnolog y view (that is, by elimi nation, it is largely restricted to recombinant/ genetically engineered and mAb -based products). The term 'Biotechnol ogy product' a nd 'Biological product' are used to broadly refer to all armaceuticals (by the broad biotechno have become inextri cably intertwined with biopharmaceuticals, to the point where they are synonymous. Th e general cons ensus is that a 'Biologic' and 'Biopharmaceutical' are interch angeable terminology, but a biologic might incorporate some ot her products (e.g. allergenics, somatic cells etc.). Biologics include a wide range of products such as: 1. Vaccines; 2. Blood products; 3. Monoclonal antibodies (therapeutics); 4. Recombinant proteins: - Insulins - Hormones - Erythropoetins and other hematopoietic facto rs - Cytokines: i nterferons, inter leukins, colony -stimulating factors, tumour necrosis factors.

Cell and Gene Therapy Pr oducts (CGTPs) But does not include: Metabolites from and by chemic al synthesis; e.g peptides/oligo -nucleotides produced by chemical synthesis. Whole blood or cellular blood components. Note: This do cument is not intended to apply to the control of genetically -modified live organis ms designed to b e used directly in humans , e.g. live vaccines. 3.1.2 INTRODUCTION It is acknowledged that biological substances used in the practice of med icines make a vital contribution to health care. Nevertheless, because of t heir nature, biologic als demand speci al attention with regard to their regulations to assure quality, efficacy and safety. Biologicals are inherently variable due to their biologic al nature, pro duced from biological materials, and often tested in biologica l test systems, thems elves variable, a feature that has import ant consequences for the safety and efficacy of the resulting product. Each product must be evaluated on its own merit s. A prerequi site for the use of biological is therefore to assure the cons istency of quality an d safety from lo t- to-lot. Today, the bio logical field is one of enormous expansion and increasing diversity, most especially in the area of new biotechnologie s. The revolu tion of DNA -based and other cell technologies has opened up a new and exciting vist a, and in many instances, traditional pro ducts are being replaced by equi valents derived by recombinant DNA technologies or other cutting -edge technologies. It is important to note that the demonstration that a product consistently pos sesses a desired char acteristics of s afety and efficacy will d epend on a multifaceted approach on the part of manufacturer and the regulatory authority - drawing on thorough charac terization of starting materials, demonstration of consistency of production , and appropriate sel ection of lot re lease tests - all under t he stringent and documented cont rols imposed by good manufacturing practices - as well as rigorous post marketing surv eillance activ ities.

Plasma -derived the rapies and their recombinant analo among pharmaceu ticals and biologics. Thei r production begins with a biological starting material, human plasma. Each therapy has a u nique bio chemical profile as a result of differences in production and proc essing methods th at can lead to di ffering clinical responses an d efficacy among patients. Hence, from the starting material, through manufacturing and final distribution to patie nts, the complexities of producing blood products places it in a unique cla ss of biologics. Blood products a re regul ated as medicinal pro duct. Blood products are in herently variable due to their biological nature, and the biological methods to test them. They are subjected to comprehensive assessment of the quality, efficacy and safety. Four (4) principal com plementa ry approaches are ado pted: Starting material: Assurance of the quality and safety of the plasma for fractionation. Manufacturing techniq ue: Cont rol of the fractionation and subsequent manufacturing procedures f or isolation, pur ification, viral inactivation and/or removal steps. Good manufacturing pr actice (GMP): Strict adherence to GMP. Adoption of GMP as an essential tool of Quality As surance S ystem. Product Compliance: Standardization of biological methods needed in charact erisation of in -process a nd finished products.

Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 380 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. A significant part of the quality of a finished product is dependent on the quality of the Active Pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs ) used for its formulation. Thus, a proper system of qualification of suppliers is necessary to ensure a constant sourcing of APIs of appropriate quality and to safeguard the public health interests. This will be do ne through standardized quality assessmen t and inspection procedures. 1.2. The National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Division (NPRA ) under the purview of the Ministry of Health Malaysia has introduce d mandatory control of APIs as part of the requirements in the p roduct registration application. 1.3. The implementation began with voluntary submission fo r New Drug Products in April 2011 and followed by; Phase 1 - New Drug Products (January 2012) Phase 2 - Scheduled Poison a) New Application (Generic Product): - i. Parente ral Dosage Form : 1July 2014 ii. Oral Dosage Form : 1July 2016 iii. Others : 1 July 2018 b) Registered Product (Pharmaceutical products containing Scheduled Poison): - All Dosage Form : Expire on 1 January 2020 onwards * API Information must be submitted at le ast one year before the expiry date.

Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 381 1.4 The procedure for cont rol of APIs established by the NPRA is based on the following principles: A general understanding of the production and qu ality control activities of the manufacturer; Assessment of API s data and information, incl uding changes and variations, submitted b y the product registration holder (PRH) /API Manufacturer . These data should include the manufacturing process, material specifications and test data and results; Assessment of the manufacturing site(s) for consisten cy in production and quality control of r aw materials, with specific emphasis on key raw materials and APIs during and after purification through compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice( GMP ); Random sampling and testing of APIs (post -marketing surveill ance) ; Handling of complaints and recalls ; and Monitoring of complaints from other agencies and countries. 1.5. This guideline is intended to provide guidance regarding the requirement s to be included for API s in the quality part of the product dossier (Part I I-S).

DEFINITION 2.1 DEFINITION OF ACTI VE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT (API) Any substance or mixture of substances intended to be used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical dosage form and that, when used so, becomes an active ingredient of that pharmace utical dosage form. Such substances are i ntended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease or to affect the structure and fun ction of the body (WHO Technical Report Series No.970,2012). 2.2 CLASSIFICATION OF ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT (API) API classification can be divided into: Inorganic substance s; Organic substances (iso lated from material s of animal or human o rigin); and Organic substances (synthetic or semi -synthetic or isolated from herbal sources or micro -organisms). Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 383 3. SCOPE 3.1. This Guideline encompasses the final APIs of new products for registratio n and current/ exist in registered products. This is applicable to all pharmaceutical products (excluding traditional products , veterinary products, and health supplement products ) both locally manufactured and imported. 3.2. Biological active substances and immu nological active substances are excluded from the scope of this Guideline . Please refer to relevant guidelines available for Biologics. 3.3. APIs used in products for export only (FEO) are exempted from the requirement for submission of the Drug Master File (D MF) and Certification of Suitability (CEP ) in the product application. 3.4. Premixing of API is part of the product manufacturing process; therefore information on premixed API sh ould be submitted under Part II -P. Submission for Part II -S solely includes infor mation on API only. 3.5. Separate registratio n of the API is not requirement for the purpose of product registration. However, the required technical documentation pertaining to each API should be submitted with the new product registration application. 3.6. Asses sment of an API will be performed once su bmission of a new product registration application has been done. 3.7. Assessment of an API will also be performed for a registered product prior to a product renewal application (as stated in item 1.3).

OPTION 1 : DRUG MASTER FILE (DMF) 5.1. The Drug Master File (DMF) is a document that may used to provide confidential detailed information about facilities, processes, or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of one or more human drugs. 5.2. The DMF submitted to the NPRA should co ntain the information as required under sections listed in Part II -S ACTD. 5.3. DMF is generally created to allow an authorized party other than the holder of the DMF to refer the DMF without disclosing the contents of the file to any other party. 5.4. The ICH M4Q Technical Guideline and ASEAN Common T echnical Requirements (ACTR) / ACTD provide details on the information to be included in the API sections of an application dossier. 5.5. Where the API and the finished product are manufactured by the same manufacturer, i nformation on the production, quality c ontrol and stability of the API may be submitted as part of the dossier for the finished product (ACTD) rather than in a separate DMF. However, the company is not precluded from submitting a DMF for the API. 5.6. The DMF is divided into two parts , namely the O pen (or PRH's) part and the Closed (or restricted) part. 5.7 The documents required for an application making a reference to a DMF are as follows: From the PRH : o Open part of the DMF, as part of the submitted product d ossier (t he open part contains most of the information in Part II-S (ACTD) - i.e. sections S1, S2.1 and S3 to S7 ); S1 General Information 1.1 Nomenclature 1.2 Structure 1.3 General Properties Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia.

Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 389 o An original Letter of Access. The Letter of Access from API Manufacturer/ holder of the DMF authorizes the NPRA to refer to the DMF, in support of the application for a finished product . Thus, the Letter of Access must state the following: The name of the finished product (product name, dosage form and product strength) to be registered; The PRH responsible for finished product regi stration; and, A declaration that both the PRH and the NPRA shall be notified of any change in the API specification or in the manufacturing process that will likely affect the product's quality or safety. The PRH is responsible to ensure that the comple te DMF (i.e. both the Open part and the closed part ) submitted to NPRA directly by the API Manufacturer . 5.8. The API Manufacturer may submit the DMF via electronic copy ( CD) directly to the NPRA to maintain confidentiality of the contents. The information con tained in the closed part of the DMF wi ll be regarded as confidential and will only be evaluated in support of the applications mentioned in the Letter of Access. The confidential information will not be disclosed to any third party without a written autho rization from the API Manufacturer. 5.9. Separate DMF must be provided for each API for: i. Finished product contains more than one API ii. API from different manufacturing site iii. API from different synthesis route 5.10. Upon receipt of the DMF, a BPFK/NPRA DMF number will be assigned to the application for pro duct registration. For future correspondences, the PRH and the API Manufacturer should make a reference to the BPFK/NPRA DMF number. The NPRA will directly contact API Manufacturer for any correspondence pertaining to API information in closed part. The PR H is required to include a copy of the API Manufacturer's Letter of Access in the application. 5.11. API Manufacturer is responsible to maintain and update the DMF. The PRH should file a variation once they are notified wi th the changes to the DMF. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 390 5.12. API Manu facturer Obligations: Any change or addition, including a change in authorization related to specific PRH , shall be submitted to the NPRA in duplicate and adequately cross - referenced to previous submission(s). The refe rence volu me(s), section(s), and/or page number(s) affected. Should any change to a DMF is necessary, the API Manufacturer shall notify each affected PRH who has referenced the DMF of the pertinent change. Such notice should be provided well before making the change in order to permit the PRH to supplement or amend any affected application(s) as needed. 5.13. The DMF is not required for common inorganic salts (for example, sodium chloride, and other common electrolytes) used and regar ded as API in products such as injecti ons and dialysis solutions, and simple organic compounds available commercially in high purity (for example, natural occurring organic acids and their salts, including ascorbic acid and sodium citrate, and simple mono - and disaccharides such as glucose and sucrose). Although a DMF is not required for these API, evidence needs to be submitted by the PRH that the API is obtained from a reliable source and consistently comply with the applicable pharmacopoeial specificatio ns. Any non -pharmacopoeial specificati ons need to be assessed by the NPRA to determine their appropriateness and adequacy to ensure the quality of the API. 5.14. Where a DMF is submitted for an API controlled according to a pharmacopoeia monograph, the DMF shou ld include a discussion of the potenti al impurities most likely to arise during synthesis using the actual manufacturing process described in the DMF together with evidence that these impurities are adequately controlled by the test procedures described in the pharmacopoeia monograph. Where pa rticular impurities found in the substance are not listed in the monograph, a justification (including toxicological data, if appropriate) should be provided. Details on the principles for the control of impurities (e. g. reporting, identification and quali fication) are outlined in the ICH Q3Aand Q3C guidelines.

Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 397 A letter of commitment (to provide complete long term stability data when study is completed/when requested) should be submitted. 8.3. Where the API is sourced from multiple sites or fro m different route of synthesis, stabi lity data from each source should be provided. 8.4. The NPRA may request for additional stability data if deemed necessary for the evaluation of the application. 8.5. Stability data is not required where the CEP specifies a re -test period that is the same as or of longer duration than the re -test period proposed by the PRH. 9. MANUFACTURING SITE INSPECTION 9.1. Depending on the outcome of the evaluation of the API dossier, a risk -based approach will be used in the planning of manufa cturing site inspections ; the approa ch wil l take into account the typ e of APIs as well as the outcome, results and reports of inspections conducted by other regulatory authorities or competent organiz ations. 9.2. The NPRA shall plan and coordinate the perform ance of inspections at the manufactu ring s ite of the API and that of the key intermediate (if relevant) to assess compliance with the relevant sections of the relevant GMP Guidelines, and to compare the technical information on the manufacturing process gi ven in the API dossier with the manu factur ing process actually carried out on the manufacturing site. 9.3. All such inspections shall be performed by inspectors deemed to possess sufficient qualifications and experience. In order to perform such inspections, the inspectors have to be competent in are as such as production and quality control of pharmaceuticals, and have appropriate experience in the area of GMP. Such inspectors shall perform the inspections and report on its findings in accordance with establis hed S tandard Operating Procedure s (SOPs) so as to ensure a standard harmoniz ed approach.

MAINTENANCE OF APPROVAL STATUS 10.1. Manufacturer of finished product should establish a mechanism by which manufacturers/suppliers of an API shall provide informatio n on any changes (i.e., var iations) in manufacture and control that may have impact on the safety, purity and quality of the API. The PRH is responsible to provide the NPRA with the appropriate documentation (referring to relevant parts of the dossier) to prove that any intend ed or implemented variation will not have an impact on the safety, purity and quality of the API that has been previously approved. For those APIs approved by the NPRA, an evaluation of such variations shall be performed with accordance to the Malaysian Variation Guidelines (MVG) . 10.2. Random samples of APIs supplied to manufacturers of finished products may be taken for independent testing if needed. Certificates of Analysis released by the API Manufacturer as well as specif ications for test methods shall be p rovide d by the API Manufacturer or the PRH to the NPRA for review upon request. In the event of failure to meet the established criteria for testing, the NPRA shall proceed to investigate and communicate this problem to the manufacturer concerned. 10.3. The NPRA may conduct a re -evaluation of the APIs at a 5 years interval. If, as a result of this re -evaluation, found that an API and/or specified manufacturing site(s) no longer complies with the recommended standards, such AP Is and manufacturing sites will be removed from the approved list. Prior notice to the PRH and API Manufacturer shall be issued from the NPRA regarding such decision. 10.4. Re-evaluation may also be done in any situation deemed necessary, including the followin g: If any omissions by the manufac turer in the initial assessment procedure or during the follow -up activities is evident in relation to the requirements. This includes compliance with GMP. If any batch(s) of supplied API is considered not to be in comp liance with the agreed specification of the API; If the CEP, or an API for which a CEP dossier was submitted, is cancelled or refused based on the assessment of the dossier for any other reason; and, If in the opinion of the NPRA, changes made in the sou rcing of key intermediates, route of synth esis, facility or other production, require that reassessment be made.

SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFI C) Package Insert a) Warnings Diabetes Mellitus : Hyperglycaemia in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotics use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patie nts with schizoph renia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given this confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycaemia -related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment -emergent hyperglycaemia -related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia -related adverse events in patients treated with a typical antipsych otics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g. obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atyp ical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycaemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycaemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood gluc ose testing.

SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFI C) Contraindications In children below the age of 12 years for the symptomati c trea tment of colds due t o an increased risk of developing serious and life -threatening adve rse reactions. In all paediatric patients (0 -18 years of age) who undergo tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrom e due to increased risk of developing seriou s and life-threatening adverse reactions. In women who are breastfe eding. In patients for whom it is known they are CYP2D6 ultra -rapid metabolisers. Special Warnings and Precautions for use CYP2D6 metabolism Codeine is metabol ised b y the liver enzyme C YP2D6 into morphine, its active metabolite. If a patient has a defi ciency or is completely lacking this enzyme an adequate analgesic effect will not be obtained. Estimates indicate that up to 7% of the Caucasian population may hav e this deficiency. However , if the patient is an extensive or ultra -rapid metaboliser there i s an increased risk of developing side effects of opioid toxicity even at commonly prescribed doses. These patients convert codeine into morphine rapidly resulting in higher than expected serum morphine levels. General symptoms of opioid toxicity include confusion, somnolence, shallow breathing, small pupils, nausea, vomiting, constipation and lack of appetite. In severe cases this may include sym ptoms of circulato ry and respiratory depress ion, which may be life -threatening and very rarely fatal. Estimates of prevalence of ultra -rapid metabolisers in different populations are summarised below: Population Prevalence % African/Ethiopian 29% African American 3.4 to 6 .5% Asian 1.2 to 2.0% Caucasian 3.6 to 6.5% Greek 6.0% Hungarian 1.9% Northern European 1.0 to 2.0% Post-operative use in children There have been reports in the published literature that codeine given post - operatively in children after tonsillectom y and/ or adenoidectomy for obstructive sleep apnoea, led to rare, but life -threatening advers e events including death. All children received doses of codeine that were within the appropriate dose Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia.

SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFI C) range; however there was evidence that the se children were e ither ultra-rapid or exten sive metabolisers in their ability to metabolise codeine to morphin e. Children with compromised respiratory function Codeine is not recommended for use in children in whom respiratory function might be compromis ed including neuro muscul ar disorders, severe cardiac or respiratory conditions, upper respiratory or lung infec tions, multiple trauma or extensive surgical procedures. These factors may worsen symptoms of morphine toxicity. 3.Pregnancy and Lactation Pregnancy Careful con sidera tion should be given before prescribing the product for pregnant patients. Opioid analg esics may depress neonatal respiration and cause withdrawal effects in neonates of dependent mothers. As a precautionary measure, use of [Product name] should be a voided during the third tr imester of pregnancy and during labor. Breastfeeding [Product name ] is contraindicated in women during breastfeeding. At normal therapeutic doses codeine and its active metabolite may be present in breast milk at very low doses and is unlikely to adverse ly affect the breast fed infant. However, if the patient is an ultr a-rapid metaboliser of CYP2D6, higher levels of the active metabolite, morphine, may be present in breast milk and on very rare occasions may res ult in symptoms of opioi d toxicity in the in fant, which may be fatal.

During post -marketing surveillan ce, there have been very rare cases of QT -prolongation and torsades de pointe s in patients taking domperidone. These reports included patients with confounding risk factors, electrolyte abnormalities and concomitant treatment which may have been contributi ng factors (see Adverse Reactions). Epidemiological studies showed that domp eridone was associated with an increased risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death (see Adverse Reactions). A higher risk was observed in patients older than 60 years, patients taking daily doses greater than 30 mg, and patients concu rrently taking QT-prolonging drugs or CYP3A4 inhibitors. Domperidone should be used at the lowest effective dose in adults and children. Domperidone is contraindicated in patien ts with known existing prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals, particul arly QTc, in (hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia), or bradycardia, or in patients with underlying cardiac diseases suc h as congestive heart failure due to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia (see Contraindications).

Monitoring of hepatic function Monitor liver function in all patients receiving tre atment with ketoconazole tablets. Monitor liver fun ction prior to treatment to rule out ac ute or chr onic liver disease (see CONTRAINDICATIONS), after two weeks of treatment and then on a monthly basis and at the first signs or symptoms of possible hepatic toxicity. When the liver function tests indicate l iver injury, the treatment should be st opped imme diately. A risk and benefit evaluation should be made before oral ketoconazole is used in cases of non -life threatening diseases requiring long treatme nt periods. In patients with elevated liver enzyme s, or who have experienced liver toxici ty with ot her drugs, treatment should not be started unless the expected benefit exceeds the ri sk of hepatic injury. In such cases, close monitoring of the liver enzymes is necessary.

Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazep ines Profound sedation, r espiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of <product name> with benzodiazepines. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioids and benzodiazepines increases the risk of d rug-related mo rtality comp ared to use of opioids alone. Because of these risks, reserve concomit ant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. If the decision is made to newly prescribe a benzodia zepine and an opioid toget her, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of c oncomitant use. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 557 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFI C) If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine in a patient already receiving an opioid, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodia zepine than in dicated in t he absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If the decision is made to prescribe an opioid in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid, and titrate based on cli nical response . Follow p atients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and s edation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when <product name> is used with benzodiazepines. Advise pat ients not to d rive o r oper ate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzod iazepine have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose an d death associ ated w ith th e use of benzodiazepines (See Drug Interactions). 2. Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life -threatening condition, have been reported during concurrent use of <p roduct name> w ith serotone rgic drugs (See Interactions with Other Medicaments). This may occur w ithin the recommended dosage range. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental -status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g. gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) and can be fatal (See Interactions with Other Medicaments). The ons et of symptoms generally o ccurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may o ccur later than that. Discontinue <product name> if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 3. Adrenal Insufficiency of adrenal insufficiency have been reported wi th opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insuf ficiency may include non -specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If ad renal insuffic iency is sus pected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possi ble. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement dosing of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to reco ver and cont inue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia.

Other o pioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify an y particular o pioids as be ing more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 4. Sexual F unction/Reproduction Long term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as low libido, erectile dysfunction, or infertility (See P ostmarketing Experience) b) Adverse Effects/ Undesirable Effects: Postmarketing Ex perience: Serotonin syndrome (See Warnings Precautions) Adrenal insufficiency (See and Precautions) Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen defic iency have occ urred with chronic use of opioids. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypoth alamic -pituitary -gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various m edical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Patie nts presenti ng with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory eval uation. Infertility: Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility ar e reversible . c) Drug Interactions: 1. Benzodiazepines Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. The concomitant us e of opioids a nd benzodiaz epines increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 559 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFI C) the central nervous system that control respiration. Opioids interact primarily at -receptors, and benzodiazepines interact at GABA A sites. When opioids and benzodiazepines are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid -related respiratory depression exists. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative trea tment options are inadequ ate (see Warnings and Precautions). Limit dosage and duration of conc omitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation. 2. Serotonergic Drugs The concomitant use of opioi ds with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in seroto nin syndrome. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue <product name> if serotonin syndro me is suspected. Examples of drugs are serotoni n antagonists, drugs (e.g. mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol ), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (See Warn ings and Precautions).

SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFI C) doses of niacin (nicotinic acid) may increase the ri sk of myopathy when given concomitantly with HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors, probably because they can produce myopathy when given alone. Therefore, combined d rug therapy should be approac hed with cau tion. Gemfibrozil and nicotinic acid: Gemfibrozil and nic otinic acid do not statistically significantly affect the bioavailability of pravastatin. However, in a limited size clinical trial, a trend toward CK elevat ions and mus culoskeletal symp toms was seen in patients treated concurrently with pravastatin and ge mfibrozil. Myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, has occurred in patients who were receiving coadministration of HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors with In a multicentre study, the AUC values of pravastatin were shown to be five -fold higher in the presence of cyclosporine. There was no accumulation of pra vastatin aft er multiple doses Clarithrom ycin, colchicine: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is i ncreased administration of clarithromycin or colchicine with pravastatin. Fusidic acid: The risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis may b e increased by the concomitan t administra tion of pravastatin with systemic fusidic acid. Co - adminis tration of this combination may cause increased plasma concentrations of both agents. The mechanism of this interaction (whether it is pharmacodynamics or ph arma cokineti c, or both) is ye t unknown. T here have been reports of rhabdomyolysis (including some f atalities) in patients receiving this combination. If treatment with fusidic acid is necessary, pravastatin treatment should be discontinued throughout the d uration of t he fusidic acid treatment. Reference: Circular Bil (15) dlm. BPFK/PPP/07/25.

Warnings and Precautions : Regular Sur veillance Patients on proton pump inhib itor treatment (particularly those treated for long term) s hould be kept under regular surveillance. Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE) Proton pump inhibitors are associated suba cute cut aneous lupus eryt hematosus ( SCLE). If lesions occur, especially in sun -exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping {product name}. SCLE after previous t reatment wi th a pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE wi th other proton pump inhibitors.

For patients e xpected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPI with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 577 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFI C) health care professionals should consider me asuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatmen t. Fracture Proton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predo minantly i n the elderly or in presence of other recognised ri sk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10 -40%. Some of this increase may be due to other ri sk factors. Patie nts at risk of osteoporosis should receive care according to current c linical guidelines and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium. Clostridium Difficile Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI the rapy may be assoc iated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve. Patients should use the lowest dose and sho rtest durati on of PPI therapy appropriat e to the condition being treated. Vitamin B12 Deficiency Daily treatment with any acid -suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vita min B12) cau sed by hypo - or achlorhydria .

Pharmacodynamic During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products , serum gastrin increases in response to the decreased acid secretion. Also CgA increases due to decreased gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. Available published evidence suggests that pr oton pump inhibitors should be discontinued between 5 days and 2 weeks prior to CgA measurements. This is to allow CgA levels that might be spuriously elevat ed following PPI treatment to return to reference range. Consumer Medication Information Leaflet (RiMUP) i.

If treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable , therapy with simvastatin should be suspended during the course of treatment. Gemfibrozil, cyclosporine or d anazol: Concomitant use of these drugs with simvastatin is contraindicated. Other Drugs Other fibrates: The dose of simvastatin should not e xceed 10 mg daily in patients rece iving concomitant medication with fibrates other than gemfibrozi l or fenofi brate. When simvastatin and fenofibrate are given concomitantly, there is no evidence that the risk of myopathy exceeds the sum of the individu al risks of each agent. Caution shoul d be used when prescribing fenofibrate with simvastatin, as either agent can cause myopathy when given alone. Addition of fibrates to simvastatin typically provides little additional reduction in LDL -C, but further reductions of TG and further increase s in HDL-C may be obtained. Combinations of fibrates with simv astatin hav e been used without myopathy in small short -term clinical studies with careful monitoring. Amiodarone: In a clinical trial, myopathy was repo rted in 6% of patients receiving sim vastat in 80 mg and amiodarone.

Pregnancy Exposure Risk related to valproate Both valproate monotherapy an d valpr oate polytherapy are associated with abnormal pregnancy outcomes. Available data suggest that antiepileptic polytherapy including valproate is associated with a malformations than valproate meta (including registries and cohort studies) has shown that 10.73% of children of epileptic women exposed to valproate monotherapy during pregnancy suffer from congenital malformations (95% CI: 8.16 -13.29). This is a greater risk of major malformations than for the general population, for whom the risk is about 2 -3%. The risk is dose dependent but a threshold dose below which no risk exists cannot be established. Available data show an increased incidence of minor and major malformations. The most common types of malformations include neural tube defects, facial dysmorphism, cleft lip and palate, craniostenosis, cardiac, renal and urogenital defects, limb defects (including bilateral aplasia of the radius), and multiple anomal ies involving various body systems. Developmental disorders Data have shown that exposure to valproate in utero can have adverse effects on mental and physical development of the exposed children. The risk seems to be dose -dependent but a threshol d dose below which no risk Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 597 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFI C) exists, cannot be established based on available data. The exact gestational period of risk for these effects is uncertain and the possibility of a risk throughout the entire pregnancy cannot be excluded. Studies in preschool c hildren exposed in utero to valproate show that up to 30-40% experience delays in their early development such as talking and walking later, lower intellectual abilities, poor language skills (speaking and understanding) and memory problems. Intelligence quotie nt (IQ) measured in school aged children (age 6) with a history of valproate exposure in utero was on average 7 -10 points lower than those children exposed to other antiepileptics. Although the role of confounding factors cannot be excluded, there i s evide nce in children exposed to valproate that the risk of intellectual impairment may be independent from maternal IQ. There are limited data on the long term outcomes. Available data show that children exposed to valproate in utero are at increased risk of autistic spectrum disorder (approximately three -fold) and childhood autism (approximately five -fold) compared with the general study population. Limited data suggests that children exposed to valproate in utero may be more likely to develop sympt oms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Female children, female adolescents and woman of childbearing potential (see above and Special Warnings and Precautions for use) If a Woman wants to plan a Pregnancy During pregnancy, maternal ton ic clon ic seizures and status epilepticus with hypoxia may carry a particular risk of death for the mother and the unborn child. In women planning to become pregnant or who are pregnant, valproate therapy should be reassessed In women planning to become p regnant all efforts should be made to switch to appropriate alternative treatment prior to conception, if possible.

Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 622 APPENDIX 10 : GUIDELINE ON PATIENT DISPENSING PACK FOR PHARMACEUTIC AL PRODU CTS IN MALAYSIA Outline: 10.1 Purpose 10.2 Objective 10.3 Definition 10.4 Benefits 10.5 Criteria for I mplementation of Patient Dispensing Pack 10.6 Products Exempted from this Requirements 10.7 Other Considerations for Implementation 10.8 Imple mentatio n Timeline 10.9 Conclusion Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 623 10.1 PURPOSE To provide guidance on the implementation of patient dispensing pack or original dispensing pack for pharmaceutical products in Malaysia. 10.2 OBJECTIVE Improve patient 's safety by: maintaining product integrit y; prevent unnecessary exposure of the product; avoid product contamination due to handling especially in non -GMP premise; and Fewer steps in dispensing process hence less possibility for errors and improvement in efficiency. 10.3 DEFINITION Patient d ispen sing pack or original dispensing pack is a ready -to-dispense pack with sufficient quantity equivalen t to an amount not more than one month supply or per treatment for one patient's use. 10.4 BENEFITS Key benefits identified: Ensuring patien ts on ho w to take medications and the importance of it, which will eventually increase patient's compliance . Clear identification of the medicine, by whom and where it was manufactured. Providing complete instructions on the use of the medicine. Original p acking w ill maintain the integrity of the pack therefore ensuring the stability of the product. Original packing will carry batch number and expiry date . Prevent mix -ups (or contamination) during repacking and dispensing. Facilitate recall of products sinc e the re quired information can only be found on the original pack . Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 624 10.5 CRITERIA FOR IMPLEMENTATION O F PATIENT DISPENSING PACK The patient dispensing pack size should be based on the medication, intended use, recommended dosage and dosage form sufficie nt for one mo nth supply or per treatment for on e patient's use. This requirement does not apply for blister or st rip pack . Maximum permitted supply is one month but may be less depending on the intended use of the medication. The Product Registration Holde r (PRH) is responsible to justify the proposed patient dispensing pack size based on these criteria as the dosing regimen for certain medication may equate to high numbers of tablets/ capsules. Justification should also address the definition of one month i.e. 28, 30 o r 31 days. Blister or strip pack are strongly recommended for solid oral dosage forms (e.g. tablets and capsules) and bulk loose pac k for supply more than one month are not permitted unless justified by the PRH . Oral chemotherapeutics in table t or cap sule must be packed in blister to reduce personnel exposure and presumably risk which can minimise the to xic effect of the chemotherapeutics . 10.6 PRODUCTS EXEMPTED FROM TH ESE REQUIREMENTS The requirements do not apply to the following produ cts: Injectables, eye, ear and nasal drops, suppositories and pessaries. Products for export only (FEO). Drug whe re the risk of issuing more than the amount required by the patient outweigh the benefits of the patient dispensing pack e.g. products containi ng subst ances with potential for abuse or cytotoxic agents where precise dosing are required. Drugs where the dos ing needs to be tailored according to patien t's body weight e.g. drugs used in oncology, HIV etc . Medically critical products and hospital pack s for ra re diseases with very low volumes where it is not viable to produce special packs for a single market. Products sold with devices with a fixed number of doses Situations where a patient dispensing pack is not appropriate will be considered on a ca se to ca se basis. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 625 10.7 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS F OR IMPLEMENTATION VARIATION APPLICATIONS Change in patient pack size with or without involving new pack type shall be submitted to Variation Section, Centre for Post Product Registration. Supporting docume nts requ ired are: a. Justification for the new pack size and/or type ; b. Accelerated stability data (3 or 6 months) and stability report for new pack types; and c. Commitment to provide complete real time stability data and report when available. List of pro ducts wi th recommended pack sizes for oral liquid preparations and dermatological are as in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively. For tablets and capsules in loose pack, the maximum packing size will depend on the highest dosage and frequency per patient's tr eatment or one month supply. 10.8 IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE Implementation of patient dispensing pack has been c onducted in a phased manner to ensure smooth transition while ensuring no supply disruption to patients. This implementation is effective since 1 March 2008 on a voluntary basis and mandated on 1 September 2008 . All products manufactured from 1 September 2008 regardless whether it is imported or locally manufactured will need to conform to the principles of this guide. 10.9 CONCL USION Patient Dispensing Pack is convenient, safe and improves quality of dispensed medicines. It will increase efficiency in dispensing and improve safety by reducing the risk and possibility of erro r. It will also result in a reduction in drug waste and better use of resources.

Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 685 1. Introduction Consumer interest in health and self -care has expanded the market for a wide range of health supplements and traditional products. These categ ories of products have been used since the earliest history of humanity and have formed one of the foundations for healthcare in cultures throughout the world. With the increased use of such products and the broad spectrum of products classified under this category, it is important to en sure that the products consumed are safe for consumers. Evaluation of the safety of complementary medicine products (health supplements, herbal products and traditional medicine) must be done in a manner that is cost effec tive and science -based within th e regulatory environment. Most ingredients might be considered as safe, considering the experience or history of long use. When an ingredient is well known for a specific use, the assessment will be limited to published da ta (including traditional refere nces). However, under certain conditions, additional data will be required to prove the safety of the product , e.g. for a new active ingredient or a new combination of ingredients . Even if a product has been in use over a long period of time, chronic toxic ology risks may have occurred but not recognized. 2. Objectives This Guideline aims to provide guidance in submitting safety data requirements for assessment to facilitate registration of complementary medicine . 3. Safety Data Proof that a product is of q uality, safe and as efficacious as claimed is a pre -condition for marketing of a complementary medicine product. Safety is dependent upon the overall product formulation, its intended use, dosage, route of administration, du ration of use and targeted group where applicable. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 686 Each active ingredient shall make a relevant and reasonable contribution to the overall therapy and the quantity of each active ingredient shall be safe for the recommended use and range of dosage. 3.1 Safety data shall be required to substantiate the safety profile for the following complementary medicine product to be marketed but not limited to: a. New ingredients b. Existing active ingredients/products with new combination , new dosage, new delivery system , new methods of manufacturing or for use in a special target population (e.g. pregnant, lactating women, children, etc). c. Existing ingredients/products with safety concern. Safety concerns may be newly emerging or established, and in some cases may need add itional information to support safe usage in complementary medicine. These safety concerns may be addressed by including additional cautionary statements. 3.2 Safety substantiation might not be required for complementary medicine product s that do not fal l under items a. - c. as mention ed above. T raditional medicines with documented data; health supplements which have been consumed as food or is a food constituent within the normal usage limit or for those containing ingredients with well documented and established safety profile may als o not require further safety substantiation. Further e xamples would include: i) Product containing the same combination (same nu mber of active ingredients) as with another previously registered product with the active ingredie nts within limits previously reg istered. ii) Combination of vitamins and minerals within permissible limits iii) Formulary products Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 687 3.3 Some general principles on assessing product safety shall be as follows: a) Single ingredient For well -known ingredients suc h as vitamins or minerals and herbal ingredients, documented data will be accepted to demonstrate safety of use. If an ingredient has been used traditionally and documented that it had no safety concerns , the submission of toxicology studies will not be required. However, if history of use is used to support safety, then the details of use must be consistent with its traditional use. If toxic effects have been reported or there is insufficient documented safety evidence and there are doubts concerning th e product/active ingredient , sub mission of toxicological reports will be required. In a case when the anticipated intake of this ingredient is significantly higher than the estimated historical intake, or for which the historical intake cannot be assesse d, additional safety data/studie s will be required . b) Combination products There are no special requirements for combinations of well -known ingredients such as vitamins or minerals . Each active ingredient and dosage will be assessed independently and acc ording to documented data. The intended use/function of each ingredient must support a logical use of the combination in question and if for traditional use must prescribe to the philosophy of that culture. Like acting herbal ingredients are considered t o have an additive effect. There fore, the dosage of each active substance may be reduced as compared to its single use. The counteracting by one active ingredient to the adverse reaction produced by another must be explained. Illogical combination of herbs or ingredients having widely different therapeutic uses will require justification. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 688 However, for a combination consisting of new active ingredients, toxicological and clinical data for finished product may be requested . This will also apply to new combin ations of well-known ingredients . Safety data will have to be on the product with information on individual ingredients as supportive references. c) Target population It cannot be assumed that an ingredient is suitable for pregnant or lactating women unless evidence is provided to t he contrary. If required, the product should carry the following statement: \"Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Insufficient reliable data\" or \"If you are pregnant /breastfeeding, please consult your doctor/pharmacist before takin g this product.\" A product will also be generally assumed not safe for children unless proven otherwise. If the product has children dosage instructions, there must be evidence to fully demonstrate safety in children of that age. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 689 4. Overview Information that will be required to substan tiate the safe use of a product may include but is not limited to: 4.1 Literature search A comprehensive literature search which would include both positive and negative reports must be submitted. The search criteria used should also be mentioned and ref erences cited. Certified translated copies by the recognised bodies must also be provided if the original articles are not in the English or Malay language. 4.2 Extent of use Information on extent of use in other countries may provide insight into the saf ety profile. The maximum amount of the ingredient that is recommended or suggested for use as food may be provided as proof of safe use. However, the amount in the product should not exceed the recommended level. If evidenc e is to be based on traditional use, it must be clearly stated that the ingredient under review is equivalent to that used traditionally. Knowledge of chemical components of an ingredient will aid in safety evaluation by identifying potentially toxic const ituents or constituents known to mimic or modulate endogenous intermediates. Modern extraction methods used may in some instances produce a substance that is compositionally different from those produced using traditional methodology. The industry should be able to capture the safety data of any abnormalities and or untoward adverse reaction that might be occurred or derived from animal and or human study. Efficacy data will also often include information on adverse events that will be useful in safety eva luation. Evidence of the regulatory status of the product in other countries may also be provided as supportive evidence to justify safe use of the product. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 690 4.3 Pharmacological properties This would include pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies for medicinal use except for traditional products which will be based on the philosophy of its traditional use. 4.4 Toxicology data The intended use and the duration of use whether it is for short or long term use will also determine the type of toxicity data needed , e.g acute and/or chronic toxicity . Other toxicity data which should be identified would include teratogenicity, carcinogenicity and mutagenicity data, where necessary. All evidence, both favorable and unfavorable should be included. Toxicity data could be derived from sources such as authoritative reference test or from animal and/or human study. The Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development ( OECD ) Guidelines shall be used as a guide to conduct toxicity study on animals. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Divisi on, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Second Edition, September 2016, Revised January 2019 Page | 691 4.5 Human data Safety profile of an ingredient may be obtained from sufficiently powered prospective observational studies, clinical trials, dose -escalation studies, systematic reviews, retrospective meta -analysis studies or even observation of adverse events under controlled studies. 4.6 Post marketing surveillance Premarket safety studies are sometimes limited by the number of study subjects. When products are in wide use, detection of adverse events provides a strong surrogate for safety monitoring in the general population and in consumers who have chronic conditions. Post marketing surveillance also provides valuable information about a product's safety profile in vulnerable populations e.g. in pregnancy, lactation, the elderly etc. Interaction with ot her medications/ supplementation or even food has significant safety implications because of their effects on bioavailability or induction/inhibition of metabolizing enzymes. Such interaction may lead to synergism or antagonism of intended effects. Safet y concerns from existing products may come from the reporting of the adverse reaction monitoring mechanism in the market or through post market control. The industry and regulator may collect those data from post -market reporting and should assess the cau sality between the emerging safety concern and the product.
