Revised: 1/2022 FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION: CONTENTS SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#S5.1), [Adverse Reactions (6.1)](#S6.1)]. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include: The risks and benefits of treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#S5.1)]. MORTALITY In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor comparing XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day or XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed with XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day or XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.2)](#S5.2)]. A XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution 10 mg twice daily (or a XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily) dosage is not recommended for the treatment of RA or PsA [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2)](#S2.2)]. MALIGNANCIES Malignancies, including lymphomas and solid tumors, have occurred in patients treated with XELJANZ and other Janus kinase inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. In RA patients, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding NMSC) was observed in patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day or XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day compared with TNF blockers [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#S5.3)]. Lymphomas and lung cancers were observed at a higher rate in patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day or XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day in RA patients compared to those treated with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Epstein Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder has been observed at an increased rate in renal transplant patients treated with XELJANZ and concomitant immunosuppressive medications [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#S5.3)]. MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily or XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, had a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke), compared to those treated with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Discontinue XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke [see [Warnings thrombosis, thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with XELJANZ and other Janus kinase inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these events were serious and some resulted in death. RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily or XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily compared to TNF blockers had an observed increase in incidence of these events. Avoid XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients at risk. Discontinue XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution and promptly evaluate patients with symptoms of thrombosis [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.5)](#S5.5)]. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), who have an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers. XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA) in patients 2 years of age and older who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers. Table 1 displays the recommended adult daily dosage of XELJANZ and XELJANZ XR and dosage adjustments for patients receiving CYP2C19 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors, in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (including but not limited to those with severe insufficiency who are undergoing hemodialysis) or moderate hepatic impairment, with lymphopenia, neutropenia, or with: once daily| |For patients undergoing hemodialysis, dose should be administered after the dialysis session on dialysis days.

The most common serious infections reported with XELJANZ included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, urinary tract infection, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. infection, and listeriosis were reported with XELJANZ. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunomodulating agents such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. In the UC population, XELJANZ treatment with 10 mg twice daily was associated with greater risk of serious infections compared to 5 mg twice daily. Additionally, opportunistic herpes zoster infections (including meningoencephalitis, ophthalmologic, and disseminated cutaneous) were seen in patients who were treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily. Other serious infections that were not reported in clinical studies may also occur (e.g., coccidioidomycosis). Avoid use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients: Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient; appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored. Caution is also recommended in patients with a history of chronic lung disease, or in those who develop interstitial lung disease, as they may be more prone to infections. Risk of infection may be higher with increasing degrees of lymphopenia and consideration should be given to lymphocyte counts when assessing individual patient risk of infection. Discontinuation and monitoring criteria for lymphopenia are recommended [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2](#S2.2), [2.3](#S2.3), [ 2.4)](#S2.4)]. Tuberculosis Patients should be evaluated and tested for latent or active infection prior to and per applicable guidelines during administration of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. Anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered prior to administration of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but who have risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision about whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Patients with latent tuberculosis should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before administering XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. Viral Reactivation Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution. Postmarketing cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in patients treated with XELJANZ. The impact of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Patients who screened positive for hepatitis B or C were excluded from clinical trials. Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. The risk of herpes zoster is increased in patients treated with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution and appears to be higher in patients treated with XELJANZ in Japan and Korea. Rheumatoid arthritis patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day or XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day had a higher observed rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, compared to those treated with TNF blockers in a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study (RA Safety Study 1). The incidence rate of all-cause mortality per 100 patient-years was 0.88 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 1.23 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.69 for TNF blockers [see [Clinical Studies (14.6)](#S14.6)]. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. A XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution 10 mg twice daily (or a XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily) dosage is not recommended for the treatment of RA, PsA, or AS [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2)](#S2.2)]. For the treatment of UC, use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration needed to achieve/maintain therapeutic response [see [Dosage and Administration (2.3)](#S2.3)]. Malignancies, including lymphomas and solid cancers, were observed in clinical studies of XELJANZ [see [Adverse Reactions (6.1)](#S6.1)]. In RA Safety Study 1, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed in patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day or XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day as compared with TNF blockers. The incidence rate of malignancies (excluding NMSC) per 100 patient-years was 1.13 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 1.13 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.77 for TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk [see [Clinical Studies (14.6)](#S14.6)]. Lymphomas and lung cancers, which are a subset of all malignancies in RA Safety Study 1, were observed at a higher rate in patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day and XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day compared to those treated with TNF blockers. The incidence rate of lymphomas per 100 patient-years was 0.07 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 0.11 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.02 for TNF blockers. The incidence rate of lung cancers per 100 patient-years among current and past smokers was 0.48 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 0.59 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.27 for TNF blockers [see [Clinical Studies (14.6)](#S14.6)]. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy while on treatment, and patients who are current or past smokers. A XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution 10 mg twice daily (or a XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily) dosage is not recommended for the treatment of RA or PsA [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2)](#S2.2)]. In Phase 2B, controlled dose-ranging trials in de-novo renal transplant patients, all of whom received induction therapy with basiliximab, high-dose Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder was observed in 5 out of 218 patients treated with XELJANZ (2.3%) compared to 0 out of 111 patients treated with cyclosporine. Other malignancies were observed in clinical studies and the postmarketing setting, including, but not limited to, lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) have been reported in patients treated with XELJANZ. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. In the UC population, treatment with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily was associated with greater risk of NMSC. In RA Safety Study 1, RA patients who were 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily or XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily had a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke, compared to those treated with TNF blockers. The incidence rate of MACE per 100 patient-years was 0.91 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 1.11 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.79 for TNF blockers. The incidence rate of fatal or myocardial infarction per 100 patient-years was 0.36 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 0.39 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.20 for TNF blockers [see [Clinical Studies (14.6)](#S14.6)]. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke. A XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution 10 mg twice daily (or a XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily) dosage is not recommended for the treatment of RA or PsA [see [Dosage and Administration thrombosis, patients treated with XELJANZ and other Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these events were serious and some resulted in death [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.2)](#S5.2)]. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with XELJANZ at both 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily compared to TNF blockers in RA Safety Study 1 had an observed increase in incidence of these events. The incidence rate of DVT per 100 patient-years was 0.22 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 0.28 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.16 for TNF blockers. The incidence rate of PE per 100 patient-years was 0.18 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 0.49 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.05 for TNF blockers [see [Clinical Studies (14.6)](#S14.6)]. A XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution 10 mg twice daily (or a XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily) dosage is not recommended for the treatment of RA, PsA, or AS [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2)](#S2.2)]. In a long-term extension study in patients with UC, five cases of pulmonary embolism were reported in patients taking XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, including one death in a patient with advanced cancer. Promptly evaluate patients with symptoms of thrombosis and discontinue XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients with symptoms of thrombosis. Avoid XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients that may be at increased risk of thrombosis. For the treatment of UC, use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration needed to achieve/maintain therapeutic response [see [Dosage and Administration (2.3)](#S2.3)]. Events of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in clinical studies with XELJANZ, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. In these studies, many patients with rheumatoid arthritis were receiving background therapy with Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). There was no discernable difference in frequency of gastrointestinal perforation between the placebo and the XELJANZ arms in clinical trials of patients with UC, and many of them were receiving background corticosteroids. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis or taking NSAIDs). Patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms should be evaluated promptly for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation [see [Adverse Reactions (6.1)](#S6.1)]. Reactions such as angioedema and urticaria that may reflect drug hypersensitivity have been observed in patients receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Some events were serious. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue tofacitinib while evaluating the potential cause or causes of the reaction [see [Adverse Reactions (6.2)](#S6.2)]. Lymphocyte Abnormalities Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with initial lymphocytosis at one month of exposure followed by a gradual decrease in mean absolute lymphocyte counts below the baseline of approximately 10% during 12 months of therapy. Lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells/mm3 were associated with an increased incidence of treated and serious infections. Avoid initiation of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution treatment in patients with a low lymphocyte count (i.e., less than 500 cells/mm3). In patients who develop a confirmed absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cells/mm3, treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution is not recommended. Monitor lymphocyte counts at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on lymphocyte counts [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2](#S2.2), [2.3](#S2.3), [2.4)](#S2.4)]. Neutropenia Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (less than 2000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution treatment in patients with a low neutrophil count (i.e., ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3). For patients who develop a persistent ANC of 500 to 1000 cells/mm3, interrupt XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution dosing until ANC is greater than or equal to 1000 cells/mm3. In patients who develop an ANC less than 500 cells/mm3, treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution is not recommended. Monitor neutrophil counts at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on ANC results [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2](#S2.2), [2.3)](#S2.3)]. Anemia Avoid initiation of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution treatment in patients with a low hemoglobin level (i.e., less than 9 g/dL). Treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution should be interrupted in patients who develop hemoglobin levels less than 8 g/dL or whose hemoglobin level drops greater than 2 g/dL on treatment. Monitor hemoglobin at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on hemoglobin results [see [Dosage and Administration (2)](#S2)]. Liver Enzyme Elevations Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Most of these abnormalities occurred in studies with background DMARD (primarily methotrexate) therapy. Routine monitoring of liver tests and prompt investigation of the causes of liver enzyme elevations is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, the administration of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution should be interrupted until this diagnosis has been excluded. Lipid Elevations Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Maximum effects were generally observed within 6 weeks. There were no clinically relevant changes in LDL/HDL cholesterol ratios. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed approximately 4-8 weeks following initiation of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution therapy. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines [e.g., National Cholesterol Educational Program (NCEP)] for the management of hyperlipidemia. Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of tofacitinib therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents. A patient experienced dissemination of the vaccine strain of varicella zoster virus, 16 days after vaccination with live attenuated (Zostavax) virus vaccine and 2 days after treatment start with tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. The patient was varicella virus na\u00efve, as evidenced by no previous history of varicella infection and no anti-varicella antibodies at baseline. Tofacitinib was discontinued and the patient recovered after treatment with standard doses of antiviral medication. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution therapy. As with any other non-deformable material, caution should be used when administering XELJANZ XR to patients with pre-existing severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs utilizing a non-deformable extended-release formulation. The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population in clinical practice. Rheumatoid Arthritis The clinical studies described in the following sections were conducted using XELJANZ. Although other doses of XELJANZ have been studied, the recommended dose of XELJANZ is 5 mg twice daily. The recommended dose for XELJANZ XR is 11 mg once daily. A dosage of XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily or XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily is not a recommended regimen for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2)](#S2.2)]. In RA Safety Study 1, 1455 patients were treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily, 1456 patients were treated with 10 mg twice daily, and 1451 patients were treated with a TNF blocker for a median of 4.0 years [see [Clinical Studies (14.6)](#S14.6)]. The following data includes two Phase 2 and five Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials. In these trials, patients were randomized to doses of XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily (292 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (306 patients) monotherapy, XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily (1044 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (1043 patients) in combination with DMARDs (including methotrexate) and placebo (809 patients). All seven placebo-controlled protocols included provisions for patients taking placebo to receive treatment with XELJANZ at Month 3 or Month 6 either by patient response (based on uncontrolled disease activity) or by design, so that adverse events cannot always be unambiguously attributed to a given treatment. Therefore, some analyses that follow include patients who changed treatment by design or by patient response from placebo to XELJANZ in both the placebo and XELJANZ group of a given interval. Comparisons between placebo and XELJANZ were based on the first 3 months of exposure, and comparisons between XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily were based on the first 12 months of exposure. The long-term safety population includes all patients who participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (including earlier development phase studies) and then participated in one of two long-term safety studies. The design of the long-term safety studies allowed for modification of XELJANZ doses according to clinical judgment. This limits the interpretation of the long-term safety data with respect to dose. The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#S5.1)]. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction during the 0 to 3 months exposure in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was 4% for patients taking XELJANZ and 3% for placebo-treated patients. Overall Infections In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, the overall frequency of infections was 20% and 22% in the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily groups, respectively, and 18% in the placebo group. The most commonly reported infections with XELJANZ were upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infections (4%, 3%, and 2% of patients, respectively). Serious Infections In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, serious infections were reported in 1 patient (0.5 events per 100 patient-years) who received placebo and 11 patients (1.7 events per 100 patient-years) who received XELJANZ 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. The rate difference between treatment groups (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 1.1 (-0.4, 2.5) events per 100 patient-years for the combined 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ group minus placebo. In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 12 months exposure, serious infections were reported in 34 patients (2.7 events per 100 patient-years) who received 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 33 patients (2.7 events per 100 patient-years) who received 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. The rate difference between XELJANZ doses (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was -0.1 (-1.3, 1.2) events per 100 patient-years for 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ minus 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, and urinary tract infection [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#S5.1)]. Tuberculosis In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, tuberculosis was not reported in patients who received placebo, 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ, or 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 12 months exposure, tuberculosis was reported in 0 patients who received 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 6 patients (0.5 events per 100 patient-years) who received 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. The rate difference between XELJANZ doses (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 0.5 (0.1, 0.9) events per 100 patient-years for 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ minus 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ. Cases of disseminated tuberculosis were also reported. The median XELJANZ exposure prior to diagnosis of tuberculosis was 10 months (range from 152 to 960 days) [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#S5.1)]. Opportunistic Infections (excluding tuberculosis) In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, opportunistic infections were not reported in patients who received placebo, 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ, or 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 12 months exposure, opportunistic infections were reported in 4 patients (0.3 events per 100 patient-years) who received 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 4 patients (0.3 events per 100 patient-years) who received 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. The rate difference between XELJANZ doses (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 0 (-0.5, 0.5) events per 100 patient-years for 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ minus 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ. The median XELJANZ exposure prior to diagnosis of an opportunistic infection was 8 months (range from 41 to 698 days) [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#S5.1)]. Malignancy In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, malignancies excluding NMSC were reported in 0 patients who received placebo and 2 patients (0.3 events per 100 patient-years) who received either XELJANZ 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. The rate difference between treatment groups (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 0.3 (-0.1, 0.7) events per 100 patient-years for the combined 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ group minus placebo. In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 12 months exposure, malignancies excluding NMSC were reported in 5 patients (0.4 events per 100 patient-years) who received 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 7 patients (0.6 events per 100 patient-years) who received 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. The rate difference between XELJANZ doses (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 0.2 (-0.4, 0.7) events per 100 patient-years for 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ minus 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ. One of these malignancies was a case of lymphoma that occurred during the 0 to 12 month period in a patient treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily. The most common types of malignancy, including malignancies observed during the long-term extension, were lung and breast cancer, followed by gastric, colorectal, renal cell, prostate cancer, lymphoma, and malignant melanoma [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#S5.3)]. Laboratory Abnormalities Lymphopenia In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, confirmed decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts below 500 cells/mm3 occurred in 0.04% of patients for the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ groups combined during the first 3 months of exposure. Confirmed lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells/mm3 were associated with an increased incidence of treated and serious infections [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.8)](#S5.8)]. Neutropenia In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, confirmed decreases in ANC below 1000 cells/mm3 occurred in 0.07% of patients for the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ groups combined during the first 3 months of exposure. There were no confirmed decreases in ANC below 500 cells/mm3 observed in any treatment group. There was no clear relationship between neutropenia and the occurrence of serious infections. In the long-term safety population, the pattern and incidence of confirmed decreases in ANC remained consistent with what was seen in the placebo-controlled clinical trials [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.8)](#S5.8)]. Liver Enzyme Elevations Confirmed increases in liver enzymes greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (3\u00d7 ULN) were observed in patients treated with XELJANZ. In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as reduction in the dose of concomitant DMARD, interruption of XELJANZ, or reduction in XELJANZ dose, resulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes. In the placebo-controlled monotherapy trials (0-3 months), no differences in the incidence of ALT or AST elevations were observed between the placebo, and XELJANZ 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily groups. In the placebo-controlled background DMARD trials (0-3 months), ALT elevations greater than 3\u00d7 ULN were observed in 1.0%, 1.3% and 1.2% of patients receiving placebo, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. In these trials, AST elevations greater than 3\u00d7 ULN were observed in 0.6%, 0.5% and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. One case of drug-induced liver injury was reported in a patient treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily for approximately 2.5 months. The patient developed symptomatic elevations of AST and ALT greater than 3\u00d7 ULN and bilirubin elevations greater than 2\u00d7 ULN, which required hospitalizations and a liver biopsy. Lipid Elevations In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, dose-related elevations in lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides) were observed at one month of exposure and remained stable thereafter. Changes in lipid parameters during the first 3 months of exposure in the placebo-controlled clinical trials are summarized below: In a placebo-controlled clinical trial, elevations in LDL cholesterol and ApoB decreased to pretreatment levels in response to statin therapy. In the long-term safety population, elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the placebo-controlled clinical trials. Serum Creatinine Elevations In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, dose-related elevations in serum creatinine were observed with XELJANZ treatment. The mean increase in serum creatinine was <0.1 mg/dL in the 12-month pooled safety analysis; however with increasing duration of exposure in the long-term extensions, up to 2% of patients were discontinued from XELJANZ treatment due to the protocol-specified discontinuation criterion of an increase in creatinine by more than 50% of baseline. The clinical significance of the observed serum creatinine elevations is unknown. Other Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of patients on 5 mg twice daily or 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ and at least 1% greater than that observed in patients on placebo with or without DMARD are summarized in Table 4. |Preferred Term||XELJANZ| 5 mg Twice Daily |XELJANZ| 10 mg Twice Daily |Placebo| |N = 1336| 809| (%) |N reflects randomized and treated patients from the respiratory tract infection||4||4||3| occurring open-label extension studies included: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Anemia Infections and infestations: Diverticulitis Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Dehydration Psychiatric disorders: disorders: Paresthesia and mediastinal disorders: Dyspnea, cough, sinus congestion, interstitial lung disease (cases were limited to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and some were fatal) Gastrointestinal disorders: Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, gastritis, joint swelling Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Non-melanoma skin cancers General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia, fatigue, peripheral edema Clinical Experience in Methotrexate-Na\u00efve Patients Study RA-VI was an active-controlled clinical trial in methotrexate-na\u00efve patients [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#S14)]. The safety experience in these patients was consistent with Studies RA-I through V. Psoriatic Arthritis XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily were studied in 2 double-blind Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Although other doses of XELJANZ have been studied, the recommended dose of XELJANZ is 5 mg twice daily. The recommended dose for XELJANZ XR is 11 mg once daily. A dosage of XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily or XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily is not recommended for the treatment of PsA [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2)](#S2.2)]. Study PsA-I (NCT01877668) had a duration of 12 months and enrolled patients who had an inadequate response to a nonbiologic DMARD and who were na\u00efve to treatment with a TNF blocker. Study PsA-I included a 3-month placebo-controlled period and also included adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously once every 2 weeks for 12 months. Study PsA-II (NCT01882439) had a duration of 6 months and enrolled patients who had an inadequate response to at least one approved TNF blocker. This clinical trial included a 3-month placebo-controlled period. In these combined Phase 3 clinical trials, 238 patients were randomized and treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and 236 patients were randomized and treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily. All patients in the clinical trials were required to receive treatment with a stable dose of a nonbiologic DMARD [the majority (79%) received methotrexate]. The study population randomized and treated with XELJANZ (474 patients) included 45 (9.5%) patients aged 65 years or older and 66 (13.9%) patients with diabetes at baseline. During the 2 PsA controlled clinical trials, there were 3 malignancies (excluding NMSC) in 474 patients receiving XELJANZ plus non-biologic DMARD (6 to 12 months exposure) compared with 0 malignancies in 236 patients in the placebo plus non-biologic DMARD group (3 months exposure) and 0 malignancies in 106 patients in the adalimumab plus non-biologic DMARD group (12 months exposure). No lymphomas were reported. Malignancies have also been observed in the long-term extension study in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with XELJANZ. The safety profile observed in patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with XELJANZ was consistent with the safety profile observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Ankylosing Spondylitis XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily was studied in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in a confirmatory double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial (Study AS-I) and in a dose-ranging Phase 2 clinical trial (Study AS-II). Study AS-I (NCT03502616) had a duration of 48 weeks and enrolled patients who had an inadequate response to at least 2 NSAIDs. Study AS-I included a 16-week double-blind period in which patients received XELJANZ 5 mg or placebo twice daily and a 32-week open-label treatment period in which all patients received XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily. Study AS-II (NCT01786668) had a duration of 16 weeks and enrolled patients who had an inadequate response to at least 2 NSAIDs. This clinical trial included a 12-week treatment period in which patients received either XELJANZ 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or placebo twice daily. In the combined Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, a total of 420 patients were treated with either XELJANZ 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg twice daily. Of these, 316 patients were treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily for up to 48 weeks. In the combined double-blind period, 185 patients were randomized to and treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and 187 to placebo for up to 16 weeks. Concomitant treatment with stable doses of nonbiologic DMARDs, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids (10 mg/day) was permitted. The study population randomized and treated with XELJANZ included 13 (3.1%) patients aged 65 years or older and 18 (4.3%) patients with diabetes at baseline. The safety profile observed in patients with AS treated with XELJANZ was consistent with the safety profile observed in RA and PsA patients. Ulcerative Colitis XELJANZ has been studied in patients with moderately to severely active UC in 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled [see [Clinical Studies (14.4)](#S14.4)]. Adverse reactions reported in 5% of patients treated with either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 1% greater than reported in patients receiving placebo in either the induction or maintenance clinical trials were: nasopharyngitis, elevated cholesterol levels, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, rash, diarrhea, and herpes zoster. Induction Trials (Study UC-II, and UC-V): Common adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily and 1% greater than that reported in patients receiving placebo in the 3 induction trials were: headache, nasopharyngitis, elevated cholesterol levels, acne, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, and pyrexia. Maintenance Trial (Study UC-III) Common adverse reactions reported in 4% of patients treated with either dose of XELJANZ and 1% greater than reported in patients receiving placebo are shown in Table 5. |Preferred Term||XELJANZ| 5 mg Twice Daily |XELJANZ| 10 mg Twice Daily |Placebo| |N = 198| |Elevated cholesterol levels| Dose-dependent adverse reactions seen in patients treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, in comparison to 5 mg twice daily, include the following: herpes zoster infections, serious infections, and NMSC [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1](#S5.1), [5.3)](#S5.3)]. During the UC controlled clinical studies (8-week induction and 52-week maintenance studies), which included 1220 patients, 0 cases of solid cancer or lymphoma were observed in XELJANZ-treated patients. In the long-term extension study, malignancies (including solid cancers, lymphomas and NMSC) were observed in patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#S5.3)]. Five cases of pulmonary embolism were reported in patients taking XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, including one fatality in a patient with advanced cancer [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.5)](#S5.5)]. Polyarticular Course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution 5 mg twice daily or weight-based equivalent twice daily was studied in 225 patients from 2 years to 17 years of age in Study pcJIA-I [see [Clinical Studies (14.5)](#S14.5)] and one open-label extension study. The total patient exposure (defined as patients who received at least one dose of XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution) was 351 patient-years. In general, the types of adverse drug reactions in patients with pcJIA were consistent with those seen in adult RA patients [see [Adverse Reactions (6.1)](#S6.1)]. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune system disorders: Drug hypersensitivity (events such as angioedema and urticaria have been observed). Table 6 includes drugs with clinically important drug interactions when administered concomitantly with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution and instructions for preventing or managing them. |Strong CP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole)| tofacitinib and may result in loss of or reduced clinical response| |Intervention||Coadministration with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral or potent immunosuppressants has not been studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, UC, or Oral Solution is not recommended| [see All information provided in this section is applicable to XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution as they contain the same active ingredient (tofacitinib). Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution during pregnancy. Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution pregnancy registry if they become pregnant. To enroll or obtain information from the registry, patients can call the toll free number 1-877-311-8972. Risk Summary Available data with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with rheumatoid arthritis and UC in pregnancy (see [Clinical Considerations](#clinical)). In animal reproduction studies, fetocidal and teratogenic effects were noted when pregnant rats and rabbits received tofacitinib during the period of organogenesis at exposures multiples of 73-times and 6.3-times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily, respectively. Further, in a peri- and post-natal study in rats, tofacitinib resulted in reductions in live litter size, postnatal survival, and pup body weights at exposure multiples of approximately 73-times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily and approximately 36 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily, respectively (see [Data](#data)). The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risks in the U.S. general population of major birth defects and miscarriages are 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Animal Data In a rat embryofetal developmental study, in which pregnant rats received tofacitinib during organogenesis, tofacitinib was teratogenic at exposure levels approximately 146 times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 73 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day in rats). Teratogenic effects consisted of external and soft tissue malformations of anasarca and membranous ventricular septal defects, respectively; centrum). In addition, there was an increase in post-implantation loss, consisting of early and late resorptions, resulting in a reduced number of viable fetuses. Mean fetal body weight was reduced. No developmental toxicity was observed in rats at exposure levels approximately 58 times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 29 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 30 mg/kg/day in pregnant rats). In a rabbit embryofetal developmental study in which pregnant rabbits received tofacitinib during the period of organogenesis, tofacitinib was teratogenic at exposure levels approximately 13 times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 6.3 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 30 mg/kg/day in rabbits) in the absence of signs of maternal toxicity. Teratogenic effects included and tail defects. In addition, there was an increase in post-implantation loss associated with late resorptions. No developmental toxicity was observed in rabbits at exposure levels approximately 3 times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 1.5 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day in pregnant rabbits). In a peri- and postnatal development study in pregnant rats that received tofacitinib from gestation day 6 through day 20 of lactation, there were reductions in live litter size, postnatal survival, and pup body weights at exposure levels approximately 73 times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 36 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 50 mg/kg/day in rats). There was no effect on behavioral and learning assessments, sexual maturation or the ability of the F1 generation rats to mate and produce viable F2 generation fetuses in rats at exposure levels approximately 17 times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 8.3 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day in rats). Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tofacitinib in human milk, the effects on a breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tofacitinib is present in the milk of lactating rats (see [Data](#data2)). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Given the serious adverse reactions seen in patients treated with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution, such as increased risk of serious infections, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least 18 hours after the last dose of XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution or 36 hours after the last dose of XELJANZ XR (approximately 6 elimination half-lives). Contraception Females In an animal reproduction study, tofacitinib at AUC multiples of 13 times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily and 6.3 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily demonstrated adverse embryo-fetal findings [see [Use in Specific Populations (8.1)](#S8.1)]. However, there is uncertainty as to how these animal findings relate to females of reproductive potential treated with the recommended clinical dose. Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential. Infertility Females Based on findings in rats, treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution may result in reduced fertility in females of reproductive potential. It is not known if this effect is reversible [see [Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)](#S13.1)]. The safety and effectiveness of XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution for the treatment of active pcJIA have been established in patients 2 years to 17 years of age. Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution for the treatment of pediatric patients with active pcJIA in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of XELJANZ in adult RA patients with additional data from a clinical trial of XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution in pediatric patients (2 years to 17 years of age) with active pcJIA consisting of an 18-week, open label, run-in period followed by a 26-week placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal period [see [Clinical Studies (14.5)](#S14.5)]. The safety and effectiveness of XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution have not been established in pcJIA patients less than 2 years of age. Adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution were consistent with those reported in RA patients [see [Adverse Reactions (6.1)](#S6.1)]. Safety and efficacy of XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution in pediatric patients for indications other than pcJIA have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of XELJANZ XR in pediatric patients have not been established. Of the 3315 patients who enrolled in rheumatoid arthritis Studies I to V, a total of 505 rheumatoid arthritis patients were 65 years of age and older, including 71 patients 75 years and older. The frequency of serious infection among XELJANZ-treated subjects 65 years of age and older was higher than among those under the age of 65. Of the 1156 XELJANZ-treated patients in the UC program, a total of 77 patients (7%) were 65 years of age or older. The number of patients aged 65 years and older was not sufficient to determine whether they responded differently from younger patients. As there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general, caution should be used when treating the elderly [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#S5.1)]. As there is a higher incidence of infection in diabetic population in general, caution should be used when treating patients with diabetes. Moderate and Severe Impairment XELJANZ-treated patients with moderate or severe renal impairment had greater tofacitinib blood concentrations than XELJANZ-treated patients with normal renal function. Therefore, dosage adjustment of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (including but not limited to those with severe insufficiency who are undergoing hemodialysis) [see [2.4)](#S2.4)]. Severe Impairment XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment; therefore, use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. Moderate Impairment XELJANZ-treated patients with moderate hepatic impairment had greater tofacitinib blood concentration than XELJANZ-treated patients with normal hepatic function [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#S12.3)]. Higher blood concentrations may increase the risk of some adverse reactions. Therefore, dosage adjustment of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2](#S2.2), [2.3](#S2.3), [2.4)](#S2.4)]. Mild Impairment No dosage adjustment of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. There is no specific antidote for overdose with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. In case of an overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions. In a study in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis, plasma tofacitinib concentrations declined more rapidly during the period of hemodialysis and dialyzer efficiency, calculated as dialyzer clearance/blood flow entering the dialyzer, was high [mean (SD) = 0.73 (0.15)]. However, due to the significant non-renal clearance of tofacitinib, the fraction of total elimination occurring by hemodialysis was small, and thus limits the value of hemodialysis for treatment of overdose with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib) tablets XELJANZ (tofacitinib) Oral Solution are formulated with the citrate salt of tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor. Tofacitinib citrate is a white to Tofacitinib molecular weight of 504.5 Daltons (or 312.4 Daltons as the tofacitinib free base) and a molecular formula of C16H20N6OC6H8O7. The chemical structure of tofacitinib citrate is: XELJANZ is supplied for oral administration as a 5 mg white round, immediate-release film-coated tablet. Each tablet of XELJANZ contains 5 mg tofacitinib (equivalent to 8.08 mg tofacitinib and triacetin. XELJANZ is supplied for oral administration as a 10 mg blue round, immediate-release film-coated tablet. Each 10 mg tablet of XELJANZ contains 10 mg tofacitinib (equivalent to 16.16 mg of citrate) Blue triacetin. XELJANZ XR is supplied for oral administration as a 11 mg pink, oval, extended-release film-coated tablet with a drilled hole at one end of the tablet band. Each 11 mg tablet of XELJANZ XR contains 11 mg tofacitinib (equivalent to 17.77 mg and oxide, sorbitol, triacetin. Printing ink contains, ammonium hydroxide, ferrosoferric oxide/black iron oxide, propylene glycol, and shellac glaze. XELJANZ XR is supplied for oral administration as a 22 mg beige, oval, extended-release film-coated tablet with a drilled hole at one end of the tablet band. Each 22 mg tablet of XELJANZ XR contains 22 mg tofacitinib (equivalent to 35.54 mg and red iron oxide, sorbitol, titanium dioxide, triacetin, and yellow iron oxide. Printing ink contains ammonium hydroxide, ferrosoferric oxide/black iron oxide, propylene glycol, and shellac glaze. XELJANZ Oral Solution is supplied for oral administration as a 1 mg/mL clear, colorless solution. Each 1 mL of XELJANZ Oral Solution contains 1 mg of tofacitinib (equivalent to 1.62 mg tofacitinib citrate) and ingredients: grape are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence cellular processes of hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Tofacitinib modulates the signaling pathway at the point of JAKs, preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. JAK enzymes transmit cytokine signaling through pairing of JAKs (e.g., JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/TyK2, Tofacitinib JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, and JAK2/JAK2 combinations with IC50 of 406, 56, and 1377 nM, respectively. However, the relevance of specific JAK combinations to therapeutic effectiveness is not known. Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with dose-dependent reductions of circulating CD16/56+ natural killer cells, with estimated maximum reductions occurring at approximately 8-10 weeks after initiation of therapy. These changes generally resolved within 2-6 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with dose-dependent increases in B cell counts. Changes in circulating T-lymphocyte counts and T-lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+) were small and inconsistent. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. Total serum IgG, IgM, and IgA levels after 6-month dosing in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were lower than placebo; however, changes were small and not dose-dependent. After treatment with XELJANZ in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, rapid decreases in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were observed and maintained throughout dosing. Changes in CRP observed with XELJANZ treatment do not reverse fully within 2 weeks after discontinuation, indicating a longer duration of pharmacodynamic activity compared to the pharmacokinetic half-life. Similar changes in T cells, B cells, and serum CRP have been observed in patients with active psoriatic arthritis although reversibility was not assessed. Total serum immunoglobulins were not assessed in patients with active psoriatic arthritis. XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution Following oral administration of XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution, peak plasma concentrations are reached within 0.5-1 hour, elimination half-life is about 3 hours and a dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure was observed in the therapeutic dose range. Steady state concentrations are achieved in 24-48 hours with negligible accumulation after twice daily administration. XELJANZ XR Following oral administration of XELJANZ XR, peak plasma concentrations are reached at 4 hours and half-life is about 6 to 8 hours. Steady state concentrations are achieved within 48 hours with negligible accumulation after once daily administration. |PK Parameters| Absorption XELJANZ The absolute oral bioavailability 74%. Coadministration of XELJANZ with a high-fat meal resulted in no changes in AUC while Cmax was reduced by 32%. In clinical trials, XELJANZ was administered without regard to meals [see [Dosage and Administration (2.1)](#S2.1)]. Distribution After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution is 87 L. The protein binding of tofacitinib is approximately 40%. Tofacitinib binds predominantly to albumin and does not appear to bind to 1-acid glycoprotein. Tofacitinib distributes equally between red blood cells and plasma. Metabolism and Excretion Clearance mechanisms for tofacitinib are approximately 70% hepatic metabolism and 30% renal excretion of the parent drug. The metabolism of tofacitinib is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 with minor contribution from CYP2C19. In a human radiolabeled study, more than 65% of the total circulating radioactivity was accounted for by unchanged tofacitinib, with the remaining 35% attributed to 8 metabolites, each accounting for less than 8% of total radioactivity. The pharmacologic activity of tofacitinib is attributed to the parent molecule. Pharmacokinetics in Patient Populations Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that pharmacokinetic characteristics were similar between patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and UC. The coefficient of variation (%) in AUC of tofacitinib were generally similar across different disease patients, ranging from 22% to 34% (Table 8). |Pharmacokinetic Parameters| (CV%) Specific Populations Covariate evaluation as part of population PK analyses in adult patient populations indicated no clinically relevant change in tofacitinib exposure, after accounting for differences in renal function (i.e., creatinine clearance) between patients, based on age, weight, gender and race (Figure 1). An approximately linear relationship between body weight and volume of distribution was observed, resulting in higher peak (Cmax) and lower trough (Cmin) concentrations in lighter patients. However, this difference is not considered to be clinically relevant. Covariate evaluation as part of population PK analyses in pcJIA patients identified body weight significantly impacting tofacitinib exposure, which supports weight-based dosing in this population. No additional dose adjustment is needed based on age, gender, race, or disease severity in pcJIA patients. The effect of renal and hepatic impairment and other intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib is shown in Figure 1. [Figure 1: Impact of Intrinsic Factors on Tofacitinib Pharmacokinetics] |Note: Reference values for weight, age, gender, and race comparisons are 70 kg, 55 years, male, and white, respectively; reference groups for renal and hepatic impairment data are subjects with normal renal and hepatic function.| a Refer to Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4) for dosage adjustment in RA, PsA, AS, UC, and pcJIA patients. In subjects with ESRD maintained on hemodialysis, mean AUC was approximately 40% higher compared with historical healthy subject data, consistent with approximately 30% contribution of renal clearance to the total clearance of tofacitinib. Dose adjustment is recommended in RA, PsA, AS, UC, and pcJIA patients with ESRD maintained on hemodialysis [see [Dosage and Drug Interaction Studies Potential for XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution to Influence the PK of Other Drugs In vitro studies indicate that tofacitinib does not significantly inhibit or induce the activity of the major human corresponding to the steady state Cmax of a 10 mg twice daily dose. These in vitro results were confirmed by a human drug interaction study showing no changes in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a highly sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, when coadministered with XELJANZ. In vitro studies indicate that tofacitinib does not significantly inhibit the activity of the exceeding 250 times the steady state Cmax of a 10 mg twice daily dose. In rheumatoid arthritis patients, the oral clearance of tofacitinib does not vary with time, indicating that tofacitinib does not normalize CYP enzyme activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Therefore, coadministration with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not expected to result in clinically relevant increases in the metabolism of CYP substrates in rheumatoid arthritis patients. In vitro data indicate that the potential for tofacitinib to inhibit transporters such as P-glycoprotein, organic anionic or cationic transporters at therapeutic concentrations is low. Dosing recommendations for coadministered drugs following administration with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution are shown in Figure 2. [Figure 2: Impact of Tofacitinib on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs] |Note: Reference group is administration of concomitant medication alone; OCT = Organic Cationic Transporter; MATE = Multidrug and Toxic Compound Extrusion.| Potential for Other Drugs to Influence the Pharmacokinetics of Tofacitinib Since tofacitinib is metabolized by CYP3A4, interaction with drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A4 is likely. Inhibitors of CYP2C19 alone or P-glycoprotein are unlikely to substantially alter the pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib (see [Figure 3](#fig3)). [Figure 3: Impact of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Tofacitinib] |Note: Reference group is administration of tofacitinib alone.| a [see In a 39-week toxicology study in monkeys, tofacitinib at exposure levels approximately 6 times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 3 times the 10 mg twice daily dose (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 5 mg/kg twice daily) produced lymphomas. No lymphomas were observed in this study at exposure levels 1 times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 0.5 times the 10 mg twice daily dose (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 1 mg/kg twice daily). The carcinogenic potential of tofacitinib was assessed in 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse carcinogenicity and 2-year rat carcinogenicity studies. Tofacitinib, at exposure levels approximately 34 times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 17 times the 10 mg twice daily dose (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 200 mg/kg/day) was not carcinogenic in mice. In the 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, tofacitinib caused benign Leydig cell tumors, hibernomas (malignancy of brown adipose tissue), and benign thymomas at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 42 times the exposure levels at the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 21 times the 10 mg twice daily dose on an AUC basis). The relevance of benign Leydig cell tumors to human risk is not known. Tofacitinib was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. It was positive for clastogenicity in the in vitro chromosome aberration assay with human lymphocytes in the presence of metabolic enzymes, but negative in the absence of metabolic enzymes. Tofacitinib was negative in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay and in the in vitro CHO-HGPRT assay and the in vivo rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. In rats, tofacitinib at exposure levels approximately 17 times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 8.3 times the 10 mg twice daily dose (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day) reduced female fertility due to increased post-implantation loss. There was no impairment of female rat fertility at exposure levels of tofacitinib equal to the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 0.5 times the 10 mg twice daily dose (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 1 mg/kg/day). Tofacitinib exposure levels at approximately 133 times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily, and approximately 67 times the 10 mg twice daily dose (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day) had no effect on male fertility, sperm motility, or sperm concentration. The XELJANZ clinical development program included six confirmatory trials. Although other doses have been studied, the recommended dose of XELJANZ is 5 mg twice daily. XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily is not recommended for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [see [Dosage and Administration (NCT00814307) was a 6-month monotherapy trial in which 610 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to a DMARD (nonbiologic or biologic) received XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily or placebo. At the Month 3 visit, all patients randomized to placebo treatment were advanced in a blinded fashion to a second predetermined treatment of XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily. The primary endpoints at Month 3 were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response, changes in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and rates of Disease Activity Score DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6. Study RA-II (NCT00856544) was a 12-month trial in which 792 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to a nonbiologic DMARD received XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily or placebo added to background DMARD treatment (excluding potent immunosuppressive treatments such as azathioprine or cyclosporine). At the Month 3 visit, nonresponding patients were advanced in a blinded fashion to a second predetermined treatment of XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily. At the end of Month 6, all placebo patients were advanced to their second predetermined treatment in a blinded fashion. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Month 6, changes in HAQ-DI at Month 3, and rates of DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6 at Month 6. Study RA-III (NCT00853385) was a 12-month trial in 717 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to MTX. Patients received XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily, adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week, or placebo added to background MTX. Placebo patients were advanced as in Study II. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Month 6, HAQ-DI at Month 3, and DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6 at Month 6. Study RA-IV (NCT00847613) was a 2-year trial with a planned analysis at 1 year in which 797 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to MTX received XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily or placebo added to background MTX. Placebo patients were advanced as in Study II. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Month 6, mean change from baseline in van der Heijde-modified total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Month 6, HAQ-DI at Month 3, and DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6 at Month 6. Study RA-V (NCT00960440) was a 6-month trial in which 399 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to at least one approved TNF blocking biologic agent received XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily or placebo added to background MTX. At the Month 3 visit, all patients randomized to placebo treatment were advanced in a blinded fashion to a second predetermined treatment of XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily. The primary endpoints at Month 3 were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response, HAQ-DI, and DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6. Study RA-VI (NCT01039688) was a 2-year monotherapy trial with a planned analysis at 1 year in which 952 MTX-na\u00efve patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis received XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily or MTX dose-titrated over 8 weeks to 20 mg weekly. The primary endpoints were mean change from baseline in van der Heijde-modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Month 6 and the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR70 response at Month 6. Clinical Response The percentages of XELJANZ-treated patients achieving ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses in Studies RA-I, IV, and V are shown in Table 9. Similar results were observed with Studies RA-II and III. In trials RA-I through V, patients treated with 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ had higher ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates versus placebo, with or without background DMARD treatment, at Month 3 and Month 6. Higher ACR20 response rates were observed within 2 weeks compared to placebo. In the 12-month trials, ACR response rates in XELJANZ-treated patients were consistent at 6 and 12 months. |Percent of Patients| |Monotherapy in Nonbiologic or Biologic DMARD Inadequate Responders| In Study RA-IV, a greater proportion of patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily plus MTX achieved a low level of disease activity as measured by a DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6 at 6 months compared to those treated with MTX alone (Table 10). |Study IV| |DAS28-4(ESR) Less Than 2.6||Placebo MTX||XELJANZ 5 mg Twice Daily + MTX| |160||321| of responders at Month 6 (n)||1% (2)||6% proportion with 0 active joints (n)||50% (1)||42% (8)| |Of responders, proportion with 1 active joint (n)||0||5% (1)| |Of responders, proportion with 2 active joints (n)||0||32% (6)| |Of responders, proportion with 3 or more active joints (n)||50% (1)||21% (4)| The results of the components of the ACR response criteria for Study RA-IV are shown in Table 11. Similar results were observed for XELJANZ in Studies RA-I, II, III, V, and VI. |Study IV| |XELJANZ| 5 Twice Daily + MTX |Placebo MTX| |N=321||N=160| |Component (mean) | The percent of ACR20 responders by visit for Study RA-IV is shown in Figure 4. Similar responses were observed for XELJANZ in Studies RA-I, II, III, V, and VI. [Figure 4: Percentage of ACR20 Responders by Visit for Study RA-IV ] Radiographic Response Two studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of XELJANZ on structural joint damage. In Study RA-IV and Study RA-VI, progression of structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change from baseline in mTSS and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score, at Months 6 and 12. The proportion of patients with no radiographic progression (mTSS change less than or equal to 0) was also assessed. In Study RA-IV, XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily reduced the mean progression of structural damage (not statistically significant) as shown in Table 12. Analyses of erosion and joint space narrowing scores were consistent with the overall results. In the placebo plus MTX group, 74% of patients experienced no radiographic progression at Month 6 compared to 84% of patients treated with XELJANZ plus MTX 5 mg twice daily. In Study RA-VI, XELJANZ monotherapy inhibited the progression of structural damage compared to MTX at Months 6 and 12 as shown in Table 12. Analyses of erosion and joint space narrowing scores were consistent with the overall results. In the MTX group, 55% of patients experienced no radiographic progression at Month 6 compared to 73% of patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily. |Study IV| |Placebo| N=139 Mean |XELJANZ 5 mg N=277 Mean (SD) |XELJANZ 5 mg Twice Daily| Mean Difference from Placebo |mTSS| Physical Function Response Improvement in physical functioning was measured by the HAQ-DI. Patients receiving XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily demonstrated greater improvement from baseline in physical functioning compared to placebo at Month 3. The mean (95% CI) difference from placebo in HAQ-DI improvement from baseline at Month 3 in Study RA-III was -0.22 (-0.35, -0.10) in patients receiving 5 mg XELJANZ twice daily. Similar results were obtained in Studies RA-I, II, IV and V. In the 12-month trials, HAQ-DI results in XELJANZ-treated patients were consistent at 6 and 12 months. Other Health-Related Outcomes General health status was assessed by the Short Form health survey (SF-36). In Studies RA-I, IV, and V, patients receiving XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared to placebo in physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS) scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36 at Month 3. The XELJANZ clinical development program to assess efficacy and safety included 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory trials in 816 patients 18 years of age and older (PsA-I and PsA-II). Although other doses have been studied, the recommended dose of XELJANZ is 5 mg twice daily. XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily is not recommended for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2)](#S2.2)]. All patients had active psoriatic arthritis for at least 6 months based upon the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR), at least 3 tender/painful joints and at least 3 swollen joints, and active plaque psoriasis. Patients randomized and treated across the 2 clinical trials represented different psoriatic arthritis subtypes at screening, including <5 joints or asymmetric involvement (21%), 5 joints involved arthritis mutilans (8%), and spondylitis (19%). Patients in these clinical trials had a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis for a mean (SD) of 7.7 (7.2) years. At baseline, 80% and 53% of patients had enthesitis and dactylitis, respectively. At baseline, all patients were required to receive treatment with a stable dose of a nonbiologic DMARD DMARDs). In both clinical trials, the primary endpoints were the ACR20 response and the change from baseline in HAQ-DI at Month 3. Study PsA-I was a 12-month clinical trial in 422 patients who had an inadequate response to a nonbiologic DMARD (67% and 33% were inadequate responders to 1 nonbiologic DMARD and 2 nonbiologic DMARDs, respectively) and who were na\u00efve to treatment with a TNF blocker. Patients were randomized in a 2:2:2:1:1 ratio to receive XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily, XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously once every 2 weeks, placebo to XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily treatment sequence, or placebo to XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily treatment sequence, respectively; study drug was added to background nonbiologic DMARD treatment. At the Month 3 visit, all patients randomized to placebo treatment were advanced in a blinded fashion to a predetermined XELJANZ dose of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. Study PsA-I was not designed to demonstrate noninferiority or superiority to adalimumab. Study PsA-II was a 6-month clinical trial in 394 patients who had an inadequate response to at least 1 approved TNF blocker (66%, 19%, and 15% were inadequate responders to TNF blocker, 2 TNF blockers and 3 TNF blockers, respectively). Patients were randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily, XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, placebo to XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily treatment sequence, or placebo to XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily treatment sequence, respectively; study drug was added to background nonbiologic DMARD treatment. At the Month 3 visit, placebo patients were advanced in a blinded fashion to a predetermined XELJANZ dose of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily as in Study PsA-I. Clinical Response At Month 3, patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily had higher (p0.05) response rates versus placebo for ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 in Study PsA-I and for ACR20 and ACR50 in Study PsA-II; ACR70 response rates were also higher for XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily versus placebo in Study PsA-II, although the differences versus placebo were not statistically significant (p>0.05) (Tables 13 and 14). |Treatment Group||Placebo||XELJANZ| 5 mg Twice Daily |N| |Treatment Group||Placebo||XELJANZ| 5 mg Twice Daily |N| Improvements from baseline in the ACR response criteria components for both studies are shown in Table 15. |Nonbiologic DMARD Inadequate Responders (TNF Blocker-Na\u00efve)||TNF Blocker Inadequate Responders| |Study PsA-I| The percentage of ACR20 responders by visit for Study PsA-I is shown in Figure 5. Similar responses were observed in Study PsA-II. In both studies, improvement in ACR20 response on XELJANZ was observed at the first visit after baseline (Week 2). |BID=twice daily; SE=standard error.| Subjects with missing data were treated as non-responders. |Figure 5: Percentage of ACR20 Responders by Visit Through Month 3 in Study PsA-I| In patients with active psoriatic arthritis evidence of benefit in enthesitis and dactylitis was observed with XELJANZ treatment. Physical Function Improvement in physical functioning was measured by the HAQ-DI. Patients receiving XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily demonstrated significantly greater improvement (p 0.05) from baseline in physical functioning compared to placebo at Month 3 (Table 16). |Least Squares Mean Change from Baseline In HAQ-DI at Month 3| |Nonbiologic DMARD Inadequate Responders| In Study PsA-I, the HAQ-DI responder rate (response defined as having improvement from baseline of 0.35) at Month 3 was 53% in patients receiving XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and 31% in patients receiving placebo. Similar responses were observed in Study PsA-II. Other Health-Related Outcomes General health status was assessed by the Short Form health survey (SF-36). In Studies PsA-I and PsA-II, patients receiving XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily had greater improvement from baseline compared to placebo in Physical Component Summary (PCS) score, but not in Mental Component Summary (MCS) score at Month 3. Patients receiving XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily reported consistently greater improvement relative to placebo in the domains of Physical Functioning, Bodily Pain, Vitality, and Social Functioning, but not in Role-Physical, General Health, Role-Emotional, or Mental Health. The XELJANZ clinical development program to assess the efficacy and safety included one placebo-controlled confirmatory trial (Study AS-I). Patients had active disease as defined by both Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and back pain score (BASDAI question 2) of greater or equal to 4 despite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), corticosteroid or double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week clinical trial in 269 adult patients who had an inadequate response (inadequate clinical response or intolerance) to at least 2 NSAIDs. Patients were randomized and treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily or placebo for 16 weeks of blinded treatment and then all received treatment of XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily for additional 32 weeks. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the proportion of patients who achieved an ASAS20 response at Week 16. Approximately 7% and 21% of patients used concomitant methotrexate or sulfasalazine, respectively from baseline to Week 16. Twenty-two percent of patients had an inadequate response to 1 or 2 TNF blockers. Clinical Response Patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily achieved greater improvements in ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses compared to placebo at Week 16 (Table 17). Consistent results were observed in the subgroup of patients who had an inadequate response to TNF blockers for both the ASAS20 (primary endpoint) and ASAS40 (secondary endpoint) at Week 16 (Table 17). |Placebo||XELJANZ 5 mg Twice Daily||Difference from Placebo| (95% CI) |Abbreviations: CI = confidence inadequate response.| |All patients (N)||N=136||N=133| |ASAS20 response| The improvements in the components of the ASAS response and other measures of disease activity were higher in XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily compared to placebo as shown in Table 18. |Placebo| (N=136) |XELJANZ Baseline) -0.97)| The percentage of patients achieving ASAS20 response by visit is shown in Figure 6. Figure 6: ASAS20 Response Over Time Up to Week 16, Study AS-I SE=standard error. Patients with missing data were treated as non-responders. Induction Trials (Study UC-I [NCT01465763] and Study (UC-I and UC-II), 1139 patients were randomized (598 and 541 patients, respectively) to XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily or placebo with a 4:1 treatment allocation ratio. These trials included adult patients with moderately to severely active UC (total Mayo score of 6 to 12, with an endoscopy subscore of at least 2, and rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1) and who had failed or were intolerant to at least 1 of the following treatments: oral or intravenous corticosteroids, azathioprine, 6-MP or TNF blocker. XELJANZ is indicated for patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers [see [Indications and Usage (1)](#S1)]. The disease activity was assessed by Mayo scoring index (0 to 12) which consists of four subscores (0 to 3 for each subscore): stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on endoscopy, and physician global assessment. An endoscopy subscore of 2 was defined by marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, any friability, and erosions; an endoscopy subscore of 3 was defined by spontaneous bleeding and ulceration. Patients were permitted to use stable doses of oral aminosalicylates and corticosteroids (prednisone daily dose up to 25 mg equivalent). Concomitant immunosuppressants (oral immunomodulators or biologic therapies) were not permitted for UC patients during these studies. A total of 52%, 73% and 72% of patients had previously failed or were intolerant to TNF blockers (51% in Study UC-1 (74% in UC-I and 70% in Study UC-II), respectively. Oral corticosteroids were received as concomitant treatment for UC by 47% of patients (45% in Study UC-I and 48% in Study UC-II) and 71% were receiving concomitant aminosalicylates as treatment for UC (71% in Study UC-I, and 72% in Study UC-II). The baseline clinical characteristics were generally similar between the XELJANZ treated patients and patients receiving placebo. The primary endpoint of Study UC-I and Study UC-II was the proportion of patients in remission at Week 8, and the key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with improvement of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa at Week 8. The efficacy results of Study UC-I and Study UC-II based on the centrally read endoscopy results are shown in Table 19. |CI = Confidence interval; N = number of patients in the analysis set; TNF = tumor necrosis factor| |Study UC-I| Daily Placebo| (95% CI) |Remission at Week 8| Clinical Response at Week 8 Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in Mayo score of 3 points and 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of 1 point or absolute subscore for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1. Clinical response was observed in 60% of patients treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily compared to 33% of placebo patients in Study UC-I and 55% compared to 29% in Study UC-II. Normalization of the Endoscopic Appearance of the Mucosa at Week 8 Normalization of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 and was observed in 7% of patients treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily compared to 2% of placebo patients in both Studies UC-I and UC-II. Maintenance Trial (Study UC-III [NCT01458574]) A total of 593 patients who completed the induction trials (UC-I or UC-II) and achieved clinical response were re-randomized with 1:1:1 treatment allocation ratio to XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily, XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, or placebo for 52 weeks in Study UC-III. XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily is the recommended dosage for maintenance therapy; limit use of XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily beyond induction to those with loss of response and should be used for the shortest duration [see [Dosage and Administration (2.3)](#S2.3)]. As in the induction trials, patients were permitted to use stable doses of oral aminosalicylates; however, corticosteroid tapering was required upon entrance into this study for patients who were receiving corticosteroids at baseline. Concomitant immunosuppressants (oral immunomodulators or biologic therapies) were not permitted. At baseline of Study UC-III: The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in remission at Week 52. There were 2 key secondary endpoints: the proportion of patients with improvement of endoscopic appearance at Week 52, and the proportion of patients with sustained corticosteroid-free remission at both Week 24 and Week 52 among patients in remission at baseline of Study UC-III. The efficacy results of Study UC-III based on the centrally read endoscopy results are summarized in Table 20. |Treatment Difference versus Placebo| (95% CI) |Endpoint||Placebo||XELJANZ | 5 mg Twice Daily |XELJANZ| 10 mg Twice Daily |XELJANZ | 5 mg Twice Daily |XELJANZ | 10 mg Twice Daily |CI = Confidence interval; N = number of patients in the analysis set; TNF = tumor necrosis factor.| |Remission at Week 52| Maintenance of Clinical Response Maintenance of clinical response was defined as the proportion of patients who met the definition of clinical response (defined as a decrease from the induction study (UC-I, UC-II) baseline Mayo score of 3 points and 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of 1 point or rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1) at both Baseline and Week 52 of Study UC-III. Maintenance of clinical response was observed in 52% in the XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily group and 62% in the XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily group compared to 20% of placebo patients. Maintenance of Remission (Among Patients in Remission at Baseline) In the 179 patients who were in remission at baseline of Study UC-III (N = 59 for placebo, N = 65 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily, N = 55 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily), 46% in the XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily group and 56% in the XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily group maintained remission at Week 52 compared to 10% of placebo patients. Normalization of the Endoscopic Appearance of the Mucosa Normalization of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 and was observed at Week 52 in 15% of patients in the XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily group and 17% of patients in the XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily group compared to 4% of placebo patients. Open-label Extension Study (Study UC-IV [NCT01470612]) In Study UC-IV, 914 patients were treated of which 156 received 5 mg twice daily and 758 received 10 mg twice daily. Of the 905 patients who were assigned to XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily in the 8-week induction studies (Study UC-I or Study UC-II), 322 patients completed the induction studies but did not achieve clinical response. Of these 322 patients, 291 continued to receive XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily (unblinded) and had available data after an additional 8 weeks in Study UC-IV. After 8 additional weeks (a total of 16 weeks treatment), 148 patients achieved clinical response, and 25 patients achieved remission (based on central endoscopy read). Among those 143 patients who achieved clinical response by 16 weeks and had available data at Week 52, 66 patients achieved remission (based on local endoscopy read) after continued treatment with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily for 52 weeks. The efficacy of XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution for pcJIA was assessed in Study pcJIA-I (NCT02592434), a 44-week, two-part study (consisting of by a 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal phase) in patients 2 years to 17 years of age with active RF negative polyarthritis, RF positive polyarthritis, extended oligoarthritis, and systemic JIA without systemic manifestations who had an inadequate response or intolerance to at least one DMARD which could have included MTX or biologic agents; the study also included patients ages 2 years to 17 years of age with active juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) who had an inadequate response to NSAIDs. Patients received XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution (dosed at 5 mg twice daily or body weight-based equivalent twice daily) for 18 weeks (run-in phase) followed by randomization to either XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution (dosed at 5 mg twice daily or body weight-based equivalent twice daily) or placebo for 26 weeks (double-blind phase). Only patients who achieved at least a JIA ACR30 response at the end of the run-in phase were randomized (1:1) to the double-blind phase. Treatment with a stable dose of MTX was permitted but was not required during the study. Concurrent use of biologics or DMARDs other than MTX was not permitted in the study. A total of 225 JIA patients (56 male and 169 female) with active polyarthritis were enrolled in the run-in phase including RF negative (104), RF positive (39), extended oligoarthritis (28), systemic JIA without systemic manifestations (13), JPsA (20), and ERA (21). Patients had a mean (SD) disease duration of 3.8 \u00b1 3.5 years, and a mean (SD) number of active joints of 12.2 \u00b1 8.1. Of the 225 patients, 173 (76.9%) patients achieved JIA ACR30 response at Week 18 and were randomized into the double-blind phase to either active XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution (n=88) or placebo (n=85). At the conclusion of the 18-week, run-in ACR 30/50/70 responses 49%, respectively. In both the run-in and double-blind phases, approximately one-third of the patients were taking concomitant oral corticosteroids, and approximately two-thirds were taking concomitant MTX. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of disease flare at Week 44 relative to the double-blind phase baseline at Week 18. Disease flare was defined (according to Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group (PRCSG)/Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) Disease Flare criteria) as worsening of 30% in 3 or more of the 6 JIA core response variables with no more than 1 of the remaining JIA core response variables improving by 30%. XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution treated patients experienced significantly fewer disease flares at Week 44 compared to placebo-treated patients (31% -10%]; p=0.0007). The occurrence of disease flare by visit in Study pcJIA-I is shown in Figure 7. Figure 7: Occurrence of Disease Flare by Visit in the Double-Blind Phase in Study pcJIA-I |BID = twice daily; SE = standard error; N = total number of subjects.| The 26-week double-blind phase is from Week 18 through Week 44 on and after randomization day. A randomized open-label trial (RA Safety Study 1; NCT02092467) was conducted to evaluate safety with XELJANZ at two doses, 5 mg twice daily (N=1455) and 10 mg twice daily (N=1456), versus the TNF-blocker control (N=1451) in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor. The co-primary endpoints were adjudicated MACE (defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal stroke) and adjudicated malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer); the study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.8 for the hazard ratio of combined XELJANZ regimens versus the TNF-blocker control for each co-primary endpoint. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of the co-primary endpoints according to predefined criteria (adjudication). The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. Other endpoints included mortality, serious infections, and thromboembolic events. The median on-study follow-up time was 4.0 years. The mean age of the population was 61 years (range: 50 to 88 years). Most patients were female (78%) and Caucasian (77%). Patients had a diagnosis of RA for a mean of 10 years, and a median swollen and tender joint count of 11 and 15 respectively. Cardiovascular risk factors included cigarette smoking (current or past) (48%), hypertension (66%), high density lipoprotein < 40 mg/dL (12%), diabetes mellitus (17%), family history of premature coronary heart disease (15%), extra-articular disease associated with RA (37%), and history of coronary artery disease (11%). The non-inferiority criterion was not met for the primary comparison of the combined tofacitinib doses to TNF blockers since the upper limit of the 95% CI exceeded the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion of 1.8 (for MACE, the upper limit of the 95% CI was 1.94; for malignancies excluding NMSC, the upper limit of the 95% CI was 2.09). Table 21 shows the study results for each of the co-primary endpoints, and other endpoints. There was an increased risk of death, MACE, malignancies, serious infections, and thromboembolic events associated with both doses of XELJANZ. |Endpoint||XELJANZ | 5 mg Twice Daily N=1455 PY=5490 |XELJANZ | 10 mg | N=1451 PY=5468 |Note: XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily was discontinued by the Data Monitoring Committee due to safety concerns, and ongoing patients switched from XELJANZ 10 mg to XELJANZ 5 mg.

Lymphomas and lung cancers, which are a subset of all malignancies in RA Safety Study 1, were observed at a higher rate in patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day and XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day compared to those treated with TNF blockers. Lymphoma was reported for 4 patients receiving XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 6 patients receiving XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 1 patient receiving TNF blockers (Incidence Rate [IR] of 0.07, 0.11, and 0.02 per 100 patient-years, respectively). Among current and past smokers, lung cancer was reported for 13 patients receiving XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 15 patients receiving XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 7 patients receiving TNF blockers (IR of 0.48, 0.59, and 0.27 per 100 patient-years, respectively).
