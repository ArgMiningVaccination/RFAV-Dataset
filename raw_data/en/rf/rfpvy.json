However, it is impossible to ignore the value of conventional healthcare marketing, particularly in the modern era where the demand for individualized care is rising. In the healthcare industry, traditional marketing strategies like TV and print advertisements continue to have a significant influence on consumer behavior and purchasing decisions, according to a study by Johnson and Johnson.1 For older generations, who might not be as tech-savvy as younger generations, this is especially true. Additionally, traditional healthcare marketing can be extremely effective in promoting the advantages of yoga and other related daily physical and mental activities. Yoga can help with both physical and mental health outcomes, including lowering stress, anxiety, and depression as well as increasing flexibility and balance, according to a study by Ross et al.2 In order to improve patient outcomes, the study also recommends that healthcare professionals promote yoga as a complementary therapy to conventional medical treatments. Here, conventional marketing strategies can work well to reach a larger audience and raise awareness of the advantages of yoga and other physical and mental activities. As a result, traditional healthcare marketing is extremely important and can help to spread awareness of the advantages of traditional healthcare practices like yoga and other related physical and mental exercises. While traditional marketing strategies can support digital marketing to reach a wider audience and encourage better health outcomes, it is a crucial part of healthcare marketing. Relevance of the study The study on the relevance of traditional healthcare marketing in today's age is essential as it sheds light on the continued importance of traditional marketing methods in the healthcare sector. The study is particularly relevant as it explores the need for immediate communication of traditional healthcare practices to ensure that patients are aware of the benefits of these practices. As mentioned in the study by Johnson and Johnson,1 traditional marketing methods, such as TV and print ads, are still influential in shaping consumer behaviour and decision-making. Therefore, the study's findings can guide healthcare providers to incorporate traditional marketing methods into their marketing strategies, along with digital marketing methods, to reach a broader audience and promote traditional healthcare practices more effectively. And also, the study's relevance is highlighted by its focus on the benefits of yoga and related physical and mental activities in daily life. As shown in the study by Ross et al.2 regular yoga practice can improve physical and mental health outcomes, which can be particularly relevant in today's age, where stress and anxiety are prevalent. By exploring the relevance of yoga and other physical and mental activities in daily life, the study can encourage healthcare providers to incorporate these practices into their treatment plans and promote them to patients through traditional marketing methods. In this way, the study can contribute to improving patients' health outcomes and overall well-being. Research questions 1) Why traditional healthcare practises should be communicated immediately to the present generation 2) To report the significance of Yoga and related physical and mental practises in daily life Advantages of traditional healthcare in physical health and mental health Here are some pointwise discussions on the advantages of traditional healthcare in physical health: A. Holistic approach : Traditional healthcare practices take a holistic approach to healing, which includes addressing physical, mental, and spiritual health. This approach has been found to be effective in improving physical health outcomes. For example, Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medicine system, uses a holistic approach that includes lifestyle modifications, dietary changes, and herbal remedies to address the root cause of the disease.3 B. Personalized treatment plans : Traditional healthcare practices offer personalized treatment plans that are tailored to the patient's specific symptoms and health conditions. This approach can lead to more effective treatment outcomes. For example, traditional Korean medicine practitioners tailor their treatment plans to the patient's specific symptoms and health conditions.4 MOJ Yoga Physical Ther . 2023;5(1):6 9. 6 \u00a92023 Srinivasulu et al.

Overall, the study concludes that traditional healthcare practices should be incorporated into modern healthcare systems, and effective communication strategies should be implemented to promote these practices among the public. Keywords : traditional, healthcare, communication, yoga MOJ Y oga & Physical Therapy Research Article Open Access Relevance of traditional healthcare communication in this age7 Copyright: \u00a92023 , Fayas TA, et al. Relevance of traditional healthcare communication in this age. MOJ Yoga Physical Ther. 2023;5(1):6 9. DOI: 10.15406/mojypt.2023.05.00062C. Fewer side effects : Traditional healthcare practices have been found to have fewer side effects compared to conventional medicine. For example, acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medicine practice, is associated with fewer side effects than pharmacological treatments for various conditions, such as chronic pain and nausea.5 D. Emphasis on prevention : Traditional healthcare practices place a strong emphasis on preventing diseases from occurring in the first place. For instance, Ayurveda recommends a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management to prevent diseases.6 E. Complementary to conventional medicine : Traditional healthcare practices can complement conventional medicine in treating various health conditions. For example, acupuncture has been found to be an effective complementary therapy for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.7 Overall, traditional healthcare practices offer several advantages in improving physical health outcomes, including a holistic approach to healing, personalized treatment plans, fewer side effects, emphasis on prevention, and complementarity with conventional medicine. These findings suggest that traditional healthcare practices can play an important role in promoting physical health and well-being. Then the traditional healthcare practices have also been found to have several benefits for mental health. Here are some key advantages supported by literature: A. Mind-body connection : Traditional healthcare practices, such as yoga, tai chi, and meditation, emphasize the connection between the mind and body. Research suggests that these practices can improve mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression.8-10 B. Holistic approach : Traditional healthcare practices often take a holistic approach to health, treating the whole person rather than just addressing symptoms. This can be especially beneficial for mental health issues, which are often influenced by a variety of factors, including physical health, relationships, and environment.4,11 C. Non-invasive : Many traditional healthcare practices are non- invasive and have fewer side effects than pharmaceutical treatments. This can make them a more appealing option for individuals who may be wary of medication or concerned about side effects.10,12 D. Empowerment : Traditional healthcare practices can empower individuals to take an active role in their own mental health. For example, mindfulness meditation has been found to increase feelings of empowerment and self-efficacy.13 E. Accessibility : Traditional healthcare practices can be accessible to individuals who may not have access to traditional mental health services. This can include individuals who live in rural or remote areas, those who cannot afford traditional mental health services, or those who may face stigma or discrimination when seeking help.4,10 Thus, it can be said that, the traditional healthcare practices have significant potential to offer a wide range of benefits for mental health. However, it is important to note that these practices should not be seen as a replacement for traditional mental health treatments, but rather as a complementary approach that can be used in conjunction with other treatments.Advantages of traditional healthcare practices in work life Traditional healthcare practices can also have positive effects on work life, improving job satisfaction, productivity, and overall well- being. Some advantages of traditional healthcare practices in work life include: A. Stress reduction : Traditional healthcare practices such as mindfulness meditation and yoga have been shown to reduce stress and improve mental health outcomes.14 This can lead to increased job satisfaction and better overall work performance. B. Improved physical health : Traditional healthcare practices such as acupuncture and massage therapy have been found to alleviate pain, improve sleep quality, and boost the immune system.15 This can lead to reduced absenteeism and better physical performance on the job. C. Increased focus and concentration : Mindfulness practices such as meditation and deep breathing exercises have been found to improve cognitive function, attention, and focus.16 This can lead to increased productivity and better performance on tasks that require concentration. D. Enhanced team dynamics : Traditional healthcare practices can also be used as team-building exercises, improving communication, trust, and cooperation among colleagues.17 This can lead to better relationships in the workplace and a more positive work environment. Overall, incorporating traditional healthcare practices into work life can have numerous benefits for employees and employers alike. By improving physical and mental health, reducing stress, and enhancing team dynamics, traditional healthcare practices can improve job satisfaction, productivity, and overall well-being in the workplace. Benefits of Y oga practices to the humanity The present study has identified and reported some key benefits of yoga practices to humanity: A. Stress and anxiety reduction : Yoga practices have been shown to be effective in reducing stress and anxiety levels in both healthy individuals and those with clinical disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders). A systematic review of randomized controlled trials found that yoga can significantly reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.18 B. Improved physical health: Yoga practices are also associated with improvements in physical health, such as increased flexibility, strength, and cardiovascular health. A study of individuals with chronic low back pain found that a 12-week yoga intervention resulted in significant improvements in pain, functional disability, and mood.19 C. Enhanced cognitive function : Yoga practices have also been shown to enhance cognitive function, such as memory, attention, and concentration. A study of healthy older adults found that a 12-week yoga intervention resulted in significant improvements in cognitive function.20 D. Improved sleep : Yoga practices may also improve sleep quality and quantity. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that yoga interventions were effective in improving sleep quality and reducing sleep disturbances.18Relevance of traditional healthcare communication in this age8 Copyright: , Fayas TA, et al. Relevance of traditional healthcare communication in this age. MOJ Yoga Physical Ther. 2023;5(1):6 9. DOI: 10.15406/mojypt.2023.05.00062E. Lowered inflammation : Yoga practices have also been shown to reduce inflammation levels in the body, which is associated with a range of chronic diseases. A review of studies found that regular yoga practices can lower levels of pro-inflammatory markers in the body.21 F. Improved emotional well-being : Yoga practices may also improve emotional well-being by promoting feelings of calm, relaxation, and positivity. A study of individuals with clinical depression found that a 12-week yoga intervention resulted in significant reductions in depression symptoms and increased levels of positive emotions.22 Overall, these findings suggest that yoga practices have a wide range of benefits for human health and well-being. Relevance of communication related to the traditional healthcare practices among the public Traditional healthcare practices have been used for centuries to prevent and treat various illnesses and diseases. However, with the advent of modern medicine, many people have forgotten the importance of these practices in maintaining good health. As a result, there is a growing need to raise awareness about traditional healthcare practices among the public. One of the most effective ways to do this is through communication. Here are some reasons why communication related to traditional healthcare practices is relevant: A. Improved health outcomes : Communication about traditional healthcare practices can lead to improved health outcomes among the public. When people are aware of the benefits of traditional healthcare practices such as yoga, acupuncture, and herbal medicine, they are more likely to adopt them into their lifestyle. This can lead to better health outcomes, including reduced stress levels, improved immune function, and a lower risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. B. Increased access to healthcare : Communication about traditional healthcare practices can also increase access to healthcare among the public. Traditional healthcare practices are often more affordable and accessible than modern medicine, especially in rural areas and developing countries. By raising awareness about these practices, more people can have access to healthcare services that they may not have otherwise been aware of. C. Preservation of cultural heritage : Communication about traditional healthcare practices is also important for the preservation of cultural heritage. Many traditional healthcare practices are rooted in cultural traditions and have been passed down through generations. By promoting these practices, we can ensure that they are not lost to modernization and remain an important part of our cultural heritage. D. Integrative healthcare : Communication about traditional healthcare practices can also lead to integrative healthcare. Integrative healthcare combines modern medicine with traditional healthcare practices to provide a more holistic approach to healthcare. This can lead to better health outcomes for patients, as it addresses the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of health. In summary, communication related to traditional healthcare practices is highly relevant in today's society. It can lead to improved health outcomes, increased access to healthcare, preservation of cultural heritage, and integrative healthcare. By promoting traditional healthcare practices through communication, we can help people lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.Recommendations and Conclusion In conclusion, the literature reviewed in this study highlights the need for immediate communication of traditional healthcare practices to the present generation. With the advancement of technology and modern medicine, traditional practices have been overlooked, but they have numerous benefits for physical and mental health. The study also reports the significance of Yoga and related physical and mental practices in daily life. Yoga has been shown to improve physical health, mental wellbeing, and work-life balance. Therefore, we also recommend that healthcare providers and marketers should communicate the benefits of traditional healthcare practices.23 and Yoga to the public through various mediums, including social media, healthcare campaigns, and educational programs. The promotion of these practices can lead to the adoption of healthy habits and improved overall health and wellbeing of individuals. In summary, the relevance of traditional healthcare practices and Yoga in today's age should not be overlooked, and the benefits should be communicated to the public for better health outcomes.
