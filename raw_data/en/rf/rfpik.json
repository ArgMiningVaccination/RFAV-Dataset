July 201304 05 Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatmentIn recent years Macmillan Cancer Support has been revealing the changing nature of cancer with startling milestone figures. In 2011, we showed that more than four in 10 of us would get cancer. In 2012, our research found that the number of people living with cancer would double to four million over the next 20 years. And in 2013, we highlighted that by 2020, while almost one in two people will get cancer, almost four in 10 of those will not die from it. While it is clearly good news that more people are surviving cancer, progress can be a double-edged sword. 'Throwing Light on the Consequences of Cancer and its Treatment' (and the accompanying lay summary report 'Cured - But at What Cost?' ) reveals another vital aspect of the changing cancer story. At least one in four of those living with cancer - around 500,000 people in the UK - face poor health or disability after cancer treatment. Many cancer patients will complete their primary treatment and return, more or less, to the same level of health and wellbeing that they enjoyed before their diagnosis. But a significant proportion will experience a wide range of distressing long-term problems, such as bowel or urinary incontinence, crippling fatigue or sexual difficulties. Some will face an increased risk of heart or bone problems, a second cancer, or other health conditions that may not emerge for many decades. And the consequences of cancer and its treatment can affect much more than just a person's physical or mental health. Some patients become isolated from friends or family, or are unable to continue working, causing financial difficulties as well as further isolation. For these patients, a cure comes with a heavy and often unexpected cost. Of course, it is not just those given an 'all clear' who are affected. Many of the two million people living with cancer today are still undergoing primary treatment, or are living with incurable disease. We are not focusing on the acute side effects of treatment in this report, or on end-of-life needs, but we do not forget the additional burden they represent. Nor is this an issue restricted to older patients in poor health: a high proportion of those who were treated for cancer as children or young adults can face the long-term consequences of treatment, such as heart problems or second cancers, for the rest of their adult life. By throwing light on the scale of the problem, it shows the Government and the NHS that we must take action, particularly if we are to cope with the increased demand on services. Many healthcare professionals underestimate the long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment, and some can feel uncomfortable talking about something for which they may feel partly responsible. We must overcome this. Revealing these problems also shows people experiencing these issues that they are not alone. The current low profile of the long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment means that some people who are affected are reluctant to report them, particularly if they feel grateful to be free of cancer. With more and more people living after cancer treatment, this issue is only going to get bigger. We need action from health professionals, commissioners and policy makers to ensure that up-to-date treatment and evidence-based services are available to prevent unnecessary disability. All patients should already receive information about potential long-term consequences before and after treatment, but they should also be supported with a Recovery Package once it is complete, which includes a Holistic Needs Assessment, Care Plan, Treatment Summary, Cancer Care Review and an opportunity to attend a Health and Wellbeing Clinic. Local and national commissioners must ensure that good care is available for all and that specialist services are provided for those in particular need. Most importantly, patients should feel able to ask for help if they are experiencing any physical or emotional issues after treatment. It is good that we are curing more people of cancer. But we have to recognise that 'not dying' is not the same as 'being well'. No one should face the often severe long-term effects of cancer alone. And if we can gather better evidence and build more responsive services, no one will. Lynda Thomas Chief ExecutiveMacmillan Cancer Support There are more than two million people living with cancer in the UK today, but not all of them are living well. Cancer and its treatment often leave a gruelling physical and mental legacy for many years afterwards. It begs the question - do we really understand the true cost of being cured? Foreword It is good that we are curing more people of cancer. But we have to recognise that 'not dying' is not the same as 'being well'. No one should face the often severe long-term effects of cancer alone. 06 07 Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatmentIt is aimed at: health and social care commissioners, health policy makers, clinical networks for cancer, healthcare professionals, health service managers, and cancer research professionals. Many people with cancer experience short-term physical side effects during cancer treatment and usually these will resolve naturally within a few months. However, some will experience long- term or late-onset 'consequences of treatment' - the wide range of physical and psychosocial changes that reduce quality of life after cancer and its treatment, however long ago that treatment might have been given. It is an accepted risk that both short- and long-term consequences of treatment may occur as a result of the inevitable damage to normal tissues in the body when undertaking treatments that are designed to be highly destructive to cancer cells. It is also well known that there can be serious, long-lasting psychosocial effects. However, it is less well known that problems can persist, or appear as new problems, years or many decades after treatment. People need a level of information about the risks of treatment and how to cope with problems should they arise. More research is needed on the best strategies for personalising how these issues are communicated and discussed, within an overall approach that prepares and supports people when living with and beyond cancer. In order to plan and deliver service provision cost effectively, commissioners and providers must better understand the needs of people living with and beyond cancer, as this population is growing and ageing. It is estimated that at least 500,000 people living with and beyond cancer have one or more physical or psychosocial consequences of their cancer or its treatment that affects their lives on a long-term basis. This includes chronic fatigue, sexual difficulties, mental health problems, pain, urinary and gastrointestinal problems and lymphoedema. As a result, they may be unable to take part in activities that had been a normal part of their life before, such as going to school or college, working, shopping, socialising, being physically active, going on holiday, enjoying sexual intimacy and having children. This leads to a significant knock-on effect on family and friends, which in turn may cause the breakdown of relationships, mental health problems and further isolation. Psychosocial problems, such as fear of recurrence, are common, whether or not someone has physical consequences. Ongoing reassurance and support are vital.Certain cancer treatments increase the risk of long-term conditions such as heart disease, osteoporosis or a second cancer, and can add to the other acute and chronic conditions common in older age, resulting in serious health and social care problems or premature death. These can also occur in young adults. The impact of these risks are currently under-recognised. Problems such as these affect people's lives more than is generally recognised, and are often poorly dealt with. Although many people return to a high level of wellbeing after cancer treatment, and do not report any problems, a significant minority have unmet needs that will increasingly impact on primary and secondary care unless action is taken. Improvements for patients are achievable, but commissioners and providers need to better understand that there is a strong case for change: This is not a small-scale issue in the population, and the numbers will grow. The increase in need will largely come from older people with co-morbidities that may be exacerbated by cancer treatment. In terms of life-years at risk, people treated as children or young people also represent a population with significant health and social care needs. There is a socio-economic impact from children, young people and adults being unable to continue education or be economically active, due to ill health. Quality of life can be compromised for the people affected. There are significant costs being incurred by individuals, the NHS and the state. There are simple and inexpensive interventions. People with complex problems benefit from specialist multidisciplinary care. Simple interventions include physical activity programmes, provision of information about self-management of problems, public toilet access schemes, dietary advice and monitoring for problems, all underpinned by a Recovery Package for every cancer patient after treatment that includes an Holistic Needs Assessment, a Care Plan, a Treatment Summary, a Cancer Care Review in primary care and access to a Health and Wellbeing Clinic (see the 2013 Department of Health report 1 'Living With and Beyond Cancer: Taking Action to Improve Outcomes'). Commissioners and providers should design and commission pathways, services and new treatment methods that minimise the consequences of cancer and its treatment and address need. National commissioning needs to address the inequitable and low level of provision of specialist services for severe, complex problems, in which specialist multidisciplinary teams can deliver holistic physical and psychosocial care. This is as important for newly treated patients as for long- term survivors. More education and research is needed to improve knowledge and to establish the consequences of cancer and its treatment as a healthcare/academic field in its own right. For example, methods - such the stratification of patients and the use of biomarkers - need to be developed to predict the consequences of cancer and its treatment, and to guide further management. There is an urgent need to improve survivorship intelligence, particularly in developing a better understanding of the population who have unmet needs and how those needs can be addressed cost effectively. This report is intended for people who are seeking to learn more about the consequences of cancer and its treatment, in order to inform their work in commissioning and providing services that meet the needs of people living with and beyond cancer. Executive summary 09 Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 1 2 3 4 5 08Executive summary Key recommendations: General recommendations to everyone involved in redesigning services and support for people living with and beyond cancer Prevent or minimise consequences of cancer and its treatment where possible, through healthier lifestyle choices, better surveillance, improved imaging, minimally invasive surgery, targeted radiotherapy and the use of modern drugs. Inform patients of potential consequences of cancer and its treatments, with simple strategies for self-management, and the value in taking early action and how to seek appropriate help. Identify patients at potential risk, summarising the interventions received in a Treatment Summary that codes potential consequences so they can be easily anticipated, recognised and monitored in primary care. Assess potential consequences through regular Holistic Needs Assessment, the use of 'power' questions and Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) tools at regular time points. Support patients through local care pathways for the consequences of cancer and its treatment, which include support for self-management and referral to appropriate specialist services. Recommendations to organisations that influence or carry out cancer commissioning General recommendations Local implementation of the NCSI Recovery Package in England, or the equivalent in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. National commissioning of specialist services for complex problems arising from cancer treatment. National quality and outcomes measurement should be embedded and further developed, including quality standards and PROMs for people living with and beyond cancer treatment, in order to monitor service delivery and cancer patient outcomes. Inclusion in the cancer Maps of Medicine and Cancer Peer Review Programme of evidence-based management of consequences of cancer and its treatment. Specific recommendations National commissioning of specialist services for:1 People with complex injuries resulting from radiation treatment for breast cancer. The Breast Radiation Injury Rehabilitation Service (BRIRS) should continue being nationally commissioned for England. 2 People with complex problems in adulthood as a result of child and young people's cancer treatments. 3 People with complex problems as a result of treatments for pelvic cancer, such as severe bowel, urinary and/or sexual dysfunction. Continue and extend the current programme of survivorship PROM surveys in England. It is estimated that at least 500,000 people living with and beyond cancer have one or more physical or psychosocial consequences of their cancer or its treatment that affects their lives on a long-term basis.010 011 Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment Executive summaryRecommendations to professional organisations and organisations who arrange training and education General recommendations Develop, publish and maintain clinical guidance on the management of the consequences of cancer and its treatment. Set educational and skills standards and competences in relation to the consequences of cancer and its treatment. Provide accessible education for professionals on the consequences of cancer and its treatments. Undertake audits/research on the consequences of cancer and its treatment.Specific recommendations Prioritise clinical guidance development where need is seen to be greatest, for example in pelvic cancers and head and neck cancers, ensuring that psychosocial consequences are always considered alongside physical ones. General recommendations to the research community Extend, build on and ratify the evidence base for: Prevalence of consequences of cancer and its treatment Costs of managing consequences of cancer and its treatment Treatments for consequences of cancer and its treatment Methods to prevent or minimise consequences of cancer and its treatment Methods for monitoring for consequences of cancer and its treatment including the risk of developing long-term conditions Cost-effectiveness of new cancer follow up pathways. General recommendations to the voluntary sector Raise awareness in individuals of the availability of post-treatment support through health and social care services, support groups, online community support, information etc. Raise the profile of consequences of cancer and its treatment as a health policy issue.Recommendations to cancer care professionals, other secondary care professionals, primary care professionals and social care professionals General recommendations Review patient information provision to ensure that appropriate information is available at multiple points (including at consent to cancer treatment) on risks of long-term consequences and how to seek help should problems arise. Local implementation of the NCSI Recovery Package (or similar post-treatment package) 2. Educate care providers by taking opportunities to increase their knowledge of how to identify and manage patients who have needs related to the consequences of cancer and its treatment. Develop referral pathways between cancer teams and local or regional specialists in supporting and managing the consequences of cancer and its treatment.Specific recommendations Fully implement the NCSI Children and Young People service models and aftercare pathways as per the QIPP Quality and Productivity case study 4. Review the main pelvic cancer care pathways (NICE, Maps of Medicine etc) and ensure that they include signposting/referral pathways to local/regional specialists in supporting and managing the consequences of pelvic cancer and its treatment, such as: Patient support groups, online communities, telephone services, including physiotherapy (pelvic specialist), vocational rehabilitation, physical activity schemes e.g. exercise on referral schemes (or a walking scheme), services for management of fatigue, body image or memory loss, etc. Primary care team for managing and monitoring for long-term conditions (as appropriate). Complementary therapies such as acupuncture.Stop smoking service.Social services including carer support.Financial advice service.Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment13 121 The consequences of cancer and its treatment can affect people's lives in many ways.Introduction 1 However, they remain an under- researched area of healthcare in terms of: Describing the population that have health and social needs in relation to the consequences of cancer and its treatment; Effective ways to treat and support people who have consequences of cancer and its treatment; Effective ways to reduce/prevent damage to healthy tissues from cancer treatments; and Effective ways to reduce/prevent psychosocial problems. Without better evidence and wider awareness, insufficient attention will be given to improving outcomes for people affected by the consequences of cancer and its treatment. This is particularly important given the increase in older people being treated for cancer, who are likely to have co-morbidities and social care needs that may be exacerbated by the treatment. The 2013 NCSI report 1 'Living With and Beyond Cancer: Taking Action to Improve Outcomes' calls upon commissioners and providers to design and commission pathways and services that minimise the consequences of cancer and its treatment and address need. It also describes the urgent need to improve survivorship intelligence, particularly in developing a better understanding of the survivorship population, which is critical to improving outcomes and understanding the costs of meeting those unmet needs. The National Cancer Intelligence Network is working with Macmillan Cancer Support's Population Evidence Programme 3 to improve epidemiological data such as incidence and prevalence of the consequences of cancer treatment. To support this drive to improve outcomes for people affected or at risk, this report makes, for the first time, estimates of how many people are affected by specific long-term problems after cancer treatment in the UK. Some of these problems may also be relatively common in people unaffected by cancer, such as depression or female urinary incontinence. This report aims to show that, regardless of the baseline incidence in the population, those people affected by cancer, by virtue of their contact with health services, are in a unique position to be helped to more effectively self-manage, to minimise the risk of long-term health problems and to make healthy lifestyle choices. However, self-management is only part of the solution, and it does not take away the health service's responsibility to care for patients who may have been left with unexpected and possibly permanent side effects of their cancer treatment.Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 1 1The biggest barrier to widespread improvement is still the lack of awareness amongst health commissioners and professionals of the issues faced by people after cancer treatment.The NCSI project on the consequences of pelvic cancer treatment (e.g. colorectal, prostate, bladder, gynaecological), led by Macmillan Cancer Support, has aimed to improve outcomes for a large number of people with problems ranging from mild to severe that may affect bowel, bladder and sexual function, as well as with psychosocial issues. Work is ongoing on the development and evaluation of resources such as patient information to help support self-management, and clinical guidance for professionals on managing mild/moderate problems. Service models are being evaluated, and a business case for the creation of a small number of specialist multidisciplinary services for severe, complex cases is being developed. However, the biggest barrier to widespread improvement is still the lack of awareness amongst health commissioners and professionals of the issues faced by people after cancer treatment. It is hoped that this document will increase awareness and lead to greater ownership of this agenda, and adequate assessment of population health needs. In anticipation of questions on how needs could be met, evidence and opinions were sought on the key ways in which local and national bodies could address the barriers to improving outcomes. All challenges and questions about this report are welcomed. In preparing it, many limitations were found with the available data and hence it is emphasised that prevalence estimates are indicative, and should be used with caution. Although the literature strongly suggests that many long-term problems are caused or exacerbated by cancer treatment, there are not enough data recorded to prove this conclusively in all cases, or to indicate how long these problems might last.Clinicians and the research community do not currently have robust, systematic methods to assess and record the incidence and severity of consequences of cancer and its treatment, to support both the clinical management of individuals and the measurement of outcomes in epidemiological studies and clinical trials. Health professionals and managers are therefore currently unable to plan effectively to meet the predicted increase in patient need that is accompanying improved survival rates, and unable to provide newly diagnosed patients with realistic predictions of the risks associated with their treatment. The estimates of prevalence give a vital picture of what kind of problems exist, and how many people are affected overall, but they still do not provide enough information to help health commissioners understand the degree of prioritisation of need within the population affected, or where inequalities exist. Should be selectively addressed? For example, there are opportunities to improve outcomes: For the small groups of people affected by very serious life-changing consequences of cancer and its treatment, in order to bring significant benefit to these individuals and their carers; For large groups of people affected by consequences of cancer and its treatment that have a lower, but still significant, impact on quality of life, in order to bring benefit to the largest number of people; For people affected by consequences decades after their cancer treatment ended, and who are likely to have lost contact with cancer care teams, but have a need for closer monitoring due to the risk of premature mortality. The NCSI chose to focus its consequences of cancer and its treatment work on two main groups: People living after child or young people's cancer treatment (small number of people with high survival chances, but a high proportion affected long-term, many with complex conditions lasting decades). People living with the consequences of pelvic cancer treatment (large number of people with moderate survival chances, a significant minority affected long-term, with problems ranging from mild to very severe). The Children and Young People cancer survivorship initiative, led by NHS Improvement, has tested and implemented service models and aftercare pathways to improve quality and the patient experience, with particular focus on the consequences of cancer and its treatment. The model has been accepted as a Quality, Innovation, Productivity, Prevention (QIPP) case study 4, which indicates that it leads to modest savings from reduced consultant outpatient appointments. NHS Improving Quality is now taking forward the roll out of the recommendations to the 19 Children's Cancer Centres in England and Wales, followed by the 14 Teenage and Young Adult Centres by 2014. These improvements will benefit children and young people currently still under the care of a cancer centre. Further challenges include: Developing transition services, so that young people are carefully transitioned to multi-disciplinary adult after care; and Targeting the group who were treated in the past and who have, or are at risk of, long-term complex problems, but are now unable to access the kind of co-ordinated monitoring and care that they need. 15 14IntroductionThrowing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 17 162a Definition In this report, the terms 'consequences of cancer and its treatment' and 'consequences of treatment' mean the wide range of long-term physical and psychosocial changes that seem to be associated with cancer and its treatment, however long ago the diagnosis and treatment might have been given. It is a difficult topic to define precisely because health professionals and researchers do not use a common terminology. treatment' are all used. For simplicity, in this report the term used mainly is 'consequences', which aims to cover as broad a definition as possible, but with a focus on consequences that have the greatest long-term impact on patients' lives. The phrase 'long-term' covers not only chronic problems that arise soon after treatment, but also late-onset conditions that may arise decades later. Although this report is not able to describe every consequence of cancer and its treatment on a person (including the consequences of someone being told that they have cancer, whether or not treatment is given - or the effect on family and friends), it is recognised that all consequences have the potential to affect quality of life. The particular issues faced by people in active treatment or at the end of life are not covered in this report, as they are covered elsewhere 5, 6. Hence, it should be noted that the figures presented in this report, which are intended to provide a measure of how many people are affected by certain long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment, will probably not represent the totality of need in this population. 2b Types of consequences of cancer and its treatments Cancer patients may receive surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy and hormone therapy, either alone or in combination depending on the stage of the disease and other factors. For each treatment option, there may be multiple physical and psychosocial consequences for a patient affecting different parts of the body, with some of them permanent. In general, the majority of patients will not experience consequences long term, but a significant minority do, and for some, the consequences may be very severe or even fatal 7. Figure 1 lists possible long-term effects for cancer patients. Further information about the possible long-term consequences of cancer and its treatments for individual c ancer types can be found on the Macmillan Cancer Support website www.macmillan.org.uk .2 2What are the consequences of cancer and its treatment?Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 2 2What are the consequences of cancer and its treatment? 19 18Figure 1 Possible long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment Collated from the multiple references used in this document Psychological and social consequences Fear of cancer recurrence Fear of future HPV infection Body image issues Lack of confidence Memory/concentration problemsImpact on family/friendsFinancial problemsIsolation Anxiety Stress DepressionChange of outlook on life Physical consequences Pain, arthralgia, numbnessScarringFacial or body disfigurement Persistent hair loss Lymphoedema Peripheral neuropathy FatigueNausea, vomitingWeight loss, weight gain Sleep or bladder adhesions, strictures, fistulae Stoma $ Hernia Bleeding from the bowel or bladder Changes in bladder function* Sexual difficulties# Early menopauseHot flushesLoss of and problemsHearing lossBreathing difficulties Endocrine dysfunction Cardiovascular disease Pelvic necrosisOsteoporosisSecond primary cancer * Includes chronic incontinence, urgency, diarrhoea, constipation, leakage, flatulence. # Problems preventing a normal sex life, e.g. erectile dysfunction, penile shortening, vaginal dryness, stenosis and shortening, sexual pain and loss of sexual interest, psychosexual problems. $ As a result of bowel adhesions, strictures, fistulae etc. ^^ Including being unable to speak or eat.

This leads to a significant knock-on effect on family and friends, which in turn may cause breakdown of relationships, mental health problems and further isolation. The impact on people's daily lives is best described in their own words. Several reports that include patient testimonies have been published (for example 8,9,10,11), with websites12,13 and patient forums14,15 also giving very good insight. See also case studies in Appendix 2. There are many studies linking certain consequences of cancer and its treatment to reduced quality of life, e.g. 16,17,18 although in general most people will not experience long-term problems after cancer treatment and report a good quality of life, and for some, certain changes may have a positive impact. The following quotes are mostly taken from patients' free-text comments in the Department of Health survey of people living one to five years after a Hodgkin lymphoma, breast, prostate or colorectal cancer diagnosis 19. Although more people gave positive comments than negative about their experience of living with and beyond cancer, a wide range of ongoing physical, psychological and social problems were reported by participants that were side effects of cancer treatment and that impacted greatly on their quality of life 18,20.What are the consequences of cancer and its treatment? 20 21' I do have a fear of dying and [the] cancer returning (I've seen what it did to my mother!) and I would have liked someone to sit down with me for 10 minutes and explain what's happening and can happen.' Male, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 1 year after diagnosis ' My anxiety has been affected in the sense that I never know when I will have [an] accident with my bowels. This can be a nightmare when driving or on public transport (sometimes I have very little warning and I can go 10 or 20 times or more in 2 hours). You never know when it's going to stop with the diarrhoea. [I] always have to think what I am eating i.e. about the fibre.' Male, prostate cancer, 3 years after diagnosis ' Nobody warned me that having 16cm of intestine removed would have such a severe effect on my bowel movements, and little dietary advice has been forthcoming.' Male, colorectal cancer, 1 year after diagnosis' I have lymphoedema in my left arm... This condition is for the rest of my life. Patients should be told of the fact that they may develop lymphoedema after their operation. It was a shock to find out later.' Female, breast cancer, 5 years after diagnosis ' I had colorectal surgery, its side effects affected my life badly. I should have been warned/ advised about those side effects to decide. If I knew about them I would not [have] go[ne] ahead with surgery.' Male, colorectal cancer, 3 years after diagnosis ' My problem is that I have one breast much larger therefore am having difficulty with underwear and clothes and certainly am too embarrassed to go swimming. I know this sound[s] trivial but it has made me quite depressed. I know my consultant is busy but they told me it wouldn't be long [before I could have breast reconstruction surgery]. I was offered an operation [...] but with one day's notice, which I just couldn't do.' Female, breast cancer, 3 years after diagnosis' It is now over 9 month[s] since my op and I am still paying for my own continence pads. [...] The pads cost \u00a34.50 for a box of 10. I think patients should be given the information to contact the continence service before the operation so they have pads.' Male, prostate cancer, 3 years after diagnosis ' I had a stem cell/bone marrow transplant a year ago but lately my depression has got so severe I have been to hospital many times on suicide watch. People need to realise that after all your cancer treatment your mind plays tricks on you. I have honestly been to hell and back. It is after treatment that you need care. I feel totally alone and have brought my 16 year old daughter up on my own. I have to stay strong so she can have a normal life. I hate it when I'm laid in bed crying and she doesn't know what to do!' Female, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 2 years after diagnosisThrowing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 2 2These testimonies clearly show that, for some, the consequences of cancer and its treatment can have a very negative effect on quality of life. It is also worth considering the scenarios of these same individuals some years later: How will their close relationships have been affected? Will they have developed other co-morbidities? Will they have a dependent partner but family who do not live near enough to provide support? If the long-term effects of cancer treatment are well managed or are avoided in the first place, this could prevent GP visits, hospital admissions, a move into residential/nursing care (for cancer survivors themselves or a spouse) or a requirement for home help, or prevent a family member having to give up work to act as carer. All these have cost implications for health and social care, as well as for the individuals affected. 2d What causes the consequences of cancer and its treatment? Although discussed as two sections below, the physical and psychosocial consequences of treatment cannot and should not be separated when considering health and social care services and support for people affected by cancer. Psychosocial and physical issues are so closely intertwined, each impacting on the other, that a holistic approach to needs assessment, support and treatment is vital. Equal weight should be given to developing psychological therapies and psychosocial support as should be given to interventions for physical symptoms after treatment.What are the consequences of cancer and its treatment? 22' Would have liked to know that the drugs which caused nerve damage could affect my balance and walking and that this could lead to back pain [sciatica]. Then I could have started preventative measures i.e. Pilates which I now do to prevent reoccurrences.' Female, breast cancer, 2 years after diagnosis ' Although I was 65 when diagnosed, I was newlywed, the hormone treatment ruined our sex life and we found this extremely upsetting and difficult to live with especially my wife who still gets very upset. A less strong relationship could have split up.' Male, prostate cancer, 2 years after diagnosis ' Well, I had to get all my teeth removed before the radiotherapy and I found that completely devastating. I wasn't prepared for it, it was just a case of, 'You're going to the dentist to get your teeth checked,' and I thought, 'Fine.' Then all of a sudden somebody said to me, 'Okay, all your teeth have to come out, cheerio.' I found that worse than being told I had cancer for some reason.' Female, head and neck cancer, 2 years after diagnosisPsychosocial consequences Psychological morbidity, such as anxiety and depression, is a major problem that arises from the many significant changes experienced by individuals and the people around them resulting from a diagnosis of cancer and the effects of treatment. These psychosocial impacts can often be seen as 'adjustment disorders' as they represent a difficulty in adjusting to the functional and existential crisis that cancer represents. Psychosocial consequences are not just about emotions, but arise from the challenge of adapting to the physical and functional problems associated with cancer and its treatment. People with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis are at higher risk of psychosocial problems. People are faced with the possibility of dying and have to cope with the extensive demands of cancer and its treatment. They may feel scared, uncertain, or angry. Numbness, confusion and difficulty concentrating are all common, as is loss of confidence, and feelings of shock, disbelief, fear, anxiety, guilt, sadness, grief and depression. There may be a sense of loss, as ways of coping with the new, unwanted changes in their life need to be found. These feelings may occur at the time of diagnosis, during treatment, or when people are recovering and adjusting to life after treatment. Distress during treatment can also lead to difficulties in long-term adjustment 21. All types of cancer treatment can change the way the body looks, works or feels, which may cause embarrassment, loss of confidence and worry about the impact on family, friends and work colleagues. Intimate relationships may be adversely affected due to: feeling sexually unattractive; having no desire for sex; loss of sexual satisfaction; a partner distancing themselves; and functional changes in erectile capacity, vaginal anatomy and physiology (which may cause sexual pain and changes in ejaculation and orgasm). Loss of fertility and the need to engage with reproductive technologies (sperm cryopreservation/egg freezing) at a time when you are also coming to terms with a cancer diagnosis can also be distressing. Friendships and support networks change, and some people may find themselves isolated. Psychosocial problems can affect a person's ability to self-manage, and cause greater reliance on other people or health and social services. Some treatments (e.g. chemotherapy and treatments for brain cancer) may lead to cognitive changes, which can affect the way people are able to live their lives. This is particularly the case for young people, who may not be able to leave home, find a job or go on to higher education 22. Some psychosocial consequences may be severe, resulting in persistent mental health difficulties. People living with and beyond cancer are considered to be at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder due to the shock and trauma of having a life-threatening disease and receiving treatment for cancer. Estimates of the prevalence of some psychosocial consequences are given in Chapter 3, Table 4B. Such substantial changes to feelings, relationships, mental health and outlook on life are an understandable and common consequence of cancer, and therefore people's need for support and intervention should be assessed systematically and appropriate services provided, as it would be for a physical consequence of treatment. 23Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 2 22e What can be done during treatment to prevent adverse consequences? It is not the intention of this document to provide detailed information on all the methods currently in use or being researched for the prevention and clinical management of the consequences of cancer treatment. This section briefly outlines how strategies for cancer treatment continually develop and that future significant progress is possible on preventing consequences of treatment by modifying cancer treatment techniques. (Appendix 4 provides some links to information on the clinical management of consequences once they occur.) The goal of research into any new cancer treatment is to find the most effective cancer-killing regime with the minimal level of toxicity during and after treatment. Scientists are constantly seeking treatments that target cancer cells as precisely as possible, e.g. robotic surgery, therapies, which damage normal tissue to a lesser extent than older treatments. However, as described in section 2d, each patient is likely to have a different response to the same treatment, and none of these methods can avoid causing any consequences. While researchers aim to develop new treatments that improve survival and minimise consequences of treatment, there is evidence that some new therapies may not achieve any reduction in the incidence or severity of consequences, or risk rare but serious complications 7,37,38. Hence, monitoring for consequences will always be necessary. Therefore, increasingly, an additional goal of cancer research is to find ways to assess patients to predict their responses to treatment, thus allowing modification of the regime to improve the chances of destroying the cancer with a lessened risk of damage to healthy tissue. For example, a pharmacogenomic approach aims to identify individuals with a high risk of toxicity from conventional doses of a chemotherapy drug, thus indicating reduced doses and a decreased risk of toxicity 39. Biomarkers have the potential to predict the occurrence of consequences, such as anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, before the patient becomes symptomatic, thus allowing for early and potentially life-saving interventions 40. Biomarkers may also help to improve preoperative cancer staging, better inform treatment options, and improve the referral patterns of patients with urgently treatable cancers towards more appropriate modes of therapy 41. Research is also being undertaken into whether there are agents that can protect against or reduce the severity of certain consequences, without affecting the cancer-killing properties of the cancer treatment. These agents may have to be taken in advance, or alongside and after treatment. For example, several novel agents are being tested as drugs to prevent or reduce gastrointestinal radiation injury 42. These drugs may also reduce injury after radiation exposure has occurred, but much more research is needed to confirm this. To minimise psychosocial consequences, the concept of preparing people during treatment with simple strategies of how to proactively manage their physical, psychological and social recovery, and any long-term problems after cancer treatment ('pre-habilitation') is recognised as an area that needs much more consideration 43. The Department of Health survivorship survey suggests that very few people are suitably prepared for what to expect when treatment finishes20.Gradual tissue changes mean that some people do not experience symptoms until years or even decades after cancer treatment.Physical consequences In order to destroy cancerous cells in the body, some healthy tissues will also be damaged24,25. While the research community continues to develop more targeted cancer therapies to minimise such damage (e.g. biological therapies, interventional radiology (IR) and proton beam radiotherapy (PBT)), no current treatments can avoid damaging healthy cells. Whether this damage leads to long-term or late-onset consequences depends on a multitude of factors that are not yet well understood, but include: Cancer treatment type, dosages, frequency and/or combinations 26; Gender, age26; Lifestyle choices (weight, smoking, diet, alcohol, physical activity) 27; Pre-existing conditions (e.g. diabetic neuropathy 28); Pre-existing medication (e.g. statins may have preventative effect 29); Post-treatment incidents (e.g. arm trauma triggering lymphoedema 30); Social deprivation31; and Genetic profile32. Research into the mechanisms by which cancer treatments cause symptoms to arise is needed so that preventative or protective measures against healthy-tissue damage can start to be uncovered. Mechanisms of radiation damage are better understood 33 than other therapies. The impact of cancer treatments on pre-existing long-term conditions is not well understood. A common and highly effective treatment for certain cancers is radiotherapy. The radiation is targeted as precisely as possible at the tumour, but it is inevitable that some surrounding healthy tissue will be irradiated. For example, radiotherapy of a tumour in the pelvic region may affect the bowel, genitourinary organs, skin, blood vessels, lymphatic system, nerves or bone. Acute side effects (during or immediately after radiotherapy) will usually resolve quickly in tissues with rapid cell turnover. Chronic problems after pelvic radiotherapy are increasingly being termed 'pelvic radiation disease' 34. This is because subtle sub-cellular changes may develop gradually after cancer treatment has ended, leading to a cascade of adverse effects on tissues. For example, changes to small blood vessels may reduce tissue blood supply and cause an increase in fibrosis (scarring). Over time, this may lead to tissue inflexibility, internal adhesions, changes to physiological function and shrinkage of organs (e.g. bladder, bowel, vagina), resulting in problems such as loss of bowel or bladder control, or pain during sex. These gradual changes, sometimes termed 'late effects', mean that some people do not experience symptoms until many months, years or even decades after treatment. Examples include heart failure after anthracyline chemotherapy for a range of cancers 35, and bone fractures due to osteoporosis caused by the effect of hormonal treatment on bone cells in breast or prostate cancer patients 36. There is a growing body of evidence implicating cancer treatments in increased risk of second primary cancers later in life, again due to a lengthy sequence of sub-cellular changes that currently cannot necessarily be prevented.What are the consequences of cancer and its treatment? 25 242What are the consequences of cancer and its treatment? 26Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 272There is a growing acknowledgement that healthy lifestyle choices can help to protect against some short- and long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment 44,45. A recent report46 by Cancer Research UK highlights the acceptability to patients, family and friends of professionals offering lifestyle advice to cancer patients. Again, much more evidence is needed to help professionals and patients make appropriate choices before, during and after cancer treatment, based on knowledge of the risks of both the physical and psychosocial consequences of cancer and its treatment, and whether the risks can be minimised. 2f Are the risks of consequences acceptable? The risk of long-term and late-onset symptoms must be balanced against whether a particular treatment regime gives the optimal outcome in terms of cancer cure. However, at present, most newly diagnosed patients cannot be given realistic predictions of the long-term risks associated with their treatment 47. There are many ethical and legal issues around the provision of information to patients on their treatment choices and on the risks of side effects (short and long term) that are discussed at the point of formal consent to treatment and subsequently. This document cannot cover these issues in detail. However, it is a fact that some people will unfortunately get unpleasant consequences or may even die as a result of their treatment 5,48, and these risks will not be eliminated in the foreseeable future. Most people accept that it is worth taking the risk of developing side effects in order to get the most effective cure for their cancer 49. Good assessment of the information needs of patients, and the offer of personalised information, is vital to help people make an informed decision about their treatment. Some information on the potential long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment is needed so that they can be monitored for, and the minority of patients who do develop problems are better able to recognise that their cancer treatment may have been the cause, and to know how to seek help 50. 2g Information for patients about the risks of long-term consequences A study carried out for Macmillan describes how there is a need to maintain some ambiguity about the future when providing information to cancer patients 47. This poses a difficult dilemma for healthcare professionals when assessing the information needs of their patients about the possible consequences of cancer and its treatment. It is impossible to define exactly what information patients want about the risks of consequences, and when to provide it, because every patient is unique and therefore information needs are highly variable. Healthcare professionals draw on their expertise in communicating risk associated with cancer treatments, but excessive information on this topic at the point of cancer diagnosis or treatment choice can be a burden to some patients, and knowledge of future risk may be a significant risk factor for later anxiety, depression and fear 26. The desire for information may depend on the level of personal health literacy and motivation. However, a paternalistic approach to withholding information about the risk of side effects should be avoided. It has been argued that complete disclosure is needed 51, but currently it is not known when the optimal time is or what the optimal approach is to discuss risks with a patient, and who is best placed to do this26. A recent evidence review52 found that \"appropriate information provision led to an improved health competence, a better sense of control over cancer and better symptom management\", and that patients had less confidence to deal with health-related issues when they had had difficulty obtaining the information they wanted. Although evidence shows that a majority of people are satisfied with the information they received about their treatment and side effects, these surveys tend to be focused on patients soon after treatment (e.g. the English 2011/12 National Cancer Patient Experience Survey 53). Given the crucial importance of information that helps support people in the long term to self-manage and avoid healthcare interventions, it is disappointing that in the 2011 Department of Health survivorship survey of people one to five years since diagnosis 54 20 to 30% said that it would have been helpful to have had more advice or information on the physical aspects of living with and after cancer, the emotional aspects and diet/lifestyle. When free-text comments in the 2011 Department of Health survivorship survey 19 were analysed, five out of the six recommendations focused on improving the offer of information to individuals on preparing for the physical consequences of treatment and the 'psychological aftermath' of receiving a diagnosis of a potentially life threatening illness. The recommendations cover information about: Cancer diagnosis and treatment options; Potential physical effects of treatment; Self-management and coping strategies; Access to support services; Potential psychological impact of end of treatment and in the long-term; and Access to advice on social, work and financial issues. Feedback from people who have received pelvic radiotherapy frequently mentions a lack of awareness of possible long-term effects on the bowel, bladder and sexual function 55,56, despite the fact that inexpensive interventions, such as providing a 'toilet card' 57 and/ or Radar key58, doing pelvic exercises or moderating the intake of dietary fibre or fat 59, allow some people to better self-manage and potentially avoid more serious problems. In one study 55, less than half of pelvic radiotherapy patients reported receiving both verbal and written information on potential long- term effects of treatment. People may forget that they have been given information, so need to have it reiterated at multiple later time points (both verbally and written). In another study 56, 30 people who had had pelvic radiotherapy were asked for their views on a Macmillan booklet explaining possible consequences of pelvic radiotherapy60, and 100% said they found it helpful. One response was: \"Having endured anal cancer treatment I am still coming to terms with after-effects a year later. I wish I had read [the booklet] earlier so that I could identify all my symptoms as being a direct result of radio/chemo. Most doctors, employers and [the] public are unaware of the effects on one's life. This book made me feel less isolated.\" Most newly diagnosed cancer patients cannot be given realistic predictions of the long-term risks associated with their treatment.Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 2 2What are the consequences of cancer and its treatment? 28 29There are many other ways in which people can access information about life after treatment; for instance, talking to other patients who have already been through the treatment, through video stories such as provided by www.healthtalkonline.org and www.youthhealthtalk.org 61 or reading personal experiences on online cancer patient forums. Overall, there are clear shortfalls in information about the possible long-term consequences of cancer treatment.Patient feedback and other evidence strongly support better provision. Expert consensus is that there is a need to personalise this provision throughout the cancer diagnosis and treatment phase, and then to ensure that information about consequences is also proactively offered at later time points, especially when a patient is moving from treatment to follow up, or from follow up to self-management. However, healthcare professionals' views appear to be more reactive than proactive 47. The Macmillan Listening Study found that people affected by cancer want researchers to give the highest priority to finding better ways to help with living with cancer 62.This study also found that \"research on treatment\" was given equal ranking (7th out of 13) to research on \"experience and management of side effects\", whereas the current balance in UK cancer research effort and funding is heavily weighted towards research on treatments. There is therefore an urgent need for more research on the best strategies for communication about the risk of consequences of cancer and its treatment and their management, within an overall approach that prepares and supports people when living with and beyond cancer. Cancer treatment can cause a wide range of long-term physical, psychological and social consequences, some of which may not arise for many years or even decades afterwards. The consequences of cancer and its treatment can have a very negative effect on quality of life, although in general most people will not experience long-term problems after cancer treatment and report a good quality of life Strategies for cancer treatment are continually developing, and future progress is possible on preventing consequences of treatment by modifying cancer treatment techniques, but the risks of consequences of treatments can never be eliminated. Excessive information on consequences of cancer and its treatment at the point of cancer diagnosis or treatment choice can be a burden to some patients, so a proactive approach to personalised assessment of information needs and provision at multiple time points should be used. The provision of high-quality timely personalised information is a fundamental element of cancer care (including follow up in primary and community care) and one that can be improved at little or no cost, resulting in a better patient experience, fewer symptoms, fewer crises and better quality of life. There is an urgent need for more research on the best strategies for communication about the risk of consequences of cancer and its treatment and their management, within an overall approach that prepares and supports people when living with and beyond cancer.Cha PTer 2 summaryThrowing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 3 31 3033a Overall prevalence of consequences of cancer and its treatment i. Why it is important to quantify needs and demand for support with consequences of cancer and its treatmentThe population of people living with and beyond cancer is growing and ageing, and has multiple needs. In order to plan and deliver service provision cost effectively, commissioners and providers must better understand these needs. This chapter provides estimates of the prevalence of particular consequences of cancer treatment in the UK as an indicator of the overall level of need for interventions such as support for self-management and specialist clinical services. The level of unmet need and demand is much more difficult to quantify, but there is clear evidence of unmet need and of rising demand, which will place further strain on primary and secondary care unless action is taken. ii. How many people are treated for cancer? If we assume that the majority of people diagnosed with cancer will receive some sort of treatment, then this amounts to approximately 300,000 - 325,000 people per year 63 who will have surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or other treatments, either alone or in combination, at an annual cost to UK health services of an estimated \u00a35.5-5.8 billion 64. A large proportion of these will have treatment with curative intent, while some will have palliative treatment (e.g. to shrink an incurable tumour or for metastases). However, data are not yet easily available (from the UK's national repositories of cancer data) to give the full picture of how many people have each kind of cancer treatment for each cancer type in the UK each year. This makes it very difficult to assess with any accuracy what the potential impact of the consequences of each kind of treatment might be on the population. For many patients, treatment is very successful. Around half of those diagnosed with cancer today will live for at least 10 years after diagnosis. For some cancers, such as melanoma and testicular cancer, the figure is higher than four in five 65. More than one in three people who have had cancer (35%) will now ultimately die from another cause, increasing to 38% by 2020 66. Level of need relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatmentThrowing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 3 The number of people living with and after a cancer diagnosis in the UK is currently estimated at two million67. This number will continue to increase significantly for the foreseeable future (by about 3% per year, equivalent to one million per decade) so that, by 2030, the total will be four million. Of these, over two million will be at least five years beyond diagnosis (Figure 2). In addition, the age profile will change, and a greater proportion will be aged 65 and over (Figure 3). By 2030, one in five people over 65 will be living with a cancer diagnosis, and older people will account for 73% of the total number of people with a cancer diagnosis, an increase from 63% in 2010 68.These increases will significantly impact on the quantity and nature of health and social care required, with a greater demand for rehabilitation and services to manage the long-term effects of cancer and its treatment 1, and greater needs likely amongst older people who will tend to have co-morbidities. Failing to meet these needs will have cost implications for the NHS and the wider economy, resulting in an increased use of health and social care resources, reduced economic activity and an increased dependency on state benefits. Please see Appendix 3 for UK population figures split by different time phases after cancer diagnosis, split by cancer type, where available. 33 323Level of need relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatment 2010 Total - 2,080,000 Total - 4,040,000 2030 220,000 370,000990,0002,680,000 570,0001,290,000Time year 1-5 years 5 yearsFigure 2 Number of people living with a cancer diagnosis by time since diagnosis in the UK Fatigue Fatigue related to cancer and its treatment can make even simple tasks feel exhausting. At its worst, fatigue can leave people bedridden. As many as 75% of people living with cancer feel fatigued at some point 102. In a national survey of people living with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 43% of those diagnosed up to five years previously reported always feeling tired 54. Although fatigue affects a large number of people after cancer treatment, there are simple interventions that can reduce its impact. For example, a recent in-depth review of 22 studies showed that aerobic exercise, such as walking or cycling, can significantly reduce fatigue 103. Other research has shown that cognitive behavioural therapy that involves increasing activity in a planned, incremental way can help fatigue104.'

Female, breast cancer, 5 years after diagnosis 19.Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 3Although the number of children and young people affected by cancer is much smaller than adults, childhood/ young people's cancer treatment is highly successful, such that a much greater proportion of patients will live into middle and old age. Hence, for the first time, health and social services have to support a growing population of older people who may have long- standing or late-onset consequences from their cancer treatment as a child or young person, such as cardiac effects, second primary cancers, bone health problems, metabolic syndrome and fertility issues. Estimates give the number of five-year survivors of child and young people's cancer rising from 21,000 in 2001 to 42,000 by 2021 1. When considering the long-term impact of consequences of cancer and its treatment on people's lives, clearly those with the greatest chances of living a long time with more serious risks and consequences are likely to require the greatest amount of health and social care over their lifetime. Children and young people automatically fall into the category of high chance of long survival (perhaps 60 to 70 life-years at stake) but are at high risk of serious consequences of treatment. Hence health service providers should consider how the needs of people living after child and young people's cancer treatment differ from those of people diagnosed much later in life, in whom only a few life-years might be at stake. iii. Difficulties in estimating the number of people living with and after cancer who also experience consequences of cancer and its treatmentObtaining the numbers of people affected by particular consequences (and how severely), or who are currently at risk of consequences, is very difficult. Whether people have consequences, and what their needs are, is not consistently recorded in patients' health records, and is not usually coded into hospital or GP IT systems, so information is almost impossible to retrieve and analyse with any confidence. Research on cancer treatments tends to focus on survival/ recurrence and not on the side effects. For the estimates of prevalence in this document, we have had to rely largely on published articles, and have also used studies commissioned for the NCSI and Macmillan Cancer Support. A number of innovative studies have aimed to quantify and describe the number of people living with the consequences of cancer and its treatment. Although these sources have helpfully increased the evidence of what a survivorship journey may look like, not all of them can be used as proof that morbidities after cancer treatment can be directly attributable to a specific cancer treatment. Examples include: The study by Elliott et al. 69, quoted below, shows the widespread incidence of problems after a cancer diagnosis, but presents no evidence about how these may be related to treatment. 35 34Level of need relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatment 3Figure 3 Proportion of older people (65 and over) living with a cancer diagnosis in the UK 1 in 8 older people (65+) in the UK population lived with a cancer diagnosis. 1 in 5 older people (65+) in the UK population will be living with a cancer diagnosis.2010 2030Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 3 3 Macmillan's Routes from Diagnosis programme70, which uses routinely collected data (Cancer Registry Data, Hospital Episode Statistics for inpatients), identifies clinical outcomes including recurrence, metastatic, second primary cancers and other health-related morbidities. The pilot study showed a high level of cardiovascular morbidity (requiring hospital admission) in people after a colorectal cancer diagnosis, but did not include an age-matched population, so it cannot be concluded that the cardiovascular problems were due to cancer treatment and therefore cannot attribute causal links. In future, the programme will include a control population, allowing comparison with the 'normal population' thus supporting conversations about whether any increased use of health resources is due to cancer and its treatment. In addition, it will address the level of health-resource use in non- inpatient settings such as outpatients, diagnostic tests and A&E. The Southampton CREW study (a prospective cohort study on the recovery of health and wellbeing following colorectal cancer) 71 which captures patient reported data before surgery and at regular points during and after treatment as well as medical data. CREW will help to inform healthcare providers about what helps or hinders rapid and effective recovery from cancer, who is most at risk of problems, and identify areas for the development of interventions to aid this process. Khan et al. 25 show that the risk of certain long-term conditions after cancer treatment is increased compared to an age-matched population but, again, without information on what treatments may have caused these increased risks. We also have to apply caution when looking at the results of cross-sectional surveys, i.e. questionnaires that are sent to a section of the population to get a snapshot of their views and experiences. Although these surveys can be very useful in obtaining information from people many years/decades after treatment, a well-known limitation of these surveys is that people with problems are more likely to respond than those without problems, and therefore the results may overestimate prevalence of problems. Prospective studies, such as observational studies, randomised controlled trials of cancer treatments and epidemiological cohort studies, should provide much more reliable data as they follow a defined group of people who have had known treatments. However, they often do so only for a relatively short time (approximately three years), and also suffer from high dropout rates, meaning that insufficient responses may prevent firm conclusions about consequences of cancer and its treatment at later time points 37. Given the expected significant rise in the population living with and beyond cancer, the epidemiology of the consequences of cancer and its treatment deserves much greater attention, and better research techniques than have been used historically 171. The research community should adopt new methods to assess the incidence and severity of consequences of cancer and its treatment in large groups of patients. If not, health professionals and managers will remain unable to plan effectively for the predicted increase in patient demand, and unable to provide newly diagnosed patients with realistic predictions of the risks associated with their treatment. Macmillan's Routes from Diagnosis is an approach that links and analyses routinely collected data and allows the cancer journey to be mapped from diagnosis to death, describing the health outcomes that patients experience. This is one step towards describing the survivorship journey at a population level. 37Level of need relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatment 36Sexual difficulties Cancer treatment can make it physically and psychologically difficult to have sex, or leave people with reduced confidence or a poor body image. Fifty-three percent of men and 24% of women who received radiotherapy to their pelvic area report issues with maintaining a sexual relationship, with the effects persisting up to at least 11 years after treatment. Fifty-eight percent of men diagnosed with prostate cancer up to five years previously are unable to have a full sex life as they are completely unable to get an erection, with a further 11% reporting difficulties with having or maintaining an erection. Depending on the issues involved, there are several ways people living with cancer and their partners can help themselves cope with sexual difficulties. This can include adjusting the way they approach sex, using medication or devices to combat vaginal dryness or erectile dysfunction, or taking simple steps to reduce the impact of bowel or urinary incontinence during sex. ' After I was diagnosed with womb cancer in 2011, I found it exceptionally difficult to get information on how the treatment might affect my future sexual relationships. I experienced a range of side effects from pelvic radiotherapy, including hot flushes and premature menopause, and for several months afterwards I wasn't able to have an orgasm. Before I was diagnosed I felt comfortable talking about sex, but having cancer changed that. It made me suddenly very protective of my sexual identity and of my body, and I found it a very isolating experience.'

Overall estimates of the number of people affected by consequences of cancer and its treatment Overall, the expert consensus view 72 is that at least 25% of the two million people living with and after cancer in the UK will have one or more physical or psychosocial consequences of their cancer or its treatment that affects their lives to a greater or lesser degree on a long-term basis. For adults living after child or young people's cancer treatment, this figure is higher: 60% are affected to some degree, of which 25% will have more severe long-term effects 73. Hence, at least 500,000 people in the UK today have had their lives affected long term following a diagnosis of cancer and receiving treatment. Several studies back up this figure: 53% of people surveyed 6 months after cancer treatment had 1 moderate or severe unmet needs 74. 25% of people (surveyed 2-15 years after cancer diagnosis) reported unmet needs for 'care coordination' and 21% for 'help to manage anxiety and recurrence concerns related to cancer'. In the same study, 8% of people reported severe 'late effects' of treatment, 12% moderate and 18% mild 75. People in Scotland diagnosed with cancer 6 or more years previously were surveyed 76 and 43% said that their health was very bad, bad or fair, compared with 23% of those who had not had cancer. In a review, 20-30% of survivors consistently reported problems associated with cancer and its treatment, including physical problems, poorer quality of life, psychological distress, sexual problems, problems with social relationships and financial concerns 16. Quality of life scores amongst breast, colorectal, prostate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivors who were surveyed 1-5 years from diagnosis were lower than those from the general population. 47% of patients reported fear of recurrence, while 20% reported moderate or severe difficulties with mobility or usual activities 18. In a survey in Northern Ireland, 41% of people living with and beyond cancer reported 'late effects' 77 with a significantly greater number of co-morbidities, lower physical and mental health scores, greater overall health service use and more unmet needs. 10-20% of people living with and beyond cancer with no other chronic condition may have serious ongoing poor health and disability, and for those with an additional chronic condition this figure may be as high as 25-30% 69. This study reported that people living with and beyond cancer were significantly more likely to report difficulties compared to healthy people (Table 1). This latter study 69 also concluded that the profiles of people living with and beyond cancer in their study were remarkably similar to individuals with chronic or long-term health conditions, but that there has been little progress in designing models of cancer follow-up care that might be better tailored to meet individuals' long-term needs related to the consequences of cancer and its treatment and a range of co-morbidities. These needs include support for psychological and social problems. There is clear evidence that this group of people are at increased risk of a variety of long-term conditions such as osteoporosis, heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism and dementia, as a consequence of their cancer treatment, which may contribute to premature death 25,73,78. 39 38Level of need relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatment 3Table 1 Proportion of survey participants who reported the health outcomes listed69 People living with and beyond cancer with no chronic conditionwith 1 chronic conditionThrowing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 3Cancer patients are also at higher risk of developing a second primary cancer, although not all of these will be as a consequence of treatment for their first primary cancer 79,80 e.g. if they have a history of smoking or an inherited genetic risk. For more details, see section 3e. 3b Sources of evidence on the prevalence of various consequences of cancer and its treatment Our estimates of the prevalence of different types of consequence of cancer and its treatment in the UK are based on three main data sources: Clinical trials of cancer treatments; Studies of routinely collected NHS and audit data; and Surveys of people with a cancer diagnosis, or history of cancer treatment. The type of data available from these sources is described in Appendix 3, and some of the difficulties in using the data are shown in Table 2. Although clinical trial data can be very compelling, there are several difficulties in extrapolating results in order to estimate prevalence in the population. Another method is to obtain and combine datasets already collected by the NHS or researchers - this has very significant potential, but is yet to be widely carried out or published. Macmillan is highly supportive of the Department of Health's recent approach to use PROMs population surveys, as these types of cross-sectional surveys offer rich qualitative and quantitative data from very large numbers of people, and will enable better understanding of the population as well as helping to prioritise service improvements. Cohort, longitudinal or observational studies are also very informative, as they have led to important findings such as the increased incidence of cancer and myocardial infarction after treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma 166, 167, and the incidence of androgen deficiency in young men after treatment for testicular cancer168. 41 40Level of need relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatment 3Mental health problems Mental health problems such as anxiety and depression are common conditions that can be triggered by difficult events, such as a cancer diagnosis or having treatment for cancer. Around a third of people diagnosed with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma five years previously experience anxiety or depression. More than one in eight of those diagnosed up to five years previously report moderate to extreme anxiety and depression 54. Some psychosocial consequences may be particularly severe, resulting in persistent mental health difficulties. People living with and beyond cancer are considered to be at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder due to the shock and trauma of being diagnosed with a life-threatening disease and receiving treatment that can be both physically and mentally gruelling 165. Some mental health problems associated with cancer and its treatment can be managed by the patient, but more severe problems may require professional help.' For me, it is the psychological and emotional effects of the cancer that has affected me the most.

Some assessment tools are not ideal50 - they are often too global to tackle the intricacies of specific consequences of cancer and its treatment. Reliable data on long-term effects are not often available81. Problems extrapolating clinical trial results to a general population. Great variation in how consequences of cancer and its treatment are defined, measured and recorded between different trials. Some long-term and late-onset (decades) effects are simply not yet known because the drugs and techniques are so new, and so are unlikely to be monitored for. Quality of life analysis may not take account of 'response shift' 82, in which patients may learn to cope with the problems and the symptoms they experience, and therefore adjust their own internal values and standards. Studies of routinely collected NHS data Have the potential to provide new insights into what care is provided for what problems after cancer treatment, the outcomes and the costs. It is worth testing methodologies now because future availability of data will improve, with national radiotherapy and chemotherapy datasets now online and collecting data 83,84.Existing published results currently do not provide sufficient detailed information on specific consequences, whether physical or psycholsocial. Data on the treatment mode and combinations of treatment given to patients are not readily available in national reporting aside from audits (e.g. Ref 150). NHS outpatient data are almost completely lacking in diagnostic and treatment information. Generally there is poor record keeping, data entry and coding of cancer treatment and consequences, or risk of consequences. Large-scale surveys are feasible and acceptable18. Results are strongly indicative of where significant problems exist for people living with and after cancer.Advantages Disadvantages Surveys of people with a cancer diagnosis, or history of cancer treatment Often limited to common cancer types, and hence cannot always be extrapolated to all cancers. May overlook issues that are specific to certain rarer cancers. Response rates vary by cancer group, deprivation category and age, which could result in selection bias when generalising results. Treatments may change over the 1 to 5-year period used to select study participants and it is therefore possible that results reflect these changes. A weakness of most longitudinal studies of life after cancer is that it is not possible to gain a baseline of health prior to cancer diagnosis. Evidence from the different types of data sources listed in Table 2 have been analysed (see Appendix 3 for details) to provide, where possible, estimates of the prevalence of a range of consequences. Owing to the difficulties in extrapolating results from clinical trials or using existing datasets, the prevalence estimates in this document have tended to be based on results from PROMs, using large-scale surveys where available, as it was felt that these give the most meaningful results in terms of the scope and scale of the problems that people are experiencing in everyday life, regardless of what cancer treatment they had and when it was given. Other key sources are published literature reviews. These results were then applied to data generated by Macmillan on the prevalence of people living more than one year after a cancer diagnosis 85. The consequences of cancer and its treatment prevalence estimates are grouped into three categories (as per Table 3): 1 Common consequences of cancer and its treatment (in essence, a breakdown of the estimated 500,000 with consequences) Physical consequences Psychosocial consequences 2 Rare or complex consequences of cancer and its treatment 3 Risks for long-term or late-onset conditions.Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 3 345 44Level of need relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatment Table 3 Grouping of consequences of cancer and its treatment for estimation of prevalence (Note that these categories are not mutually exclusive or exhaustive) Common Large numbers Section 3c affected - in total around Table 4A 500,000 and 4BCategory Impact Timing Physical and psychosocial effects ranging from mild to severe.

Note: There are many more consequences that are not included in this report, especially rarer ones, but which may have a profound impact on people's health and wellbeing, or place people at greater risk of problems later in life. Pain Pain can persist after the end of cancer treatment for many reasons. For example, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause nerve damage that leads to neuropathic pain106 while surgery or radiotherapy in the pelvic area can lead to parts of the bowel sticking together107. One in three (33%) people who have completed treatment intended to cure their cancer report some degree of pain 108. Around one in five of those diagnosed with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma up to five years previously report moderate to extreme pain or discomfort after completing treatment 54.' I'm thankful the surgery allowed me to live. I try to remember that when debilitating pain makes me want to die.' Male, prostate cancer, 5 years after diagnosis 3c Common consequences of cancer and its treatment Tables 4A and 4B show that there is a very broad range of consequences of cancer and its treatment, and that many hundreds of thousands of people are affected, often with multiple problems. In many cases, it is thought that there is a significant level of unmet need, as there is little evidence that health services are designed to meet these needs, and people experiencing these problems often report unmet needs 74,77. As described in Chapter 2, patient survey results and individual testimonies describe the gaps in information, support and treatment.Note: All figures in Tables 4A and 4B are indicative. For information on how these estimates were made, please see Appendix 3. Figures in this table must not be interpreted to mean that these groups of people all had their problems caused directly by cancer treatment. Some people may have pre-existing conditions, and will report them as problems post-cancer, and are therefore within the scope of our estimate of the number of people who have needs post-cancer.

These can include diarrhoea, frequency, urgency and sometimes incontinence.

Up to one in six (17%) of those who have had surgery for colorectal cancer several years previously may still need to wear a protective incontinence pad at all times 17. People experiencing these issues may be able to manage many of the symptoms themselves with the right support. For example, guided changes to diet and strengthening the muscles used for bowel control can reduce the severity of some gastrointestinal problems.' I was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2007, and had chemotherapy and radiotherapy. I felt like I had been burnt to a crisp inside and out and was in agony for months afterwards.

Further details in Appendix 3 Speech and swallowing problems Surgery and radiotherapy to the head and neck area may interfere with some of the actions or movements of the mouth, tongue or throat, making it more difficult to eat or drink. Any change to the lips, teeth, tongue or soft palate is likely to make speech sound different. It is estimated that 40 to 50% of head and neck and oesophago-gastric cancer patients will experience dysphagia, speech difficulties or other upper gastrointestinal problems 59,111. A recent cross-sectional survey of people who had been treated for head and neck cancer within the last five years identified that between 40 and 50% reported concerns/problems with swallowing, chewing/eating or dry mouth112. Rehabilitation for the functional, psychological, social and physical aspects of eating, drinking 113,114 and speaking is increasingly complex115, and it is important to ensure that good long-term nutritional status is maintained.'

Head and neck cancer patient, ScotlandThrowing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 3 33d Rare or complex consequences of cancer treatment It is very difficult to estimate prevalence for these consequences due to their rarity. Only radiation-induced brachial plexus (RIBP) nerve injury prevalence is known with reasonable accuracy owing to the Radiotherapy Action Group Exposure (RAGE) action group 9, comprising people who have lived for several decades with extensive and disabling unmet needs. Annual incidence of some consequences can be estimated, e.g. chronic graft versus host disease is estimated at least 250 cases per year 90,91. Owing to the seriousness of the types of consequences listed in Table 5, it is likely that these needs are being met, at least in part, as people will be very unwell and will almost certainly require hospital admission, possibly as an emergency. Although the number affected is small in comparison to those described in Tables 4A and B, these groups should be considered in local and national commissioning plans, owing to the risk of mortality and the high expense and complexity of interventions (e.g. complex surgery or bone marrow transplants requiring lengthy inpatient stays). The rarity of the conditions and the complexity of the interventions raise questions such as: Whether services should be concentrated in a small number of expert centres; Whether earlier detection of problems may reduce the complexity of interventions needed, or indeed whether prevention may be possible; and Whether data are being collected and compiled routinely about consequences of cancer and its treatment, allowing rare but serious conditions caused by new treatments 38 to be identified and, if possible, mitigated against or appropriately treated. Like many areas relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatment, these issues are very under-researched. The lessons from the RIBP/RAGE group of women are that, despite having an action group and a 'voice', it took decades for the establishment to acknowledge the multiple needs of this group of people and address them through specialist commissioning (in England - the BRIRS 92,93). This service offers a model for how people with rare but severe consequences of treatment can be helped through specialist centres with multidisciplinary expertise. 53 52Level of need relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatment Table 5 Examples of rare or complex consequences of cancer and its treatment Radiation-induced brachial plexus (RIBP) nerve injuries Treatments/services that may manage/alleviate symptoms: Breast Radiation Injury Rehabilitation Service (BRIRS).

As with other, more immediate, consequences of treatment, the level of risk depends on a wide range of factors including type of cancer, type of treatment, lifestyle and any co-morbidities. The most serious long-term risk is the development of a second primary cancer, which is uncommon 94,95 but many patients live with the knowledge that they are at increased risk of this (alongside the fear of recurrence of the original cancer). Other conditions such as endocrine disorders, osteoporosis and heart disease are also associated with risk of premature mortality.Many of the following examples are common conditions in the general population and therefore it is not possible to say with certainty that any one person's long-term condition was caused by their cancer treatment. Nevertheless, there is clear evidence (Table 6) that cancer treatment increases the risk of developing these conditions, and therefore suitable monitoring or preventative measures are required 88, e.g. identifying a prior risk of osteoporosis by bone mineral density scanning for men living with and beyond prostate cancer25. In addition, it is vital to empower patients with information to help them make good lifestyle choices, including increasing physical activity, stopping smoking, sensible dietary/alcohol advice and the value of any dietary supplements 44,45. 55 54Level of need relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatment Lymphoedema Lymphoedema can develop when lymph nodes or vessels are removed, damaged or blocked. This leads to a build-up of fluid in the affected area. Radiotherapy to the lymph nodes can cause scar tissue that also blocks the flow 109. The condition is chronic, which means it cannot be cured but can be managed. As well as causing physical and psychosocial difficulties, lymphoedema can also increase the risk of infections in the affected area. There are several ways patients can help treat lymphoedema themselves, including using compression garments and techniques to relieve the swelling, such as simple lymphatic drainage. The NHS saves an estimated \u00a3100 in reduced hospital admissions for every \u00a31 spent on lymphoedema treatments that limit swelling and prevent damage and infection 110.' Being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001 completely changed my life. After the surgery, I had chemotherapy and then radiotherapy. I had a lot of unpleasant side effects at the time, such as anaemia, hair loss, severe fatigue, depression and lymphoedema. The lymphoedema has led to restricted movement in one of my arms, which causes me physical difficulties. It's hard to find clothes that fit and it's difficult to exercise. I also have problems raising the arm, which then hinders many day-to-day activities. The doctors say it may never go away and I will just have to learn to live with it for the rest of my life.' Asma, 50, Middlesex Table 6 Risks of developing long-term conditions after cancer treatment Young people after radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma were 5 times more likely to develop oestrogen (ER) - and progesterone (PR)-positive breast cancer and 9 times more likely to develop ER- and PR-negative breast cancer 96.

For further details and references see Appendix 3.* The hazard ratio is an expression of the hazard or chance of events occurring in the 'with cancer' group as a ratio of the hazard of the events occurring in the 'no cancer' group. For example, a hazard ratio of 2.49 for osteoporosis after prostate cancer means, in the quoted study, prostate patients were 2.49 times more likely to develop osteoporosis than men who have never had prostate cancer. The odds ratio represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared with the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure. In order to plan and deliver service provision cost effectively, commissioners and providers must better understand the needs and demands of people living with and beyond cancer, as this population is growing and ageing. It is estimated that around 500,000 people living with and beyond cancer have one or more physical or psychosocial consequences of their cancer or its treatment that affects their lives on a long-term basis. The prevalence of consequences of cancer and its treatment in the UK provides an indicator of the level of need for interventions, such as support for self-management and specialist clinical services. Examples include: Gastrointestinal problems: 90,000 people Urinary problems: 150,000 people Sexual difficulties: 350,000 people Mental health problems: 240,000 people Chronic fatigue: 350,000 people Lymphoedema: up to 63,000 people Rare and complex complications, e.g. chronic graft versus host disease, myleodysplastic syndrome, fistulae: probably a few hundred new cases of each per year People living with and beyond cancer are likely to be at increased risk of second primary cancer and other common long-term conditions. These risks are particularly high amongst people living after child and young people's cancer treatment. There is clear evidence of unmet need, which will increasingly impact on primary and secondary care unless action is taken.Cha PTer 3 summaryThrowing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 4 59 5844a The case for change \u2014 addressing the barriers to improving outcomes Chapter 3 outlined the clinical case for change - proof of a significant prevalence of consequences of cancer and its treatment, and a level of unmet need that could affect around 500,000 people, preventing them from living as healthy and active a life as possible. Many of these people could be helped with simple interventions and support for self-management, but a significant minority will need more complex support and treatment. The immediate question is: how much will it cost to provide these interventions, and will they save any money elsewhere in the system? The lack of robust economic evidence that addressing the consequences of cancer and its treatment is worthwhile is one of the most significant barriers to change in the current financial and commissioning climate. Again, a low level of research (in this case into understanding the drivers of costs of caring for people after their cancer treatment has ended) is severely hampering efforts to improve outcomes for people living with and beyond cancer. Chapter 4 looks at the current economic evidence, and examines some of the other barriers to change, some of which could be tackled at little or no cost to the NHS.4b Economic evidence i. Costs of consequences of cancer and its treatment Chapter 4 of the 2013 NCSI report 1 describes how failing to meet the needs of people living with and beyond cancer has very significant cost implications for the NHS and wider economy. It is estimated that cancer cost the English economy over \u00a318 billion in 2008, with nearly \u00a35.5 billion of this sum related to lost productivity from people living with and beyond cancer 64. Cancer diagnosis and treatment are expensive, but what is much less well understood is the high healthcare and personal costs incurred after people have completed treatment. Many long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment affect people's (including carers') ability to work and take part in normal activities. This not only contributes significantly to the cost burden on health services and other state support such as benefits and social services, but also causes a reduction in tax revenue. Therefore the health economics of the consequences of cancer and its treatment should play a major part in the rationale for change. Improving outcomes for people affected by the consequences of cancer and its treatmentThrowing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 4 4What is equally important to consider is the cost burden to the person affected by cancer, their family and friends. For example, people may have a reduced income due to an inability to work or a reduction in hours, need to purchase continence products or new clothing owing to swollen limbs, or pay for private healthcare or complementary therapies because they cannot find the help they need in the NHS. These financial pressures often have a knock- on effect on mental health by placing continuing strain on people who may have run up debts during their treatment - the latest research shows that 83% of cancer patients who have recently had treatment are on average \u00a3570 per month worse off 116. ii. Potential areas for more cost-effective use of resourcesThe NCSI has shown how outpatient capacity can be released by changing from traditional 'one size fits all' post-treatment follow-up services, to stratified pathways of care, allowing resources to be reinvested in survivorship services 169. Alongside savings from fewer low-cost/high-volume cancer follow-up consultations with professionals by providing better support for self-management, there is also the potential to reduce the costs of high-cost/low-volume episodes such as complex consequences of treatment that require intensive hospital care (including complex surgery) and lengthy rehabilitation. Figure 4 details some of the findings of the Macmillan Routes from Diagnosis study, which describes the inpatient activity of colorectal cancer patients within North Trent between 2006 and 2008 117. Across eight different patient groupings ('pathways'), the 'survivorship' costs varied from \u00a31,000 (those surviving less than a year after diagnosis) to \u00a315,000 (those surviving one to five years after diagnosis with non-cancer complications, i.e. morbidities such as cardiovascular disease or intestinal issues and not including additional primary, metastatic cancer or a recurrence) per person according to the nature of the person's needs. This insight offers the opportunity to explore whether there are ways to manage cancer treatment that avoid potential complications for each group and thus the subsequent healthcare costs. For example: Those with non-cancer complications may benefit from increased primary care involvement, Those with cancer complications (i.e. additional primary, metastatic cancer or a recurrence) may benefit from better cancer care team support, and Those with no complications (i.e. no morbidities or cancer complications identified through the study) may benefit from being on a stratified care pathway that does not involve routine hospital follow- up appointments, but instead has support for self-management with rapid re-access to professionals when needed. 61 60Improving outcomes for people affected by the consequences of cancer and its treatment Figure 4 Costs associated with different survivorship pathways Spend per Patient in Treatment and Survivorship Phases by Survivorship Outcome Pathway (\u00a3k) Note: To obtain spend per patient, HRG 4.0 codes were costed using the 2010/11 National Tariff; costs are inpatient only, excluding locally agreed costs (such as chemotherapy), and priced at the spell, rather than episode, level (in line with how hospitals receive funding from their PCT).

We know from this analysis that pre-diagnosis these individuals have a high percentage of unplanned admissions mainly due to non-cancer related problems, so these individuals may already be debilitated by bowel problems and poor general health. We also know 2-3 years after diagnosis and then major surgery, intense chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, this group experience a high frequency of unplanned admissions for non-cancer related issues. Treatment for these non- cancer problems may involve lengthy hospital stays and additional costs for rehabilitation, counselling and support. 50% of the Pathway 4 group die of an non-cancer related cause, compared to an average of 6% amongst the other pathways. It may be possible to prevent or reduce such non-cancer morbidities with earlier intervention, but this is unproven. Management of complex cases such as these requires a high degree of team work between different cancer and non-cancer specialty teams and between secondary and tertiary care, and therefore protocols that streamline referral, decision-making and treatment are likely to improve efficiency and outcomes. People with long-term mild/moderate problems as a consequence of cancer or its treatment who do not need major interventions often struggle on, but are known to visit health professionals much more frequently than non-cancer patients 69,75. They may also be at risk of their condition deteriorating to the point of requiring inpatient care. There is potential for this use of resources to be reduced if: Professionals and patients have the knowledge that post-treatment symptoms and difficulties may be a result of the cancer treatment and that effective interventions exist (facilitating the recovery of health and wellbeing through self-management, including restoration of self-confidence and confidence to self-manage cancer-related problems 11, and/or earlier referral to specialists in consequences of cancer and its treatment); and Patients at risk of future problems are educated to avoid risk factors (e.g. avoid skin damage to limbs if at risk of lymphoedema) and are encouraged to adopt a healthier lifestyle (e.g. increased physical activity, stop smoking), and therefore can prevent problems occurring in the first place, thus reducing the demand on health and social care. Patient engagement in healthcare via self-management is widely recognised as crucial to improved outcomes for people with long-term chronic conditions, although cost-effectiveness evidence in relation to cancer has been scarce 118. The hypothesis that self-management as part of stratified cancer follow-up pathways will result in greater efficiency has yet to be fully proven, but NHS Improvement test sites are already achieving reductions in oncology follow-up outpatient attendances, number of hospital readmissions and use of bed days 119. 62 63 SupportingselfmanagementSupportingselfmanagem entAssessment and care planning Treatmen t Summar y and er Care ReviewHealth and wellbein g event SupportingselfmanagementRecove A study in Manchester120 suggests that once inpatient, outpatient and emergency costs are considered, it should be possible to unlock savings of \u00a31,000 per patient through a stratified approach to follow up, pathway efficiency and better management of co-morbidities. Please see the NCSI report 1 for more information. A review121 of evidence on self- management for prostate patients post-treatment found that \"it is a viable and appropriate way of providing healthcare solutions to ameliorate men's functional and emotional problems\" but that \"economic viability will be difficult to assess since cost comparison with current provision is not straightforward\". The NCSI has concluded that as a minimum there should be a Recovery Package of interventions (Figure 5), which could play a significant role in moving patients into greater self-efficacy and help to reduce the impact of consequences of cancer and its treatment 1. Through the Recovery Package, it is intended that people will be helped to minimise any effects of the consequences of cancer and its treatment on their life: Holistic Needs Assessment and Care Plan: to be carried out at or near diagnosis, and at the end of treatment, and any other time needs change, using a standardised assessment tool, resulting in a written Care Plan outlining the actions to be taken to address identified needs. Treatment Summary: from the hospital team using a structured format, to be shared with the patient and their GP. Cancer Care Review: to be carried out by the patient's GP practice three months post-diagnosis, which includes discussion of potential long-term effects of their cancer and treatment. Health and Wellbeing Clinic: to help prepare the person and their carers for supported self-management. It will include what signs and symptoms they need to look out for, what resources are available to help them, what to do if they are worried, and will include advice on healthy lifestyles, including physical activity, and work and financial issues.Copyright \u00a9 Macmillan Cancer Support 2013.

Specialist multidisciplinary teams are also needed to support people living with complex long-term consequences of child and young people's cancer treatment, many of whom are lost to follow up and at risk of serious health problems if not helped. The cost of such specialist services has yet to be fully calculated, but as they will be largely outpatient based and usually do not involve high-cost drugs or therapies, it is very likely that they will cost much less per QALY gained than the \u00a320-30,000 threshold. 4c Addressing the barriers to change i. The main barriers to change and possible solutionsThis section outlines some of the main barriers that exist to patients receiving optimal care for long-terms problems after cancer and its treatment, around: The healthcare system (4c ii), Healthcare and research professionals (4c iii), and People affected by cancer (4c iv). Some solutions are suggested in this section in order to stimulate further debate and action on strategies for which there is good evidence and that can be easily and inexpensively implemented now, and strategies that need further research or resources. Although some consequences are widely understood to be caused by cancer treatment and may already have dedicated local services, other consequences are still at a low level of awareness and have poor provision 127,128. It is therefore acknowledged that health service staff and researchers are largely still at the early stages of developing and testing potential solutions 129 including what could be achieved through supported self-management19, and how the stratification of cancer follow up and devolvement of care to primary/ community teams could be designed to ensure that long-term problems and risks are properly recognised and minimised. ii. Barriers and some potential solutions for the healthcare system Often, the biggest barriers to improvements in healthcare are around the way that NHS services are funded, incentivised, provided and monitored, which can often seem to create too many time-consuming hurdles for professionals and service managers who are keen to make improvements. National or local targets for cancer care improvement have focused on major issues such as early diagnosis, enhanced recovery from surgery, waiting times for diagnosis and treatment, provision of more and better radiotherapy, and unscheduled care for cancer patients. As a result, there has not been much space as yet to consider survivorship as a whole, although as of March 2013, commissioners and providers in England are now expected to follow the guidance in the 2013 NCSI document 1, including implementation of the Recovery Package (Figure 5). There is growing recognition of the value of redesigning cancer follow up, and it is expected that stratified follow-up pathways will roll out across the NHS in the next few years 119,169, thus freeing up valuable resources that can be better targeted at people with the highest need, including those with long-term problems after treatment. This system redesign in the coming years offers considerable opportunity for addressing the needs of people relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatment (Figure 6), as long as it is done in a whole-system patient- centred way.iii. Additional costs of addressing unmet needs relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatment It is clear that new costs will be incurred if unmet needs relating to the consequences of cancer and its treatment are to be met. Currently, owing to the lack of a detailed understanding of the level of need or what interventions and services are most appropriate for which consequences, it is not possible to forecast what level of funding might be needed. However, when compared to health economic analyses of the cost-benefit of new treatments to reduce mortality and improve quality of life, the costs of services for the consequences of cancer and its treatment are likely to be very modest and well within accepted limits (i.e. cost effective at less than \u00a320-30,000 per Quality of Life Year (QALY) gained 122). As described earlier, simple and inexpensive interventions for many problems are available, including the provision of information and supporting people to self-manage and to take preventative measures. The costs of implementing these are likely to be largely around 'pump priming' in terms of short-term project costs and staff training. Recurring costs will be minimal. Voluntary sector involvement is also possible. The costs of implementing the Recovery Package will depend on local implementation - reductions in cancer follow-up (through stratified pathways and remote surveillance) can support the development of the Recovery Package. Patients' wellbeing will be greater and their demand for services lower if they get the support that is relevant to their particular needs, and which promotes healthy lifestyles and independence. Local management of most mild/ moderate consequences of cancer and its treatment is possible and effective (e.g. 103,123,124,125,126) but referral pathways do not always exist from cancer care teams to local services, such as for lymphoedema, fatigue, pain management, counselling, or cancer-related sexual dysfunction, urinary problems and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Establishing these pathways will probably result in a small increase in referrals to secondary care, but it is likely that costs are already being incurred in terms of other consultations with GPs and secondary care that result in unnecessary investigations or ineffective treatments (due to the lack of awareness of local services or of the best clinical practice for consequences of cancer and its treatment). The small proportion of people who experience serious consequences of cancer and its treatment need specialist health service care and treatment. Like the BRIRS (Chapter 3), regional centres for other complex consequences of treatment are needed in order to provide equitable access to high-quality care and treatment from multidisciplinary expert teams. These centres can also help to fill the gaps in research and education on the consequences of cancer and its treatment. Currently, there is only one dedicated multidisciplinary service in the UK for gastrointestinal 64Costs of services for the consequences of cancer and its treatment are likely to be very modest and well within accepted limits i.e. cost effective at less than \u00a320-30,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained. 65Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 4 467 66Improving outcomes for people affected by the consequences of cancer and its treatment Figure 6 Example of greater use of local support services by redesigning cancer follow up119 Greater use has been made of local support services as a result of the redesign of breast cancer follow up at the NHS Improvement stratified pathway test sites. Breast cancer teams referred more patients to services for: Lymphoedema Physiotherapy Menopause clinics Psychological support services Level 3 and 4 Complementary therapies Support groups ' The most surprising and pleasing thing about this project was discovering what facilities already exist in the community and that by working with providers we could greatly enhance our service simply by being aware of them and using them appropriately.' Healthcare professional Table 7 Barriers to improvement related to the healthcare system, and suggested solutions for health commissioners and providers The relevant decision-making bodies should ensure that quality standards and measures are updated to include evidence-based best practice for the management of consequences of cancer and its treatment, e.g. NHS England Service Specifications, NICE cancer guidelines, Map of Medicine, Cancer IOG Peer Review standards and any other relevant cancer care quality standards such as for gastrointestinal problems 59, lymphoedema130 and vaginal problems131.Barriers relating to the Suggested solutions healthcare system National guidance National guidance and quality standards generally do not include management of consequences of cancer and its treatment as part of the cancer care pathway Assess level of need for services (at local and national level) and address inequalities in provision.

Barriers and possible solutions for healthcare and research professionals There is a wide range of issues that prevent health and social care professionals from improving outcomes for patients with long-term unmet needs. Underlying these is the fact that cancer care is a complex and rapidly changing field of medicine. It is a challenge for professionals outside the cancer care team to keep up to date with these regimes and what effects they may have on patients in the long term. Some may not even realise that a problem has been caused by cancer treatment. Even for cancer professionals, correctly diagnosing consequences of cancer treatment can be complex and challenging, and there can be confusion with symptoms of recurrent cancer or of other chronic illnesses/co-morbidities. Cancer professionals cannot be prepared for every eventuality because patients have simply not yet lived long enough after being given the newest treatments for researchers to be able to pin point all problematic consequences. Research on improving outcomes for the consequences of established (or discontinued) treatment regimes is also limited, because it is hard to engage current clinicians with problems that might be seen as 'old news'. Hence, although survivorship issues have come a long way up the agenda of health professionals, there remains a lot to do. Table 8 lists some barriers to change and possible solutions for healthcare professionals. 71 70Improving outcomes for people affected by the consequences of cancer and its treatment Table 8 Barriers to improvement related to health and social care/research professionals, and suggested solutions Whole team/pathway system redesign that releases professionals' time from routine follow up.Barriers relating to health and Suggested solutions social care/research professionals Time Multiple competing priorities for professionals' time Read/attend conference presentations, study days, journal articles etc. Improve primary care awareness by secondary care providing clear post-treatment letters to primary care and patients that include READ coding for cancer treatment (e.g. using the NCSI Treatment Summary template 132).Awareness Health and social care professionals, especially those outside of cancer care teams, lack awareness of the problems that consequences of cancer and its treatment can causeProfessional associations and educational institutes develop information and educational resources (e.g. clinical guidance, clinical tools, e-learning, textbooks; see Appendix 4) to (a) improve correct diagnosis and management of consequences, and (b) improve ability of cancer care teams to prepare people for possible consequences with self-management strategies. Professional associations develop and promote competency frameworks and professional curricula for continuing professional development, which includes skills for assessing the information and support needs of patients, and improving level 2 skills in psychological assessment and support 133.

Education of community pharmacists.Barriers relating to health and Suggested solutions social care/research professionals Formal education There is little formal education on offer for screening, identification and clinical management of consequences of cancer and its treatment or on how to support people to self-manage physical or psychosocial problems Adopt recognised assessment tools (e.g. Holistic Needs Assessment) and develop Care Plans134. Use the Treatment Summary process to identify possible consequences. Use other structured questions when discussing post-treatment issues with patients.Offer and support practical experience opportunities in managing consequences of cancer and its treatments.Confidence and ownershipSome professionals express lack of ownership and/or lack of confidence in identifying and managing the consequences of cancer and its treatment Establish consequences of cancer and its treatment as a medical/academic field in its own right.

Research into the mechanisms of consequences of cancer and its treatment, their prevalence and trajectory, and ways to prevent, minimise and manage them. Increase publication of articles about consequences. Improve the identification and ongoing measurement of consequences, including PROMs. More detailed PROMS/assessments designed for specific aspects of morbidity (e.g. bowel, urinary, sexual) are needed to give accurate data on the scope and severity of impact. National survivorship surveys.Monitor groups of patients for increased risk of late- onset consequences, including through the long-term follow up of patients in clinical trials, observational studies, prospective longitudinal cohort studies and better recording through national datasets of which patients have received which treatments. Where a risk is identified, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to responding and informing patients and consistent approaches should be developed for monitoring and surveillance. Barriers relating to health and Suggested solutions social care/research professionals Research and scientific knowledgeThere is limited research into ways to predict, avoid, minimise and treat consequences of cancer and its treatment See also Appendix 4.iv. Barriers and possible solutions relating to people affected by cancer Reference has already been made to the importance of empowering people undergoing treatment and their families so that they are prepared for the possible physical and psychosocial consequences of cancer and its treatment. There needs to be much better understanding of the difficulties that people encounter, and what self-management, coping strategies and other solutions there could be. Table 9 provides some suggestions. Addressing barriers to self-efficacy could result in a significant improvement in how soon people are able to return to living as normal a life as possible after a cancer diagnosis, and how much they might need health and social care services in future. 73Table 9 Barriers to improvement related to people affected by cancer, and suggested solutions Offer people information and education (repeated at several time points) about which consequences of cancer and its treatment might arise and why (taking into account language barriers, cognitive difficulties or learning difficulties etc) with advice on coping strategies. Help patients to better understand risks, how to self- manage and how to get back into the cancer care system or into post-treatment services. Provide advice on work-related and financial issues early in diagnosis/treatment phase (as well as later on). Ensure patients' family and friends are aware of potential problems - as appropriate/desired. Effective transition to adult services of people living after child or young people's cancer treatments.Barriers relating to people Suggested solutions affected by cancer Knowledge Patients and carers lack knowledge about their condition or level of risk, and are not prepared for the physical, psychosocial or financial impact of cancer and its treatmentThrowing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 4 475 74Improving outcomes for people affected by the consequences of cancer and its treatment Reassurance to patient of healthcare team contact details and availability including who to contact out-of-hours.

Signpost patient to support services, charities, groups, online communities including those dedicated to cultural, ethnic or religious groups. Public campaign that something can be done. Give patient information that these are normal feelings or symptoms and should be discussed. Barriers relating to people Suggested solutions affected by cancer Reluctance to raise problems with a professional e.g. due to embarrass - ment, feelings of isolation, cultural taboos, not wanting further invasive treatment, or feeling that nothing can or will be doneReluctance in talking to health professionals or with family or friends; reluctance to attend healthcare appointments for fear of personal accidents or not wanting to be seen in public Open access 'patient-triggered' follow up (i.e. patient able to contact cancer team as soon as problems arise). Primary care team understand risk of consequences via the Treatment Summary.Delay in raising problems with a professional (including signs of recurrence)Waiting until annual cancer follow-up appointment to mention the problem Reduction in severity of consequences through healthier lifestyle choices on diet, smoking, weight, physical activity, alcohol. Prevention of commonly associated chronic illnesses through healthier lifestyle choices as above.Lifestyle factorsRange of barriers to making healthy lifestyle choices See also Appendix 4. There is an economic rationale for changing how consequences of cancer and its treatment are identified and managed. There are simple and effective changes that can be implemented at little or no cost, such as: Better patient information about consequences of cancer and its treatment and who to go to for help, including use of the Treatment Summary as the keystone to communication with the patient and primary care. Advice on healthier lifestyle choices. Use of structured questions to identify people with problems. Increasing professionals' awareness through education events and publication of guidance. Co-ordinated pathways from cancer care teams to existing local specialists in managing consequences of cancer and its treatment. The key principles of service redesign are: Prevent or minimise consequences where possible, through healthier lifestyle choices, better surveillance, improved imaging, minimally invasive surgery, targeted radiotherapy and the use of modern drugs. Inform patients of potential consequences of cancer and its treatments, with simple strategies for self-management, and the value in taking early action and how to seek appropriate help. Identify patients at potential risk, summarising the interventions received in a Treatment Summary that codes potential consequences so that they can be easily anticipated, recognised and monitored in primary care. Assess potential consequences through regular Holistic Needs Assessment, the use of 'power' questions and PROM tools at regular time points. Support patients through local care pathways for consequences of cancer and its treatment, which include support for self-management and referral to appropriate specialist services. More education and research is needed in order to improve knowledge and to establish the consequences of cancer and its treatment as a healthcare/academic field in its own right. For example, in developing tools to predict the consequences of cancer and its treatment, identifying biomarkers, and using risk stratification of patients to guide further management.Cha PTer 4 summaryThrowing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 5 5 77 76The majority of people affected will be in older age, but in terms of life-years at risk, people treated as children and young people also represent a population with significant needs. Health commissioners and providers need a 'case for change' which not only shows the many benefits for people affected by cancer and the financial benefits to the system, but also that changes are achievable. This report complements the 2013 Department of Health report 'Living With and Beyond Cancer: Taking Action to Improve Outcomes' (2013) by providing a more in-depth description of the scale and scope of long-term problems affecting people as a result of cancer treatment. It is intended to assist health service professionals, managers and commissioners to develop and take forward plans to deliver cost-effective service provision that improves outcomes for this population, which is growing and ageing and whose needs are currently poorly met. There is a clear rationale for change in terms of addressing unmet need, improving patient outcomes and reducing the impact on the economy and health services. It is estimated that around 500,000 people living with and beyond cancer have one or more physical or psychosocial consequences of their cancer or its treatment that affects the quality of their lives on a long-term basis. The prevalence of consequences of cancer and its treatment provides an indicator of the level of need for interventions, such as support for self-management and specialist clinical services. Our estimates include: Gastrointestinal problems: 90,000 people affected Urinary problems: 150,000 people Sexual difficulties: 350,000 people Mental health problems: 240,000 people Chronic fatigue: 350,000 people Lymphoedema: up to 63,000 people Rare and complex complications, e.g. chronic graft versus host disease, myleodysplastic syndrome, fistulae: probably a few hundred new cases of each per year. (For further detail, see Appendix 3.) People living with and beyond cancer are also likely to be at increased risk of second primary cancers, and long-term conditions including osteoporosis and cardiovascular problems.Conclusions and recommendations Faced with a growing population of people living with and beyond cancer, due to increasing numbers of diagnoses and better survival rates, the commissioners and public health teams who are tasked with assessing the needs of the population must take account of the long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment. Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment 5 5In recent years, a range of evidence has become available on what actions can be taken to improve outcomes. Some examples of what can be achieved at little or no cost at a local level include: Provision of good quality patient information that supports self-management, including healthier lifestyle choices. Education for professionals on symptoms of consequences of cancer and its treatment and the risk of long-term conditions. Better identification of patients with problems through the use of structured questions to overcome embarrassment. Co-ordinated pathways from cancer care teams to existing local specialists in managing the consequences of cancer and its treatment. (For further information, see Chapter 4 and Appendix 4.) National specialist commissioning needs to address the inequitable and low level of provision of specialist services for rare, severe, complex problems, for which multidisciplinary teams can deliver expert holistic physical and psychosocial care. If health commissioners and providers ignore the evidence, they will be unable to plan effectively for the inevitable rise in demand from people living with and beyond cancer, especially from older people with co-morbidities, whose needs for health and social care will only increase or result in premature death if the consequences of their cancer treatment are poorly managed. This report is also intended to stimulate debate about available intelligence on the consequences of cancer and its treatment and on patients' experiences of living long term after a cancer diagnosis. Challenges and questions about this report are welcomed (survivorship@macmillan.org.uk). In preparing it, many limitations were found with the available data and it is emphasised that the estimates of prevalence of consequences of cancer and its treatment (Chapter 3) are indicative only. If intelligence is to improve, then data collection and analysis need a step change. Better information on acute and long- term outcomes and experiences will help professionals to provide better personalised and targeted care for their patients. It will also allow commissioners and cancer service managers to measure how well a local health system is helping people to live as healthy and active a life as possible after a cancer diagnosis. Macmillan and the National Cancer Intelligence Network are starting to tackle this through the Cancer Population Evidence Programme 3, which includes studies such as Routes from Diagnosis70, which is now being extended. Macmillan is calling on NHS England to ensure that their pilot cancer survivorship survey is rolled out at a national level, and to work with Macmillan to develop a process for using the results as a driver for service improvement. In conclusion, the consequences of cancer and its treatment remain a significantly under-recognised aspect of cancer care, with hundreds of thousands of people having long-term unmet needs that affect their health and quality of life, and that of their carers, and which have a serious impact on health and social care, and on the economy.

Artificial urinary sphincter A device that is fitted to treat male urinary incontinence by preventing involuntary opening of the urethra. Biofeedback A treatment method that allows patients to monitor body functions that are usually automatic, so that they can learn to control the functions voluntarily (e.g. blood pressure and body temperature). Biological therapy Unlike chemotherapy, biological therapies do not directly damage the DNA of cancer cells. Biological agents can act to modify the immune system or to reprogram abnormal cellular pathways and so eliminate cancer cells by more indirect routes than with traditional forms of chemotherapy. Biomarkers or Biological marker A substance used as an indicator of a biological process. For example, an antibody can be a biomarker of infection. In genetics a biomarker is a specific DNA sequence known to relate to the susceptibility of a certain disease. Biomarkers can also be introduced into the body to examine organ function, or used to measure the therapeutic response to a treatment. Bisphosphonates A type of drug that prevents the loss of bone mass and is used to treat osteoporosis. Bone marrow transplant A surgical procedure that substitutes damaged or diseased bone marrow with a healthy replacement.

Case study of problems after pelvic cancer treatment (with thanks to the Gastrointestinal and Nutrition team, Royal Marsden Hospital, London) This case is typical of those seen by the team and involves multiple problems after pelvic cancer treatment. Bowel urgency and faecal leakage are the most troublesome and common symptoms in patients who have undergone pelvic radiotherapy or colorectal surgery. These symptoms often occur in conjunction with urinary and sexual problems and often have a severe impact on quality of life. Financial implications of faecal leakage or incontinence as well as the psychological and emotional impact of being incontinent in public, or the fear of being incontinent, can be enormous. Fiona (not her real name), aged 38, was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She had radical surgery, then 18 months later she experienced pelvic and para-aortic lymph node relapse and small bowel obstruction. She underwent further surgery during which 35cm of the terminal ileum was resected, and was given chemotherapy and pelvic and para-aortic lymph node irradiation.Symptoms on referra l Bowel frequency: per day Stool consistency: type 1-7 Bristol Stool Chart (i.e. ranging from liquid to very hard) Daily urgency of defaecation Faecal leakage weekly Nocturnal defaecation 3 times per week Severe abdominal pain daily Frequent painful bloating Steatorrhoea 2 times per week Urinary frequency and leakage Sexual problems Fatigue Financial concerns Social isolation and low mood Differential diagnoses for Fiona's symptoms included: Development of small bowel bacterial overgrowth Bile acid malabsorption Pancreatic insufficiency Underlying gastrointestinal disease previous cancer or radiotherapy (i.e. coeliac disease, new-onset inflammatory bowel disease) Excess fibre intake (dietary assessment) Recurrent pelvic malignancy Damaged anal sphincters from previous childbirthThrowing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment93 92Test results (as per the Marsden bowel algorithm and published guidance for managing gastrointestinal symptoms after radiotherapy) (See Appendix 4): Raised CRP low (157pg/ml) (See Appendix 4) Glucose/hydrogen methane breath test: positive for methane and hydrogen after 40 minutes Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal aspirate and biopsies - positive for Escherichia coli and Streptococcus bacteria, both sensitive to ciprofloxacin, biopsies did not show inflammation, dysplasia or malignancy SeHCAT scan (selenium homocholic acid taurine - a clinical test to diagnose bile acid malabsorption - 7-day retention of 3.2% indicating severe bile acid malabsorption Flexible sigmoidoscopy - biopsies did not show any organic cause for symptoms i.e. no cancer or non-malignant GI disease Physical examination and anorectal physiology - weak sphincter muscle tone and anterior sphincter trauma Endoanal ultrasound and anorectal manometry - anterior internal sphincter trauma confirmed but not requiring surgical intervention CT scan abdomen and pelvis - no recurrent cancer, no gall bladder disease 7-day food diary - fibre intake 15g per day, fat intake 80g per day Trial of lactose-free diet - no benefit Multidisciplinary aspects of Fiona's management: Course of ciprofloxacin to treat small intestine bacterial overgrowth Management of bile acid malabsorption with colesevelam 2 tablets TDS and referral to a registered dietitian (see below) Annual check of vitamin B12 and CRP levels in addition to serum fat-soluble vitamin levels and trace elements Pelvic floor and toileting exercises Introduction of gentle exercise as symptoms improve Dietetic assessment and advice included: Obtaining a weight, height, BMI and percentage weight loss Analysis of 7-day dietary food diary or diet history (to facilitate the calculation of the patient's dietary fat intake and to assess pattern of eating and dietary adequacy) Review of vitamin and mineral levels (e.g. vitamin A, D, E, B12, folate, zinc, selenium) to identify any potential deficiencies A diet that provided 20% of her energy intake from fat was discussed i.e. 45g of dietary fat per day based on an intake of 2,000 calories per day Supportive literature given and explained, including discussing meal plans, reading food labels and eating out Forceval and Calcichew D3 were commenced subsequently to colesevelam to enable a staged approach.

Case study of problems in adulthood after childhood cancer treatment Ellie (not her real name) was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) at the age of 6 years. She had a high blast count and was treated according to the clinical trial protocol UKALLX. She was treated with daunorubicin (an anthracycline) at 180 mg/m2 and received cranial radiotherapy (18 Gy). Subsequently, she had two bone marrow relapses (disease recurrence) and received further chemotherapy (including anthracyclines) and total body radiation. This was followed by an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. At follow up as a young adult Ellie has many treatment-related complex chronic diseases as listed below, involving many specialities that may not be all on one site or provide continuity of care from consultants with full knowledge of cancer-treatment-related diseases.

Evidence on the prevalence of the main consequences of cancer and its treatment for the more common cancers were sought, and applied to estimates of the size of the population who are living with and after cancer. 2. Given the level of prevalence and unmet need, evidence and opinion on how improvements to patient outcomes could be achieved was sought. The chief sources of evidence on prevalence were gathered by the University of Dundee and Macmillan Cancer Support from a variety of sources including research articles, publications, conference proceedings, publically available statistics, focus groups, personal communication from people affected by cancer and from experts, plus Macmillan-funded research and evaluation studies. Wherever possible, UK-based studies were used.If this document had tried to cover all relevant sources and all consequences of all cancer treatments, the result would have been far too long and detailed to be of value to the intended audience. It is therefore not an exhaustive systematic review that follows strict scientific community rules governing such types of review. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of the evidence precluded meta-analysis. Hence, the quality of the evidence has not been formally assessed according to standard criteria 136 but used broad quality criteria and review by experts to ensure that the information presented in this document is largely representative and unbiased. Limitations and assumptions The number of people living with different consequences of cancer and its treatments cannot be directly measured at this time due to limitations in the availability and granularity of data. As such our estimates are indicative only and here we explain key limitations and assumptions used to generate these estimates. As more information becomes available we will refine our figures. A number of factors have led to difficulties in presenting the consequences of cancer and its treatment prevalence statistics in a coherent way that is relevant to how the care of patients living with and after cancer in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland is currently organised. These factors include: Consequences of cancer and its treatment are not routinely collected and reported in health records or linked between primary, secondary or community care making it difficult to report the level and extent and the impact on people lives. In particular the lack of routinely available data means that we cannot identify the proportion of people with multiple compared to single consequences. Academic articles about consequences of frequently differ in their perspective (such as whether they are from the perspective of the tumour type, the treatment type or the type of consequence of treatment). Therefore it is very difficult to find studies that have looked at similar cohorts of patients at similar time points after similar treatments. Definitions/diagnostic criteria for consequences of cancer and its treatments are variable 137. Modern cancer treatment, often involving combinations of treatments, is continually evolving. Therefore the pattern of consequences of will also change over time. Thus it is uncertain whether the results from any research study on consequences can be extrapolated to the current population who are living with and beyond cancer. Some articles deal specifically with novel treatments for cancer and these techniques may never be adopted into routine clinical use, therefore the results have to be treated with particular caution. There is a lack of comparison of problems experienced by patients who are living with and beyond cancer with problems experienced by patients without a cancer diagnosis. In a patient who is living with and beyond cancer, it would be unreasonable to attribute every health problem to their cancer or its treatment. However, studies that include control groups (i.e. patients without a diagnosis of cancer) are difficult to find. It is possible that studies systematically underestimate the potential risk of consequences of treatment. If survival rates improve as a result of a change in treatment, then there may be an increase in the number of people living with and beyond cancer who have consequences. Often, relatively small series of patients are studied in order to obtain estimates of the likelihood of rare events. Most cancer treatment schedules have been calibrated so that only a small proportion of patients might suffer severe consequences and so the estimates of event rates are unlikely to be reliable. Data from clinical trials will tend to report consequences that affect those people who have had treatment, but consequences such as pain, fatigue and psychosocial problems will affect people living with and beyond cancer who are not receiving treatment. Data are not yet easily available (from the UK's national repositories of cancer data) that would give the full picture of how many people have each kind of cancer treatment (or no treatment) for each cancer type in the UK each year. This makes it very difficult to assess with any accuracy what the potential impact of the consequences of each kind of treatment (or no treatment) might be on the population. Long term follow up of people living with cancer in many studies is limited to 5 years and very few studies follow up beyond 10 years after diagnosis. There are a number of factors that may have caused under- or overestimation of the prevalence of consequences of cancer and its treatment in this report. 95 94Appendix 3: Methodology notes Methodology notes and data tables for the prevalence of consequences of treatment Appendix 3: Methodology notesThrowing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment97 96Factors that may cause underestimation: The number of people living with and beyond cancer has increased by 3% per year since 2010, which is the latest data for the cancer population estimates. Percentage prevalence figures were applied only to certain main cancer types Percentage prevalence figures may only relate to one form of treatment e.g. radiotherapy, thus excluding those with consequences after other treatments such as surgery or chemotherapy. Issues relating to outcome measures in cancer treatment clinical trials: Patient-reported outcome tools and clinician-rated outcome tools may not ask about all potential consequences. Clinician-rated outcome tools tend to group outcomes into grades of toxicity, and then judge only 'high' severity as representing toxicity, thus potentially ignoring lower-grade toxicity that still might cause significant reduction in quality of life for the patient. Factors that may cause overestimation: Response bias in surveys \u2014 those people with health problems being more likely to respond. Calculations were based on an assumption that all people with a cancer diagnosis will receive treatment (whether curative or palliative) and that this occurs within a year of diagnosis. Calculations were based on an assumption that consequences only affect those from one year or more after diagnosis but evidence beyond 10 years after diagnosis in particular is limited.Our estimates broadly assume that consequences are uniformly applied to the population living with cancer and have not been refined to take into account different outcomes for different demographic groups, cancer types or treatment types and combinations as this level of detail are not available uniformly in the evidence. We acknowledge that different groups in the population will experience different outcomes. Where we know consequences are only applicable to certain cancer types or treatments and have data which can help us distinguish these groups we have adjusted the estimates accordingly. Calculations were based on an assumption that consequences experienced at one year (or one to five years) after diagnosis will stay at the same prevalence however long ago the treatment was. There is good evidence that many chronic physical consequences of treatment do not improve over time unless treated. However, some consequences such as fear of recurrence or hot flushes may reduce over time. Where evidence suggests consequences diminish over time we have restricted the population affected accordingly, for example to the one to five years after diagnosis population group. Where evidence is only available for a subset of the population such as certain localities (region or nation) we assume that the observed prevalence persists across the UK. Where evidence is only available for certain cancer types we assume these consequences apply to all cancer types only where we have further evidence that consequences are likely to be an issue for people with any cancer type. This is partly because we know more about the potential long-term consequences of certain cancers and treatments than others.Appendix 3: Methodology notes Section 2 Cancer prevalence Table 11 UK cancer population figures split by time period after cancer diagnosis and cancer type, at the end of 2010 (Excludes non-melanoma skin cancer) Cancer type Total UK 0-1 year after >1 year after 1-5 years prevalence figures do not add exactly due to rounding. * The figures were used as the basis for consequences of cancer and its treatment calculations. Therefore people with side effects during treatment or within 6 months of completing treatment are excluded in the consequences of cancer and its treatment prevalence calculations, as these side effects would normally (in the majority of people) be expected to resolve by 1 year since diagnosis. Any side effects lasting more than 1 year from diagnosis are assumed to be chronic, i.e. long lasting, although it is recognised that some will resolve over a longer period of time. However, the evidence does not support significant resolution over a longer timescale for some of the most debilitating consequences of cancer and its treatment, such as bowel, urinary and sexual problems and serious mental health issues. The number of people living with 'Other' cancers has been further disaggregated to allow estimation for consequences which affect only certain cancer types. For example we have estimated the total number of people living with other pelvic cancers using the best currently available data of known 20-year prevalence in England and 1-year prevalence for the UK for 22 cancer types at the end of 2006 and applying these figures to the UK total for 'Other' cancers. Estimated cancer population figures are given in the table below. Further work to refine these estimates is underway. Reference: 138 above; National Cancer Intelligence Network.

Based on estimates for the proportion of patients receiving RT (bladder 8%, cervical 53%, uterine 23%), this results in upper estimate totals of bladder ~3,000, cervical ~11,000 and uterine ~3,000 people affected = 17,000, rounded down to 15,000 .May exclude urinary effects of people treated with surgery \u00b1 chemotherapy. For example, people having bladder surgery (e.g. creation of a neobladder) are likely to have urinary side effects, but are not included here. Evidence suggests that after RT, urinary effects increase over time. The percentage of patients receiving RT is likely to have increased from 2006. Assume that the percentage receiving RT (USA data) is the same in the UK. Other gynaecological cancers and testicular cancer are not included.Urinary incontinence, with an occurrence rate of more than 50%, represents the most common side effect after surgery and RT for Stage I endometrial carcinoma. Depending on the type of RT, a stress incontinence rate of 24.4% and an urge incontinence rate of 29.2% is possible 144.Chronic changes to urinary function Total = 150,000 (continued) Source: Department of Health PROMS survey 2012 54.

Post-EBRT 60-70% ED. Post-brachytherapy 5-51% ED. For colorectal cancer, in a recent comparison, 86% of survivors of rectal tumours had sexual dysfunction compared with 39% of colon cancer survivors. For breast and gynaecological cancers, approximately one half of women who have been treated for breast and gynaecological cancers experience long-term sexual dysfunction 145. 23.8% of women and 53.3% of men after pelvic RT reported sexual relationships affected 1-11 years after RT 55.Sexual difficulties Total = 350,000 Glaser et al. 201318.Throwing light on the consequences of cancer and its treatment103 102Appendix 3: Methodology notes Sources used for Assumptions/ Other sources for Evidence that the the calculation limitations comparison problem affects quality of life (examples)Sources used for Assumptions/ Other sources for Evidence that the the calculation limitations comparison problem affects quality of life examples) Source: Andreyev et al. 201259.

Estimate for men based on conservative assumption that symptoms only affect men 1-5 years post-diagnosis. 70% experiencing hot flushes is a consensus view from the literature and clinical experts.The prevalence of symptoms among the postmenopausal women was as follows: hot flashes, 65%; night vaginal dryness, 26%; difficulty sleeping, 44%; and feeling depressed, 44% 147. Retrospective and cross-sectional studies have shown that the incidence of hot flashes in men subjected to castration is about 75%.

Cancer-related lymphoedema accounts for 25% of these figures. For UK population of 63.2 million, cancer-related lymphoedema prevalence therefore ranges from 25% ~21,000 to 25% of 3.99 x 63,200 = ~63,000Lymphoedema is a permanent condition and cannot be cured.In a breast cancer study, 8% of the women had diagnosed lymphoedema and 37% had arm symptoms without diagnosed lymphoedema 153.

Fear of recurrence: 42.5% of of all cancer patients living 1-5 years after diagnosis = ~240,000 .

Owing to the decline in fear of recurrence and fear of dying by 5 years after diagnosis in the Department of Health PROMS survey, we are assuming that the percentage applies to the 1-5 year population only, although we do know that fear of recurrence and fear of dying will persist after 5 years but we do not have data to verify if the prevalence is maintained beyond 5 years.The majority of cancer survivors reported low to moderate levels of fear of cancer recurrence, and considered it to be one of the top five greatest concerns and the most frequently endorsed needs. More precisely, across different cancer sites, 39-97% of cancer survivors reported some degree of fear of recurrence, 22-87% reported moderate to high degree and 0-15% reported high levels 137.Fear of recurrence Total = 240,000 Fear of dying Total = 125,000 Simard et al. 2013137.
