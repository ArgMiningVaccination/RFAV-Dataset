Josh Griffin, Distric t 8 Wildlife Biologist (now IDN R Private Lands Supervisor South Region) and Chad Stewart, Indiana Deer Research Biologist, have been a steady and sturdy presence, helping the Tas k Force develop recommendations that work for deer, people and our shared environment. While the State has exclusi ve jurisdiction over deer management, Josh and Chad have w orked hard to listen to the con cerns of the Task Force and the community to help us deve lop recommendations that suit the unique needs of Bloomington and Monroe County. And while they never complained about our interminable meetings or endless questions, no doubt Aldo Leopo ld's observation that \"The real problem of wildlife managem ent is not how we should handle the animals...the real problem is one of human manageme nt\" rings true. We are very th ankful for Josh and Chad's technical advice. Thanks is due to Dr. Angie Shelto n of the IU Research and Teaching Preserve whose research on deer exclosures in Griffy Woods provides some of th e best data we have about deer in our community. A member of the City's Environmental Re sources Advisory Committee, Dr. Shelton has presented her findings to the Task F orce and to the public and has participated in a number of Task Force meetings. Thanks to her for all she does to study and protect one of the community's most treasured natural spaces. A very big thank you to City of Bloomington GIS Manager, Laura Haley, who worked to map deervehicle collisions and who developed a program specificall y for the Task Force to map the geography of survey responses. Thanks too to GIS expert Chu ck Winkle for greenspace, development aerials and other mapping. Thanks is due to the urban farmers who have given us advice. Finally, thanks to the community. Ours is a community that pays attention and takes seriously our collective responsi bility to wildlife and each ot her. Thank you to all the people who have, over the last t wo years, made the effort to e mail, call, attend a meeting, participate in outreach sessions and/or complete the survey. Yo ur feedback has been critical to our work. Thanks for caring. ii EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Not that long ago, one could tak e a hike in local woods and nev er see a deer. As scarce as deer were in the forest, they were virtually nonexistent in ne ighborhoods. Today, things are different. Not only are deer abundant in local woods, but deer are ever more common in many neighborhoods. The increased presence of deer i n the woods and in residential areas is the direct result of human action. We have fragmented wildlife habitat, sprawled ourselves across the landscape, provided deer with ideal \"edge\" environment and elim inated virtually all deer predators. As a result, deer are abundant. In some areas, and to some residents, deer are overabundant. Deer are not to blame for this situation we are. As humans have created the issue, how do we most responsibly address it? When it comes to managing community deer, there is no simple fix. The issue is complex and contentious. Deer are sentient beings who hav e significant reproductive capacity and whose numbers can grow quickly within a very small area. Humans are sentient beings who also have the capacity to overwhelm the landscape and who tend to have very strong, sometimes discordant, opinions about deer. Addressing concerns about deer requires humans to collectively ask hard questions that are ecological, cultural a nd moral in nature. The Joint City of BloomingtonMon roe County Deer Task Force is a citizen group created by local government in response to petitions signed by over 500 residents calling for city and county government to \"do somethi ng\" about deer. It was also a response to concerns expressed by ecologists and conc erned residents about deer dama ge in Griffy Woods. The primary charge of this group is to provide local decision m akers with guidance on how to deal with deer concerns in a c ommunity where sentiment is di vided, concerns are localized and public dollars scarce. Since September 2010, the Task Force has met to explore deer management approaches, educate and reach out to the community, assess community sentiment, review the science and consult with expert s. In its work, the Task Force was faced with two very different, but related, concerns: deer damage at Griffy Woods and deer in Bloomington neighborhoods. When it comes to deer at Griffy Woods, clear evidence points to ecosystem damage by deer - native tree seedlings are not regenerating; herbaceous plant species are severely com promised and possibly going locally extinct; invasive species are taking over some ar eas; the forest understory is unnaturally open; and understoryreliant birds and other animals are losing habitat. When it comes to deer in neighbor hoods, the analysis is not as clear cut. State biologists advise that Bloomington's urban deer are not starving and are n ot close to reaching biological carrying capacity - t he number of deer the suburban environment could support. Instead, biologists direct that deer abundance in neighborhoods is best indicated by \"social carrying capacity,\" defined as the level of deerrelated interf erences in human activities that residents find acceptable. The feedback received by the T ask Force via emails, surveys and community outreach meetings, points out that many - but certainly not all - iii residents have reached their car rying capacity for deer. Much o f the resident concern with deer abundance is localized to t he southeastern quadrant of the City. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) advises that neighborhoo ds should not be sanitized of deer simply because deer are an inconvenience to h umans, nor should residents endure unreasonable property damage. Instead, there m ust be a careful balance among and between the needs of p eople, deer, other organisms an d our shared environment. The following recommendations are intended to foster a better b alance. All recommendations were filtered through the lenses of humaneness, safety, cost and efficacy. These recommendations are integrated strategies and are intende d to work in concert - each management strategy has its purpose and the Task Force rec ommends that the best deer management program is one in which all the proposed recomm endations work together. However, we acknowled ge that the administrative and political reality of the issue likely means that deer management strategies will proceed in a stepwise fashion. SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Griffy Woods The work of scientists at the IU Research and Teaching Preserve indicates that the deer population at the Griffy Woods is far higher than comparable fo rests in the region - as much as 13 times greater. Griffy 's deer density appears to be detrimental to forest biodiversity and may be restructuring the overall forest commun ity. Deer browsing at Griffy is compromising the survival of many herbaceous species and severely hampering the regeneration of many native tree seedlings. Tree seedlings represent the next generation of forest canopy tree s. Browsing also encourages the establishment of invasive species. Excessive deer browsing p oses the possibility of produ cing an \"alternate stable state\" a condition in which a forest would never return to it s natural state, even if browsing pressure were diminished by a permanent reduction of d eer densities. Because of the clear evidence of environmental damage, we recommend the fo llowing: Sharpshooting for immediate, substantial and humane reduction. After consulting with ecologists, researchers and biologists fr om both the State and federal government, the Task Force recommends that deer should be managed through a local governmentfinanced sharpshootin g effort. To restore the ecological integrity of Griffy, a substantial number of deer need to be culled soon to avoid irre versible ecological damage. Sharpshooting is the most effici ent way to cull the greatest nu mber of deer in the most humane way possible. All deer cu lled in this effort should be donated to the local food bank. This effort is both an environmental and social service good. Should sharpshooting not be feasi ble due to cost or other consi derations, the Task Force recommends that a managed hunt is the secondbest way to reduce the deer herd at Griffy. Whether reduced via sharpshootin g or managed hunting, any deer effort at Griffy will require maintenance. It will be u p to local government to decide whether to maintain the herd through sharpshooting, managed hunting or other means. iv 2. Neighborhood Deer Neighborhood deer are different. Unlike their rural counterparts, urban and suburban deer have small home ranges, high survival rates and significant reproductive potential. Absent limiting factors, a suburban deer herd can double every three t o four years within a relatively small geographic area. A typical suburban deer lives an average of 812 years. Long before an urban deer herd reaches biological carrying capacity, residents often reach their social carrying capacity f or deer. The feedback received by the Task Force indicates that many residents have reached this point. Instead of waiting for the deer herd to grow to a level at whic h virtually all residents perceive deer to be problematic a nd to a level at which deer be gin to suffer from disease, starvation and more vehicle collisions, we should take preventive measures. The Task Force recommends that responsible measures be implemented now t o limit herd growth and to limit the need to apply mo re widespread and costly deer management measures in the future. For deer in urban and suburban environments, the Task Force rec ommends the following: Prohibit the Feeding of Deer Many residents feed deer with the best intentions; however, fee ding is not in the best interest of deer nor in the interest of neighborly relations. I mproper diets provided during feeding can create health proble ms for deer and can increase th e rate and spread of disease. While a citywide feeding ban is necessary, alone it is not suf ficient. Deer commonly browse on plants not intended as \"deer food\" and any ban on intentiona l feeding does little to deter deer from many neighborhoods. Raise Fence Height Limits At present, city residents are a llowed to construct fences up t o eight feet in height in backyards and up to four feet in front yards and on corner lots . Biologists advise that an eight foot fence will exclude most deer, but a ten foot fence w ill exclude just about all deer. As most, but not all urban garden s are located in backyards, th e Task Force recommends that fence height limits be raise d to ten feet in backyards and be restored to the pre2007 allowance of eight feet in front yards. Deer and Development We might also mitigate deer damage through land use practices. For example, when a developer proposes to build a ne w project, the project is subje ct to layers of review to ensure the project's environmental soundness. While features s uch as karst, stormwater, tree cover and erosion are part of the analysis, wildlife is no t. It should be. Much development fragments wildlife h abitat and proliferates \"edge\" environments. Deer thrive on the edge. By filtering a development proposal through the ad ded lenses of wildlife displacement and habitat fragmen tation, we have the opportunity to try to prevent deer human conflicts before they occur. Similarly, we should consider the ways in which corridors might be used to bette r direct movement of deer aroun d or through a community rather than dispersing deer throughout. v Urban Deer Zone \u00ad\u00ad City of Bloomington and Monroe County land immediately surrounding the City The State of Indiana created Urb an Deer Zones (UDZs) in respons e to growing concerns of Indiana residents living in urba n and suburban areas. The inten t of a UDZ is to reduce the size of urban deer herds to bette r mirror the social carrying c apacity of the community by extending the hunting season, increasing the bag limit and requ iring that hunters take an antlerless deer before taking an antlered deer. By focusing pr imarily on female deer, this \"EarnaBuck\" requirement is an effective management tool to control and reduce deer numbers. UDZ status does not per mit hunting where hunting is otherwise prohibited. IDNR has advised that the area appropriate for a local UDZ may include the City of Bloomington plus Monroe County land immediately surrounding Blo omington. IDNR will not approve UDZ designation for the county only, absent inclusi on of the city. The Task Force recommends that local officials seek UDZ designation for the city and applicable areas of the county, but that an y hunting within city limits be strictly regulated and limited to five contiguous acres of gree nspace. The boundaries of the UDZ would be defined by roads, geographic indicators and other easilyidentified marker s. The following describes how a UDZ would work in the coun ty and how it would work in the city. Monroe County Both bowandarrow and firearm hunting are allowed in Monroe Co unty, outside the City of Bloomington's corpora te boundaries. Most county lan d is decidedly more rural than land within the city and hunting has been practiced for many years. To strengthen bow hunting efforts in the county, the Task Force re commends that local officials seek UDZ status for a ppropriate areas of Monroe Count y. IDNR has advised that the whole of Monroe County is not suitable for UDZ designa tion as much of the county is stateowned land or otherwise rural; however, if pair ed with UDZ designation for the city, IDNR m ay approve a request for UDZ st atus for the concentric area of Monroe County land surrounding the corporate boundaries of Bloomington. Such designation of county land could lower deer dens ities and potentially prevent immigration o f deer into more urban areas. City of Bloomington At present, it is illegal to dis charge a firearm within city li mits, but there is no prohibition on the discharge of a bow and arrow on private property. Therefore, city residents may currently bow hunt on private property witho ut further city regulation, provided these residents obtain a hunting license a nd follow all State requirements. Some residents ar e already hunting, or allowing hunting, on their properties. We anticipate that even more may do so as they bec ome frustrated with deer. The absence of rules governing bow and arrow discharge is most likely a historical artifact, rather than an intenti onal silence. While a number o f communities successfully implement urban deer hunts in areas of human habitation, in some areas of Bloomington, it's just not suitable. First, many of t he neighborhoods vi experiencing the greatest concern with deer abundance are dense ly settled and keeping hunting at an adequate distance from occupied structure s, from roadways, sidewalks, trails and other public ways, makes hunting in neigh borhoods problematic. Secondly, in dense, core neighborhoods, lots are small and yards back up to yards. Hunting in this sor t of environment would almost guarantee that the practice would be very visible and that a deer shot in one yard may expire in another, causing tension among n eighbors. Hunting in these urb an situations raises more problems than it solves, an d, as some have observed, is ju st not in the spirit of Bloomington's community character. However, hunting is an ageold, costeffective way to reduce and maintain deer herds at sustainable levels. Therefore, the Task Force recommends that the option of hunting in denselysettled nei ghborhoods should be taken off the table, and the practice limited to five or more contiguous acres of greenspace where rigorous hunter proficiency and safety gu idelines would be required. In this context, greenspace is operationalized using the City of Bloomington Env ironmental Commission's definition: a permeable surface (forested, shrub/grass covered areas, parks, golf courses, cemeteries and agricultural land) more tha n ten feet from any humanmade development such as r oads, parking lots and building s. Localized Management for Pocket Deer Allow for Trap and Kill Management Using Automatic Notification and Stress Level Monitoring Deer tucked away in many neighbo rhoods have ample food, water a nd cover, and little reason to migrate out of residen tial areas. Any hunting allowa nce on five or more acres of greenspace will not address most of the pocket deer living in B loomington neighborhoods. On the advice of State and federal biologists, neither hunting nor sharpshooting is suitable for neighborhoods experiencing t he greatest deer pressure. Inst ead, the safest form of lethal management is a trap and kill effort. The Task Force specifically reco mmends a form of trap and kill that employs an automatic notification system whereby biologists are notified as soon as a deer is trapped. Automatic notification is intended to minimize the amount of time a deer is trapped, thereby reducing stress to the deer. Deer are able to endure shortterm stress a nd urban deer are acclimated to the presence of the fences and less likely to perceive the t rap as anomalous. Deer would be baited for a few weeks leadin g up to the implementation of t he project. Acclimated to both the cage and the food sourc e, deer are less likely to perc eive the closing of the trap as an \"event\" and less likely to be stressed by closure. Death wou ld be administered via gunshot. To ensure that deer stress and suffering are minimized , biologists conducting the project would be measuring corti sol (stress) levels of deer throughout the process. If biologists determine that cortisol levels are rising as the pro ject is conducted, the project would stop. This technique requi res an adequate earthen backstop, and not all properties will be suitable for the effort vii Deer do not recognize humancrea ted boundaries, such as propert y lines. Meaningful and effective deer management must occur on a larger scale. Therefo re, IDNR will not approve this technique as an effort by, and on behalf of, an individual property owner with a small parcel. Instead, request for th is management technique must derive from a larger management unit, such as a large landowner, a homeowners' assoc iation, a neighborhood association, a business park or government. Because not everyo ne experiences deer to be problematic, the cost of this effort should be borne by residents perceiving deer to be a problem. Neighbors could pool funds. Sharpshooting in appropriate greenspaces Another way to realize a quick r eduction in the deer herd proxi mate to neighborhoods is to conduct a sharpshooting effort o n greenspaces near neighborhoods to prevent immigration into neighborhoods. Sites are to be determined by the entity re questing the permit in association with the agency perf orming the sharpshooting. Shar pshooting requires a permit from the IDNR. The Task F orce recommends that authorizat ion for sharpshooting should also require permission f rom the City. Again, the IDNR will not approve this technique as an effort by, and o n behalf of, an individual prop erty owner with a small parcel. Instead, request for th is management technique must derive from a larger management unit, such as a large landowner, a homeowners' assoc iation, a neighborhood association, a business park or government. Cost is to be born e by residents perceiving deer to be a problem. 3. Measurement and Monitoring There is still much the community has to learn about deer. By r esolution, the Task Force will sunset once it submits its recommendations to State and local government. However, deer are here to stay, and the \" deer issue\" is not going away a nytime soon. We offer a number of suggestions for monitoring the deer herd and for admi nistering any deer management strategies local gover nment wishes to adopt. Recomme ndations for monitoring include, but are not limited to: establishment of a Deer Management Team, tracking deervehicle collisions regularly and in a way that accounts for traffic volume; establishing a deer complaint system; engaging citizen scientis ts to help participate in regular \"edeer\" counts similar to the way bird watchers register their sightings; conducting pellet counts and m onitoring urban vegetation. 4. Education While the Task Force has reached out to the community to inform them of issues of deer feeding, fawns, driving tips, deer behavior and other topics, t he public should continually be informed about these issues. Additionally, any deer manageme nt plans implemented by local government will require clear communication with and to t he public. For these reasons, the Task Force provides a proposed outreach and commun ication plan. 5. Role of Citizens It's not just up to government to solve issues of local deer concern. Citizens have a part to play too. There are many measures residents can take to mitiga te deer damage and neighbor conflict. We can stop i ntentionally feeding deer; it h arms deer more than it helps viii them. We can make an effort to pl ant more deerresistant plants . Toward that end, the Task Force has worked with the IDNR to develop a custom list of largely native plants that resist deer browsing . We can fence our gardens and u se repellants. We can be especi ally cautious when driving during rut and at dawn and dusk, when deer are on the move. We can all take steps to learn more about deer nature and work to better understand which concerns are imagined (such as unprovoked aggression) and which are real. Both humans and deer are components of a larger biotic system w hose health depends on balance. By fragmenting the landscape and disrupting trophic levels, humans have upset this balance. The recommendatio ns offered by the Task Force are informed by science, public opinion and deer welfare and are motivated by an intent to effect better stewardship of a landscape that includes deer , people, plants and other ele ments of our sha red life. This report recommends that lethal me ans be introduced where predation has long been absent in an effort to restore ecosystem balance at Griffy Woods, to better manage conflict with deer in neighborhoods, and to prevent the deer herd from growin g. Our community has a strong commitm ent to nurturing environmenta l integrity, fostering humane relationships with all animals and cultivating the commo n good. It is also a community where residents actively work to reimagine and rede fine their relationship with nature. The \"deer issue\" giv es us an opportunity to respon sibly redefine this relationship further. As the community conversation about how to best live with deer evolves, let's approach this disc ussion as we approach many oth er issues of community concern - with reason and with compassion for each other and th e natural world of which we are a part. INTRODUCTION Civilization is a state of mutual and interdependent cooperation between human animals, other animals, plants and soils, which may be disrupted at any moment by the failure of any one of them. \u00ad\u00ad Aldo Leopold, 1933 Humans and deer are elements of a bigger system. This is an interconnected and interdependent system that includes plants, soils, water and ot her animals. It's a complex system whose health depends on balance. While it is hardly a novel observation to point out that humans have upset this balance, when it comes the \"deer issue,\" it is important to keep in mind that deer overabundance - both real and perceived - is the direct result of human action. Humans have eliminated most natural predators such as mountain lions and wolves. We h ave sprawled ourselves across the landscape and transfor med it into a crazy quilt of f ields, wood lots, gardens and lawns. We've enticed deer into our neighborhoods by providing fertilized lawns and by intentionally feeding deer. Whe re deer were once scarce, they are now abundant. In some areas, and to some residents, deer are overabundant. Deer overabundance is experienced differently in different cont exts. In neighborhoods, overabundance sometimes translat es into lost garden food, damage to trees, damage to landscaping and increased deera uto collisions. In natural, for ested areas, overabundance translates into degraded and compromised ecosystems. An overabundance of deer is not good for deer, humans or the en vironment. Left unchecked, a deer herd can doubl e every three years. As the num ber of deer grows, the health of the landscape declines and deer eventually suffer fro m increased stress and illness. As the number of deer grows, human tolerance decreases and frustrated residents may take matters into their own h ands, implementing methods tha t may be neither legal nor humane. Deer, other animals (including h umans) and forest ecosystems ar e the unfortunate victims of our attempt to tame nature. S ince we've upset the balance, how do we most humanely, safely and effectively restore it ? There are no easy answers to this question. The issue of deer management is both complex and contentious, and there is n o onetime, onesizefits all simple fix. 1 In its work, the Deer Task Force was faced with developing reco mmendations to address two very different concerns: dee r damage at Griffy Woods and complaints about deer in Bloomington neighborhoods. Assessi ng the influence of deer at Griffy Woods was a relatively straightforward process. Clear scientific evidence indicates that deer are damaging the forest ecosystem: native tree seedlings are not r egenerating; herbaceous plant species are severely compr omised and may be going locally extinct; invasive plant species are taking over; the forest understory is unnaturally o pen; and understoryreliant birds and other animals are losing habitat. Assessing the deer situation in Bloomington neighborhoods was a nother matter. Urban deer have plenty of food and cover in neighborhoods. They are acclimated to human presence and are comfortable with the human built environment, routinely navigating sidewalks, traffic and backyard fences. Bloomington deer are no t starving, nor have they reached biological carrying capacity. Instead, concern with dee r in Bloomington neighborhoods is almost entirely social. Not all residents perc eive deer to be overabundant, and concerns about deer tend to be concentrated in certain areas of the city. The challenge for the Task Force was to develop recommendations that were sen sitive to different, oftentimes localized, social carrying capacities for deer. With these very different concerns in mind - one ecological and one social - the Task Force offers this advisory report. This report is issued by a group o f volunteers who have done their best to examine the science, work with the experts and li sten to their fellow community members. It is not the only way to approach deer in o ur community, although we did work hard to come up with suggestions that we think are responsible, responsive, humane and in the best interest of deer. No doubt this report will not pl ease everyone - some will think it goes too far and others will think that it does not go fa r enough. It represents just o ne juncture in a continuing community discussion about how deer and humans can best live to gether. This report is advisory in nature: it will be u p to elected officials in coope ration with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources to decide which recommendations to implement. Just as the voices of residents have been solicited and encouraged during the Task Force process, so too will public input be a vita l part of the more formal pol icymaking process. Ours is a community that cares d eeply about animals, our shared environment and each other. As our community conversation about deer evolves, resid ents must be willing to work together toward solutions to the twin problems of deer overabundance and people getting angry at each other about it. As the \"deer issue\" is no t going away anytime soon, let's approach deer management with the hallmark traits that ma ke our community great - creativity, kindness and respect toward humans and other animal s. 2 ABOUT THE DEER TASK FORCE The Joint City of BloomingtonMon roe County Deer Task Force was established by the Bloomington City Council and th e Monroe County Commissioners in 2010. The group was formed in response to concerns expressed by members of the Bloo mington Environmental Advisory Committee about deer dam age at Griffy Woods and in res ponse to a petition signed by over 500 residents ca lling upon the City and County t o establish a task force to address concerns about deer in ne ighborhoods. The charge of the Joint Task Force is to explore ways to address social a nd environmental concerns about deer, to engage in public outreach, to solicit community feedback and to issue advisory r ecommendations. The Task Force will sunset once it submits its recommendations. Since September 2010, the Task Fo rce has met almost monthly to consult with experts, review management options, devel op a communication plan, solicit and analyze public feedback and work through possible approaches. Throughout this process, the Task Force worked closely with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) to learn about deer and to examine various management options. In addition, th e Task Force has sought advice from ecologists, anthropologists and biologists from IU, Purdue and the United States Department of Agriculture. We've toured \"deer problem\" neighborhoods, mapped the geography of resident concerns, worked with scientists from the IU Research and Teaching Preserve to learn more about deer at Griffy Woods and consulted with other communities that have dealt with urban deer concerns. The Task Force has also worked t o learn more about the public's concern with deer. All meetings of the Task Force have been open to the public to atte nd, observe and comment. We hosted a series of five commu nity outreach meeting in 2011, set up booths at the Farmers' Market and issued a pub lic opinion survey to which ove r 700 community members responded. We establish ed a website and an email addr ess and developed an extensive set of \"FrequentlyAsked Questions.\" The Task Force has issued tips for living with deer and developed a custom list of largely native deerre sistant plants. The Task Force has also reached out to the public through media . The group issued media pieces to educate residents abou t deer behavior, offer tips for driving during the rut, urge residents not to feed deer, explain the effects of deer herbivo ry on the Griffy ecosystem, and offer periodic updates on th e work of the group. Members of the Task Force were featured on WFIU's Noon Edition and have been interviewed by the Herald\u00adTimes. The Task Force is a citizenbase d, volunteer group composed of 11 people from diverse backgrounds. Members were appointed based on their interest in the issue, their expertise and their ability to work with people of differing perspectives . The Task Force includes a City Council member, a County Co mmissioner, the Director of the City's Animal Care and Control, a retired editor and avid gardener, a wildlife rehabil itator, an ecologist and IU professor, the CEO of a local an imal welfare organization, a hu nter and competitive archer, a conservation biologist who stu died bearhuman conflicts in Ja pan and an anthropologist who studied deerhuman conflicts in Scotland. A wildlife biologist from IDNR provides the group with technical advice and serves in a nonvoting capacity. (Brief biographies of Task Force members can be found at the end of this document.) 3 JURISDICTION Many residents look to the Task F orce and local government to s olve the deer issue. However, it is important to unde rstand that the Task Force and local government do not have authority to manage deer in any way they see fit. Instead, any proposal to care for, manage or otherwise regulate deer on public or private property must first be approved by the IDNR. According to the Indiana Code, w ild animals belong to the peopl e of Indiana, and IDNR is charged with protecting and mana ging Indiana wildlife on behalf of Indiana residents (I.C. \u00a7142211). By law, the IDNR is required to consider the welfare of wild animals, the relationship of wild animals to other animals and the welfare o f people (I.C. \u00a7142226). IDNR sets the boundaries within which deer management options can be selected, but leaves it up to communities to de cide specifically how and if m anagement should occur. (IDNR, Human Conflict with White\u00ad tailed Deer, 2012). MANAGEMENT CRITERIA The recommendations contained in this report are motivated by t he following considerations: 1) to do what is in the best interest of deer; 2) to manage deerhuman conflicts at levels considered safe and acceptable to community residents; 3) to manage deer impact for a healthy forest habitat at Griffy Woods; and 4 ) to improve the public's knowledge and understanding of d eer. In developing its recomm endations, the Task Force asked the following questions of each possible management optio n: Is it effective? Is it safe? Is it Is it costeffec tive? Will the IDNR allow it? No one deer management tool wil l magically solve all concerns w ith deer overabundance. The type and severity of deer co nflicts within the community va ry considerably and no single approach can be expected t o be effective in all situatio ns. Therefore, the recommendations of this report are intended to work as an integ rated whole. Similarly, the need for deer management is not going away anyti me soon. The management approaches recommended in this report reflect a picture of the deer issue in our community at one point in time : ~20102012. Deer, humans and o ther ecosystem components are parts of an open system that is continually chan ging. We cannot accurately predict months or years in advance what the deer pop ulation will be, what people will want, or what habita t will look like. As our popula tions and habitats change, the suggestions of this report migh t be wholly inapplicable in futu re years. Responsible stewardship means that we will ha ve to monitor actions and adap t any management program to changing conditions. For these reasons, it will be critical for local government to establish a team to administe r any management strategies gov ernment wishes to implement and to monitor the deer situation going forward. 4 KEY TERMS BIOLOGICAL CARRYING CAPACITY: The number of deer in good physical condition that a parcel of land can support over an extended period of time. When population numbers approach or ex ceed this capacity, habitat quality decreases, the h erd's physical condition declines and the likelihood of winter mortality due to poor nut rition or disease increases. HOME RANGE: The area within which a deer normally lives over the course of a year. This is the area traversed by a deer in its norma l activities of foraging, resti ng, mating and caring for young. OVERABUNDANCE: A muchused and misused term. \" Overabundance\" does not always translate into \"overpopulation.\" Overabundance tends to be understood in at l east two ways. First, deer may be regarded as overabundant when they cause direct harm to, or are perceived to harm, human welfare. This harm may include damage to plants, vehicle collisions and threat of disease. This underst anding directly relates to huma n self interest. Second, overabundance may also be invoked when deer populations reach d ensities that threaten the integrity of the biological world for example, when bro wse lines appear, when forest understory disappears, native species are compromised or when b iodiversity becomes degraded (Rutberg 1997). SOCIAL CARRYING CAPACITY: The maximum number of deer that can coexist compatibly with loc al human populations. Social carrying capacity is a fu nction of the sensitivity of th e local human population to the presence of deer, and can be considerably lower than biological carrying capacity. Sensitivity of humans to deer is dependent on local land use pr actices, local population density, and attitudes and priori ties of humans. Social carryin g capacity is often reached well before biological carrying capacity is reached in urban situations. 5 HUMANE DEER MANAGEMENT POSITION STATEMENT The humane treatment of deer was a critical component of the Ta sk Force's decision making process. On 26 September 2011, the Task Force adopted t he following policy. As stated by the World Organization for Animal Health and the A merican Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), animal welfare means how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. An ani mal is in a good state of welfare, as indicated by scientific evidence, if it is healthy, comfortable, well nourished, safe, able to express innate behav ior, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear and distress. Further, conservation and manage ment of animal populations shou ld be humane, socially responsible and scientifically prudent, includ ing humane handling and humane slaughter. The AVMA states that euthanasia is the act of inducing humane death in an animal with an emphasis on makin g the death as painless and dis tress free as possible. Euthanasia technique s should result in rapid loss of consciousness followed by cardiac or respiratory arrest and the ultimate loss of brain function. In addition, the technique should mini mize distress and anxiety experienced by the animal prior to loss of consciou sness. The specific method to be used shoul d be determined based on a numb er of factors including location of th e animal to be euthanized, safe ty aspects, whether the animal is captive or freeroaming, whether the anim al is intended for human consumption a nd the experience of personnel performing the euthanasia. The Joint City of BloomingtonMon roe County Deer Task Force end orses these statements. The Task Force intends that priority be given to nonlethal mitigation strategies and that lethal means be employed when a determinati on is made that a problem exists that is unlikely to be solved using nonlethal means. Further, the Task Force r ecommends lethal management m ethods be employed where necessary to alleviate suffering, protect hum an life, prevent damage to the rest of th e ecosystem or for the overall health of the deer population. If lethal means must be utilized, the most humane methods should be employed, as p rescribed by the AVMA Guideline s on Euthanasia. 6 ABOUT DEER Whitetailed deer are one of Indiana's oldest native wildlife, once existing alongside saber toothed cats and woolly mammoths. However, due to hunting and h abitat destruction, deer were actually eliminated from I ndiana by the late 1800s. The last reported deer was documented in 1892 and Indiana remained \"deer free\" until the s pecies was reintroduced by State fish and wildlife bio logists in 1934. By 1951, the number of deer in Indiana had grown to 5,000 and the deer har vest that year was almost 1,600. Today, the deer harvest exceeds 130,000 animals per year (Stewart 2011). In large part, this rebound is due human alterations of the natural landscape, including the creation of suburban and exurban developments and the e limination of virtua lly all nonhuman pre dators. Where deer were once scarce, they are now abundant. The considerable growth of Indiana's deer population indicates the very resilient and adaptable nature of deer. Urban deer have adjusted to conditio ns of the human built environment: they thrive on a fr agmented landscape, find nutrie ntrich forage in neighborhood yards, live out their lives in a fairly small geog raphic range, are acclimated to the presence of humans. Urban de er live longer and have fewer p redators than rural deer. HABITAT: THE EDGE Deer are edge species they prefer those transitional spaces t hat are situated between forested areas and open spaces, such as agricultural land, gras s land and human settlement. Ravines, creek draws, natural ar eas, and wooded parks create na tural bedding areas and cover, while golf courses, open park land, fertilized lawns and flowering or vegetable gardens provide ample and varied forage opportunities. Urban deer are also much more ha bituated to human presence (Sto rm et al. 2007, Etter et al. 2002, Swihart et al. 1995). D eer acclimated to people do no t avoid areas of human settlement and lose their fear of humans. As a consequence, urb an deer often exhibit a \"refuge effect\" in which deer are attracted to fertilized lawns and gardens as food supplements, are not afraid to cr oss roads and traffic to pursu e food and otherwise do not avoid contact with humans. DIET: MOVABLE FEAST Whitetailed deer are foragers. One of their many defense mecha nisms is eating on the go. Deer will not camp out at a food source; instead, they eat a li ttle here, move on, eat a little there, and so on. An average dee r will consume between 4.5 and 11 pounds of food a day. When it comes to food preferences, deer love fertilized areas a nd no where is fertilizer more abundant than lawns, flower beds and gardens. Indeed, food found in suburban yards is sometimes more nutrient rich than that found in the forest ( Swihart et al. 1995). 7 HOME RANGE Compared to their rural counterparts, urban deer live out their lives within a relatively small geographic area (Grund and Woolf 2002). The home range o f deer in developed landscapes ranges from 43 hectare (ha) (urban) to 158 ha (exurban). This compares with a home range of deer in forested a reas of 171181 ha and agricult ural landscapes, and Spohr 2000; Etter et al. 2002; Walter et al. 2002). Home ranges are shaped by many factors: 1) population density i s inversely related to home range; 2) local movement ma y be restricted if habitat is patchily distributed, resulting in insular areas where activity is concentrated; and 3) increased concealment sites (wooded areas used for cove r) interspersed with feeding s ites in suburban contexts may reduce the energy requiremen ts of deer (Swihart et al. 1995 ). Within suburban areas, female deer have smaller home ranges than male deer. Whitetailed deer are organized into matrilineal groups in w hich related females are accompanied by their immediate offspring. Female deer typically remain in the area in which they are born and the home range of young female deer often overlaps with that of their mothers while males disperse (Porter et al. 1991; Nixon et al. 1994). Biologists have characterized the range of female deer as a rosepetal configuration wherein family units exist in a form analogous to the petals on a rose (US DOI 1992). DEER TEMPERAMENT Deer are not aggressive animals. By and large, they are very ge ntle. Given the choice of \"fight\" or \"flight,\" a deer will flee. However, like all mothers, a doe may become aggressive if she perceives her young are b eing threatened. Because deer h ave a longer evolutionary history experiencing canines as predators, a doe may more readily become aggressive at the sight of dog than a human. Deer aggression did not inform the recommendations of this repo rt, largely because aggression is more imagined than it is real. Yet, the Task Forc e received many inquiries from frightened residents wantin g to know what to do if they en counter a deer. The short answer is to use common sense an d observe the deer from a dista nce; keep your dog inside if deer are outside. For more tips on what to do if you encount er a deer, see \"Tips for Living With Deer.\" Ovals represent the overl apping home ranges of female offspring from several generations.

Deer populations increase, decrease or remain stable based on the balance between reproduction and mortality. In Indiana, deer reproductive rates are generally high and mortality of adult deer is relatively low. When mortality is limited, a deer herd could realistically double within three years. In the Midwest, fawns generally have a reproductive rate of 1.13, although this figure can be as low as 0.6. Yearlings and adults generally have between 1.8 and 2.1 young each year, although this figure can be as l ow as 1.6 (Nixon 1991). At the same time, survival rates for urban, suburban and exurban deer are relatively high, ranging f rom 69 to 87% (Storm et al. 2007, Etter et al. 2002; and Bering er et al. 2002). A typical suburban deer lives an average of 812 years (Storm et al. 2007; Etter et al. 2002). 1 The following hypotheticals are intended to illustrate the repr oductive potential of a deer herd in situations of limited pr edation. The hypotheticals were provided by the IDNR and are not representations of the local deer population. The models are not meant to be interpreted literally, although r ealistic numbers have been ent ered. 2 Two scenarios are provided below. Hypothetical A uses commonly accepted figures to model population growth. This hy pothetical demonstrates that a deer herd can double in three years. Hypothetical B uses more conservative reproductive rates - rates well below commonly cited ranges. Using conservat ive figures, the second hypothetical illustrates that a deer herd can double in four years. 1 Climate change might also influe nce deer reproduction. Milder winters increase deer body mass (Mysterud et al. 2001) and winter survival (Loison et al. 1999), which fa vor population growth (Forchhammer et al. 1998.) 2 Thanks to Indiana State Deer Res earch Biologist Chad Stewart fo r providing the initial hypothetical and for permission to reprint here. fairfaxcounty.go v 9 133 deer alive at the end of Year 1HYPOTHETICAL A - The Moderate Model YEAR 1 Assume at the beginning of Year 1, there are 100 deer in a herd: 50 are male, 20 are female fawns and 30 are female yearlings /adults. If fawns exhibit a re productive rate of 1.13, yearlings and adults recruit at a rate of 1.8 and survivorship is a midrange figure of 75%, the following is a possible growth scenario: 50 males 20 female fawns these fawns produce 22.6 youn g (reproductive rate of 1.13) 30 adults/yearlings produce 54 young (reproductive rate of 1.8) 177 deer total 44 deer die YEAR 2 For the sake of simplicity, assume 25% mortality, which studies show is high for urban deer (fawns will likely exhibit a higher mortality rate.) At th e beginning of Year 2, assume that the deer population starts out as follows: 38 males 17 fawns born in Year 1 to female fawns (assume 8 are female an d 9 are male) 15 fawns recruited to yearling sta tus from female fawn status i n Year 1 23 female yearlings/adults 40 fawns produced in Year 1 by female yearling/adults (assume 2 1 are female and 20 are male) Reproduction in Year 2 67 males (38 males continuing to survive + 29 male fawns born i n Year 1) 29 female fawns (21 born to yearli ngs and 8 born to fawns in Ye ar 1) these fawns produce 33 young (reproductive rate of 1.3) 38 yearlings/adults (the 23 surviving from Year 1 + the 15 new yearlings) these yearlings produce 68.4 young (reproductive rate of 1.8) 235 deer total 59 die Under these parameters, the deer herd is growing ~33% per year, and will have doubled at the end of the third year. 176 deer alive at the end of Year 2 Herd Growth Model \u00ad\u00ad Moderate Recruitment Estimates Population Doubles in 3 Years 100133176234311413 0100200300400500 Beginning End of Year 1E n d of Year 2E n d of Year 3E n d of Year 4E n d of Year 5 TimeNumber of Deer 10 145 deer alive at the end of Year 2HYPOTHETICAL B - The Conservative Model Again, assume there are 100 deer in a herd 50 are male, 20 are fawns and 30 are yearlings/adults.

How many dee r live in the community? This is a tough quest ion to answer. We don't know ex actly how many deer there are in Bloomington and Monroe County. The IDNR does not engage in a deer census. Instead of looking at the number of deer per square mile, modern deer management looks at trends and the effects of deer overabundance, such as deer health, ecosystem health and deerhuman conflicts. If the deer are healthy, the forest is he althy, deervehicle collisions are not increasing and people ar e not complaining about deer, i t does not matter how many deer there are per square mile the management objectives hav e been met. While the Task Force considered quantification techniques such as aerial count s, thermal infrared photography, drive and pellet counts and spotlight techniques, these techniques are variously expensive, laborinten sive and, according to the IDNR , wholly unnecessary. POPULATION TRENDS To track population trends in the Indiana deer herd, the IDNR r elies on harvest and deer auto collision figures. These trends show that the deer populat ion is growing throughout the State, but has been stable wi thin Monroe County in recent y ears. Deer Harvest - Monroe County In Monroe County, the number of deer harvested over the last 12 years has oscillated but appears to be relatively stable ( See Appendix II). In 2000, 1,368 deer were harvested; that number increased to 1,623 in 2004, dropped to 1,272 in 2005 and increased to 1,480 in 2009 - the year in which resident complaints increased. In 201 1, the harvest figure was 1,361, very close to what it was 12 years ago. 3 Insofar as the vast majority of hunting occurs in more rural areas of the county, not within city limits, these figures most accurately reflect trends in the deer herd outside the city. 3 According to the IDNR, a reduced harvest may or may not be a fu nction of reduced herd size. Weather also informs deer movement and hunter participation. Cold weather is a signal to deer to move and is closely related to the deer rut. The Indi ana State Climate Office reported above normal temperatures 21 days in November 2011, with eight of tho se days being 10 degrees or mor e above normal, ma king it the ninth warmest November since 1895. It wa s also the third wettest Nove mber in history and the wettest in the past 26 years. Warm weather may have k ept deer at bay and the rain m ay have discouraged some hunters. Source: nps.gov 12 Deer\u00ad Vehicle Collisions Similarly, deervehicle collision s have remained stable in both the city and county over the last handful of years. Important ly, this collision data is reco rded only when an accident incurs $1,000 in property damage. Not surprisingly, most of the se recorded collisions occur on highspeed, highvolume roads, not on lowspeed, lowvolume residential neighborhood roads. Deervehicle collisions ar e a function of many factors, not only deer density. Other factors such as driver behavior, reporting practices, traffic s peed and traffic volume inform the number of deervehicle collisions. s Monroe County In Monroe County, reported deervehicle collisions increased fr om 41 in 2000 to approximately 110 in 2011. This in crease could be due to bett er reporting, more deer, more cars on the road, more road s or a host of many other facto rs. From 20082011, total county crash figures have remained relati vely stable: 2008 100 2009 115 2010 111 2011 110 City of Bloomington From 20082011, crashes within Bloom ington's city limits and the immediate area around the city have also remained stable: 2008 45 2009 52 2010 53 2011 40 Most of the $1,000+ recorded crashes in the city occur on high volume roads such as State Road 46 Bypass near Lake Griffy, the State Road 46State Road 4 46 intersection and near the Renwick development. Most d eervehicle collisions occur dur ing rut (mating) season, OctoberDecember; most did not result in injury to humans; none resulted in death to a human; and most of the property damage ranged from $1,001 to $2 ,000. While helpful, this information does not account for traffic vo lume. A more descriptive analysis would control for volum e - how many accidents occur pe r million miles travelled. In the absence of that informati on, it is difficult to know if accidents are happening because there are more deer in the area or just more cars on the road. ( See \"Measurement and Monitoring\" for recommendations f or more informational ways to track deervehicle collisions. ) The following maps document accide nt locations, season, injury and damage estimates for both the City of Bloomingt on and Monroe County. 131415161718192021 LYME DISEASE The specter of Lyme disease is o ne of the most common concerns cited by residents regarding the presence of urban and suburban deer. Residents wo rry that areas of deer concentration may increase the risk of transmission of the disease to humans. However, whether or not high deer densities increase the risk of Lyme di sease is questionable. Lyme disease is a systemic, tick borne disease caused by a spir al bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi. Following transmission by a bite of an infected tick, Lyme di sease spirochetes initially multiply and disseminate in the skin surrounding the bite. If untreated, spirochetes can invade the blood stream wher e they multiply and cause flul ike symptoms. Lyme disease is transmitted to h umans by the blacklegged deer tick, Ixodes scapularis . Blacklegged deer ticks are the o nly vectors of Lyme disease in Indiana. The blacklegged deer tick follows a generalized life cycle that is relevant to the transmission of the disease to humans: 1) After a female tick lays eggs on the ground, larv a form; 2) Sixlegged larva feeds on a whitefooted mouse, sm all animal or bird and then dr ops to the ground and molts. The larva may have acquir ed the Lyme disease agent in th e blood meal; 3) The eight legged nymph feeds on a small ma mmal, pet or human and may tran smit the disease. The nymph then drops to the ground a nd molts; 4) The eightlegged a dult feeds and mates on a deer, dog, fox or other animal, then drops to the ground. Males die soon thereafter and females begin to develop eggs. Tick larvae are infected when they feed on infected whitefooted mice. Whitetailed deer are not reservoirs of Lyme disea se because they do not support the disease in the blood a t levels high enough to infec t ticks. However, deer are the preferred host for adult blacklegged deer ticks and are theref ore critically important to tick reproduction. Left: Small rodents, such as mice, are reservoirs for B. burgdorferi . The tick becomes infected from feeding on a mouse and remains infe cted as it changes to nymph and then adult. The spirochetes are transmitted by infected nymphs to other mice and to humans, which are inadvertent hosts. Deer are important hosts for adult ticks, b ut are not effective reservoirs for B. burgdorferi . (From: Nature 390, 553554 (11 December 1997) 22 The problem is that reducing the deer herd doesn't translate in to reduced exposure to Lyme disease. First, adult blacklegged deer ticks feed on racc oons, skunks, opossums, and other mediumsized mammals. When deer are scarce, ticks don't n ecessarily become scarce, because they have alternative hosts. Indeed, several st udies on mainland sites in New York and New Jersey found no correlation between deer and t icks. Second, ticks and Lyme disease are rare or absent in parts of the United States ( the Southeast, most of the Midwest) where deer are abundant. Third, ticks are only dangerous if they are infected, and deer are hosts to the ticks, but play no role in infecting tick s that's the role of the white footed mouse (as well as chipmun ks and shrews) (Jordan et al. 2005; Jordan et al. 2007 and Ostfeld 1997). Model simulations of the relationship between deer and ticks sh ow that a reduction in deer density results in a small reduct ion of the blacklegged deer t ick population. In order to drastically reduce the host tick numbers, deer would need to be almost entirely removed from the landscape, since one deer serves as a host for many ti cks. Experiments on island deer populations indicate that with a drastic reduction of deer numbers, the host tick numbers will also decline. In a freeranging population, where deer are not constrained to one geographic area, it is unlikely that reduction of deer numb ers would decrease the presence of blacklegged deer ticks, thereby decreasing the risk of Lyme disease (Ostfeld 1997). Another important point to consider is that the populationlevel risk of Lyme disease in Monroe County is relatively low. Based on data from the Indiana State Department of Health, the number of confirmed cases in Monroe County has held steady at \"less than five\" per year over the last several years. 4 Indeed, from 1990 to 2003, only four cases of Lyme disease were reported in Monroe County. From 2003 to 2004 (the last year for which data is available), one Monroe County resident was confirmed to have Lyme disease. To be fair, various factors confuse the diag nosis and reporting of the disease, and there are strong arguments that the disease is ei ther highly underreported or o verreported (misdiagnosed). Biologists at IU have been trappi ng and testing blacklegged de er ticks for 7 to 8 years. They found healthy populations in southwest Monroe County near Springville, but had never found the blacklegged deer tick in the Bloomington area until spring 2010, at which time they found a small populati on at Griffy Lake Nature Preser ve. None of these ticks have tested positive for Lyme disease. 4 The Department of Health accounts for cases in a \"less than\" f ashion in the interest of privacy. 23 DEER AND PUBLIC OPINION When it comes to deer, people tend to have strong feelings. Some residents view deer as highly valued wildlife, while others may view deer as a nuisance. Yet others may have mixed feelings about deer in urban spaces. In an effort to better understand how residents perceive deer, the Task Force issued a survey and hosted a series of community outreach meetings. OUTREACH MEETINGS The Task Force held a series of five meetings throughout the co mmunity from late June to late July 2011 to share information about its work and to solicit feedback from residents. Approximately 70 people in total attended the meetings. Meetings were held at Templeton Elementary, University Elementary, Bloomington North High Schoo l, Grandview Elementary and City Hall. After presenting information on the role of the Task Force, deer behavior and biology and common management approaches, the Task Force asked members of t he public two questions: 1) How do residents experience and perceive deer in their neighborhoods and in the community and 2) What are the most important criteria the Task Force should consider in making its recommendations? T he following is a summary of r esponses. For itemized responses to each of the structu red questions, please refer to Appendix III. Jonathan Hayward 24 Resident Experience and Perception In talking about their experiences with deer, many residents communicated that they noticed a marked increase in the number of deer within the last five years. Numerous residents linked the presence of deer in neighborhoods with the development of Renwick and other areas that replaced nature with the built environment . Many pointed out that the number of deer in their neighborhood impairs their ability to landscape, grow their own food and establish native plants. Participants spoke about seeing deer in areas of the city where they seem \"out of pla ce.\" Participants spoke about r esident deer herds that live most of their lives in neighborhoods. Residents also expressed concern about the close proximity of neighborhood deer to children playing outside. ( See Appendix III). Visual summary of responses to Question 1 \"What are your experiences with deer(neighborhood and community) ?\" 25 Criteria When asked which criteria for de er management were most importa nt, community members spoke about safety, a ne ed for community education and cost. When it comes to \"who pays?\" some participants po inted out that deer affect different areas of the community differently and that those who do not experience a pr oblem should not have to pay for those who do. Others obj ected to their tax dollars being dedicated to deer management. Yet others advised that in a time of economic const raint, government should pursue the most costeffective methods. ( See Appendix III). Visual summary of responses to Question 2 \"What are the most important criteria the Task Force should consider in making its recommendations?\" 26 PUBLIC OPINION SURVEY To further assess public sentiment, the Task Force issued a sur vey. The survey was open from late July to midSeptember 2011. It was available online and in hard copy form at the community outreach meetings, at the Farmers' Market and upon re quest. The survey was publicized through the newspaper , the Task Force website, publi cservice announcements and neighborhood newsletters. For survey questions and respons es, see Appendix IV. METHODOLOGY This was not a scientific survey. It was not random and cannot be thought to be entirely representative of all city and c ounty residents. The decision n ot to survey a random sample of the population was based on c ost, time, pragmatism and an ef fort to \"hear\" as many voices as we could. As with any survey open to anyone, it is li kely that residents who completed this survey are people who feel strongly about the issue. Respondents were asked to complete one survey per household, and responses were limited to one IP address per response. While it might not be scientific, the survey does provide a useful window into the way members of the communi ty think about and experience deer. In s oliciting feedback, the Task Force made it clear that the questionnaire was not intende d to be a referendum on preferred deer management techniques. The survey received 742 responses. Fifteen responses were elimi nated from consideration as the respondents indicated that they did not live in Monroe C ounty. Respondents were primarily Bloomington residents (77%). Most were between the ag es of 4069 (66%) and most live on \u00bd acre or less (61% ). Many of the respondents indicated that they have lived at their current residence for more than 10 years (47%). To gauge public perception, the Task Force asked residents questions that included the following: perception of deer in their neig hborhood and community overall; frequency of deer sightings in their yard and neighborhood; concerns about deer; deer damage to property; methods used to protect property from deer damage; and what residents would consider evidence of a successful deer man agement program. 27 NUMBER OF DEER : Residents living within the corp orate boundaries of the City of Bloomington tend to perceive deer to be more numerous in their neighborhood and in the community than do Monroe County residents living outside the city limits.

Again, the in structions accompanying the survey stated t hat questions were not intended to be a referendum on preferred management techniques. Instead, the Task Force made it clear that the group would consider public sentiment alongside other criteria such as efficacy, cost, safety and humaneness in making its recommendations. 31 Do Nothing City: 19% supported or strongly supported 5 65% opposed or strongly opposed County: 24% supported or strongly supported 55% opposed or strongly opposed Public Education City: 74% supported or strongly supported 6% opposed or strongly opposed County: 79% supported or strongly supported 4% opposed or strongly opposed Deer\u00adresistant Plants City: 68% supported or strongly supported 9% opposed or strongly opposed County: 63% supported or strongly supported 13% opposed or strongly opposed Fencing City: 50% supported or strongly supported 23% opposed or strongly opposed County: 44% supported or strongly supported 24% opposed or strongly opposed Repellents, Scare Devices City: 48% supported or strongly supported 22% opposed or strongly opposed County: 43% supported or strongly supported 23% opposed or strongly opposed Contraception City: 38% supported or strongly supported 41% opposed or strongly opposed County: 33% supported or strongly supported 47% opposed or strongly opposed 5 In the following, those who did not indicate support or opposition, indicated neutrality. 32 Sterilization City: 38% supported or strongly supported 42% opposed or strongly opposed County: 31% supported or strongly supported 51% opposed or strongly opposed Trap and Relocate City: 29% supported or strongly supported 53% opposed or strongly opposed County: 18% supported or strongly supported 65% opposed or strongly opposed Hunting City: 45% supported or strongly supported 40% opposed or strongly opposed County: 64% supported or strongly supported 23% opposed or strongly opposed Sharpshooting City: 41% supported or strongly supported 45% opposed or strongly opposed County: 43% supported or strongly supported 43% opposed or strongly opposed Trap and Euthanize City: 30% supported or strongly supported 56% opposed or strongly opposed County: 22% supported or strongly supported 66% opposed or strongly opposed 33 EVIDENCE OF SUCCESS What would you consider to be evidence of a successful deer management program? CITY the Community Reduced Deer\u00adVehicle Collisions Decreased Ecosystem Damage Reduced Loss of Ornamentals Reduced Loss of Garden Food Reduced Number of Resident Complaints Improved Health of the Deer Herd No Management Needed Other COUNTY Reduced Number of Deer in the Community Improved Health of the Deer Herd Reduced Loss of Ornamentals Reduced Loss of Garden Food Reduced Number of Resident Complaints No Management Needed Other 34 THE GEOGRAPHY OF CONCERN Deer are not a problem for every body. Some residents report th at they never see deer in their neighborhood; others routinely report herds. Some reside nts think the number of deer in their neighborhood is at a n acceptable level; others th ink the number of deer has reached a crisis level. Indeed, when it comes to social tolerance for deer, the Task Force's survey revealed a distinct geogr aphic pattern: deer are percei ved to be too numerous and problematic in southeast quadrant of the city. In response to a question asking if the number of deer in their neighborhood was \"not enough,\" \"just right\" or \"too ma ny,\" the overwhelming majority of \"too many\" respondents were concentrated in the portion of the city bounded by East Third Street to the north, Woodlawn to the west, Winslow to the south and South Sare to th e east. 6 See opinion map on the following page. Similarly, when asked how many r esidents see deer in their yard on a daily basis, the great majority of residents west of W oodlawn report seeing \"0\" deer i n their yard daily, while most respondents living east of Woodlawn, in the southeast quadrant of the city defined by the boundaries described above, reported seeing 15 deer in the ir yard daily. See daily sighting maps for both individua l yards and neighborhoods on fo llowing pages. This localized concern mirrors the feedback the Task Force has received from residents. This is not surprising. The southeast portion of the city is a n area that has experienced significant development and loss of greenspace in recent years. This development has fragmented the landscape and prov ides deer with the nutrientri ch lawnforest edge they need to thrive. 6 To discern how resident complaints map onto different parts of the city, the Task Force asked survey respondents to indicate where th ey live by providing cross stre et or block information. To protect privacy, the survey did not ask f or pinpoint addresses. 3536373839 DEER MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES The Task Force explored a number of different management altern atives for addressing both urban deer and deer at Griff y. Some of these techniques ar e traditional and are known to produce measurable effects; o thers are lessknown but emergi ng techniques for handling suburban deer. Other options are simply not viable. The deer management alternatives considered by the Task Force include: Do Nothing Fencing Feeding Ban Scare Devices Landscape Alteration Repellents Trap and Translocate Contraception Sterilization Sharpshooting Trap and Kill (Various Methods) Hunting (Both Regulated and Managed forms) Predator Reintroduction Each option was filtered through the lenses of efficacy, cost, safety, maintenance and humaneness. The management options explored by the Task Force a re described below. ___________________________________________ DO NOTHING - LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE One option is to do nothing - to let nature take its course. As discussed previously, due to ample food, water, cover and the absence of predators, urban de er have high survival rates. They also have robust reproducti ve capacity. Nonintervention m ust be considered with an understanding that a \"hands off\" approach means that the local deer herd will likely grow. EFFICACY : This depends on your perspective. If the herd increases, so t oo may deer damage, deervehicle collisions, disease and ecosystem degradat ion. COST : No cost to implement. Additional deer damage costs may be incu rred by residents. SAFETY : Generally safe, but see above. MAINTENANCE : None. HUMANENESS : Generally humane; however increas ed deervehicle collisions and a deer herd that approaches biological carrying capacity would likely result in deer suffering. TASK FORCE POSITION : Nonaction will not address ecological and social concerns associated with deer. 40 FENCING This method prevents the ingress of deer. Most effective fence designs include mesh or hightensile wire at least 8' in height. Deer will rarely jump over an 8' fence or into a space that they perceive to be an enclo sure. When motivated by a food source, a deer can clear an 8' fence. Biologists advise that a 10' fence will exclude almo st all deer. A fence may not need to be as hi gh as 8', perhaps 6', but slanted outward. Deer will try walking under the fence and meet resistance. Such a slanted fe nce should be at a 45degree angle, and may consist of fencing with a few strands of additio nal wire on top for extra height. IDNR describes a common configuration: This fence is constructed using two widths of woven wire fencing to provide a minimum height of eight feet. Deer can easily jump fences of lower heights. Posts should be placed 10\u00ad12 feet apart. While this permanent type of fence is the most effective means of restricting deer, construction and labor costs may prove prohibitive when considered in a cost/benefit analy sis. The use of this ty pe of fence would best suit the need to restrict deer from a small, highly valued crop for an extended period of time. Snow fencing Lattice type snow fencing can be used successfully around small garden plots, but deer tend to jump the fence if too large an area is surrounded. Snow fencing is less expensive than woven wire and can be removed and reused as need ed (IDNR, Managing Deer Damage). 41 EFFICACY: Fences are effective for exclusion from individual properties , but fences move the deer into neighboring yards. COST: An 8' woven wire fence cost $6 to $8 per foot to install. A polypropylene mesh grid deer netting can be staked aroun d most small gardens at a cost to the homeowner of $2$3 per foot, plus labor. SAFETY: Generally safe. The City of Bloomington prohibits electrifi ed and barbedwire fences. MAINTENANCE : Fences generally require some form of maintenance. HUMANENESS : Generally humane. IDNR : Approves fencing (nonelectrif ied and electrified) as a means of control. CITY: Fences may not exceed a height of 8' in a backyard and may not exceed 4' in height in front yards and corner lots (BMC \u00a720. 05.046(d)(1)). The following typ es of fences are prohibited: barbed wire, security wire, electrified wire, sharpened top spikes and other similar material (BMC \u00a720.05.047(a)). TASK FORCE POSITION : Fences can be an effective deterrent tool for individual property owners, but not as a general community deer management strategy . 42 FEEDING BAN Supplemental feeding may encourage higher deer reproductive rates, encourage denser deer concentrations in certain areas, increase deervehicle col lisions, spread disease and habituate deer to the presence of humans (DeNicola 2000). In r esponse, some communities have banned the feeding of deer. EFFICACY : If deer relied only on supplemental feeding, a feeding ban w ould be effective. However, deer commonly browse on plants not intended as \"deer f ood.\" Therefore, banning intentional feeding is of limited efficacy. Feeding ba ns are also difficult to enforce. Most enforcement occurs upon comp laint. To make a ban work, there must be a sustained effort to publicize and enforce the rule. The educational/aware nessbuilding value may be just as important as the actual prohibition. COST : Costs are related to personnel needed to receive the complai nts, enforce the ban and penalize violators. SAFETY : Generally safe. MAINTENANCE : A feeding ban requires maintenance via administration and enf orcement. HUMANENESS : Generally humane. IDNR : Not recognized as an approved tool for deer damage mitigation . TASK FORCE POSITION : A feeding ban may help mitigate nuisance concerns associated with deer in neighborhoods. The greatest value of a feeding ban is its educational value. SCARE DEVICES Scare devices include methods for scaring or hazing deer in the interest of encouraging deer to change their habitual pa ttern of movement. These device s include motionsensitive lights and sprinklers and radios that go on and off during the night. EFFICACY: Scare devices may be effective at the first sign of a problem . The problem with all scare devices is that deer eventually acclimate to them, ev en when the devices are moved occasionally. Varying the scare devices every week may ex tend the protection for a longer period. Scare devices are an effective shortterm soluti on. COST: Generally cost effective. SAFETY: Generally safe. MAINTENANCE : Devices must be maintained, adj usted and moved as necessary. HUMANENESS : Generally humane. TASK FORCE POSITION : Scare devices may help individual property owners reduce damage to their properties. 43 REPELLENTS Repellents can be effective to deter deer over a limited time period in a localized area. ( See \"Tips for Living With Deer\") EFFICACY Chemical repellents are relatively effective at low deer densit ies, but become less effective as deer densities increase. Repellents do not eliminate bro wsing, they only reduce it; Rainfall will wash off many repe llents and reapplication may be required; The availability of other, more palatable deer food dictates th e effectiveness of repellents. When food is scarce, deer may ignore both taste and odor repellents. COST Costs vary from $25/gallon to $45/gallon for commercial repelle nts to minimal cost for home remedies. SAFETY: Chemical repellents are not su itable for application on plan ts intended for human consumption. MAINTENANCE : Maintenance is required. IDNR: Recognized as an approved method of control. HUMANENESS : Generally considered humane. TASK FORCE POSITION : Repellents may help individual property owners reduce damage to their properties. LANDSCAPE ALTERATION By choosing species that are undesirable to deer, residents can reduce the amount of damage to landscaping. Plants wi th a bitter or spicy taste, mil ky sap, or thorny, hairy, or tough leaves and stems are unpalatable to deer. EFFICACY : Certain plants can effec tively deter browsing. However, the presence of undesirable plants does not deter deer from feeding on other ne arby plants that they do find palatable. If there is inte nsive feeding pressure caused b y drought, snow or high deer density, deer will browse even the most undesirable plants. (Fo r a custom list of deer resistant plants, see \"Tips for Living With Deer\") COST: Variable SAFETY: Generally considered safe. MAINTENANCE : Maintenance is required. IDNR: Recognized as an approved method of control. HUMANENESS : Generally considered humane. TASK FORCE POSITION : Planting deerresistant flower s, bushes and trees may help individual property owners reduce damage to their yards. 44 TRAP AND TRANSLOCATE (Not approved by IDNR in free\u00adranging contexts) The trapping and translocation of deer involves trapping deer i n problem areas and moving them somewhere else. EFFICACY High Mortality. Studies shows that approximately 4% of the deer die in transpor t, as many as 25% of translocated deer die within the first two months of trapping a nd translocation, and more than 85% of deer may not sur vive longer than one year. (Be ringer et al. 1996). These deer tend to have high mortality rates resulting from cap turerelated injuries, unfamiliarity with the release site and encounters with new mortality agents. Many deer suffer from a type of s tress resulting from prolonged trapping and transport called \"capture myopathy.\" Capture myopathy is a degenerative disease of skeletal muscle associated with the increa sed muscular exertion and over stimulation of the nervous system as a result of the capture, restraint, and trans portation of animals. Illness and death may result due to disruption of normal circul ation, muscle tissue damage, and electrolyte imbalance. Affected animals may show mu scle tremors or muscle rigidity, weakness, hyperthermia, respiratory difficulty , collapse, and death. Animals that do not die acutely may succumb later due to inadequate oxygen supply to the kidneys and from toxic products of muscle breakdown. Low Availability of Release Sites Translocation efforts are furthe r complicated by lack of suitab le release sites. Most habitats within the species' native range are already saturated with deer and cannot withstand supplemental stocking without risking damage to the h abitats. Disease Transmission This technique can spread diseas es such as chronic wasting dise ase and tuberculosis from one population to another. COST : $400/deer, plus ongoing maintenance. SAFETY : A properly managed trap poses l ittle risk to human safety. MAINTENANCE : Maintenance is required as new deer immigrate in. HUMANENESS : The biological realities of capture and translocation are quite different from the public's perception of \"they lived happily every after, just somewhere else\" (Conover 2002). Due to the capt ure myopathy associated with this technique, this method involves considerable suffering by deer. 45 IDNR: FREE\u00adRANGING ENVIRONMENTS Live trap and translocation, and release of deer into a freera nging situation is not endorsed by the IDNR for the following reasons: 1) The population of whitetaile d deer in Indiana is at a high level. The high deer numbers statewide is exemplified by high hunter harvest an d high numbers of deervehicle accidents. 2) Competition for resourc es with resident deer. 3) Low survival of translocated deer. A large percentage of the translocated animals could be expected to die due to traumatic causes, inclu ding capture myopathy and deer vehicle accidents. 4) Translocated deer tend to drift back into urban situations a t their new locations. Policy C2(a) (IDNR, Human Conflict with White\u00adtailed Deer, 2012, p.5) ENCLOSED ENVIRONMENTS The IDNR will approve trap and transfer to an enclosed environment only for a not forprofit entity and only if a ll deer are sterilized. The cost of deer sterilization is approximately $1,000 per deer. IDNR policy directs: D) Livetrapping and translocati on of deer will be permitted on ly to notfor profit, instate institutions approved by the DFW, subject to t he following conditions: a) The receiving facility must file a written plan for animal h ealth care discussing nutrition, parasite an d disease control and other ro utine management issues concerning confinement. b) Individual animals must be ce rtified free of TB and Brucello sis by a blood test. c) The institution must have deer proof enclosures to ensure ag ainst escape to the wild. d) All animals, upon which drugs have been used, must be perman ently marked in a highly visible manner. e) Translocated animals must be accompanied by a copy of the deer removal permit and a numbered tag provided by the Department. Should mo rtality occur during translocation, the tag must be affixed to the carcass and the animal tested for chronic wasting disease (CWD) at the transpor ter's expense. f) All animals, regardless of their final destination, shall be rendered incapable of reproduction (sterilized). Du ring sterilization the deer mus t be checked for ticks and must be treated if any are found. Policy C2(b)(1)(D) (IDNR, Human Conflict with White\u00adtailed Deer, 2012) TASK FORCE POSITION : Because of the suffering invol ved in translocation, the low availability of release sites, a nd the practicality and cost in volved in meeting IDNR requirements, the Task Force does not consider this a humane or costeffective option for deer management. 46 CONTRACEPTION (Not supported by IDNR in free\u00adranging contexts.) Two primary forms of contracepti on have been utilized to stem t he growth of deer herds: PZP and GnRH. The first method of inducing inf ertility in deer is by immunoco ntraception using a vaccine extracted from the ova ries of pigs, called porcine zona pellucida (PZP), in which the deer is immunized against a protein or ho rmone needed for reproduction (Miller and Killian 2000). When this vaccine is injected int o a doe, her immune system forms antibodies against the vaccine. After the doe ovulates, the vaccine antibodies attach to her ovum and block fertilization, which causes the female to experience multiple e strous cycles and extends the breeding season (Warren 2000). An extended breeding season will increase deer activity at a time of year when conservation of calories is important and may result in increased winter mortality. Lengthened breeding activity of bucks may al so lead to an increase in the number of deervehicle collisions. At this time, the use of PZP for fertility control in deer is experimental. Unlike PZP, GnRH prevents eggs f rom being released from the ova ries, thereby eliminating multiple estrus cycles. GonaCon is the only commerciallyavail able approved GnRH vaccine. Longterm field efficacy data does not exist; however pen studies (wherein animals are confined and excluded from o ther deer) indicate that a sing leshot GnRH vaccine can last for up to four years (Mille r et al. 2004). The EPA has app roved the use of GonaCon as a \"pesticide.\" However, the Offi ce of the Indiana State Chemis t has not approved this pesticide for use in Indiana. At this point, there are no known dangers to humans or wildlife from eating deer vaccinated with GonaCon. However, the longt erm bioaccumulative effects of the pesticide are still being studied. EFFICACY : As a standalone management s trategy, contraception does no t reduce overabundant deer populations. A number of factors shape the ef ficacy of contraception. Deer Population Must Be \"Closed.\" Treated deer populations must be isolated, or closed, from adjacent populations. Deer immigration from adjoin ing properties would negate any fertility control efforts within the treated area, a s new immigrants have not been exposed to the fertility agents. A High Percentage of Does Must Be Treated. A large proportion of the females (7090 %) must be treated to curb or reduce population growth. Population Must Be At Target Level. Since mortality rate s for suburban deer populations are usually low, eliminating reproduction within th e deer herd will not reduce total deer numbers for several years after initiating the anti fertility program. Therefore, a deer population should be at the desired level before initiatin g this technique. 47 Population Growth and Damage. Again, this method is not intended to, nor does it effectively address, immediate population growth or damage conc erns. Deer Stress. Federal regulations require t hat GonaCon be administered by hand. PZP is not commercially available and is not subject to specifi c limitations as it experimental in nature. Use of PZP would require a research per mit. IDNR advises that the conditions of any permit would require that the deer be tagged. Both tagging and administering the contraceptive agent by hand requires that dee r be captured before the vaccine is administered. Deer are stressed in the capture/trapp ing phase. COST: $600$800/doe, plus ongoing maintenance. SAFETY : Generally safe, but see above. MAINTENANCE : Some forms of immunocontracep tion require boosters. Unless l ocated in a closed system, does immigrating into an area would require dosage. HUMANENESS : Because this method works by decreasing fertility rather than increasing mortality rates, this method i s generally considered humane. IDNR: IDNR does not support the use of contraception in freeranging environments.7 TASK FORCE POSITION : Because this technique is not approved by the IDNR in free ranging environments, and because it is costly, requires that t he deer population be closed and the bioaccumulative effects are not known, this is not a vi able option. 7 See, IDNR's response to Ogden Dunes, Indiana's request to use GonaCon in a free ranging environment (01 August 2012). 48 STERILIZATION (The IDNR does not approve of this method in free\u00adranging contexts.) Sterilization involves the permanent loss of fertility to a dee r. There are two primary forms of sterilization: surgical sterilization and ligation. Surgica l sterilization involves the removal of a doe's ovaries. Rem oval of a doe's ovaries reshap es doe behavior: there is some indication that sterilized deer move more than fertile dee r. Ligation of the oviduct does not alter female behavior but does increase the amount of time she cycles per season. EFFICACY : Effective in small pockets (l ess than 2 square miles) and i solated areas with limited immigration opportunity. Some studies suggest that ste rilization is more effective than culling because the sterili zed deer are able to contribute to resource limitation and densitydependence in reproduction (Boone and Wiegert 1994). Ot her studies suggest the sterilization is an effective way to maintain a desired populat ion level after culling has been implemented (Nielsen 1997). This m ethod does not eliminate curr ent damage, as population remains; however, it does stem population growth. Higher mortality rates have been observed in sterilized deer; home range size and movement tend to be similar between sterilized and nonste rilized animals (Skinner 2007). Cornell is currently engaging in research to determine if surgical sterilization in combination with hunting can mitigate deerrelated impacts on u niversity lands and surrounding neighborhoods (Curti s 2011). For its study, Cornel l divided their management areas into three zone s: 1) suburban campus core; 2) adjacent outlying areas that contain agriculture fields and natural areas where deer hu nting is permitted and 3) an adjacent control zone. Each zon e uses a different technique. In the suburban zone, biologists are using sterilizati on as the primary management to ol. In the agricultural/rural zone, hunting is allowed and the increased harvest of female de er is encouraged through an \"EarnaBuck\" program. The resul ts of the ongoing research cou ld determine if fertility control combined with hunting is a viable, longterm approach t o managing deer or other wildlife populations. COST: $800$1,000/doe plus ongoing maintenance. SAFETY : No real threat to human safety. MAINTENANCE : Requires annual maintenance. HUMANENESS : Because this method works by decreasing fertility rather than increasing mortality rates, this method is generally considered humane. IDNR: Does not support this method in freeranging environments. TASK FORCE POSITION : Because this technique is not approved by the IDNR in free ranging environments and is cost ly, this is not a viable option . 49 SHARPSHOOTING Sharpshooting requires trained personnel to use a variety of te chniques to maximize safety, discretion and efficiency. The e ffort is conducted by trained p ersonnel authorized by the IDNR. Shooting is usually perfo rmed from an elevated position to ensure the shot is aimed at the ground and not toward bui ldings or in the air. A backstop is needed to prevent a bullet from ricocheting into uni ntended areas. Shooting is usu ally done at night using artificial light, over bait and using a sound suppression devic e. Using silencers serves two purposes: it keeps the activity \" quiet\" and out of range to nei ghboring residents; it also prevents educating or frightenin g other deer. Use of sound sup pression devices and spotlights to take wild animals is tightly controlled and allow ed to be used only by IDNR employees, federal wildlife staff or persons specifically autho rized by the IDNR. (I.C. 1422 67 and 1422611). Deer are shot in the head or neck to ensu re a quick death. The use of an accurately delivered gunshot h as been determined to be human e euthanasia by the American Veterinary Medical Association. EFFICACY : Performed by trained marksmen, this method is effective to bring about a quick and substantial reduction of the deer herd. The practice requires a natural backstop and is not suitable in many residential areas. To be effective, a feeding ban should be in place and enforcement of the ban should be increased when trap and kill management is being implemented. COST : $200$350/deer, depending on m ethod plus ongoing maintenance . SAFETY : When performed by trained personnel using special equipment, wildlife managers generally consider this method safe. However, some mem bers of the public may express concerns about the discharge of firearms. MAINTENANCE : In a freeranging context, thi s method requires continual upk eep. HUMANENESS : Because the technique is administered by trained sharpshooters using highpowered rifles to kill deer over bait, death is instantaneous. Because the te chnique uses sound suppression devices, deer and other animals in the area are not frightened or stressed. Some people may object to this m ethod because it involves killi ng an animal. IDNR : Sharp shooting is a wildlife management technique used in and a djacent to human populated areas which can be emp loyed to addresses societal issues, such as safety and humaneness, while providing for the efficient removal of deer. Sharp shooting is an intensive method of deer removal b y competent marksmen and should not be considered or mistaken for a form of hunting. a) The landowner, homeowner's association, or government entity must submit a detailed plan for sharp shooting to the District Biologist for approval, which 50 reasonably attempts to resolve the problem on a community wide scale (per IDNR's discretion) for an extended period of time. The plan must include: 1. Introduction brief history of the conflict and a descripti on of the area, including its location (political township, township, range, an d section)or address and size. Describe in detail the extent of damage caused by the deer, attaching any supporting documentation as an a ppendix. Any additional problem s/issues associated with the deer should be described as well. 2. Authority -specifically site your legal authority to act on behalf of those being affected and to conduct such act ivities on the lands where the sharp shooting will occur. 3. Goal - the long term objectiv es of the sharp shooting plan 4. Alternatives a review of ot her alternatives to sharp shooting including the reasons that these are not viable. 5. Logistics - describe in detail the following: A. Number of deer to be culled - discuss the number of deer to be removed by sharpshooting and supporting information for the recommendation . (Note: Deer density estimates or counts are not required. Discussion with potential contracted sharpshooters and community involvement will best aid estimated number of deer to remove. Any discussion of age and sex restrictions of t he deer to be removed would occur in this section.) B. Timing when sharpsh ooting will be conducted C. Personnel - who will be conducting the cull and how/why the individuals were selected. D. Methods - what methods, equipment (ex. Type of firearm), and aids will be used to perform the sharp shooting. E. Safety Issues - discuss all safety issues and how these issues will be specifically addressed during sharp shooting operations. F. Utilization plan - describe h ow the culled deer will be util ized/disposed of. 6. Long Term Management Plan - proposed management techniques t o be employed once sharp shooting has been completed to meet the lon g term objectives of the sharp shooting plan. 7. Public Information Plan - Lis t all efforts that have been un dertaken to discuss the problem with affected indivi duals. List all efforts that wi ll be undertaken to inform affected individuals as the plan is implemented. 8. Lead Contact - list the contact information for the designat ed individual, including a phone number and emai l address who affected individ uals can contact immediately about any concerns during the sharp shooting operat ion. The District Wildlife Biologist will forward the plan to the De er Biologist for review. They will discuss any fu rther requirements or issues wi th the applicant before forwarding the plan, plus any accompanying documents, to the Regional Supervisor and District Lieutena nt for review, comment and recommendations. Then, all materials will be forwarded to th e appropriate Regional Commander and the Private Lands Program Manage r, and then to the Chief of Wil dlife. A Special Purpose Deer Control Permit will be issued upon final approval from the Fish and Wildlife Director. b) Upon permit issuance, the permittee must maintain a current, accurate list of the names of approved designated sharp shooters. A copy of the perm it must be in the possession of each sharp shooter. The permittee must keep recor d of all anim als taken during the valid permit dates. 51 c) Within 30 days of the permit expiration, the permittee will submit a final report to the District Biologist which will be forwarded to the Wildlife Section Chief. The report will assist in future decisionmaking processes. The report should document all aspects of the deer removal process, in cluding any public reaction to t he deer removal or control. d) Considerations for Sharp Shoot ing Sharp shooting is an int ensive method of deer removal by competent marksmen th at maximizes safety, humaneness , and efficiency. To accomplish this, the methodolo gy, aids, and equipment used i n a sharp shooting plan must be selected with consideration for the specific situa tion. The Division of Fish and Wildlif e offers the following recommen dations as general guidance for preparing a sharp shooting plan. The IDNR will not conduct or participate in any sharps hooting activities within any community. The definition of sharp shooting requires that the shooters m ust be competent marksmen so the sharp shooting pl an should include a means of e valuating marksmanship proficiency. Sharp shooting may be costly and those costs are the responsi bility of the permittee. There could be inherent risks and unforeseen liabilities when conducting sharp shooting efforts. The total liabi lity and safety of all sharp s hooting efforts and its associated activities is the responsibility of the permittee. Sharp shooting can be an extre mely divisive technique within the community. The applicant should consider the potential ramifications that go along with implementing a sharp shooting program. To maximize communit y acceptance of the sharp shooting operat ion, human consumption should be the prefe rred method of disposal of removed deer during the sharp shooting operation. Baiting to attract deer to a specific location for removal ha s been proven to be efficient in sharp shooting situ ations and may be incorporated into a special permit. Conducting sharp shooting efforts in the winter using bait will likely increase the efficiency of the deer removal program. The use of elevated stands has proven to be efficient in deer removal and is often necessary in areas with higher hu man densities for safety issue s (people and buildings). Policy C2(b)(2) (IDNR, Human Conflict with Whitetailed Deer, 2012). NOTE : The Bloomington Municipal Code \u00a714.20.020 currently prohibits the discharge of firearms within the city limits, with exceptions for police and selfdefense. TASK FORCE POSITION : Of all the available lethal methods, this is one of the most hu mane. 52 TRAP and KILL In trap and kill management, deer are lured into a trap or net via bait and killed via captive bolt, firearm or chemical. If di spatched via gunshot, meat is suitable for human consumption. If killed via chemical, meat not suitable for cons umption. Deer may be trapped by using drop nets, remote immobilization drugs adminis tered by way of darts or by using Clover traps - collapsib le netted cage traps. The us e of an accurately delivered gunshot has been determined to b e humane euthanasia by the Amer ican Veterinary Medical Association. Many techniques involve prebaiting to attract and condition the animal to the capture site. Traps can be remotely monitored with cameras or checked frequen tly to ensure quick death after capture. Netting will capture multiple deer at a t ime, while Clover traps will usually capture one deer at a ti me. After capture, the deer are dispatched. If dispatched via captive bolt, it is necessary to restrain the deer. When done via gunshot, no restraint is required, although it is sometim es used. Death via tranquilizer is administered by way of remote delivery. It takes 46 mi nutes for the tranquilizer to t ake effect, during which time the animal may continue to feed and move around. Wildlife prof essionals have no control over where an animal might move and may need permission of priv ate property owners to retrieve the animal. EFFICACY: This technique may be suitable in areas where other lethal me thods are not safe or suitable. When the animal is trapped, this technique remove s concerns about wounded deer traveling about areas of de nse human habitation. To be ef fective, a feeding ban should be in place and enforcement of t he ban should be increased when trap and kill management is being implemented. COST : $100300/deer plus ongoing ma intenance. Capture cost will be lower when: animal densities are high; animals have not been previously trapped; a nd any deer is the target - not a specific deer, gender or age class. SAFETY: This technique must be performed by trained specialists and i s generally considered safe if properly managed. Pets and other animals ma y inadvertently be trapped. The use of trap cameras help ensure the quick release of any no ntarget animal. If the deer is killed via gunshot, the trap must be located near an adequat e natural backstop. Not all properties will be suitable for this technique. Owner permissio n will be required for trap placement on private land. The traps may be subject to vandali sm. MAINTENANCE : Must be ongoing. HUMANENESS : The effects of capture stress are key in assessing the humanene ss of this option. The longer a deer is trapped, the gre ater its stress level and the less humane the management option. 53 The Task Force does not consider the use of captive bolt as hum ane - it results in undue suffering to the deer and is dangerous to those administe ring the technique. The use of drop nets to capture animals is less humane than a C lover trap. Use of chemical immobilization to bring about death is less hum ane than death via firearm. When deer are chemically immobilized in a confined are a from which they desire to escape, such as a trap , they will continuously experience stress as the chemical can take up to six minutes to take effect. The more a deer is stressed, the longer it takes for the drugs to work, and the more stress the deer will experience. This longterm stress is what causes muscle tissue damage leading to capture myopathy. One study measured blood cortisol (stress) levels in deer killed instantly by rifle shot to the head and compared th em to deer that were chemically immobilized and subsequently euthanized with a c aptive bolt gun. Those deer that were killed after having been chemically immobilized had blood cortisol levels that were about 10 times greater than deer killed by rifle shot, indicating that the immobilized deer had been stressed more prior to being dispatched (Schwartz et al. 1 997). Some people may object to this m ethod because it involves killi ng an animal. IDNR : C) Live\u00adtrapping and euthanasia will be permitted. Mechanical euthanasia can be substituted for pharmacological agents. The use of captive bolt system or accurately delivered gunshot has been determined to be humane euthanasia by the American Veterinary Medical Association and are approved methods for use on deer under the DFW \"Euthanasia for Captive Nuisance Wild Animals\" policy. (IDNR, Human Conflict with White\u00ad tailed Deer, 2012) TASK FORCE POSITION The most humane of the trap and kill option is one wherein deer are acclimated to the site via a period of prebaiting, where the time between trapping an d death is very short and when death is caused by a precis e gunshot to the head. Any tra p and kill method should minimize stress to deer. If a trap and kill method reveals that deer stress levels are too high, the management program should be abated. 54 HUNTING Public hunting is the pursuit an d killing of wildlife for food or recreation by licensed individuals who are using sancti oned hunting equipment and who are abiding by all applicable State and local laws. There are two primary classifi cations of public hunting: 1) regulated public hunting an d 2) managed public hunting. Regulated Public Hunting In regulated public hunting, pro perty is opened to public access during all or part of the deerhunting season. Participat ing hunters are subject to Indi ana law and regulations. This method of management has the low est overall operating costs and requires the least amount of oversight and preparation. Managed Hunting Managed hunting is a term used to describe the application of regulated hunting in combination with more stringen t controls (DeNicola et al. 2000). Managed hunting may limit hunters to specific region s and dates, may require that h unters demonstrate a certain level of proficiency, may requir e additional permitting and may require shooting from elevated stands, among other req uirements. Because managed hunt ing provides more control and oversight over the activity, most communities that do allow hunting in urban environments do so by developing managed hunting rules. In Indi ana, communities may work with the IDNR to develop such rules to further control hun ting. Both the City of Warsaw and the Hidden Valley Home owners Association in Dearborn County have developed such rules. EFFICACY: Public hunting is the tool m ost commonly used by State wild life agencies to manage deer populations. Compare d to other lethal management to ols, hunting is the most cost effective. Studies indicate that an actual reduction in the deer herd usually translates into a perceived reduction in the deer herd by th e public. Another study sugges ts that hunting tends to de acclimate deer to humans, thereby potentially decreasing some f orms of deerhuman conflict (Kilpatrick and Lima 1999). One commonly expressed concern is that hunting actually increases the reproductive rates of deer. That is, when deer are c ulled, there are fewer deer and those who are left will increase their reproduction to compensate for fewer deer. This happens when a deer population moves from exceeding their biological carrying capac ity to a situation in which they are below biological carryin g capacity in other words, if deer go from a denuded landscape to one with abundant forage. Reducing a deer herd that has not reached biological carrying capacity will not enable the remaining deer to go into a \"super reproductive\" state. IDNR points out that the real pr oblem with the \"rebound effect\" occurs when the population comes close to 100% o r 110% of biological carrying c apacity and reproduction 55 drops to 0.3. The IDNR Deer Research Biologist estimates that deer in Bloomington now are probably reproducing at a 1.52.0 rate, and removing deer will not accelerate that rate.8 COST: Two costs are at issue: cost to the hunter and cost to admin ister the program. For hunters, the cost includes cost of a hunting license, any addit ional fees that may be imposed with a managed hunt, cost for eq uipment, tools, etc. With gene ral hunting, the administrative costs are borne b y the State. With managed hunt ing, the administrative costs are borne by the community administering the program. Wh ile cost may vary considerably from community to community depending on how and w hat they regulate, a figure of approximately $120$150/deer is not unreasonable ( See, for example, Hygnstrom et al. 2011). A whitetailed deer study in Minnesota that compa red four lethal removal methods found that the cost of a managed hunt averaged $117 per deer removed, based on the average net cost per deer after including revenues generate d by selling permits to participating hunters (Doerr et al. 2001). SAFETY : Generally considered safe. No accidents have been reported in Indiana's urban deer zones. According to the IDNR, the majority of archery hun ting accidents result from hunter falls from tree stands. T his risk can be mitigated by us e of safety belts or ropes. In response to concerns raised by the Task Force concerning saf ety perception and lowered visibility, the IDNR recommended that the Task Force consider using five contiguous acres in Bloomington's urban situations. In general, the IDNR does not recommend acreage requirements for hunting efforts. MAINTENANCE : Maintenance is required. Deer spend their life in a defined h ome range. In urban and suburban environments, the home range is relatively small. Some research on urban deer has shown that when d eer are removed from an area, other deer will not abandon their home range to fill that niche (Kilpatrick et al. 2001; McNulty et al. 1997). Yet, over time, young deer searching for their own home range will d isperse in random directions, slowly repopulating the area. 8 Furthermore, an increase in indi vidual reproduction does not co mpensate for fewer d eer in the herd. For example, if a population is at 50 percent biological carrying c apacity, a population of female deer may produce 1.6 fawns annually; if the herd is at 30 percent biolog ical carrying capacity, a female deer may produce 1.8 fawns a year. As a population is reduced in relation to carrying capacity, individual deer may produce more fawns, but this increase in individual reproductiv e rate does not compensa te for fewer deer - a smaller deer populat ion will still produc e fewer fawns. If a population is at 50 percent biological carrying capacity with 50 adult females, t he population can produce 88 f awns. If is reduced t o 30 percent carrying capacity with 30 adult female does, the herd grows by 70 fawns (Downing and Guynn 1985; Rosenberry et al. 2009). 56 HUMANENESS : Many people object to hunting because it involves killing an animal. Even the bestplaced shot resulting i n instantaneous death may be considered inhumane by someone who believes deer should not be killed. Humaneness may be increased by requiring that hunters demonstra te a certain level of proficien cy before being allowed to hunt. IDNR : Public hunting, either with sele cted or unrestricted hunters is the most preferred, economical and practicable metho d of removing deer, even in urb an areas. Even if firearms cannot be used, or are not feasible, archery hunting c an be efficiently and safely used to remove deer in urban areas . (IDNR, Human Conflict with White\u00ad tailed Deer, 2012) CITY : The Bloomington Municipal Code \u00a714.20.020 currently prohibits the discharge of firearms within the city limits, with exceptions for police and selfdefense. City code does not currently prohibit the discharge of a bow and arrow. TASK FORCE POSITION : May be a viable option in certain circumstances. 57 PREDATOR REINTRODUCTION (Not Supported by the IDNR) This option is intended to restore predators to an area of deer overabundance in the interest of restoring a better predatorprey relationship and minimizes human involvement in management. This approach is not realistic. EFFICACY : Our fragmented landscape does not provide the large, isolated undevelope d areas predators require. To be effective, predator numbers would have to be relatively high. COST : unknown SAFETY : While wolves and mountain lions are effective deer predators, they present the potential to injure or kill nontarget species such as pets and humans. As fed up as some residents are with deer, predator reintroduction would pose an even greater community wildlife concern. MAINTENANCE : unknown HUMANENESS : Some may perceive this as a more \"natural,\" nonhuman way to manage deer. TASK FORCE POSITION : While the elimination of most predators by humans is the cause of both real and perceived overabundance, IDNR does not support the reintroduction of predators. Therefore, the Task Force eliminated this option from consideration. Image: nps.gov Gray wolves once ranged across the entire North American continent. The spread of European settlers deplete d populations of large ungulates, reducin g the number of prey available to wolves. Eventually, wolves began to prey on livestock. In response to demands from ranchers, government agencies institute d a bounty program to eradicate gray wolves. By the early 1900s the historic range of the gray wolf was reduced to Alaska, Canada and northeastern Minnesota .Image:wdfw.wa.gov 58 RECOMMENDATIONS 59 NEIGHBORHOOD DEER: THE TRAGEDY OF BECOMING COMMON Not that long ago, the presence of deer in residential neighborhoods was rare. If a resident observed one it was a real \"event\" - noteworthy enough to make it into the local newspaper in some communities. Today, the presence of deer in many Bloomington neighborhoods has become a feature of everyday life. Fawns are born in backyards and a deer occasionally crashes through a patio glass door. As both deer and human populations expand, nature and culture are mixing in new ways. Some residents value t he increased presence of deer in neighborhoods; others bemoan it. Some view deer abun dance as an unsustainable threat to urban agriculture; others are concerned primarily about ornamental landscaping. Yet others people have more contextsen sitive notions of where deer fit in and where they do not: an occasional deer in Bryan Park may be nice, but a herd on College Mall Road may not be as welcome. When it comes to deer in Bloomin gton neighborhoods, the underly ing question of whether deer are \"overabundant\" is almost entirely a social one. Bloomington neighborhood deer are not close to reaching biolog ical carrying capacity - the po int at which the habitat can no longer support deer. Instead, managing deer in neighborhoods is about managing social carrying capacity. The \"urban deer issue\" is squarely a \"human issue.\" It is about managing the herd to a level that is acce ptable to residents. This level is subjective. It differs from neighborhood to neighborhood and from resident to resident and it changes over time. However, managing social carryin g capacity doesn't just mean th at we reduce the herd to satisfy our own needs and maximi ze our own happiness. Managing social carrying capacity also means that we must learn to adapt to some deer pr esence in neighborhoods. We should not expect deer to avoi d our hostas. Nor should we develop land without regard to a development's influence on wildlife. Deer are an important part of our landscape. When it comes to urban deer, IDNR advises that deer should not be eliminated, nor should landowners experience excessive property loss. Instead, there must be a careful balance between people and deer (IDNR, Managing Deer Damage 2012). 60 RECOMMENDATIONS Based on the Task Force's survey, we know that some areas of the community have reached social carrying capacity while others have not. The goa l of the Task Force was to come up with an integrated, mult ipronged approach that address es the social and geographic differences. Because resident concern is localized, because the urban deer herd is likely to grow in the absence any limiting factors, and because resident concerns are unlikely to be resolved using only nonlethal means, the Task F orce recommends both non lethal and sitespecific lethal strategies for neighborhoods. 1. FEEDING BAN (CITY) Many residents feed deer with the best of intentions. Some may be concerned that deer do not have enough to eat, especially in the winter. Others might enjoy seeing deer up close. However, supplemental feeding is actually not in the best interest of the deer. Supplemental feeding may: Increase the reproductive capacity of a herd; Increase deervehicle collisions. Most deer feeding is conducted near homes, which places deer in close proximity to welltravelled roads; Concentrate deer and increase no setonose contact, thereby possibly spreading disease; Cause increased landscape damage . Deer are browsers and will he avily graze areas surrounding feeding stations; Cause deer to lose their fear of humans. Deer using a feeding s ite can become acclimated to, and no longer fearful of, humans. A fear of humans is in the best interest of deer. Increased acclimation will create more conflict between humans and deer and between humans and other humans; When placing feed on the ground for deer, residents will likely attract other critters, such as raccoons and mice. Whitefooted mice are reservoirs of Lyme disease; In the winter, deer typically eat and move less to conserve energy. Feeding sites may cause deer to travel further to reach the site than t hey would for natural forage. Feeding sites situated i n residential areas mean that d eer are more likely to be chased by neighborhood dogs. Even if they are not injured, p rovoking deer to run through deep snow and frigid temperatures causes them to waste a lot of energy they cannot afford to lose. The IDNR makes it clear that deer in Monroe County are not star ving and that local winters are not severe enough to warrant supplemental feeding. If a resident sees a deer with its ribs showing, it is most likely a doe nursing her young in the spring and summer. Such weight loss is normal and temporary. Because intentional feeding of the deer just exacerbates concerns with deer as \"nuisance\" animals and because it is not good for deer, the practice should be prohibited within the city limits. It is commonly acknowledged that antifeeding ordi nances are difficult to 61 enforce; enforcement occurs most usually upon complaint. Howeve r, such a ban does have deterrent and educational value . The ban should be accompanied by public awareness efforts ( See \"Education and Outreach\" Chapter). Language for a City of Bloomington ban might look something like the following: 7.29 DEER FEEDING 7.29.010 Deer Feeding Prohibited (a) Except as provided in 7. 29.020 below, a person commits an offense if the person intentionally feeds deer or make s food available for consumptio n by deer on private or public property within the corporate boundaries of the City of Bloomington (b) A person shall be presumed to have intentionally fed de er, or made food available for consumption by deer, if the perso n places food, or causes food to be placed, on the ground outdoors or on any outdoor platform that stands fewer than five feet above the ground. (c) For the purpose of this section, the following shall consti tute food: corn, fruit, oats, hay, nuts, wheat, alfalfa, salt blocks, grain, vegetables, and commercially sold wildlife feed and livestock feed. 7.29.020 Exceptions (a) This chapter does not apply to an animal control office r, veterinarian, peace officer, City employee, federal or State wildlife official, or property owner who is authorized by the Indiana Department of Natural Re sources to treat , manage, capture, trap, hunt, or remove deer and who is acting within th e scope of the person's authority. (b) The following material are excluded from the prohibitions o f this chapter: (1) Planted material gr owing in gardens, or standing crops; (2) Naturallygrowing matter, including but not limit ed to fruit and vegetables; (3) Fruit or nuts that have fallen on the ground from trees; (4) Stored crops, provided the stored crop is not int entionally made available to deer; (5) The normal feeding of livestock and/or the pr actice of raising crops and crop aftermath, including hay, alfalfa and grains, produc ed, harvested, stored or fed to domestic livestock in accordance with normal agricul tural practices; (6) The cultivation of a lawn or garden; and (7) The feeding of birds. 7.29.030 Violations (a) Any animal control officer ma y issue to any person in viola tion of this chapter a notice of ordinance violation. (b) Upon notice, it shall be the d uty of each property owner to remove any and all food placed on the property in violat ion of this ordinance. Failure to remove such food within 24 hours after written notice from the City, or otherwise continui ng to feed deer after receiving notice from the City, shall consti tute a violation of this ordi nance. (c) Persons who violate any provision of this chapter shall be subject to a fine of fifty dollars for the first offense, with the fine of each subsequent offense of this chapter increasing by an increment of fifty dollars. Measurement Measuring the efficacy of a feed ing ban will be difficult. How ever, complaints about deer feeding, reduced damage to veget ation and neighborhood complain ts about deer in general might be indicators. 62 2. RAISE FENCE HEIGHT LIMITS AND EXPLORE FEASIBILITY OF ELECTRIC FENCES (CITY) Deer who live their lives among humans do not perceive features of the built environment to be artificial human constructs. Instead, houses, roads, cars and fences are all part of an urban deer's daily reality. Therefore, it gives an urban deer n o pause to jump over a fence to access food, be that food vegetables or hostas. On average , deer can jump almost 8'; however, when pressed, or motiva ted by a food source, deer can jump even higher. While an 8' fence excludes many deer, IDNR advises that a 10' fence will exclude virtually all deer. Height At present, the Bloomington Unifi ed Development Ordinance allow s a maximum fence height of 8' feet in yard areas behind the front wall of houses . This standard drops to a maximum height of 4' in front ya rds, which includes street yards of corner lots. As the City strives to encourage more urban agriculture (including frontya rd gardens), the current fence height limitations become increasingly problematic. The T ask Force has heard from urban farmers that current fence height limits frustrate their ability to grow vegetable crops, flowering plants and fruit and nut trees. Additionally, the City's Board of Zoning Appeals has received a request from a resident to raise fence h eight limitations in the interest of keeping deer out of gardens. Even if deer numbers were reduced in Bloomington neighborhoods, deer will not (and should not) be entirely eliminated from urban environments. Therefore, the need for fences tall enough to prevent deer encroachment will endure. For these reasons, the Task Force rec ommends that the City raise fence height limitations t o 10' in sideyards and backyard s and 8' feet in front yards. The recommendation for taller fences in front yards is not a ne w idea. From 1995 to 2007, residents were permitted to build 8' fences in their front yard s. During this time, planners observed that taller, solid fences placed in front yards and adjacent to public sidewalks created an uncomfortable, potent ially unsafe, pedestrian enviro nment. Additionally, there are aesthetic concerns with placing taller, opaque fences in close proximity to street views. In response, the City lowered fe nce height limits to 4'. Today, given the concerns expressed by residents about deer, City pl anners advise that taller, 8' fences might very well be suitable if the fences followed an \"open fencing\" configuration that allows visibility into the property, through the use of lattice, wrought iron, picket or other material. 63 Electric Fences While a conventional fence provides a barrier to keep deer out, electric fences are intended to modify deer behavior. Accordin g to the IDNR, one of the mos t effective deer fences is the \"peanut butter fence.\" Deliverin g a low amperage jolt that doe s not set fire to plants or injure animals, a peanut butter fence is characterized by strips of foil smeared with peanut butter affixed to an electrified fence. The deer lick the peanu t butter, receive a shock, and are conditioned not to return. At present, electric fences are prohibited throughout the City' s planning jurisdiction. A brief review of other communities indicates that most communities all ow electric fences only in rural/agricultural or industrial zones. The handful of urban co mmunities that allow electrified fences frequently require a nonelectrified perimet er fence that acts as a deterrent and provides protection from having innocent people t ouching the electrified section. A distinct advantage o f an electric fence over a conventional fence is cost. A conventional fence typically costs $5$7 per linear foot, while an electric fence is about $0.15 per linear foot. A conventional fence is a permanent structure while electric fences can easily be removed. In discussing fence options, the Task Force initially considere d an evolutionary approach to fencing: try raising fence height limits first; if that does no t work, open the possibility of electric fencing. However, give n the cost associated with con ventional fences, the Task Force instead recommends that the City simultaneously raise fen ce height limits while exploring the possibility of allowing some electrified fencing. Because of the possible safety concerns, this is a matte r best left to the City's plann ing experts. Ordinance Change Raising fence height limitations to extend up to 10' in sideyar ds and backyards and up to 8' in front yards and corner lots requires amendment of the Bloomi ngton Municipal Code. Measurement The efficacy of raising fence he ight limits should be measured by citizen feedback via the deer comment form and/or resident survey. 64 3. DEER AND DEVELOPMENT - CONSIDER WILDLIFE Human activity has fragmented mu ch of our community's wildlife habitat. Fragmentation reduces the average size of remaining wooded patches and increases the distance between patches and the ratio of edge to interior (Andren 1994; Murcia 1995). Some plants and mammals are severely compromised by fragmentation, others thriv e on it. Deer fall into the latter category. Deer love edge. As humans encro ach into previously forested ar eas, we not only displace deer, but we proliferate a crazy quilt of edge, the existence o f which is a good predictor of deer presence (Schiller and Horn , 1997). Fragmenting the landsc ape encourages deer to disperse and take up residence in neighborhoods. The increased presence of deer in neighborhoods, especially on the southeast side of town, tracks with a decrease in the community's loss of greenspace. According to the Bloomington Environmental Commission's Greenspace Report, from 1993 to 2007, the amount of greenspace in the City's planning jurisdiction area s hrank by a quarter from 51% to 38% (City of Bloomington Environmental Commission 2007). Much of the loss has been concentrated in the southeastern side of town, which has s een 42% of its greenspace disappear within 14 years. Accoun ting for most of this loss is development. Given the simultaneous loss of greenspace and the increase of edge in thi s area, it is not surprising that many residents point out that they did not perceive a \"deer problem\" until the Deer Park and Renwick projects were built out. The creation of more edge poses other environmental concerns. E dge reduces native biodiversity, increasing the chances of establishment of invasive species, changing vegetative structure and alterin g microclimate. Edge also incre ases the abundance of the whitefooted mouse, the principa l natural reservoir of the Lyme bacterium (Allan et al. 2002). Field studies in Indiana and Illinois indicate that pop ulation densities of white footed mice are markedly higher in forest patches than in conti nuous forest (Nupp and Swihart 1996, 1998; See also Ostefeld et al. 2002). 65 Edge can be better managed, and f uture deerhuman conflicts red uced, through community design. Both City and County gui ding landuse documents discour age sprawl and prioritize nurturing environmental integrity. When a developer proposes a project, that project is subject to a rigorous environmen tal review to assess the develo pment's impact on environmental features such as s iltation, stormwater, tree cove r, open space, native plantings and karst. However, a development's influence on wil dlife is not usually part of the development review process. It should be. The City's Environmental Commission is charged with advising \"t he City of Bloomington on how its actions and policies may preserve and enhance the quali ty of Bloomington's environment, including the life supporting processes that natur al ecological systems provide to humans and other orga nisms.\" The Task Force encoura ges the Environmental Commission to include wildlife displacement and habitat fragmen tation in its review of development proposals. Similarly, while the County's draft Comprehensive Plan points to the need to protect endangered species, the analysis of develop ment's impact should extend to other wildlife, such as deer. Wildlife Corridors The arrangement of trees in a community is a good way to predic t how deer populations will respond to a design or devel opment proposal (Gorham and Po rter 2011). As tree cover increases, deer are presented with an interconnected netw ork for movement, cover and access to food. Through continuous tree cover, experts advise that communities may be able to better direct movement of deer around or through a c ommunity rather than dispersing deer throughout (Cornicelli et al. 1996, Grund et al . 2002). We encourage the City's Environmental Commission to start a community conversation about ways in which wildlife corridors might be preserved or established. The Renwick Refrain. Residents frequently comment t hat they did not notice a \"deer problem\" until the Renwick Planned Unit Development was built. The phot os above depict the Renwick are a at three moments in time, l eftright: 1993, 2005 and 2010. 66 4. URBAN DEER ZONE: CITY OF BLOOMINGTON AND MONROE COUNTY LAND IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING THE CITY The State of Indiana created Urb an Deer Zones (UDZs) in respons e to growing concerns of Indiana residents living in urba n and suburban areas. The inten t of a UDZ is to reduce the size of urban deer herds to bette r mirror the social carrying c apacity of the community. UDZ designation is sought by the local community, approved by t he State Natural Resources Commission and incorpora ted into the Indiana Administ rative Code (312 IAC 9). UDZs extend the hunting season, increase bag limits and require that hunters in a UDZ take an antlerless deer before taking an antlered deer. In addition to Statewide bag limits, hunters in UDZs are allowed to t ake four antlerless deer or three antlerless deer plus one buck. By focusing primarily on female deer, this \"EarnaBuck\" requirement is an effective management tool to control and reduce deer numbers. It is important to understand what a UDZ is and what it is not. A UDZ is intended only for hunting through archery. A UDZ does not allow hunting where hun ting is otherwise prohibited through regulations governing the discharge of a bow and arrow. UDZ designation does not prevent a local community from adopting more rigorous hunting regulations. A number of urban communities in Indiana have been designated U DZs, including: Marion County (entire county, including Indianapolis), Vanderburgh Cou nty (entire county, including Evansville), Lake County (entire county, including Ga ry), Porter County (entire county). Areas of Hendricks, Boon e, Hamilton, Allen, Tippecanoe , LaPorte and Kosciusko counties have also been designated UDZs. UDZs are effective insofar as re sidents open up their property to hunting. If people do not provide hunter access to their land, UDZs are of limited effica cy. To encourage more residents to participate in the UDZ effort, the Indiana legislature enacted legislation in 2011 to shield landowners from liability. 9 9 The law provides that landowners who provide access to their l and free of charge for hunting, are not liable for the injury or death of a participant resulting from risks of the ac tivity. Nor can a partici pant or the participant's representative make a claim, mai ntain an action against, or rec over from the landowner a ny loss, damage, or death resulting from an inherent risk a ssociated with hunting. Inhere nt risks include those condition s, dangers, or hazards that are an integral part of the activ ity; including surface and sub surface conditions and natur al conditions of the land, vegetation and waters; the behav ior of wild or domestic animals on the land; the ordinary dangers of structures or equipment on the land; and, negl igent acts of a participant tha t may contribute to the injury of that participant or others. However, the law does not prevent or limit the liability of a l andowner who has knowledge of a dangerous condition that exists on the land and does not make the danger known to the pa rticipant, who commits an act or omission that constitutes a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of the participant, or who intentional ly injures the participant. IC \u00a734319. 67 IDNR has advised that the area appropriate for a local UDZ may include the City of Bloomington plus Monroe County land immediately surrounding Blo omington. IDNR will not approve UDZ designation for the county only, absent inclusi on of the city. IDNR further advises that a significant porti on of land in Monroe County is either State or national forested land, and is not suitab le for UDZ designation. IDNR d oes not support designating the whole of Monroe County a UDZ. The Task Force recommends that local officials seek UDZ designa tion for the city and applicable areas of the county, but that any hunting within cit y limits be strictly regulated and limited to a minimum of five contiguous acres of greenspace . The boundaries of the UDZ would be defined by roads, geographic indicators and other easily identified markers. The following describes how a UDZ would work in the county and how it would work in the city: URBAN DEER ZONE IN MONROE COUNTY Both bowandarrow and firearm hunting are allowed in Monroe Co unty, outside the City of Bloomington's corporate boundaries. Most county land is decidedly more rural than land within the city and hu nting has been practiced for ma ny years. To strengthen bow hunting efforts in the count y, the Task Force recommends th at local officials seek UDZ status for appropriate areas of Monroe County. Again, IDNR may approve a request for UDZ status for the concentri c area of Monroe County land su rrounding the corporate boundaries of Bloomingt on. Such designation of count y land could lower deer densities and potentially p revent immigration of deer into more urban areas. URBAN DEER ZONE IN CITY OF BLOOMINGTON At present, it is illegal to dis charge a firearm within city li mits, but there is no prohibition on the discharge of a bowandarrow on private prop erty. Therefore, city residents may currently bow hunt on private property without fu rther city regulation, provided these residents obtain a hunting license and follow al l State requirements. Some residents are already hunti ng, or allowing hunting, on the ir properties. We anticipate that even more may do so as they become frustrated w ith deer. While a number of communities s uccessfully implement urban deer hunts in areas of human habitation, in some areas of Bloomington, it's just not s uitable. First, many of the neighborhoods experiencing t he greatest concern with deer abundance are densely settled and keeping hunting at an adequate distance from occupi ed structures, from roadways, sidewalks, trails and other public ways, makes huntin g in neighborhoods problematic. Secondly, in dense, core neighborhoods, lots are small and yards back up to yards. Hunting in this sort of environment would almost gua rantee that the practice would be very visible and that a deer shot in one yard may expi re in another, causing tension among neighbors. Instead , as discussed in the followin g section, the Task Force recommends that that bow and arro w discharge be limited to five contiguous acres of greenspace and that rigorous hun ter proficiency and accountabil ity rules should apply. 68 5. ESTABLISH \"GREENSPACE HUNTING DISTRICTS\" WITHIN THE CITY While an Urban Deer Zone designation is a good step toward bett er managing the local herd, by itself, a UDZ does not address the safety and visibility concerns that come with hunting in more urban environments. To address those concerns, the Task Force recommends creating more rigorous requirements for hunting with in City limits. Specifically, we recommend that bow and arrow discharge be limi ted to a minimum of five contiguous acres of specifically designated \"Greenspace Hunting Districts\" and that strict safety rules and hunter accounta bility provisions be implemente d in these areas. The recommendation for \"Greenspace Hunting Districts\" is strict er than current rules. At present, no local laws prohibit or limit the discharge of a bow and arrow within the City limits. This is likely a historical artifact, rather than an intentional silence. As more and more residents express growing frustrated with the presence of urban deer, more residents are likely to seek relief through legally hunting deer on their property during deer season. Provided the proper ty owner follows State laws, cu rrently, a Bloomington resident may hunt on his/her pro perty (or any other property to which s/he has been granted permission) without further restriction. Because \"urban hunting\" is different, we recommend that any UDZ status be complemented with City regulat ions implementing strict hunting regulations, beyo nd those required by State law. WHY FIVE? We recommend that hunting be res tricted to a minimum of five co ntiguous acres of greenspace. Five acres is not a magic number, and many communi ties allow hunting on parcels much smaller. However, in response to concerns brought forth by the Task Force concerning safety perception and lowered visibility, the IDNR r ecommended that the Task Force consider using five contiguous acres in Bloomington's urban situations. (In general, IDNR does not provide these restrictions and maintains that no acreage limit is required for safely discharging archery equipment.) WHY GREENSPACE? The Task Force considered the option of allowing residential pr operty owners to aggregate properties to meet the fiveacre test. However, upon touring a reas of Bloomington most affected by deer, IDNR biologists advised against hunting in many of these neighborhoods - housing is just too dense. Instead, the Task Force turned its focus to hunting on green expanses, distanced from human s ettlement. As much of the city 's greenspace is in private ownership, limiting hunting only to public greenspace would be ineffective; therefore, the Task Force recommends that manag ed hunting be allowed on both p ublic and private property. We have relied on the City of Bloomington Environmental Commission's definition of greenspace. Greenspace is defin ed as possessing a permeable surface (forested, 69 shrub/grass covered areas, parks , golf courses, cemeteries and agricultural land) and more than ten feet from any humanmade development such as roads, pa rking lots and buildings. IDNR has advised that ten feet i s a sufficient setback to guara ntee safety. This \"greenspace\" approach to urban deer management is similar to many other urban deer management programs, including that being successfully imp lemented by the Hidden Valley Homeowners' Association in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Hidde n Valley allows hunting on linear \"greenbelts\" that run throughout the densely populate d association area. Some of the greenbelts are very close to houses and playgrounds. As the se \"greenbelts\" also serve as deer habitat, a deer that has been shot tends to run along t he green corridor before it expires, instead of running into someone's yard. 10 A map documenting both private a nd public greenspace of at leas t five contiguous acres follows. 10 In early 2012, a resident of the homeowners' association challe nged the practice. Afte r review, an Indiana administrative law judge found t hat Hidden Valley had taken rea sonable precautions to ensure resident safety including requi rements such as a hunter education course , proficiency test a nd hunting from an elevated tree stand. Given these precautions, the court found that the perceived threat to public safety was not greater than the continued harm of deer overabundance. The safety requirements w e propose here are very similar to those of Hidden Valley. 7071 GREENSPACE HUNTING DISTRICTS - RULES Any hunting on greenspace within the City limits should be closely regulated by City government and strict hunter pro ficiency, safety and accountabi lity rules should apply. RULES FOR PROPERTY OWNERS WISHING TO PARTICIPATE 1. FIVE CONTIGUOUS ACRES OF GREENSPACE Persons owning a tract or tracts of five or more contiguous acr es of greenspace and who wish to have their property designated as a Greenspace Hunt ing District shall make an application to the City; Property owners may aggregate their properties to meet the acre age requirement provided that properties are not separated by a road and all ow ners agree in writing that hunting may occur on their property; When it comes to public land, cl early not all greenspace of five contiguous acres would be suitable for hunting. For example, Bryan Park is very visible, close to houses and open, without much tree cover. Instead of trying to map out criteria governing which public areas wou ld be suitable, IDNR advises th at it would be better to simply include/exclude certain parks by name. The Ta sk Force leaves it to the best judgment of City officials to decide which, if any, parks are best suited to hunting. Parks suitable may include: Winslow Woods, Wapehani Mountain Bike Park, Thompson Park, the Goa t Farm and Southeast Park. 2. APPLICATION TO THE CITY AND HOLD HARMLESS AGREEMENTS REQUIRED An application for designation of property as a Greenspace Hunt ing Districts should be on a form supplied by the City and accompanied by the following: A plat, map, or other instrument identifying with sufficient pa rticularity the boundary of the property to be designated; Documentation sufficient to verify all ownership interests in the property; Documentation sufficient to verif y the authority of the applica nt or applicants to submit the property for designat ion as a Greenspace Hunting Dis trict and to grant permission, on behalf of those w ho have ownership interests in the property, to hunters applying to participate in a reduction effort; At the City's discretion, and su bject to applicant verification , documentation from a prior year's application may be incorporated by reference for p urpose of meeting the requirements outlined herein, provided there has been no ma terial change in ownership interests or property boundaries since the initial su bmittal; No one shall be authorized to hun t on a designated Greenspace Hunting District without a City permit. No City permits should be granted without written permission of an authorized prop erty owner of a designated Gree nspace Hunting Districts or his/her authorized designee on a form to be suppli ed by the City; Property owners must agree to ho ld the City harmless for action s of persons permitted to participate in a reduction effort; Written permission should be mai ntained by the City and updated annually. 72 RULES FOR HUNTERS 1. Greenspace Hunting Districts Permit Required. Any person wishing to hunt in a Greenspace Hunting District mus t obtain a permit from the City of Bloomington. Requirements include: Applicant must be 21 years or older, unless hunting with a ment or; Applicant must not have a previo us record of State game violati ons or felony charges; Applicant must agree to any background checks; Each hunter shall be issued a uni que permit identification numb er; Permits shall be nontransferabl e and shall authorize only the named person; Permitee may hunt only in the Greenspace Hunting District to which the hunter has been assigned; Permittees must meet all State requirements for hunting; Application fee may be assessed to help offset the cost of admi nistration. 2. Hold Harmless Agreement Required All hunters wishing to hunt with in a Greenspace Hunting Distric ts must sign a hold harmless agreement with the City. 3. Permission to Hunt Agreement Required Hunters and participating landowner must sign a permission to h unt or similar liability form (examples are available by the IDNR); Hunters are responsible for obtaining permission to hunt within a Greenspace Hunting District. Permission must be obtained prior to applicat ion for a permit or attendance in any orientation meeting or proficiency test. 4. Proficiency Test Required Hunters must pass an authorized archery proficiency test each y ear with the equipment they will use to hunt within a Greenspace Hunting Dis trict. Test is to be administered by a Cityappointed entity; Candidates will be allowed two opportunities to qualify; Test will consist of five (5) consecutive shots in an eight (8) inch circle from a distance of 20 yards. The candida te must place four (4) out of five (5) arrows. 5. Hunting Equipment Hunting equipment shall be limit ed to long bow, recurve, compou nd bow or crossbow, as defined by State law. 6. Tree Stands All hunters must hunt from an elevated stand. Still hunting, de fined as the continuous movement of a hunter through an animal's environment , shall not be allowed; All hunters must use safety ha rness or belt while hunting; There can be no screwin steps, and no nails or lag screws driven into trees; 73 Tree stands shall be removed after the hunting season; Stands shall be placed in areas of low public visibility; The City should provide hunters with guidance on placement of t ree stands;11 The City should reserve the right to approve location of tree s tands. 7. Hunter Accountability Hunters must carry a copy of his /her Greenspace Hunting District permit at all times while hunting within a Greenspace Hunting District; Hunters must mark all arrows/bol t with a number corresponding t o permit number. 8. Mandatory Orientation Each qualified hunter shall atte nd a mandatory meeting conducted prior to the commencement of hunting in a Gree nspace Hunting District. An IDNR Conservation Officer can provide guidance on developing an orientation. Topics to co ver at an orientation may include: A review of Greenspace Hunting Districts hunting rules, trespas sing rules, etc.; Emphasis on lowvisibility parki ng, removal of deer, wounded deer protocol, etc.; Possible reactions of nonhunters who are accidentally encounte red while hunting, while trailing a deer, while loading or driving with deer ; The importance of tree stand plac ement and that high visibility stands or careless hunting will result in revocation of permit; Donation of meat should be encouraged and guidance on donation should be provided; Permitting, reporting, and ide ntification requirements; An explanation that City restrictions are additional to require ments outlined in State law; A review of all causes for revocation of permits. 11 Suggestions for tree stand placem ent provided by Task Force mem ber Susannah SmithBurchell: A tree should be selected in an area that allows you to trav el to, and leave the stand, without ruining your chances of success. Do not cross deer trails entering or exiting your stand location. Ideally, your stand should be downwind of the deer activity or of where you expect to see the deer. Bowhunters should try to be b etween 15 and 25 yards away fro m the expected shot location (beds, trails, feeding area). Placing a stand too close to the shot location diminishe s the size of the kill zone on the deer, allowing a greater chance of crippling a deer or placing a poor or missed shot. Choose larger trees, at least three feet in circumference at the base. Small trees make it more difficult to place a stand securely and to blend in with surrounding woods. Trees th at are in groups provide better cover and break up the hunter's silhouette. It helps with concealment of potential ly reflective surfaces of the tree stand or bow to choose trees in shadows looking o ut into more brightlylit area s. There is not a prescribed height for a tree stand, though ma ny hunters prefer to be in the 1525 foot range. The higher a hunter travels up the t ree, the more difficult the sho oting angles and the greater the distance between the hunter and the deer this prese nts more obstructions and a gr eater risk of injury. The best determinant is the height at which the cover behind the tree offers the most protection from being spotted. 74 9. Time and Place Hunters are permitted to hunt only in the Greenspace Hunting Di stricts to which s/he is assigned; Hunting dates and times shall be determined by the City each ye ar, as needed. The dates shall fall within the IDNR's hunting season; City reserves right to suspend h unting on when special events o r other concerns may increase the visibility potential of the program. 10. Shooting Requirements Hunters shall not shoot outside of the perimeter of the approve d Greenspace Hunting District or deliver a shot that is likely to leave the Greenspace Hunting District. 11. \"Earn\u00ad a\u00adBuck\" Incentive Under UDZ rules, a hunter must take at least one antlerless dee r before taking a antlered deer. After taking the first antlered deer, a hunter should be incentivized to take at least two more antlerless deer before taking another an tlered deer. 12 12. Field Dressing and Deer Removal Hunters are encouraged to field dress deer offsite, not on the property within the Greenspace Hunting Districts; Hunters must strive to cover or otherwise conceal deer so they are not visible being transported in and from the Greenspace Hunting Districts; If a deer expires in highly visi ble location, then the entire d eer, including offal, should be removed from area as soon as practicable to reduce pr olonged negative exposure to the program. 13. Wounded Deer A hunter shall make every effort t o track a wounded deer for th e purpose of completing the harvest and recovering the carcass; A hunter shall remain in the Greenspace Hunting District until the deer has expired; In the event the wounded deer is not recovered or leaves the pe rmitted Greenspace Hunting District, the hunter sha ll immediately notify law enfor cement and provide sufficient information to enable law enforcement to track and r etrieve the deer; Hunters shall follow all applicab le State laws regarding trespa ss and hunting without consent. Hunters are enc ouraged to complete retrieval a greements with 12 This is a more rigorous EarnaBuck incentive, stricter than the oneantlerless requirement of an Urban Deer Zone. Warsaw is an Urban D eer Zone and has been encouragin g the harvest of antlerless deer since 2006. Since that time, over 90% o f the 200 total deer harvested have been antlerless. IDNR has expressed its support for this more rigorous approach, focusing on antlerless harvest. However, I DNR advises that an \"EarnaBuck\" requirement (not just an incentive) would conflict with State law, and such requirement would be impermissible. The Indiana Ad ministrative Code defines \"antl ered deer\" as a deer wit h an antler at least three (3) inches long (312 IAC 9 12) and \"antlerless deer\" as \"a deer other than an a ntlered deer (312 IAC 9 13). 75 property owners adjacent to the Greenspace Hunting Districts to permit hunters to retrieve deer from nonhunt ed surrounding property. 14. Harvested Animal Procedures Hunters must check in all harvested animals in accordance with State law; Hunters shall submit a cull repo rt to the City of Bloomington o n a form provided by the City. 15. Revocation Any violation of the aforementio ned rules will result in immedi ate suspension of hunting privileges within the City. 76 Ordinance Changes and Other Approval The recommendation for establish ing \"Greenspace Hunting Distric ts\" require a number of changes to the Bloomington Munic ipal Code. Those changes include, but may not be limited to: Restricting the discharge of a bow and arrow to five contiguous acres of the \"Greenspace Hunting Districts\" with the exception of archery pr actice. 13 Permitting requirements, rules for hunters, rules for property owners, penalties and revocation conditions. Any allowance for hunting on Cit yowned parks greenspace requir es the approval of the City's Board of Park Commissioners. Measurement 1) Hunter Success: Hunter success is a reference point used by biologists to determine if a hunting effort is successful. In many State Parks, hunter succe ss is set at 0.1 for archery hunting. That means that if 1 in 10 hunters kill a deer, then the State Park can skip hunting the following years. However, if hunter success is greater tha n 10%, this success points to the need for additional hunting efforts the following year. This rate is based upon property widelyaccessible by the general hunting public. It is unknown how these numbers translate into an urban situation, where hunting opportunities are more restricted. If the Task Force recommendation for managed hunting on greenspace is implemented, those overseeing the hunt will have to determine an appropriate metri c. At some point, if the City determines that the deer he rd is being successfully manage d, it could decide to suspend hunting. 2) Resident Feedback: Studies indicate that an actual reduction in the deer herd usually translates into a perceived reduction in the deer herd. One study reported that where deer densities were reduced by 25%, re sidents experienced a 24% redu ction in damage; where deer densities were reduced by 92%, residents experienced a 47% decrease in damage (Kilpatrick and Labonte 2003). After a managed hunting program, the perception of residents living near hunting greenspaces should be assessed th rough a survey or some other public feedback mechanism. 13 Notably, this limitation on the discharge of bows and arrows w ould limit the ability of residents to take nuisance animals such as coyotes, raccoons, foxes and skunks wi th archery equipment a s allowed by Indiana law (312 IAC 9315; 312 IAC 93 12; IC 1482278 and IC 1422 612). 77 6. TRAP AND KILL MANAGEMENT FOR POCKET DEER Deer tucked away in neighborhoo ds have ample nutrientrich food , water, shelter and very small home ranges. They have no reason to leave. This is true of the most \"deer dense\" portion of the City - the southeast quadrant. Hunting on greenspace would not address concerns with these neighborhood deer. By far, the most challenging aspect of the Task Force's work wa s addressing concerns with neighborhood deer. Because neighborhood deer populations are op en (deer are free to move in and out), IDNR will not approve the use of contraceptio n or sterilization. While the Task Force explored ways to open up neighborhoods to hunting, neighborhoods experiencing the greatest proble ms with deer abundance are densely built. Once the Task Force factored in hunter setbacks from property lines, occupied structures, roads, sidewalk and other public ways, these neig hborhoods became \"unhuntable.\" Even absent these setbacks, the IDNR has advised t hat given the density of problem neighborhoods, many areas are just not suitable for hunting. Similarly, the Task Force consulted with a biologist from the USDA who judged many of these neighborhoods unsuitable for a sharpshooting effort. Instead, upon touring many of these \"problem neighborhoods,\" bi ologists from the IDNR and the USDA advise that the safest way to remove deer from the se neighborhoods is through a trap and kill program. Unlike traditional trap and k ill methods where deer are trapped for some duration of time before they are dispatched, t he Task Force recommends a trap and kill method in which deer are trapped for a very sho rt period of time before they are killed. Cages are equipped wi th cameras and a system that a utomatically notifies a wildlife specialist when a deer is trapped. Once trapped, deer are dispatched by trained personnel within 15 to 20 minute s via gunshot. Because deer ar e acclimated to the site for a sustained period of prebaitin g and are accustomed to feature s of the built environment such as fences, it is likely tha t a deer will not be stressed when initially trapped. Instead, it will likely go about eating the b ait. For these reasons, the Ta sk Force considers this the safest and most humane way to re duce the number of deer in neig hborhoods. The project proposed project will serve both deer management and research purposes. Dr. Joe Caudell of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Serv ice Wildlife Services (APHIS) and Purdue University wi ll be measuring the stress levels of deer during the project. If stress is determined to be excessive, the project will stop. If the stress levels are determined not to be high, the p roject will continue and may ha ve longterm value not just to Bloomington neighborhoods, but other communities. This form of trap and kill is not suitable for all properties. Instead, because deer are dispatched using a firearm, this method requires an adequate na tural backstop. While the method can be implemented with a captive bolt where there is no t an adequate backstop, 78 the Task Force voted against use of captive bolt. 14 The project would be implemented in the winter, when deer could be effectively baited. Dr. Caudell describes the project as follows: Background : Though hunting is the prefe rred technique to manage deer populations, increasing conflict s within urban areas where hunt ing is prohibited or undesirable necessitate the need for additional removal techniq ues. Clover traps have proven effective at capturing deer, but the act of euthana sia via physical restraint is often viewed as inh umane, unnecessarily stressful, or generally unfavorable to a large contingent of Indiana residents. Develo ping a technique that can monitor traps and promote ra pid response time by biologists , as well as methods to measure stress levels of trapped deer, may aid in un derstanding an urban deer's response to being trapped. This method can be inc orporated with a removal plan that also involves sharpshooting, and efficiency c an be compared and contrasted in terms of hours/deer removed. Deer have been routinely captured using clover traps for past relocation efforts, research, disease management, an d other projects. However, it has been shown in other studies that comparative s tress levels are higher in capt ured and euthanized or immobilized deer than in deer that have been euthanized thro ugh gunshot. But several of these comparisons [that] have compared stress levels of whitetailed deer, the deer have been chemically immobilized. When deer are chemi cally immobilized in a confined area where they de sire to get away, such as a tra p, they will continuously experience stress. The more a deer is stressed, t he longer it takes for the drugs to work, and the more stress the deer will experience . This longterm stress is what causes muscle tissue damage leading to capture m yopathy (a disease that an animal develops due to l ongterm stress, often in a sit uation where the animal is capture[d] or is in captivity and experiences chronic stress. This disease can eventually lead to death in the animal.) Our hypothesis is that if the deer can be captured and euthaniz ed within a short time frame, the deer would only experience what is a normal lev el of stress for a prey species and, therefore, would be considered [a] humane met hod for euthanizing the deer. 14 Use of captive bolt requires that the biologist administering t he technique jump on the deer to administer the shot. Not only is this dangerous to those administering th e shot, but it causes stress to the deer and death is not as immediate as death by gunshot. 79 Stress in Deer: Stressors would be anything th at threatens or disturbs the homeostatic equilibrium (basical ly the health) of an animal. Individual animals will perceive stressors differently. A deer in a \"wild\" setting tha t has no experience with netting, metal poles, or other m anmade objects would probably consider just the presence of the trap a stressor. Urban deer are much more accu stomed to human made materials (i.e., deer fences, houses, swing sets, etc.). So just the presence of the traps should not be a stress or. This is also why we would prebait with the traps locked in the open position (so that the deer can enter and exit them, get a meal, and do not perceive them as a stresso r). The stress response can b e divided into three components. The primary stress response involves the release o f catecholamines [with]in the first few seconds and glucocorticosteriods within a few minutes. This is what gets animals moving in a fi ght or flight response. The secondary response involves increased cardiac output and mobilization of blood sug ars because of the catecholamines. The third stage involves whole body changes in organ functions, catabolism of muscle, and reduct ion of other bodily functions. If deer are in a prolonged state of stress, where muscles are catabolized, this can lead to long term injury or capture myopathy (whic h would probably be painful to the animal and therefore cause suffering). Our goal is to get to the deer bef ore they get to this stage. If our plan works, then the deer would only be stress[e d] for a few minutes and only just start to release g lucocorticosteroids (which is w hat we are measuring). The higher the glucocorticosteriods levels, the longer the animal has experienced stress. Once we can film the deer's behavior in th e trap and correlate that time with the glucocorticos teriods levels, we will have a better idea of the length of time that someone woul d have to euthanize the deer before it begins to move from the shortterm, normal stress to chronic stress and suffering. The idea behind what we are prop osing is to first acclimate the deer to the presence of the trap through prebaiting. The deer would [visit] the tra p for several days to a couple of weeks and feed inside the trap (without the door clos ing). Then, on the day that the door closes, the dee r might be startled as the tra p closes, but then, ideally, go back to eating. The d eer should not experience str ess until it wants to get away from a predator or other disturbance. Excluding some unex pected disturbance (such as a unleashed dog roaming the neighborhood), the remote trap indicator would let the biologist know that [a] deer is trapped and the presence of the biologist would be the start of the stressful period. This should only last for less than a minute (the time it takes to euthanize the deer). We wo uld also use the trap cameras to monitor the behavior of the deer to assess what it does once the door closes. Newer cameras will take video, and that video can be u sed, in conjunction with the measurement of the stre ss hormones, to assess the stre ss experienced by the deer. Our goal would be to see if we can develop a lowstr ess procedure that can be used in these urban condition s. If the data indicates that this method is not working, we can scrap this idea and go back to the drawing boar d. It would be easy enough to review the camera footage and get the blood chemistry sent off to the lab on a daily basis in the initial phase to assess the effectivene ss as quickly as possible. 80 Methods: We would use a collapsible clove r trap to capture deer. The de er would be prebaited without the trap. Once the deer are accustomed t o feeding in a specific area, the trap would be introduced and the prebaiting continued. Once the deer are accustomed to entering t he trap, feeding, and leaving, the trap would be set (to capture the deer) and a remote camera with cellular technology would be added to record the behavior of the trapped deer and to notify the bi ologist that a deer is in the trap. The biologist would t hen respond to the \"call\" and w ithin 1520 minutes, arrive at the trap and eutha nize the deer via gunshot. To determine the stress levels experienced during the procedure s, we would use a combination of evidence from the remote camera photos and/or vi deos and the measurements of (glucocorticosteriods) levels. It is the Task Force's judgment that this research project is t he safest and most humane way to reduce the number of pocket deer living in neighborhoods where residents perceive deer to be overabundant. Because concerns with pocket deer are primarily social and largely localized, the Task Force recommends that affected resi dents assume the cost of this management technique. The USDA APHIS estimates that the co st of this project could be as low as $100/deer if residents helped with baiting prior t o implementation of the effort. The USDA APHIS has stated that it would be willing to t rain local law enforcement to conduct this effort in future years, should the City so request . 81 7. SHARPSHOOTING BY THE USDA IN SUITABLE OPEN GREENSPACES To complement the trap and kill method and to prevent deer from immigrating into neighborhoods from surrounding a reas, the Task Force recommends that landowners, homeowner associations and other appropriate entities be allowe d to hire sharpshooters to conduct reduction efforts in suitable greenspace areas near neighborhoods where deer nuisance is a concern or where ecological damage can be demonst rated. Many neighborhoods in the southeastern portion of the community expressing the greatest concern with deer abundance are l argely unsuitable for a sharpshooting effort. However, public and private greenspace areas nearby would be appropriate . The Task Force recommends that both private and public suitable greenspace sho uld be made eligible for a sharpshooting deer reduction eff ort. Because IDNR is unlikely t o grant a special purpose permit to an individual landowne r who does not control sufficie nt property, the City may consider allowing private landown ers to include Cityowned prop erty in their request for a special purpose sharpshooting permit. As discussed in the \"Management A lternatives\" section of this r eport, the best practice sharpshooting efforts are conducted at night, over bait and usi ng a silencer. At present, State law allows only IDNR, fede ral wildlife agents or an individual permitted by IDNR, to use silencers and jacklighting (IC \u00a71422611 and IC \u00a714226 7). IDNR does not provide sharpshooting services; however, the USDA APHIS does provide th ese services and has a long history of conducting sharpshooting efforts in urban environments, including management at the Monroe County Airport.15 Here is how a sharpsh ooting effort would work: Winter - The effort would be con ducted in the winter, when deer are motivated to travel to a food source and afte r which time young have been we aned; Baiting - Deer would be baited c ontinuously before the effort c ommenced. Costs of the effort could be reduced if r esidents or other volunteers pr ovided baiting services; Safety and clusters - Deer are s hot only when circumstances are safe (i.e., no non target animals are in the removal zone) and fewer than approxim ately nine deer are present to prevent alerting the deer to the practice; Female deer prioritized - Most shots are taken on a firstoppor tunity basis. When possible, antlerless deer should be prioritized; Lead Fragmentation - To limit lead fragmentation, deer should culled by placement of shot to the cranium or uppe r neck (Stewart and Veverka 2011) . At present, lead free bullets tend to be less precise and stand a greater chance of passing through targets and striking a nontarge t animal or object (Caudell 2012); Notice is given to adjacent prop erty owners before the practice begins; If there are too many properties participating in a sharpshooti ng effort too close together, the deer will be sprea d out over all of those properties. It is best to pick one property (usually based on safety, size and deer sightings) and bait that property to draw in all the deer . As each social group comes in , the shooter removes 15 APHIS agents receive extensive firearms training and usually perform this service at a cost less than that of private wildlife management firms. 82 all of the individuals in that g roup. A certain distance away, another bait site is set up and attempts to draw in groups that are not associated with the previous bait site. Sites may be sat once, multiple times, or not at all, depending on deer activity. Usually, many sites are set up and monitored prior to sharpshoo ting. The Task Force recommends that s harpshooting is a useful supple ment to the trap and kill method proposed for neighborhoo ds. Together, these methods could result in a significant reduction in deer and potentially alleviate the need for intensive measures in the future. Because concerns with neighborhood deer are largely social and localized, the Task Force recommends that residents perceiving overabundance of deer assume the cost of this management technique. The USDA h as stated that it would be will ing to train local law enforcement in future years to conduct sharpshooting in greensp aces, should the City so request. ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN EITHER TRAP AND KILL OR SHARPSHOOTING PROGRAMS Any entity wishing to manage deer through either a trap and kil l or sharpshooting effort must obtain a special purpose de er control permit from the IDNR . Additionally, the Task Force recommends that the City exact close control over the pro cess. Specifically, we recommend that the City identify particular zones of the city e xperiencing deer problems and declare those as nuisance areas. Once an area is so declar ed, then entities within this area would be eligible to apply to the City for permission to i mplement trap and kill or sharpshooting in appropriate areas. Both State requirements an d suggested City oversight are described below. 1. IDNR - PERMIT REQUIRED Both \"trap and kill\" and sharpsh ooting management require a spe cial purpose deer control permit from the IDNR and both methods are subject to IDNR's sha rpshooting policy (See \"Management Alternatives\" for details). The IDNR will not accep t requests or issue permits to individual landowners who do not control enough land to adeq uately address communitywide conflicts. IDNR requires that persons wishing to engage in either trap and kill or sharpshooting demonstrate that these activities wil l make a meaningful contribution to solving deer abundance on a larger scale, for an extended period of time. For these reasons, IDNR may issue a permit to entities controlling sufficient land, such as cities, neighborhoods, homeowner s associations, business parks or a landowner who owns sufficient property. IDNR advises that one way to ensure the overall wildlife management efficacy of trap and kill and sharpshooting methods is to identify regions in which deer are reported to be a nuisance or in which ecological damage is being sustained. The area should be sufficiently large. Rather than locating the trap and kill and sharpshooting efforts in one or two neighborhoods, IDNR suggests creating management districts and then making management recommendations based on the level of deer damage an d concern in certain districts. IDNR suggests that the se areas might be created by d ividing the city up into quadrants. 83 2. CITY - LOCATION WITHIN A DEER NUISANCE DISTRICT Identification of management zon es fits well with the need for City oversight. We know that most effective urban deer manage ment is concentrated in zones and that concern with deer tends to be regionalized. To best match management to need whil e exercising City oversight, the Task Force recommends that the City annually ide ntify regions as \"Deer Nuisance Districts.\" This desig nation might be made based on s urvey data, citizen complaints, deervehicle collisions, browse evidence or some ot her indicator of overabundance. Once a region of the city has been declared a Deer Nuisance District, property owners within the District may apply to the City for deer reduction using either trap and kill or sharpshooting. Should official s wish to proceed with recommend ations to allow either of these methods, the results of th e Task Force survey indicate th at the southeastern quadrant of Bloomington is one wh ere residents have reached their social tolerance for deer; this quadrant might be identified a Nuisance District. This Nuisance District approach is modeled, in part, on the dee r management program in Warsaw, Indiana. Kosciusko Count y is declared an Urban Deer Zo ne. Within the City of Warsaw, areas experiencing the greatest concern with deer are d eemed \"Deer Nuisance Zones\" based on resident complai nts, property damage and deerv ehicle collisions. Within those zones, property owners can apply to city government for hunting on their land. Since the Task Force is not recommending hunting in neighborhoods, an d as we know that hunting on greenspace in Bloomin gton will likely not address co ncerns with neighborhood deer, we are taking the Warsaw model of identifying nuisance areas, and recommending urbanspecific management practices within those areas. 16 Ordinance and Policy Changes 1. The Bloomington Municipal Code \u00a714.20.020 currently prohibit s the discharge of firearms within the city limits, with exceptions for police and selfdefense. USDA APHIS is authorized by federal law to discharge firearms; however APH IS defers to the wishes of the local community. Some com munities have required a change to local code before APHIS is allowed to engage in sharpshooting. Any management performed by an entity other than the federal governmen t or local law enforcement (for example, White Buffalo) would require a change t o the Bloomington Municipal Code. 2. Also requiring codification are criteria for Deer Nuisance Dist rict designation whereby suitable entities would be deemed eligible by the City to contr act with IDNRendorsed individuals to conduct trap and kill and sharpshooting efforts as appropriate. 16 The Warsaw zones are proposed by a deer management team and es tablished each year by Council resolution. 84 Funding the Effort The costs of trap and kill and/or sharpshooting should be borne by the residents in the area perceiving deer overabundan ce. There are a number of reasons for this: Concerns with deer are social and geographically specific. All residents of the City should not be expected to assume the cost of paying for a localized concern; Those morally opposed do not want to subsidize a lethal effort; Some residents experiencing deer overabundance have indicated t hat they are willing to help pay for a deerreduction effort; and At a moment of economic austerity, it is unlikely that City is positioned to devote scarce resources to a deer reduction effort to address social c arrying capacity. While the Task Force does not recommend devoting City money to addres s this social concern, the Task Force does feel that residents experiencing concerns with deer should be afforded some relief b y being able to implement appro priate methods to reduce the size of the deer herd in their neighborhoods. Measurement : The efficacy of trap and kill and sharpshooting programs could be measured by resident feedback, deervehicle collision data and whether the number of deer culled through either a shar pshooting or trapandkill eff ort exceeded or fell short of the number of deer for which the IDNR permit was written. 85 GRIFFY WOODS Griffy Woods is an approximately 2,700acre woodland located ab out a mile from Assembly Hall. Bigger than many Indiana State Parks, Griffy Woods is cha racterized by extraordinary ecological diversity: it includes a 109acre lake and at least ten distinct ecological communities, ranging from marsh and floodplain forest to dry me sic upland, conifer plantations and old fields. Griff y is home to more than 565 ter restrial plant species, including 15 flora species identified as endangered, threatened or rare; nearly 160 bird species; almost 50 reptile and am phibian species; and over 100 small mammal species. Griffy also provides valuable outdoor space for humans. Hikers, birders, wildflower enthusiasts, and other nature lovers frequent these woods. Griffy provides critical field research opportunities for scient ists from all over the State a nd is an outdoor classroom for graduate and gradeschool student s alike. The quality of Griff y's natural space combined with its proximity to the city marks Griffy as unique - few cities the size of Bloomington have such a vast, biologically r ich resource in their municipal backyards.

Answer: A depauperate forest understory marked by the absence of native wildflowers, tree seedlings and habitat for other animals and the presence of invasive species and native plants deer don't eat. Source: V. Wilkins 86 Responsibility for stewardship o f Griffy is a joint effort. \"G riffy Woods\" is a collective referent used to describe land u nder the ownership of the City of Bloomington, Indiana University and private ownership. The City of Bloomington owns the largest portion - approximately 1,200 acres called the \"Griffy Lake Nature Preser ve.\" The Cityowned land includes 240acre statedesignated preserve southwest of the la ke called Griffy Woods Nature Preserve. The Cityowned portion of Griffy is under the control of the City of Bloomington Utilities Services Board. An agreement between the Utilities Board and the City's Board of Parks and Recrea tion allows for the Board of Pa rks and Recreation to manage Griffy. Indiana University owns land at Griffy Woods south of Cityowned property called the \"Indiana University Research and Teaching Preserve\" (IURTP). Established in 2001, the 185acre IURTP provides a field station for scientists and students to study and observe fundamental environmental processes as they occur in the natural world. Research at IURTP is wideranging and multidisciplinary, including topics such as periodical cicadas, community dynamics of microbes, soilborne pathogens and tree recruitment and effects of exotic grasses on native communities. Teaching at the preserve ranges from grade school classes to university courses such as \"The City as an Ecosystem,\" \"The Biology of Birds\" and \"Silviculture.\" Situated next to residential nei ghborhoods and the Indiana Univ ersity golf course, Griffy provides deer with ideal edge ha bitat. Ideal habitat, paired w ith protection from predators, translates into many deer. Research by IU scientists suggests that deer may be 13 times more numerous at Griffy than they are at other nearby forests. The density of deer in Griffy Woods is having widespread, potentially irreversible, ecosystem effects. 87 ECOSYSTEM EFFECTS OF DEER OVERBROWSING When it comes to forest ecosystems, deer tend to function as 2003) or \"ecosystem engineers,\" able to affect cascades of changes throu ghout a forest that reshape forest structure and composition. High levels of deer browsing can kill or reduce the size of plants, inhibit forest regeneration, redirect forest succession , facilitate invasive plant species, alter nutrient and carbo n cycling and reduce food reso urces and habitat for other wildlife. But, that's not all. Deer herbivory can also: Reduce species richness, evenness and diversity; Reduce the presence of seedlings and saplings of trees and othe r woody species; Reduce ground cover of spring ep hemerals and other herbaceous s pecies; Increase soil compaction, er osion and sediment runoff; Reduce leaf litter depth; Increase the presence of plants deer don't like. Once browsere sistant species are established, they can minimize the reestablishment of lessbrow se resistant species through physical competition a nd/or chemical interference; Reconfigure the forest understory in an \"alternate stable state \" that is resistant to the reestablishment of originally dominant species (Stromayer and Warren 1997); and Shrink habitat, reduce food resources and lower survival rates for ground and shrub nesting birds. Especially vulnerable are birds such as the ovenbird, wood thrush and Acadian flycatcher all species that appear to be declining in the Midwest. In a study of mature deciduous woodlands in Indiana, Purdue scientists observed that average daily survival rates for wood thrush and Acadian flycatcher nests were significantly lower on sites experiencing heavy deer browsing (MacGowan and Weeks 1997). 17 17 Additionally, in studies of fore sts heavily browsed by deer, sc ientists have observed that species richness declined significantly for intermediatecanopy nesting birds (d eCalesta 1994). Similarly, understory and mid story nesters are lower in heavily browsed sites, with some spe cies completely absent. For birds that are successful in fledging young in areas experiencing heavy herbi vory, those birds fa ce a higher risk of predation as they travel further from the nest site to seek adequate food and cover (Casey and Hein 1983). Wood thrushes suffer significantly from deer overbrowsing. V. Wilkins 88 DEER HERBIVORY AT GRIFFY The damaging effects of deer bro wsing are apparent at Griffy. Years of observation suggest that there have been longterm d eclines of many plant species a t Griffy and an increase in unpalatable native species (such as pawpaw and spicebush) and n onnative invasives (such as bush honeysuckle, multiflora rose and privet). It is also ap parent that deer browsing is significantly compromising the regeneration of native tree seed lings and saplings, which represent the next generation of canopy trees. The 2008 Griffy Lake Nature Preserve Master Plan observed that deer herbivory and trampling was having a particula rly deleterious effect in the M esic Upland Forest and Floodplain Forest (pp. 5758). G riffy's Mesic Upland Forest is over 700 acres and is known as the climax community in the process of ecological succession . The Mesic upland is considered of high natural quality, marked by low levels of disturbance, few exotic species and many large trees, such as oaks, maples and beech (Plan , pp. 4445). In contrast, the 135 acres of Floodplain Forest is characterized by the presence of trees along a stream and a dense herbaceous understory. Periodic flooding tends to selec t for early successional plants. The Floodplain Forest c ontains extensive pockets of degraded areas due to the presence of exotic species such as garlic mustard, privet, multiflora rose and Japanese stiltgrass ( Plan, pp. 4344). In fact, over the last five years, Japanese stil tgrass has gone from a significant, but relative ly minor, invader in the floodp lain to the most dominant species forming nearly 100% cov er in many areas (Shelton, un published data). Other studies have shown that an interaction between deer and Japanes e stiltgrass leads to a shift toward an alternate stable state of near complete dominance by stiltgrass (Baiser et al. 2008). The Griffy Master Plan called for a study to determine the effects of deer browse. Th e Plan specifically called for research using \"exclosure plots to dete rmine whether there is an overabundance of deer at the sit e, and how the plant communitie s respond when the pressure of presumed overabundance of deer is removed.\" The Plan further advised that, \"[i]t may be necessary to introd uce population controls in the future to reduce the number of deer and their effects o n the site.\" (pp. 5758). Since 2005, scientists at the IU Research and Teaching Preserve (IURTP) have been studying the effects of deer on the Griffy ecosystem. Led by D r. Angie Shelton, the IURTP team constructed exclosures designed to keep deer out, but allo w other planteaters in. The IURTP team used 15 exclosures (15m x 15m) and 15 control pl ots to measu re both herbaceous and woody vegetation inside and outside the fenced areas. The results of the exclosure studies indicate that deer herbivory is: 1) decreasin g native vegetative diversity; 2) encouraging the growth of invasive species and native plants unpalatable to deer; 3) severely compromising the regeneration of native trees and spri ng ephemerals; and 4) causing soil compaction and potential changes to soil microorganisms. 89 fenced forest plot open forest plo t A. Trees and Other Woody Plants One of the most apparent effects of herbivory is the way it sha pes the regeneration of tree and other woody species. Native trees at Griffy include: oaks ( white, red, black, and red), hickories (shagbark, bitternut), red cedar, black gum, beech, dogwood, elms (American and slippery), cherry, sassafras, ash (white and black), walnut, Ohio buckeye, cottonwood, black will ow, musclewood and pawpaw. Nontree prominent species include sh, virburnum grape. Nonnative woody species include multiflora rose, privet, honeysuckle and barberry. In five years of deer exclosure, the results are stark: inside the exclosure - the area inaccessible to deer - there wer e 705 trees or shrubs of 44 spe cies. Outside the exclosures, there were 470 individuals of 30 species. In the oldest exclosu re, where deer have been excluded for seven years, the results are even more dramatic: 190 woody plants and 15 species were counted inside the fence, and 31 woody plants and 7 species were counted outside the fence. Photographs inside (left) and outside (right) a deer exclosure constructed in 2005 in Griffy Woods, showing a marked different in the community of trees and shrubs. Photos by Angie Shelton. 90 Woody Plant Density and Diversity In four years of deer exclusion, the density and diversity of woody plant species has increased inside the exclosures and severely declined in the de eraccessible control plots. Of 292 tree seedlings/saplings measured by IURTP scientists, over 80% occurred within the exclosures. Tree seedlings palatable to deer such as ash, hickory, sassafras, beech, dogwood, sugar maple and musclewood have been observed only inside the deer exclosures. None of these native tree species have been observed by the IURTP team outside the exclosures.18 These tree seedlings and saplings represent the next generation of canopy trees. Woody Plant Height Tree seedlings less than 12\" i n height are typically first year seedlings, which have ex tremely high mortality due to fungal pathogens in the s oil and other factors like browsing. Plants over 12\" in height are considered viable new recruits. Since the exclosures were constructed, 90 new tree recruits at least 12\" in height have been observed inside the exclosures and only eight recruits were observed outside the exclosures. All eight recruits in the control plots were clonal pawpaw seedlings. B. Herbaceous Species Herbaceous plants are plants with nonwoody stems, whose aboveground growth usuall y dies back in winter. Included in this class are spring ephemerals such as wild ginger, squirrel corn, roundleaved ragwort, tr illium, jackinthepulpit, such as tri llium, jackinthepulpit, delphinium and mayapple are smaller, flower less and are less numerous outside of the exclosures, suggesting that deer browsing is compromising the survival of these species. 18 The IURTP team did not observe regeneration of oaks, cherries or walnuts either inside or outside the deer exclosures. All of these trees have high wildlife value. IU sc ientists surmise that the lack of generation of these trees could be du e to fruit and nut predators and recruit ment limitation from other sources such as fungal pathogens or poor mast years. This lack of regeneration might also mean that it takes these species longer to recover. Shagbark hickor y - a species not regenerating at trillium V. Wilkin sV. Wilkin s V. Wilkin s 91 C. Indicator Species Another way to assess the effect o f deer on forest ecosystems i s to monitor \"indicator species,\" common plant species that tend to provide early signals of deer overabundance. Scientists studying deer impacts on Indiana State parks identif ied three indicator species, whose size is related to deer density: sweet cicely, white bane berry and jackinthepulpit (Parker and Webster 1997). The m inimum mean height of these species indicates the point at which a plant community is in balance with the population of whitetailed deer. Drops below these levels signal that the deer population is beginning to negatively a ffect the plant community. The average height of the indicators in a mesic closed canopy forest community in Indiana in the absence of excessive deer browsing is as follows: white baneberry - 25 cm sweet cicely - 42 cm jackinthepulpit - 37. Dr. Shelton's recent research at Griffy Woods indicates the hei ghts of these three species are substantially smaller than these levels, even inside the deer exclosures. In addition, these species were rare to absent in the deer exclosures in plant surveys from 2009 to 2012. However, these three specie s are significantly taller and more numerous inside the fences, indicating that they are beginning to recover from the effects of deer browsing. The slow recovery of these species s uggests that the effect of deer browsing at Griffy Woods is extreme and plant popula tions are threatened.

Shelton D. Soil and Mycorrhizae An overabundance of deer can adversely affect soils. A reduction of plants may change soil nutrients, organic matter and th e number of roots; deer droppin gs can trigger nutrient pulses; trampling can cause soil compaction and both vegetative cover shifts and trampling can affect soil microorganisms su ch as mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria, which aid in nutrient uptake by plants and decompo sition of organic matter. Griffy is showing signs of soil compaction. After only two years of fencing, soil inside exclosures is significantly less compacted than soil in control plots. It is unclear whether this is due to direct effects of deer such as trampling or indirect effects such as increased growth of plant roots that loosen soil. 93 E. Invasives An overabundance of deer can also encourage the spread of invas ive plants (Baiser et al. 2008; Duguay et al. 2011). Where d eer are overabundant, the forest floor tends to be dominated by exotic invasives th at deer avoid eating, such as garlic mustard and Japanese stilt grass. Invasives can outcompete some natives and may come to dominate forest environments. We can see this happening at Griffy. Outside the research exclosures, the floor is dominated by the invasive exotic Japanese stiltgrass. Inside the exclosure, the stiltgrass is present, but the ar ea is dominated by tall native plants such as winged Verbesina, goldenrods and Inside Exclosure: Domi nation by Tall Natives A. Shelton A. Shelton 94 PELLET COUNTS While deer are difficult to count, the abundance of deer feces gives an indication of relative densities and deer usage of an area (Neff 1968). In the spring of 2011, Dr. Shelton c ounted deer pellet piles in the areas surrounding each of the exclosures at Griffy and at two other forested areas owned by IURTP- Moores Creek, a secondary growth forest on the northwestern edge of Lake Monroe, and Lilly Dickey Woods, a secondary growth and old growth forest located north of Nashville in Brown County. Hunting is not permitted on either property, but the properties are located adjacent to areas where hunting is permitted. Using a line transect method to avoid biases due to topography that can affect deer behavior and movement patterns, Shelton counted all pellet pile s within a 4 m belt centered on multiple transect lines, resulting in 1,664m 2 surveyed within a total area of 3600m2. Compared to the other properties surveyed, very high densities of deer pellets were found at Griffy. In fact, the density of deer pellets at Griffy was 13 times higher than the other sites. On average, there were 29 pellet piles per plot at Griff y compared to an average of three or fewer pellet piles per plot at the other sites. Signi ficantly, the maximum number of pellet piles found in a Griffy plot was 95, while the maximum n umber of piles found in a plot at one of the other sites was six (Shelton 2011). Courtesy of A. SheltonA. Shelton Griffy Woods Moores Creek Lilly Dickey Woods 95 THE UNDERSTORY STORY: INVASIVES AND PLANTS DEER DON'T LIKE To the casual observer, Griffy w oods looks green; however, it is much altered. In a healthy forest with low deer impact, the understory will have a wide va riety of plants that deer like (such as trillium and oak) and don't like (such as spicebush). At Griffy, the forest floor is largely depleted of the native p lants and trees deer like to ea t and the understory is overwhelmingly marked by the present of exotic invasive species and by native plants that are unpalatable to deer. Above: Predominance of Japanese stiltgrass at Griffy. Above: Virtually the only noninvasive native plants found in the Gr iffy understory are the plants that deer don't like, such as spicebush and pawpaw. To uring Griffy, an IDNR biologist characterized The above image depicts pawpaw predominance at Griffy. 96 PROTECT GRIFFY - REDUX In 2000, thousands of community members, students and IU facult y joined together to save Griffy from the encroachment of a planned golf course. Called, the \"Protect Griffy Alliance,\" the movement was successful: the golf course plan was scrapped and the IU Research and Teaching Preserve was established soon thereafter. Today, the community is at another \"Protect Griffy\" juncture. The research by Dr. Shelton and the IURTP team indicates that t he deer population at Griffy Woods is far higher than other c omparable forests and that this density is severely degrading forest biodiversity. Left unchecked, deer browsing poses the possibility of producing an \"alternate stable state\" a condition in which a forest would never return to its natural state, even if browsing pressure were diminished by a permanent reduction of deer densities. While the 2008 Griffy Master Plan pointed out many nega tive environmental effects of herbivory and that it \"may be necessary to introduce population controls in the future to reduce the number of deer and their effects on the si te,\" the Task Force advises that the time to implement population controls is now. Thinning the deer herd in the interest of ecosystem restoration is not a new practice. Indiana State Parks have been engaging in deer reduction effort s since the 1990s, after biologists, naturalists and othe rs observed that an overabundan ce of deer was stripping the forest understory and inhibiting the regeneration of native and many herbaceous species. So extensive was the damage at State Parks, that in 1995, the Indiana State Legislature passed a law requiring the IDNR to reduce deer herd sizes in parks sustaining ecological damage (\u00a71422613). To measure the effect of deer re duction on plant communities, Purdue biologists established permanent vegetative plots throughout the parks in 1996. These plots revealed that State parks without any for m of deer management showed evidence of fewer tree seedlings and shrubs, lower percent cover of herbaceous species and higher percent cover of unpalatable species (Webster and Parker 1997). More than a decade later, these plots were resampled to determ ine if vegetative communities in State parks have recovered following years of hu nting. Evidence suggests that they have. From 1996 to 2010, herbaceous percent cover, woody stem density and species richness, evenness and di versity increased in hunted St ate parks. In this period, mean percent cover of tree seedlings increased from 2% to 14%; cover of lilaceous species increased by 73% and cover of exotic species decreased by 8% (Jenkins 2011, p. 18). A closer look at neighboring State parks reveals even more dram atic recovery. Griffy is part of the Brown County Hills Section of the Highland Rim Natural R egion, as are the Brown County, McCormick's Creek and Spring Mill State parks. These S tate parks commenced closelycontrolled hunting in the 1990s, with Brown County bein g the first to do so in 1993. When these three parks were resampled in 2010, scientists foun d that vegetative cover had increased significantly. In Brown County, the percent cover increased from 6% to 34%; at McCormick's Creek, the percen t cover increased from 26% to 5 0%; at Spring Mill, cover increased from 43% to 68% (Jenkins 2011, p. 19). 97 RECOMMENDATIONS The comparative experience of State parks indicates that reduci ng the deer herd leads to the recovery of forests. The que stion for our community is to h ow best accomplish this goal? Because deer damage at Griffy is widespread, biologists advise that a substantial number of deer should be culled in an effort to restore forest health. If a significant number of deer are not culled, those tha t remain will browse new shoot s and the effort will be ineffective for plant restoration. Because a sizable number of deer should be culled, the Task Force recommends sharpshooting as an initial deer reductio n strategy.19 Sharpshooting is more efficient than hunting and can reduce the deer herd quickly with minimal suffering to the deer. U se of sharpshooting has proven effective at lowering deer densities and increasing plant height, vegetative cover and bio diversity in Chicagoarea forest preserves (Etter et al. 2 001). While other communities do use regulated hunting to reach deer density and ecosystem restoration goals, hunting is less efficient than sharpshooting and it would take longer for Griffy to reach rest oration goals. Indeed, after years of hunting, one forest pre serve in Nebraska took 10 years to reach its ecosystem restoration goals (Hygnstrom et al. 2011). Because evidence of \"reverse succession\" is already occurring at the Griffy L ake Nature Preserve, sharpshoo ting is the most effective and humane way to accomplish eco system restoration. All deer cu lled through sharpshooting should be donated to the local food bank and its partners. If sharpshooting is not feasible due to cost or other considerations, the Task Forc e recommends that the deer herd at Griffy be reduced through managed hunting. I. SHARPSHOOTING - INITIAL REDUCTION Sharpshooting is conducted by trained personnel authorized by t he IDNR. Shooting is usually performed from an elevate d position to ensure the shot is aimed at the ground and not toward buildings or in the air. Deer are shot in the head o r neck to ensure a quick death. The least visible sharpshooting efforts are conducted at night, over bait and using a silencer. Baiting causes deer to become acclimated to a site, and conduct ing the effort at night reduces the visibility of the practice. The use of silencers keeps the effort quiet and serves to lessen the trauma to nearby d eer as it does not alert them t o what is going on around them. When deer are not aware of sharpshooting, they are not f rightened and therefore less likely to flee the management site, making the whole effor t more effective. At present, State law allows onl y IDNR, federal wildlife agents or an individual permitted by IDNR, to use silencers and jackl ighting (IC \u00a7142267). IDNR does not provide sharpshooting services; however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) does provide these serv ices. The USDA APHIS has a long history of conducting sharpshooting efforts in forests a nd in urban environments, including management at the Monroe County Airport. APHIS agents receive extensive 19 The number of deer that might be taken if sharpshooting is approved is a matter of ongoing discussion between Parks and Recreation staff and the USDA. 98 firearms training and usually perform this service at a cost le ss than that of private wildlife management firms. To review the feasibility of sharpshooting at Griffy, in early 2012, the Task Force chair, Dr. Shelton and staff from Bloomingt on Parks and Rec reation met wit h IDNR biologists and Dr. Joe Caudell, a Wildlife Disease Biologist from USDA APHIS and a wildlife professor at Purdue. Caudell advised that Griffy is suitable for a sharpshooting effort and that the effort should be restricted to governmentowned property so that local government maintains maximal control over the effort. Here is how it would work: Winter - The effort would be con ducted in the winter, when deer are motivated to travel to a food source and afte r which time young have been we aned. Baiting - Deer would be baited c ontinuously on Griffy land befo re the effort commenced. Costs of the effort cou ld be reduced if City staff p rovided baiting services. Night and sound suppression - To minimize visibility, the effor t should be conducted at night and with soundsuppression devices. Safety and clusters - Deer are s hot only when circumstances are safe (i.e., no non target animals in the removal zone) and fewer than approximatel y nine deer are present to prevent educating the deer. Twopronged approach - Most of t he shooting would occur from a tree stand over bait; however, USDA staff would also shoot from motor vehicles, where appropriate using thermal imaging and nightvision goggles to determine if an animal is a non target species. Female deer prioritized - Most shots are taken on a firstoppor tunity basis; however, when possible, antlerless deer should be prioritized to reduce the reproductive potential of the population. Diminishing Returns - The first few days of a sharpshooting eff ort are always more effective in drawing the greatest number of deer; over time, the numbers dwindle and the effort becomes more expensive. Lead Fragmentation - To limit lead fragmentation, deer should culled by placement of shot to the cranium or uppe r neck (Stewart and Veverka 2011) . At present, lead free bullets tend to be less precise and stand a greater chance of passing through targets and striking a nontarge t animal or object (Caudell 2012). Notice is given to adjacent prop erty owners before the practice begins. Sharpshooting is a multiyear e ffort that requires State oversight. To encourage plant regeneration, biologists advise that it is necessary to spend t wo or three years using sharpshooting as part of a conce rted deer reduction effort; aft er that time, it is necessary to maintain herd management either through sharpshooting or some o ther lethal means. Any sharpshooting effort require s approval and a permit from th e IDNR ( See \"Management Alternatives\"). If the City so requests, Dr. Caudell advises t hat he is willing to train local law enforcement to conduct s harpshooting at Griffy. 99 Ordinance Changes The City prohibits the discharge of a firearm anywhere within t he corporate boundaries of Bloomington (BMC \u00a714.20.020) and p rohibits hunting at the Griff y Lake Nature Preserve (BMC \u00a711.08.300). However, City code also anticipates the nee d for hunting as a management tool, stating that \"hu nting and trapping may be permissible if used as an authorized management tool when the situation warrants and permission for this action is granted by the board of park commissioners.\" (BMC \u00a711.08.300). While this provision does not detail the type of weapon th at would be approved for a mana gement effort at Griffy, when read with the general City wide prohibition on the dischar ge of firearms anywhere within the City limits, it is likely that a sharpshooting effor t would require and amendment to the City code. While a change to City code may be necessary, the decision whether to implement a deer management prog ram at Griffy is up to the Bloomington Board of Parks and Recreation. The City owns a portion of land at Griffy that is outside of th e Bloomington corporate boundaries. If a sharpshooting effort is conducted in this area , a change to local code may not be necessary. Similarly, if the effort is conduced by USDA APHIS, a change to code may or may not be necessary. APHIS i s authorized by federal law to discharge firearms; however, APHIS defers to the wis hes of the local community. Som e communities have required a change to local code before APHIS is allowed to enga ge in sharpshooting. Notably, any management performe d by an entity other than the f ederal government or local law enforcement (for examp le, White Buffalo) would requir e a change to the Bloomington Municipal Code. Measurement Continued monitoring of herbaceous and woody vegetation is crit ical to a sciencebased management approach to deer at Gr iffy. Measures of forest recov ery would include tree seedling regeneration, increased height at flowering of herbaceous plants, plant species richness and herbaceous plant cover. Previous monitoring of these species by IURTP scientists was funded by a grant that will expire soon. City and County government should work with Preserve staff to help secure funding for this monito ring effort. Funding the Effort The Griffy Lake Nature Preserve is a public resource enjoyed by all community residents and held in trust for future gen erations. For this reason, the cost of management should be borne by those holding this land in the public trust. The Task Force recommends that the City fund the sharpshooting effort. Partnerships : Because deer do not know humanimposed political boundaries a nd freely move from city to IU to r esidential to property within county jurisdiction, the Task Force suggests that Monroe County might contribute funds f or the effort. Residents could also help by making private donations to the Pa rks Board non reverting capital fund via the P arks Foundation. A deer reducti on effort would be strengthened by cooperation from IU. Grants: The City should also explore g rant funding opportunities for the effort. 100 Donation of Venison All deer culled through the sharpshooting effort should be donated to the local food bank. One of the greatest needs in hun ger relief is access to highqu ality protein. If a small deer provides 40 pounds of meat and one pound of meat can provide fi ve meals, that's 200 meals per deer. A dedication of public dollars for a sharpshoot ing effort would work to both restore ecological integrity and to improve the human condition; it would be both an environmental and social service good. Ancillary Effects: Reduced Neighborhood Deer and Reduced Deer\u00ad Vehicle Collisions A sharpshooting effort at Griffy may have an effect on deer abundance in surrounding neighborhoods and deervehicle collisions on nearby roadways. D eer move freely between Griffy and adjacent neighborhood s. A cull at Griffy may reduce deer abundance in residential neighborhoods proxim ate to the preserve. Deer also move freely from Griffy across roads. As indicated by deervehicle collision data, Stat e Road 46 Bypass is the site of most auto collisions with deer; th is is likely a function of tr affic volume as much as it is a function of deer abundance. Some studies suggest that sharpsho oting may reduce the number of deervehicle collisions on area roadways. In a study where deer herds were reduced by 54%, 72%, and 76% via 78%, respectively (DeNicola and Williams 2008). A sharpshooting effort may reduce the number of collisi ons with deer on the Bypass and potentially prevent injury. II. SHARPSHOOTING OR MANAGED HUNTING \u00ad\u00ad MAINTENANCE Any deer reduction effort at Gri ffy requires maintenance to kee p up with annual recruitment of deer and immigrat ion from surrounding areas. It will be up to local decision makers to determine if they prefer to maintain the herd through sharpshooting or through managed hunting, or some other m eans. Should the City and Parks Board wish to implement a managed hunt, the guidelines offered in the \"Neighb orhood Deer\" chapter of this report might provide guidance.20 Should local officials wish to pursue a managed hunt at Griffy, the efficacy of the effort might be discerned by looking at measures employed by Indiana State parks. At State parks, success of deer management effort s is determined by looking at vegetation, the number of deer harvested per square mile and hunter success. Hunter success is a reference point used by biologists to determine whether a hunting effort is eff ective. In many State parks, hunter success is set at 0.1 fo r archery hunting. That means that if 1 in 10 hunters kill a deer, then the State park can sk ip hunting the following year. However, if hunter success is greater than 10%, this success po ints to the need for additional hunting efforts the following year. If a managed hu nt is implemented at Griffy, t hose overseeing the hunt will have to determine a Griffyspecific metric. 20 The requirements include, but a re not limited to: a Cityissue d permit; hold harmless agreements; proficiency tests; rules on permissible hunting equipment; required use of tree stands; hunter accountability rules; mandatory hunter orientat ion; limitations on time and pl ace; \"EarnaBuck\" incen tive; rules for field dressing and tracking a wounded deer; right of the City to revo ke permits; and an en couragement of hunters to donate meat to the food bank. 101 MEASURING AND MONITORING In order to evaluate the effectiveness of any deer management p lan and to adapt any plan to changing circumstances, relia ble and accurate data is critical. The work of the Task Force was constrained in many ways by a lack of good data. Going forw ard, it is important to implement a system to better monitor deer herd trends and deer impacts. Monitoring should be repeated on an annual or biannual basis so that tren ds in the system are evaluated and appropriat e responses developed. What follows is a series of suggestions for monitoring and measuring. Given the complexity of human, wildlife, and ecosystem factors shaping the \"deer iss ue,\" it is strongly suggested the City adopt a combination of these approaches. 1. DEER MANAGEMENT TEAM Again, the \"deer issue\" is not going away anytime soon, and what works at the time of this report might not work a few year s from now. The Task Force reco mmends that the City establish a permanent Deer Management Team to annually review data on deerauto collisions, damage complaints by property owners and impacts on natural communities. If elected officials choose to imple ment recommendations offered i n this report, a management team will be needed to oversee and administer the re commendations. The composition of any team will depend on which recommendations lo cal officials choose to implement. However, the team might be composed of representatives from law enforcement, wildlife experts, animal welfare and hunters. 2. TRACK DEER\u00adVEHICLE COLLISIONS/MILLION MILES TRAVELED At present, deervehicle collisions on City streets are not actively tracked nor analyzed on a routine basis. To generate the deervehicle collision maps cont ained in this report, the Task Force worked with City G IS and Engineering. To better identify roadway stretches where deervehicle collisi ons are problematic, the Task Force recommends active monitoring of deervehicle collisi ons. To meaningfully assess whether deervehicle colli sions are occurring as a funct ion of traffic volume or as a function of deer overabundance, we suggest that data be normalized for traffic volume. For example, while some of the most heavilytraveled roads, such as State Road 46, experience the most deervehicle collisions, it may be the case that when the crash data is normalized for traffic volume, a neighborh ood street may actually experien ce more deervehicle collisions per million miles trave led. Knowing where crashes oc cur because deer are overabundant would help guide mi tigation efforts. As this coll ision data is tracked over time, it will be up to transportation experts to decide which mitigation techniques work best for any given stretch of road. 21 21 Most techniques involve reducing deer along the roadway through fencing or lethal means, modifying motorist behavior, mod ifying deer behavior and roadway planning . However, a number of studies have tested what works and what does not. One technique that does not work is the iconic yellow \"Deer Crossing\" sign. 102 3. DEER COMPLAINT SYSTEM Set up an online and/or phone site where citizens can call in or log complaints. Local government could use the location and number of complaints as a metric for deer problems. Citizens need to have a way for sharing issues they are experie ncing with deer. This information is also needed for monitoring the social and econom ic dimension of people deer interaction in Bloomington and Monroe County. Data will be used for evaluating the magnitude, nature and location of the problem and devise targeted interventions. Minimal information to be collected include: date, name and contact inf ormation of person logging the complaint, description and l ocation of the issue. A complai nt log system could be subject to organized efforts to i nflate the actua l problem. How ever, individual and place specific information can be used to control for this. A nonanonymous logging system is also advisable for facilitating community engagement when discussing and devising solutions to the complaints. The City's uReport tool, along with web and phone options, should provide sufficient aven ues for citizen reportage. 4. CITIZEN SCIENTISTS Enlist citizen observers to estimate deer density. For example, at 8 a.m. for one or, ideally, a few days, ask people to record the number of deer they see in their back yard and log the observation with the City or Cou nty. This could become an annua l event providing information useful for estimating trends in population changes and distribution. There are various programs involving citizens in scientific pro jects; see e.g. Cornell's ebird initiative (http://ebird.org ) , http://www.scientificameric an.com/citizenscience/ ). Bloomington City Department of Pa rks and Recreation offers a Ci tizen Scientist Certification ( http://bloomington.in.gov/citizenscientist ). This group could be involved in facilitating deer and deer impact monitoring. These signs are so com mon these days that the signs become \"bac kground\" and are not marked in the mind of the driver. Drivers ignore the s igns. As a consequence, the sig ns don't do much to reduce deervehicle collisions. Signs that do appear to be effective are enhan ced signs that are installed f or a short period of time, usually during the OctoberDecember rut season when the majorit y of deervehicle collisions occur. 103 5. PELLET COUNTS Conduct censuses of deer droppings as a measure of deer density , as is commonly done in many studies. This could be organized as part of a citizen scie ntist program and could take place at the same time. 6. LEVERAGE IU RESOURCES Enlist IU courses to conduct res earch and/or surveys to estimate densities, for example, courses in biology or SPEA. 7. LEVERAGE EXISTING ON\u00adTHE\u00adGROUND GOVERNMENT STAFF Use City or postal workers who walk (or drive) regular routes o n a daily or weekly basis and ask them to make note of the number of deer sightings they experience. 8. MONITOR VEGETATION Monitor vegetation for browse da mage, especially in City parks that would be accessible without permission. Potential pr oblems are, e.g., quantifying d eer damage separate from other stressors (e.g., drought), density of deerpreferred spec ies and when the browsing damage occurred. Expert involveme nt from biologists and foreste rs could provide valuable feedback. 9. REMOTE CAMERAS Use existing remote cameras to estimate deer densities. 10. ANALYZE ROAD KILL DATA City of Bloomington Animal Care a nd Control currently tracks re quests for pick up of dead deer. Usually, these deer have been involved in a collision wit h a vehicle. As current deer vehicle collision data tracks c ollisions triggering $1,000 or m ore in property damage to a car owner, this data could provi de additional insight into the number of deer that are being hit by cars. 104 EDUCATION/OUTREACH PLAN Objective: To effectively inform and educat e City of Bloomington and Monro e County residents and other stakeholders of any la wmakerapproved recommendations regarding deer management including, but not limited to: Gardening and Living Humanely with Urban Deer Deer Management Techniques: Effi cacy and Current Regulations Facts and Myths about Deer Ordinance Changes as Applicable Strategy : Once officials have decided on deer management strategies, a comprehensive communication action plan should be developed, implemented and assigned to a staff member(s) or other responsible parties.

Local food reduces food miles traveled and fosters the provisio n of affordable, healthy food for all. Numerous local gardeners participate in gleaning and \"plantarow\" i nitiatives in an effort to help feed area hungry. We h ave made changes to our land use laws, established community gardens and orchards and worked to support the work of local farmers. Despite these adv ances, a number of City residents advise that their a bility to grow their own food is compromised by an overabundance of deer within City limits. That's not entirely surprising: on average, a deer will consume between 4.5 and 11 pounds of forage per day. From the beginning of the Task F orce's work, local growers have been urging the group to consider the influence of deer on urban farms and community gar dens. The City's Commission on Sustainability sent the Task Force a formal recom mendation pointing out that the deer population is impa iring the community's ability t o encourage and expand local food production. The recommendation expressed concern tha t \"consumption and destruction of food and food pla nts will discourage many people from maintaining such gardens.\" (BCOS recommendation to Task Force, December 14, 2010 ). Similarly, the Bloomington Food Policy Council ex pressed concern that \"consump tion of food and food plants by deer will discourage p eople from maintaining such gar dens at a time when it is economically and environmentally beneficial to encourage reside nts to start and expand vegetable and fruit gardens.\" (Food Policy Council communicati on, October 2011). Both communications requested that the Task Force take into consider ation the \"competition between deer and human food needs\" in making its recommendations.22 To better understand the experie nce of local growers, the Task Force hosted a special meeting dedicated to urban agric ulture. Growers told the Task Force that they had experienced more deer damage to crops in recent years and felt that this increase was related to deer abundance, althou gh rabbits, woodchucks, birds and raccoons also eat their fair share of vegetables. While all agreed that raising fence height limits within the City limits would help, the group ack nowledged that fencing comes at a considerable cost and may not be affordable to all. Fen cing also shifts deer to yards of neighbors who may be trying to grow their own food. 23 22 Indeed, when asked what would be evidence of a successful deer management program, 45% of city and 37% of county respondents to the Task Force's survey responded that \"reduced loss of garden food\" would be an indicator of success. 23 Indiana farmers have a long history of dealing with deer damag e to crops. IDNR works with farmers to explore hunting and barrier solut ions. The IDNR may issue a spe cial outofseason Deer Control Permit to a 107 DEER AND FOOD: ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE While much discussion has pivoted around residents' ability to grow their own food, deer and sustainability dovetai l in another way: deer are food. Unlike factory farmed meat that travels thousands of miles to ge t from farm to table and where animals are raised in deplorable conditions, deer meat is local and it's free of synthetic hormones. The deer from which the meat is derived lived out their lives in a freeranging environment, not in pens or cages. Venison is a highquality, lowf at source of protein. Venison can reasonably be compared to lean, grassfed beef. A pound of highquality beef is about $7/pound. If a small deer renders about 40 pounds of meat, that is $280 worth of protein. At time when local food insecurity is increasing and the community is placing an everg reater prioritization on local sustenance, deer as a food sourc e should be examined more closely. Bloomingtonians can already grow their own chickens and slaughter those chickens on ce the birds are no longer productive. Cultivating the harvest and consumption of local de er seems to be a good next step in strengthening the commun ity's commitment to local, heal thy food. Indeed, \"deer hunting for locavores\" is a growing movement (Farrell 2009). Novice urban hunters are forming classes and clubs to learn skills that a few generations ago were passed down from parent to child. Classes such as the Locavore Hunter and organizations such as The Bull Moose Hunting Society (chapters in San Francisco, Washington, DC and Austin, Texas) teach urbanites about deer and how to hunt. Rece nt years have also seen publications such as The Beginner's Guide to Hunting Deer for Food (Landers 2011) and Backyard Deer Hunting: Converting Deer to Dinner for Pennies per Pound (Smith 2012). Similarly, Purdue offers ven ison workshops in several Indiana c ounties teaching participants proper techniques s uch as: field dressing, butcher ing and proper storage and preservation of meat. However, viewing deer as a food s ource is not just about \"going local.\" It's about getting food to community members experie ncing hunger. In Monroe County, 17% of all households and 50% of lowincome households reported having pro blems paying for food (SCAN 2012). From May 2011 to M ay 2012, the Consumer Price Ind ex (CPI) for all food rose by 2.8%, but the CPI for meat rose by 5.4% (USDA 2012). In its Annual Food Patron Survey, almost 67% of patrons of Mother Hubbard's Cupboard indi cated that they would like to have more access to meat. farmer who has suffered a minimum financial loss of $500 attrib utable to deer damage that has occurred or is inevitable to occur on a commerc ial crop currently being grown at the time of inspection. Acreage or other contextual considerations may att ach. Permits are issued only o n the recommendation of a IDNR district wildlife biologist. P ermits do not supersede local prohibition s against the discharge of a firearm or bow and arrow. 108 Venison can reasonably be compared to lean, grassfed organic beef. 1 lb. highquality beef = $7/lb. 1lb. venison = 5 meals. Small deer = 40 pounds. _____________ A small deer provides: $280 worth of high quality protein. 200 meals DONATION OF DEER MEAT: A COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP Any deer culled through a Cityfinanced deer reduction effort s hould be donated to the local food bank. Similarly, hunters should be encouraged to don ate deer meat. Donation of deer requires processing of me at at a facility that is licen sed and inspected. The cost of processing is estimated to be about $1.25/pound. Community m embers can help offset the cost of processing by donating to one of the followi ng organizations. Indiana Department of Natural Resources Sportsman's Benevolence Fund Farmers and Hunters Feeding the Hungry (Specify \"IN\u00ad30\" to donate specifically to the Monroe County Chapter .) The number of people that one deer can feed is not trivial: one pound of venison renders about f ive meals and one small deer provides 200 meals. The Task Force's recommendations for lethal action are not recommendations that are made lightly. They are an unfortunate, but necessary, response to a humancreated situation. However, there is some good that can come from this: hungry people can be fed. 109 TIPS FOR LIVING WITH DEER DON'T FEED THE DEER! Improper diets can create health problems for deer, may spread disease and may cause tension among neighbors. See p. 48 for more on why feeding deer is a bad idea. THE ENCOUNTER Deer are not inherently aggressive. Given the choice of \"fight or flight,\" a deer will almost always choose to run away. Like all mothers, a doe may become aggressive if she thinks her young are being threatened. To reduce the likelihood of an unfavorable encounter, there are a few common sense measures we can all take: Never, under any circumstance, approach a deer. Be especially cautious of deer with fawns. Attacks by bucks are rare, but b ucks may become aggressive in \" rut\" season October through December. If you do see a deer, observe it from a distance, preferably fr om inside a structure or vehicle. Keep your pet inside when there is a deer in your yard. 110 DON'T DISTURB THE FAWNS! Fawns are born throughout the sp ring and early summer months. A round that time, concerned residents call animal and wildlife agencies about lon e fawns they find in woods and backyards, assuming these fawns have been orphaned. In the majority of cases, the fawns have not been abandoned. Usually the mother is nearby, a ware and attentive. Except when feeding them, mothers hide their young to avoid attracting predators. If you find a fawn, leave it alone knowing that a concerned and anxious mother is nearby and will take care of the young deer once you leave. To ensure safety of both peopl e and deer, the Joint City of BloomingtonMonroe County Deer Task Force has consulted experts and offers the following tips: Keep children and pets away from the fawn and any other deer. D eer are not inherently aggressive. However, like most mothers, a doe can be come aggressive if she perceives that her young are being threatened. If you suspect a fawn has been orphaned do not attempt to move or feed it. Feeding fawns cow's milk is a common mistake that can kill a fawn. Feeding fawns must be left up to a licensed wildlife rehabilitator. The best way to make sure a fawn is truly orphaned is to check back periodically from a distance where a mother will not see you. Please call Wi ldCare at 3231313 for advice. If maggots are visible on the fawn (usually on its belly or under its tail), the fawn has been alone for at le ast two days and WildCare should be called immediately. If you suspect that a fawn (or a ny deer) has been injured, do n ot attempt to move it. Instead, please call City of Bloom ington Animal Care and Control at 3493492. 111 DRIVING TIPS BE VIGILANT: When you drive, make a hab it of watching from side to side, especially in areas of low visibility or where shrubs or grasses are close to the road. WATCH FOR GROUP BEHAVIOR : Deer tend to travel in groups. If one deer crosses the road, watch for more to follow. Female deer tend to stay together as \"doe groups\" in winter and have young fawns following them in the spring and early summer. Keep in mind that a deer crossing in front of you may double back. OBSERVE DEER CROSSINGS: Always observe deer crossing war ning signs. When approaching a posted area, slow down and maintain a slower speed throu gh these sites. Signs may not always be present where deer may cross. Be aware of typ ical deer habitat such as wooded areas or natural grass fields, and remain particularly alert while traveling on roadwa ys that pass through these kinds of conditions. BE AWARE OF SEASONS: In the fall, bucks are on the mo ve due to rutting, and in some places, hunting seasons. In spring (MayJune), yearlings are seeking new territories. Be ex tra careful driving at these seasons. BE AWARE OF TIME OF DAY: Deer are most active at dusk and dawn. Be watchful, especially during early morning and evening, when wildlife may be moving across roads. USE HIGH BEAMS: At night use high beams when on coming traffic is absent. Slow down and watch for the eyeshine of deer near the road edges. If you see eyes reflecte d in your headlights, slow down immediately. HONK! If you see a deer on the road or making its way onto the road, honk the horn. The sound gives the deer an audible signal to avoid. DON'T SWERVE! If at all possible, do not swerve to avoid wildlife but brake firmly and sound your horn. Animals are easily confused. If you swerve, deer may run into the vehicle rather than away from it. Swerving could mean driving into another vehicle or off the road into poles or fences. 112 Deer\u00ad Away Homebrew Deer are especially repelled by smells that combine mint and rotten eggs. Mix the following in a 1gallon tank sprayer: 2 beaten and strained eggs 1 cup milk, yogurt, buttermilk, or sour milk 2 tsp. Tabasco sauce or cayenne pepper 20 drops essential oil of clove, cinnamon, or eucalyptus, found in small bottles at health food stores 1 tsp. cooking oil or dormant oil 1 tsp. liquid dish soap Top off the tank with water and pump it up. Shake the sprayer occasionally and mist onto dry foliage. One applic ation will last for 2 to 4 wee ks in dry weather. For more homemade recipes, see http://www.deerdeparted.com/deer repellentrecipes.html . FENCING Often the most effective lon gterm solution to exclude deer from individual properties is fencing. Many fence designs using many different materials have been used with success. Generally, with sturdier materials and better construction, less maintenance will be required and the fence will last longer. If fencing the entire area is too expensive, fencing individual plants is effective. See \"Deer Management Alternatives\" fo r suggestions on effective fen cing. REPELLENTS Repellents can be effective to deter deer over a limited time period in a localized area. Repellents do not eliminate brows ing, they only reduce it. When food is scarce, deer may ignore both taste and odor repe llents. There are a variety of r epellents available. Some you can make yourself. Some are commercially available. Hair Bags Sometimes deer are deterred by h uman hair. Try putting bags of human hair in fine mesh bags and hang the bags from area s that are experiencing the heaviest browsing. Bags should be placed in the spring, at least 3' apart and replaced monthly. IDNR recommends protecting hair bags from the elements by putting the bag in a plastic container (like a milk jug) and cutting out the bottom of the jug so the smell of the hair can be emitted. Check with local salons and barbers for free hair! 113 Soap Bars of soap can be used in the same way as hair bags. Suspend strongly scented soap from tree branches or in bags near the damage, again no grea ter than 3' apart. Weathering actually makes the soap more e ffective! (Many people swear by the use of Irish Spring, right.) Bloodmeal Spread within 30\" of the damage, bloodmeal works for a short while, but may attract loca l dogs and other carnivores. Commercial Repellents When considering any chemical repellent, be fully aware of any and all application restrictions. Many commercial repellents are not safe for edible plants. The following is recommended by the IDNR. Hinder\u00ae\u00ad is one of a few deer and rabbit repellents registered for use on edible plants. It may be applied directly to vegetables, field crops, ornamental plants, and fruit trees. Depending upon weather conditions, one application is generally effective for 24 weeks. For areas smaller than 30 acres, the m anufacturer recommends direct application to the entire area. An 810 foot wide strip application is suggested for larger fields. Magic Circle\u00ae\u00ad is considered safe for most vegetable, orchard, and field crops because it is applied to the perimeter of the area to be protec ted. Application is recommended for a 610 foot band around the crop area. Enduranc e is greatly influenced by weather conditions. Reapplication is recommended after heavy rains or dew. Thiram\u00ae is a fungicide that repels the deer by taste. It is sold unde r a number of commercial names including Gufstason 42s. Application is recom mended for dormant trees and shrubs. Ro\u00adpel\u00ae\u00ad may be applied directly to nursery and Christmas trees, orname ntal and flowering trees and plants. It should not be used with edible c rops. Deer\u00adAway\u00ae\u00ad repels deer by both odor and ta ste. Success has been shown in protecting ornamental trees, shrubs, and flower beds. 114 SCARE TACTICS Methods for startling deer might be an effective and economic way to keep deer out of your yard, especially at the first sign of a problem. Strobe lights and noisemakers (su ch as a radio going on and off during the night) while effective, might annoy your neighbors. Motionsensitive lights and sprinklers tend to work as well as other scare devices and are less likely to make enemies of your neighbors. The problem with hazing devices is that they work best in the short term deer eventually acclimate to scare devices, even when the devices are moved occ asionally. Varying the scare devices every week may extend the protection for a longer period. Furthermore, even when placed on a timer, scare devices are indiscriminate and ma y scare away desired wildlife and actually attract others for examples, raccoons a re reported to love to play in motionsensor sprinklers. NEVER attempt to scare away a deer by shooting it with a BB gun, a slingshot, paintball gun or similar device. Doing so is illegal under State law. It is illegal to discharge a firearm within City limits. Noise\u00adbased scare devices must follow the requirements of the City's noise ordinance. 115 DEER\u00adRESISTANT PLANTS Deer prefer certain plants over others. For example, they love hostas, azaleas and arborvitae. By choosing species that are undesirable to deer, y ou can reduce the amount of damage to many ornamental plants . Plants with a bitter or spicy taste, milky sap, or thorny, hairy, or tough leaves and stems are unpalatable to deer. Howev er, no plant is truly \"deer resistant\" deer will browse the best of what's around and th ere is no definite way to predict what deer will or will not eat. However, there are tree s and plants that deer tend not to eat. The following is a working list of deerresistant p lants developed in consultation with the IDNR.V.

By eliminating most pre dators and fragmenting the landscape, humans have upset this balance. Left unchecked, a deer herd can double every thre e years. While this would be bad for humans and local ecosyst ems, it would also be bad for d eer - more deer would compete for resources; more deer would be subject to action by frustrated residents; and more deer would be victims of automobile collisions. Deer are not to blame for this situation - we are. While there is likely no \"eternal return\" to a landscape untouched by human modification, there are many thi ngs humans can do to effect a better balance and to be better stewards of a landscape that includes not just humans and deer, but plants, soils, water, air and all the other critical components of our shared life. However, it is not just up to th e Task Force and government to solve the \"deer issue.\" Citizens have a part to play too. We will all have to work to b etter understand deer biology and behavior and to demystify common misunderstandings. Some o f us will allow hunting access on our land; others will ha ve to help subsidize deer man agement. Some of us will have to drop the overgeneralized and unfounded fear that deer a re aggressive - they are not. Some of us will have to st op feeding the deer - it's not good for the deer. We will all have to recognize that deer are an important part of our shared landscape and that neighborhoods should not be sani tized of deer, simply because t hey are an inconvenience to some. This report envisions deer culling as a necessary component of ecosystem stewardship. It reintroduces human predation into parts of the community where predation has long been absent. We recognize that our recommendations will not please everyone - some will think it goes too far, others, not far enough. These recommendations are the product of a group of volunteers who have done their best to review the science, c onsult with the experts and listen to their community members. We have worked to develop su ggestions that are safe, effective and humane. We have worked to develop recommendation s that are not only in the best interest of humans and our ecosystem, but also in the best interest of deer. When it comes to deer, it's easy to get mad at the Task Force, at government and each other. This is a tough issue with no handy solution. This report is just one step in the ongoing community conversation about how to coexist with community deer. Government officials and residents will decide on how, and if, to move forward with recommendations. Going forward, it is useful to keep in mind that ours is a community where residents actively work to reimagine and redefine their relationship with nature. The deer issue gives us an opportunity to responsibly rede fine this relationship further. 121LITERATURE CITED ALLAN, B, F. Keesing and R.S.

Have seen injured/limp ing deer - a concern. Has impacted ability to garden. See deer about 3 mornings/week Deer cross road near school - a safety concern. Highland Avenue see about 12 deer in a herd Arden Drive - did not have any deer issues until a few years a go. Have installed a 4' fence in back yard, but deer g et in fence and knock it down . Deer not afraid of 95 lb. Lab. Liquid fence helps, but needs to be used often Have noticed more problems in la st 5 years; development seems to have caused a lot of this, taking their habitat (High St., Renwick, Deer Manor, etc.) Even if the community designated an area for deer, it will not make a difference since deer have a high reproductive rate Also coyotes seen in urban areas Deer Park - regular deer population moved as Deer Park develope d, then moved again when Renwick developed Traffic concerns/car accidents Possible social problem of deer s hot by bow but dying in someon e else's yard S. Clifton Ave (High and Hillsid e) - deer jumped through window , bleeding, caused much damage Concerns for young children being outside when doe and fawns pr esent; does won't move (Sheridan) Private property problem E. Hunter - 5 deer living in yar d, concerns about kids being ou tside In Woodstock, have seen as many as 14 deer at a time 135 On Mt. Gilead, see deer 23x/da y; see does, fawns and bucks Concern about auto accidents but otherwise likes seeing them; h abitat seems sufficient See deer by business in town, lik e in the parking lot of Mother Bear's Pizza; see deer in other odd places in City Plant deer resistant plants or fence off plants Enjoys seeing deer; important fo r people to understand other species Supports wolf reintroduction In Renwick, see a herd of ~10; they eat plants In Renwick neighborhood, a doe w as hit by a car, sustained bra in damage and was running into trees and everything else. Very traumatic for kid s and neighbors to witness. Suffering. Police had to shoot. Dogs are a good deterrent. During rut, Renwick resident h ad a standoff with a buck. Hunter previously saw about 8 d eer/week now see about 8 deer/da y On Bethel Lane, can be as many as 4050 deer at a time. Near University Elementary, see groups of 26 deer in yard daily; the deer are eating things they did not eat before; they push through fencing and n etting. Concerned with deercar collisions Does are dropping fawns in lawns Problems for kids walking to bus stops - they encounter deer As deer numbers increase, have noticed a reduction in other spe cies Rock Creek - see more deer Sycamore Knolls - Negative experi ence; herd is growing; does/fawns/bucks, impact gardens Sycamore Knolls - jump fence, use s spray deterrents, plants hos tas for them to eat instead of other plants Browncliff - near Griffy - some positive experiences but negative for gardeners, concerns about auto accidents Moore's Pike/College Mall - nega tive/dangerous deer have knocke d down fence, concerns about gardening, car a ccidents (3 layers of plastic me sh fence, woods near them looks like pics of Griffy Seems to be relat ed to development of Ramsey Farm SE side, positive, natural yard, deer eat some of it, cover som e plants and fence some, enjoy seeing them, recognize that people have altered the environment, other animals eat the plants too, can't exterminate everything that a nnoys us, accept other creatures SE side - High - negative for ga rdening, tree damage, $ for fen cing/deterrents McDoel gardens/S. Rogers - deer are not a problem Own a small woodlot concern f or regeneration of woods, conce rn about Lyme disease Hyde Park - See deer daily, fenc ed garden, hunter - sees more deer in neighborhood than in the woods Take methods to slow traffic to avoid deer collisions 136 Question 2: \"What are the most important criteria the Task Force should consider in making its recommendations: efficacy, safety, deer welfare, cost, community acceptance, other?\" Responses: How do you deal with people who don't want to do anything about deer? Suggest Task Force ID and remove fawns Overpopulation is severe Preservation of human life, property, and diverse ecosystem Cost effective Use electric shock devices (locally produced) Task Force needs to identify the current deer population and figure out what an acceptable number is. Suggest the Task Force develop a citizen input website where pe ople report the deer they see Concern with deertick population and Lyme disease. Templeton neighborhood - smaller lots, many deer, fawns born in yard Humane treatment of deer Quality of life Does it impact business/visitors differently than homeowners? How do fences affect neighborhoods? How did hunting in Brown Co. St. Park work? (worked well - hunt every other year - maintenance) Now seeing return to understory People's attitudes are important ; we have to assume some risk living with wildlife Deer are a symptom of fact that we are not living in harmony, n ot just with deer but with whole environment Must educate people on their pla ce in nature and their role in this situation. If people had a different attitude t oward being part of - not apart from - nature, their choices might be different. Should the Task Force be swayed by attitudes? Annual harvest helps keep herd at a level where they are health y. Community will accept it if they are educated and feel it is in the best inter est of the deer's health. Size of the herd needs to be reduced If hunting increased in county, would that impact deer in city? Are there similarities among the neighborhoods that report prob lems? If development is an issue, may nee d to look at ordinances that allow development. Indicators of efficacy: Fewer si ghtings and less damage to plan ts Indicators: Deer welfare, safety and cost. Cost important, esp ecially in these tight economic times. Question: If culling is recommended, how would the Task Force k now when it has culled enough? May be a need for some kind of count. Maybe som e way to engage residents and encourage them to report deer sighting - a way re sidents can electronically log deer sightings, much like how people catalog birds they see. 137 The Task Force might have to try to quantify deer to garner any sort of community acceptance. Concerned about safety of management option Concerned about keeping people safe from deer Concern for diseases that deer carry as it relates to herd health as it relates to human health Costdamages incurred because of the deer and costs incurred to protect property Veganturnedhunter who has been invited to hunt area around Ti mbercrest for the last couple of years. He has noted an increase in deer in town over the last handful of years. Encourages the Task Force to think of cost efficiency, especial ly in light of current economic climate The Task Force should encourage residents to donate funds to Hu nters and Farmers Feeding the Hungry. Does not want to be taxed to rem ove deer; how to handle the cos ts in an equitable manner Safety Community acceptance - whole range of feelings within one neigh borhood This problem affects some people more than others Where would deer go? Not \"antideer\" just concerned about density, forest regeneration, deer affect ability to live in a sustainable manner 138 APPENDIX IV PUBLIC OPINION SURVEY 139View Summary Browse Responses Filter ResponsesCrosstab ResponsesDownload ResponsesShare Responses Download Create Chart Download Create Chart DownloadJoint City of Bloomington-Monroe County Deer Task Force Community Opinion Survey Edit Design Survey Collect Responses + Add Report Response Summary Active Filter: My New Filter Total: 742 Edit Filtered: 727 Unapply Show this Page Only PAGE: 1 1.

If none, please explain.\" These are stupid choices! \"Right\" or \"too many\" is a non issue. They live with us and are friends, accept them anywhere they choose to try to survive . Obey all canine and cat regulations. 9/16/2011 8:32 AM Open the town to urban Bow Hunting!!! 9/15/2011 8:45 PM Thankfully, we live in an area t hat contains enough \"natual spa ce\" for us to see deer, birds, squirrels, rabbits, etc.. They are a necessary part of t he natural landscape, and their numbers are immaterial. 9/15/2011 6:15 PM There are very many. One group in the small hedgerow behind bin ford. They are increasingly aggressive. Do not l eave when humans appear. Mom d eer with baby rushed porch. 9/15/2011 11:14 AM I love the deer and leave my back yard gates open so the deer can come in and lay under my pine trees. 9/13/2011 9:42 AM There are too many deer. Deer are wild animals and do not belon g in the city. 9/13/2011 9:19 AM I love the deer. They are beautiful creatures! I heard here at the meeting that they cause more problems for the loca l community of people. 9/12/2011 10:56 AM Because of the close streets and closeness to campus, I worry b oth for the safety of the deer and for the unsuspecting drivers. 9/12/2011 8:47 AM I worry about the deer being that we are close to moores pike. I have seen a 3 legged deer that I assume had been hit by a car. :( there is a family of 5 that often sleep in our back yard. 9/10/2011 1:08 PM Deer appeared after recent Blackw ell development, ca 5 to 7 yea rs ago. We have become the nursery for the deer. I would hate to see them culle d just because we all say \"there are too many and they do not belong here.\" Our sense less developing is the true problem. 9/9/2011 12:51 AM It's a real problem because of my big yard with a small forest. I had 8 deer living back there at one time. I understand from previous owner of my home this has gone on for decades. 9/9/2011 12:20 AM the number is slightly t oo high. 9/8/2011 4:46 PM The number of deer do not concern me as much as the skinny and injured deer I see (possibly the same ones over and over). I read the FAQs and see that the number of deer is not thought to be unsuppo rtable in Bloomington. I find them peaceful to watch (except abovementioned ty pes) but worry about aggression to my dog, as I have watched her bark at one on the other side of my fence, and the deer began huffing and snorting and walking towards her the dog is a 50 p ound female. Not thrilled about the eating of ornamentals, though I find sprayin g has been quite effective. 9/7/2011 10:18 PM I don't really mind the number of deer, other than when they eat all of my hastas, day lillies, and iris in one night. That is annoying, but what can you do? My 149 neighborhood borders the city/county limits, and seeing deer, t urkeys, rabbits, birds, and an occasional fox in my back yard is fairly enjoyabl e. I feel like I'm cohabitating with nature. Plus, when they're around, I think the deer somewhat help to keep the speed of traffic thro ugh my housing edition lower. (I would rather have more deer and fewer speed humps/c hicanes around town.) It is we ird to see them in the middle of town though. Es pecially during afternoon hours . 8/1/2011 11:03 AM Mixed feelings. Like them, but t hey can destroy plants. 7/29/2011 6:10 PM I absolutely adore the deer, especially the fawns. I have a fee ding station for them. I stopped investing in expensive p lants and a portion of my lawn went back to nature. i have a floodlight to illuminate the deer in the winter. I no longer get upset when they eat my flowers. I spend qui te a bit of money feeding the deer. I am afraid that someday they will no longer appear. They are the joy of my life because they are so graceful and quiet. They do not bark and even do not chase away the squirrels when they are munching away on the fe eding block. They also do not chase away the adorable little bunnies dreaming away on my lawn. I was overjoy ed when a few weeks ago a fawn was born at the edge of the tree line visible from my bedroom window. Where else can you experience such a miracle. Please, d on't chase the deer away. I can handle more than I have now. 7/24/2011 1:11 PM 2 TO 8 DEER ON ANY GIVEN DAY IS MORE ACCURATE. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AN 8 POINT BUCK IN MY BACK YARD THEY RARELY TRAVEL ALONE. ANY W ILD ANIMAL OF THAT SIZE IS TOO MANY IN THE CITY AND SHOULD NOT BE N EAR BUSY STREETS. I HAVE BEEN KEPT FROM MY COMPOST PILE. MY TREES A ND PLANTS HAVE BEEN EATEN AND KILLED. THE DEER KNOCK DOWN MY FENCE S AND EVEN BREAK THE RAILS. 7/24/2011 1:53 AM I don't like them eating my flowers but I love seeing them and think it is up to us to plant things that the deer don't eat. I want to live peacefully with them. 7/23/2011 10:17 PM I do not frequently see deer near my apartment, but I do see th em frequently on roadsides south of town. However, their negative impacts on cit y parks and surrounding natural areas are app arent enough to justify a disc ussion of appropriate management regardless of the number of backyeard de er sightings. 7/22/2011 3:43 PM I don't mind the deer except tha t those in my yard are scrawny (even though they eat all of our flowers and shrub s) and the ones I see in our ne ighborhood hve that same tick covered look. Plus they get hit by cars. 7/19/2011 6:36 PM I feel that, because we've encroached upon their living space, it's only natural that they have become part of ours. 7/18/2011 12:30 AM The number of deer is understand able and doesn't bother me. 7/17/2011 7:50 PM I love the deer. I wouldn't mind seeing more on a more regular basis. Sometimes they're here daily, sometimes we ekly, most recently, less often . It changes. 7/16/2011 7:34 PM NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM. USE DEER REPEL LANT AND/OR JUST SHOO THEM OFF. 7/16/2011 6:54 PM 150 It's not the deer's fault that th ey are in my neighborhood. Sin ce their original home at \"Deer Park\" (the old Sarkes T arzian estate) had its fence re moved, they have dispersed throughout the neighborhood. 7/16/2011 3:04 PM I know there are many in parts o f the town, I think the traffic noise and relatively smaller yards in my part of Brya n Park neighborhood, combine with a lack of green corridors from other places, prev ent them from getting as far W est as my yard. 7/15/2011 2:56 PM It's not so much about numbers a s it is the damage they are doi ng. One can do a lot of damage to a small yard. 7/15/2011 8:58 AM We've encroached on their habitat and now they're forced to wander in search of food. The \"control\" shoulhave happened back when people were in terested in building on the \"deers' property\"! And I'm not at all happy tha t they devour my garden! 7/15/2011 7:53 AM we live next to the park where the herd gathers nightly so it s eems as if there are too many but this may be biased give location 7/14/2011 5:55 PM The numbers seem static suggestin g the population size is at eq uilibrium. This is a good thing. 7/14/2011 2:23 PM The number of deer vary. One may wander through or a small herd . One year a large herd of 8 or so went through t he porperty. 7/14/2011 2:18 PM We are on a longestablished deer crossing path. Although they are cute, I would like to see fewer on my property. 7/14/2011 2:12 PM I have only ever seen deer in the neighborhood crossing the str eets. 2nd street is very busy and this is quite dangerous. 7/14/2011 2:07 PM have actually seen less the last 2 years. 7/14/2011 12:50 AM The deer are diseased predators who came on my deck 3 years ago and ate all the tomatoes in my Earth boxes. I can't have a garden, and over 11 years, we have completely relandscaped to deerpoisonous and/or deer resistan t species. 7/14/2011 12:40 AM The deer in the city are not a n aturally occuring phenomina. Th ey were in the deer park estate surrounded by 8 foot f ences up until it was purchas ed and tranformed into the current rental spaces. The deer have no natural compet ition since we will not hunt within thecity limits this creates unregulated growth. The cost of relocation is far cheaper than the current costs they inflict o n the people and property within the city l imits. 7/14/2011 12:39 AM I don't mind the deer although we have to continually spray our plants with deer away. 7/14/2011 12:12 AM Deer: they are a beautiful creat ure that were here long before we got here so let's move over a little and enjoy them. 7/14/2011 12:03 AM About three months ago, I saw 21 deer, in a group, in an adjoin ing yard. This is ludicrous, if not plainly idioti c. There is no reasonable argum ent that this should, or can, continue. 7/14/2011 11:42 AM I see the deer outside of our fe nce because we have 2 dogs with a fenced yard. Neither of these separately would deter a hungry deer, but toge ther, the other offerings of my neighbors make m y yard a less preferred stop. 7/14/2011 11:24 AM 151 When I don't see them, they decimate my flowers, foliage every night, even with the leading sprays. 7/14/2011 11:16 AM There are large fields behind my house and some woods, so i exp ect to see a few. 7/14/2011 8:05 AM Leave the deer alone. We are taking their space and they need someone to go. As long as their not hurting anyone, LEAVE THEM ALONE. 7/14/201 1 7:53 AM WE ARE SO SICK OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE THE DEERGET A LIFE A ND WORRY ABOUT OUR SOLDIERS WHO AR E BEING KILLED AND LEAVE THE ANIMALS ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 7/14/2011 7 :26 AM We have 5 bucks and about 4 doe on our property alone. They sta y there because they can decimate our garden. 7/14/2011 7:05 AM We suspect there are too many deer for the area, but they seem to be thriving. 7/14/2011 6:55 AM I have seen a deer in a road twice in the last month. That is 2 deer too many!! 7/13/2011 10:26 PM These poor beautiful animals have no where to go. 7/13/2011 10:19 PM How many people are on the task force counting the correct amou nt of deer per person? 7/13/2011 9:34 PM Only when I see them by the road do I worry. Many of the street s here have hills and the deer can cause dangerous s ituations 7/13/2011 9:19 PM the deer were here before we started building and taking away t heir land, this is human error 7/13/2011 7:52 PM I believe there are too many dee r for conditions in our area. I do not feel that this means eliminating deer is the only solution. The deer populatio n would not be such a big problem if land was managed better, there were predators to keep deer from lingering in the same area for extended periods of time, etc. 7/13/2011 7:20 PM I don't mind them if you could k eep them out of gardens and flower beds 7/13/2011 6:52 PM Though the deer seem like too many because they are eating my garden/landscape plantings, I do not want to do t hem harm. I see them as a part of the landscape that we humans have gotten out of balance. 7/13/2011 5:43 PM The deer eat edible plants (vege tables, etc) as well as ornamental plants. 7/13/2011 5:32 PM There are none in my neighborhood , but I often see them on Coll ege Mall Rd around the Renw ick development and eati ng the bushes on the other side of the road. 7/13/2011 5:23 PM I love seeing the deer, but I kn ow they are dangerous to vehicl es and tear up yards. I don't want any harm to come to these creatures. 7/13/2011 5: 21 PM I can't believe you would even consider taking advice on \"what is the RIGHT number\" of deer from selfselecte d, possibly grossly uninformed or misinformed people and pretending to then determine what a :right\" number o f animals might be. Mother Nature takes care of that without your assistance. 7/ 13/2011 5:01 PM I just recently had a doe and two fawns in my back yard. Cute, but I do not like them eating the new, tender shoots of plants! There are a couple of groups of deer here. 7/13/2011 3:19 PM 152 I am okay with the number of dee r but I am worried about them g etting injured by cars and people. 7/13/2011 3:17 PM I think deer belong in nature and that we have no right expect deer to NOT be in town. If people want them to not eat their plants, fences and chemicals deterrents can be used. If there are areas where deer are in the roads, si gnage warning and encouraging slower speeds should be put up. The reality is that humans should not have a monopoly on being allowed to live in the city. 7/13/2 011 3:14 PM None in my condo neighborhood, bu t 'WAY too many deer on High S treet when I drive to work every day. Afraid I will hit one. Knew of a perso n who died as result of deer/car collision in a suburban area. It's dangerous. 7/13/2011 3:12 PM I don't mind seeing them, but I'm sure the poor things don't wa nt to be walking around a neighborhood like that. There isn't enough green space for them to live safely. 7/13/2011 3:06 PM I feel that there are too many deer for a residential neighborh ood near major roads and I worry about traffic accidents, but other than worrying ab out them being hit by cars, I have no problem with the deer being in the neighborhood. 7/13/2011 2:58 PM This area is very rural on the lake and there is a lot more roo m for deer to roam and feed than in the city so it is not as urgent a problem in thi s location than in city locations. 7/13/2011 2:50 PM I love seeing deer but I feel the y're in danger when they show up this far into town. There are very few forested areas in our neighborhood; these deer must have traveled a good distance to show up on the 700 block of West Al len. 7/13/2011 2:19 PM I don't know if it is that we ha ve more deer, or if we have sim ply encroached more on their habitat. I do know that they are a terrible problem fo r my garden. It's become nearly impossible to keep the deer off food plants and flowers. 7/13/2011 1:12 PM I do not mind the deer too much e xcept when they eat my plants, but I have learned to use natural sprays to keep the plants safe. 7/13/2011 1:1 1 PM The deer have been on the ridge longer than my condo has. We live in a small, semi rural midwestern town and deer are a part of life. 7/13/2011 1:07 PM I often see deer to the east of Bryan Park, but have only seen them in the vicinity of Davis and Dunn St. once, and neve r further west than that. I wo uld be fine with having a deer or two in my neighb orhood, but would worry about them in our streets, which have much more tr affic than those to the east of the park. (I'd rather have more deer and less traffic.) 7/13/2011 1:04 PM I have a neighbor who actually puts out food for the deer which I am sure attracts many! 7/13/2011 1:03 PM Probably right for being in the c ity, but I would definitely want to see a lot more if I lived in the county or a more rural area. 7/13/2011 12:54 AM Takes some of the joy out of gardening. 7/13/2011 12:41 AM where are they supposed to go since they have less habitat 7/13/2011 12:17 AM Recently I have not seen any, bu t last year there were way too many. I saw groups of females and babies, and single s tags frequently. I don't know w here they have gone, 153 but is not likely that I am just not noticing them because my w alking behavior hasn't changed much. So right now, I wo uld say the number is about rig ht. 7/13/2011 12:16 AM Number doesn't seem overwhelminglike it did when I lived east of Bloomington, but I haven't looked seriously for overbrowsing. Deer do not b oth my yard, but I have a dog. 7/13/2011 11:44 AM I worry about the number of deer, mostly for safety reasons (th eirs and ours). But how many is too many? I don't know, and besides, where else are they supposed to go, when we keep converting their natural habitats into subdivisions? 7/13/2011 9:47 AM To me it's For us or for th e deer? If I had to choose, I g uess it would be \"too man\", but because I'm guessing t hat they deer are starting to e xceed the carrying capacity of the land? 7/13/2011 8:19 AM The number of deer doesn't bother me. 7/13/2011 7:03 AM It does not seem like that much except that I see what they do to vegetation around the houseeven if I don't see them. 7/13/2011 1:27 AM We rarely see deer in the neighb orhood but we have seen them on rare occasions. I think deer in the neighborhood is a bad idea. They will get hit by a car and/or could hurt someone. 7/12/2011 4:10 PM I always enjoy it and experience a little thrill when I see a d eer. That said, I have noticed there seem to be more, b ased on number of sightings, an d I am worried for the deer themselves. I have seen several fawns that appeared to have been hit by cars this season. That breaks my heart. 7/12/2011 2:00 PM Something has definitely happene d in the last 10 years that we are seeing more in our yard, more often. I can meas ure that by how the landscaping in my front yard has changed, particularly in the last 3 years. There's really n othing left of it now. 154 Question 10. \"Where do you see deer in your community? Please describe below by citing street names, landmarks, etc.\" I suppose it's not right next to my residence, but I've seen deer across 3rd st. from the old Cheeseburger in Paradise.

If this were a pack of dogs it would not be permitted. They look cute and loveable, bu t even so, I believe that in town they are both a hea lth hazard and are responsible for destruction of property. 9/15/2011 7:59 PM On my property 9/15/2011 7:43 PM In my yard, crossing the street in front of my house, in our ne ighbors' yards, and in yards in other neighborhoods as I drive toward downtown. 9/1 5/2011 6:55 PM We see deer occasionally in a variety of areas in Monroe County. Since they are a natural component of the county, we simply enjoy seeing them, and find no intelligent reason to make note of the locations. 9/15/2011 6:16 PM Thornton Drive/Covey Lane/Miller Drive/Highland Avenue/Maxwell Street 9/15/2011 6:01 PM near Smith Rd. neighborhood back of our yard in the street (Fenbrook) my flowers 9/15/2011 5:48 PM Mulberry Lane, Mulberry Court, Olcott Blvd, Forrestor road, Win ston 9/15/2011 5:42 PM High Street, Stands Drive, Roger s Rd., Sare Rd., the Stands 9/15/2011 4:45 PM cabot court and my backyard 9/15/2011 4:32 PM Every day on my way to and from work and on my way to lunch.

Also I have to su rvey every morning in my own yard for deer damage. If I spray my plants on e night too late, they get eaten.

Every day you can see the deer along Southdowns between Circle a nd High Street. The deer migra te along the stream that flows south under High Street at Covenanter and heads down to M oores Pike. As the population has increased, I now see deer every day as I walk along various routes to IU, such as Rose Avenue and First Street, Eastside Drive and Maxwel l, Maxwell and Hawthorne, Ballantine and University.

If 'other,' please explain.\" If the deer did approach, I woul d be very concerned about them getting into my garden. I am concerned that the deer have a place to live, since we humans are taking all the wild places from them The deer have a legitimate place in our ecosystem. This is the ir land too! 9/16/2011 8:19 PM The deer are not afraid of humans and sometime soon someone is going to get killed. 9/16/2011 10:15 AM Someone is going to get seriousl y hurt or killed. They (the deer) have absolutely no fear of humans. 9/16/2011 8:51 AM Residents need to provide suitable food, water, saltlicks, corn to keep deer close by Vegetable gardens need to be enc losed, lined with fabric soften er 9/16/2011 8:35 AM deer in the neighborhood are an asset 9/16/2011 12:23 AM They eat all of the seed on my b ird feeders every night. 9/16/2011 12:16 AM Deer damage to our shrubs! They eat and trample just about anyt hing we plant. They are also dangerous for children playing outside. 9/15/2 011 9:32 PM I found a deer tick on me. Lymes disease cannot be far behind a s a health problem in this area 9/15/2011 9:08 PM pets, ticks, fleas, droppings 9/15/2011 4:47 PM How many months does it require to decide to reduce the deer po pulation? Yes, deer resistant plants are available; however, this cost to home owners needs to be spread over a number of years an d Bloomington seemed to be pleased with the recognition of AIB but floral di splays are now decreasing in large numbers and that takes away so much of the Bloom i n Bloomington that it makes me sad. 9/15/2011 4:11 PM FecesI watch them defecate on and at the edge of my yard regu larly. It smells. It cannot be healthy for human beings. 9/15/2011 2:43 PM Some child is going to be attacked. Over the past 5 years they have become increasingly aggressive. Ticks will surely be increasing as wel l 9/15/2011 11:18 AM My concern is about the ignoranc e of the general populace about deer behavior and rules if followed that might mit igate deer/people interaction p roblems. 9/15/2011 9:45 AM Deer people interaction trauma Recently pulled two\" sweet \" dog s off a struggling, during deer that had been hit by a car. The whole scene was a r eal ugly mess to behold. It was Nature meets meet s pets and cars in the suburbs 9/15/2011 6:55 AM Deer damage to fencing and danger to pets 9/13/2011 9:49 AM A deer crashed through a large w indow and wrecked a room in our home in July, 2009. 9/13/2011 9:15 AM Ticks drop and spread by dear 9/13/2011 8:55 AM 159 Deer are right on our front porc hes, at our mailboxes, between our children and the bus stop. They drop their fawns f or the day in our lawn. We can not avoid them; they are unafraid of us. They regular ly stare us down and dance in a fighter or flight manner. 9/12/2011 10:30 AM Maybe deer if apart of the bioecosystem 9/12/2011 9:54 AM Human hostility toward deerv ery concerned 9/9/2011 4:03 PM Deer culling resulting in weapon s used across yards. I will not hesitate to sue the city if ordinance is enacted tha t allows for killing deer on my property. 9/9/2011 12:54 AM I've seen them try to cross Atwater, which is busy. One I call, \"Wounded Doe\" who walks with a limp, likely has b een hit. She regularly shows up in my yard with 3 fawns. 9/9/2011 12:25 AM having deer interact with my youn g children or having them run into by deer who on occasion run through the yar d at high speed 9/9/2011 4:07 AM As any conservation officer will tell you, when a deer populati on gets large enough, predators who prey on deer will be next to arrive. The animals who prey on deer are cougars and coyotes. Coyotes hav e already been sighted in the n eighborhood. There are small children in this neighborhood, so obviously this is a problem. 9/8/2011 8:30 AM we are trying to maintain a native plant/sustainable garden and the deer are just decimating it! the deer are not afraid of people and I do worry about my children's safety I fear for a rough winter and we will have starving deer walking around because the population is too hig 9/7/2011 10:02 PM I am a cyclist for both exercise and commuting around town. I n early collided with a deer and her fawn who darted out on Covenanter. I have to keep and eye out for deer every time I get on the bike! 9/7/2011 12:45 AM We have tried to plant native plants to support bird and insect populations but the deer eat everything but the invasive honeysuckle. 9/5/2011 8:08 PM Fear for young children and pets , as we have seen two coyote in our yard in the past two years. Deer will draw the coyote, as the coyote will feed o n the deer. 8/1/2011 4:41 PM Are there many deervehicle collisions within city limits? I wo uldn't think traffic would be travelling so fast that collisions couldn't be avoided by careful drivers. County roads are another story but most who use these roads k now to watch for deer; it's the county afte rall. 8/1/2011 11:07 AM Very concerned about danger to c hildren!!!! I have witnessed dear aggression. They have no fear of humans. They are also economically destructive. 7/29/2011 11:50 PM Deer have shown aggressive behav ior in my backyard, including not moving when I go outside, pawing the ground as if to come after me or my dog (a very large German Shepherd). One night I had to wa it for a buck to leave my drive way before I could enter my garage/house. This week, a female deer began following me and my dog during our morning walk. I am especially concerned about the safety of children in my neighborhood (Arden Place). 7/26/2011 12:58 AM 160 DEER THREATS TO YOUNG CHILDREN ( my kids on my own patio) or oth ers who can't defend themselves, like th ose with LOW VISION/DISABLED (my mother)! 7/24/2011 10:09 PM I AM ALSO TIRED OF CLEANING DEER FECES OFF MY SHOES...NASTY STUFF! LET THE THE CITY POOPERSCOOP THEIR PETS LIKE WE HAVE TO. 7/24/2011 2:09 AM I am very concerned that people seem to exaggerate the number o f deer and their aggression. I have found it easy to scare them out of my yard.. ..and if one has a fawn nearby and acts with aggression, then take precautions by leaving the scene and calling animal control. 7/23/2011 10:22 PM The biggest damage to biodiversity and ecosystem is the people. The deer seem fine to me. 7/23/2011 1:29 PM Not only deer health and wellb eing, but the health of the peop le and their pets also. 7/23/2011 1:08 PM I am concerned that we have let this continue to grow into a re al problem and the population of deer has grown in size at the same time so that i t will take a great deal of energy and creativity to solve it now! I understand that Iowa City did solve the Deer situation. Perhaps you could investigate how they worked t hrough it there. 7/22/2011 3:08 PM my dog (G Shep) gets along fine w/ deer. She just watches them and fawns approach her w/o fear. We enjoy the deer. 7/22/2011 1:33 PM What concerns me most is developing a community consensus that permits optimal coexistence of human and natural. 7/22/2011 10:44 AM The city's lack of control over the everexpanding deer populat ion! 7/22/2011 10:11 AM The deer situation is absolutely out of control. Personally, it has cost me thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours. 7/21/2011 8:54 PM They have been seen eating found ation plantings that they don't usually eat. 7/21/2011 3:24 PM Deer damage to shrubs and young trees in my yard 7/21/2011 1 :24 PM The deer were not destroying our ability to enjoy our property 5 years ago. Now they are completely dominating our yard and environment 7/20/2011 10:21 PM danger of accidents caused by illegal hunting,poisoning,or othe r attempts to control deer population 7/20/2011 8:21 AM A few fanatical, obsessive homeo wners who want the deer killed. 7/19/2011 11:10 PM I answered other because I wanted to explain Deer Aggression. I live in an area with many children and am concerned t hat they may be harmed by deer. Example: There was a buck chasing a doe in the yards on my street; in that sit uation, someone could be run over because you know the buck is only interested in the doe and his surroundings. 7/19/2011 2:11 PM I believe we can drive slowly an d watchfully and avoid collisions, though \"deer\" signs could conceivably help with drivers who otherwise might not notice. There are ways to control damage to garden s, which perhaps more people need to know about; I for one don't mind sharing occasional flowers with the deer. The deer 161 around here look really healthy to me no ribs showing, etc., though I suppose that could change if the deer population grows too large and people are unwilling to allow them to eat some of their g reenery. As deer are big anima ls and as interested as any of us in protecting their young, I believe we should be mindful in the birthing season and when deer are young. Deer ticks are tiny but if people know what to look for, they can check for them. Wh at biodiversity? I suspect that educational campaigns and signs can go a long way to allaying concern s that people have about their own safety, and likew ise for concerns people have a bout the animals' safety. 7/16/2011 7:44 PM People shooting deer in my backyard which is a woods. 7/16/2 011 6:17 PM Yes, they are in our gardens. Th ey are a valued part of our world. As to accidents involving deer, most are probably preventable when drivers are aware and driving within the speed limits 7/16/2011 12:30 AM On deervehicle collisions: there might be a danger on Hillside or Sare Road, but elsewhere cars go slow enough th at collisions unlikely. 7/16 /2011 11:55 AM If the deer population is large enough to cause an imbalance wi th species who need the same food supply, then, yes, I am concerned. If deer produce methane, and their production of it is high enough to warrant concern about global warming and about our oxygen supply, then I am con cerned. If the deer population is large enough to cause ill health in the herds, t hen I am concerned about transm ission of disease by deer. I need to know more about the current deer population to know how I feel about these issues. When global warmingcreated droughts occur, I am concerned about the health and wellbeing of all wildlife. Part of deer management is responsible management of all re sources, and responsible management of environmental systems. 7/15/2011 10:00 PM Because I love seeing the deer it always seems magical I try not to be annoyed when they eat my hostas. I saw a doe with 3 babies yesterday an d it was quite wonderful. I think we should com e up with a peaceful way to pre vent the city deer population from getting bigger (birth control?) but I frankly e njoy the deer in my neighborhoodalong with the rabbits, birds, and occasional pos sums. Signs here and there to warn motorists unaware of our deer might be a good idea. 7/15/2011 8:32 PM Increasing population. 23 born to mature females each year. 7/15/2011 4:01 PM Every deer related human fatalit y is avoidable. Human life is precious. Man is the measure of all things. 7/15/2011 2:03 PM Very concerned about aggression toward children, especially dur ing rutting season 7/15/2011 10:55 AM Widespread opinion that deer are \"cute\" they are an outofco ntrol population of wild animals and need to be managed 7/15/2011 9:50 AM Deer damage to cropland 7/15/2011 8:34 AM I am fearing for my own security when I go for a walk in the evening. Deer with their young are just about everywhere and they won't go and hide when a human being comes around the corner. Even dogs don't bother them.... 7/14/2011 9:51 PM overdevelopment of wildlife habitat 7/14/2011 9:39 PM 162 Ever since I read in the HT about deer having sharp teeth and h ooves I'm scared to do much 'shooing away' unless I can quickly retreat inside the house. 7/14/2011 8:14 PM The continuous growth of the deer population in Bloomington. 7/14/2011 6:59 PM my neighbor (not sure if she is d oing survey) admits to getting lyme disease from tick at SE park hard not to relate this to deer population 7/14/2011 5:57 PM Causing damage to all of the abo ve cars and vegetation. 7/14/2011 4:36 PM Very concerned that deer will a ccidentally trample a small dog or child that gets underfoot. 7/14/2011 4:28 PM I was nearly startled to death w hile jogging near my house at dusk. I nearly ran into the thing. Reminded me of the \"G randma got run over by a reinde er\" song 7/14/2011 4:21 PM Damage to plants and flowers on property very concerned 7/ 14/2011 3:15 PM We have displaced the deer from THEIR native ecosystem. We must learn to live in harmony with them. if the people in Anchorage can live with bla ck bears, brown bears, and moose, we can certainl y adapt to the presence of dee r in our community!!! Grow up people and stop whining, 7/14/2011 3:15 PM We have a huge tick population i n our area and I suspect the # of deer could be increasing the ticks. 7/14/2011 2:15 PM Economic. The homeowner with little cash is throwing it away to plant a tomato plant or azalea. The homeowner s erious about growing fruit tree s or vegetables must fence the lot. Which totally changes a neighborhood which is fortunately low on fences. 7/14/2011 12:44 AM Hey we are all God's creatures and we should learn to live toge ther like different nationalities do. Just because t hey are animals makes no differ ence. 7/14/2011 12:10 AM My dog caught a deer early this Spring, and, had I not been nea r with a tennis racket with which I smacked him, the de er could easily have caused a large vet bill for my dog. 7/14/2011 11:45 AM Destruction of hours of gardening 7/14/2011 11:19 AM There are enough deer that drivers going through the neighborho od are often distracted 7/14/2011 9:53 AM If people would just be more careful and not have a wholier tha n though attitude there wouldn't be a problem. God put us on this earth to take c are of his animals he created, not get rid of them. 7/14/2011 7:57 AM IF THE \"PEOPLE OF BLOOMINGTON\" WO ULD TREAT THE LAND AND COMMUNI TY AS WELL AS THE DEER DO THEN WE W OULD HAVE A BETTER PLACE TO LIV E. 7/14/2011 7:31 AM forest degradation due to over bro wsing 7/14/2011 7:21 AM Since we have 5 bucks on our pro perty we are worried about deer aggression in the fall and winter season. 7/14/2011 7:07 AM Swerving vehicle running off the highway or hitting another. Transmission of honey locust trees with large dangerou s thorns ( up 9 inchess long or more) through deer feces. 7/13/2011 10:58 PM May the deer have their revenge on Bloomington!!! 7/13/2011 9:45 PM 163 I am very concerned about deer/children collisions as the deer bound out of yards on High Street while many neighborho od children walk to Childs Ele mentary School. 7/13/2011 8:47 PM already damaged my car. 7/13/2011 8:42 PM Deer are so domesticated in our neighborhood that that they loo k for traffic before crossing the street. 7/13/2011 8:20 PM I am not concerned about deer. Wi ldlife belong in our county. 7/13/2011 7:01 PM Get rid of all the deer. 7/13/2011 6:11 PM I'm concerned that the \"solution\" is likely to be worse than th e problem. Would you really prefer hunters in neighborhoods? Can that really be safe ? It would send a signal to every kid that it's OK to shoot anything that moves. 7/13 /2011 5:07 PM I am concerned about government and local vigilantes meddling w ith deer in our area. You scare me. 7/13/2011 5:04 PM Nature has a way of balancing it self. My concern is that many r esidents come across as whiners and are overly paranoid about \"deer aggression.\" The de er are not tearing down our fence to get to my flowers, vegetables, my little dog or my children. 7/13/2011 3:54 PM I'm worried that the Deer Task Force has lost their minds askin g if I am worried about biodiversity and the echos ystem. 7/13/2011 3:47 PM I'm concerned about a deer hurti ng our dog if a deer comes into our yard while our dog is out. 7/13/2011 3:46 PM They were here first. 7/13/2011 3:33 PM The City does NOTHING to PROTECT my personal property from Dest ructive DEER and said they would FINE me .00 for having an electric fence on my own property 7/13/2011 3:11 PM I suppose this could be filed un der the Deer agression category , but I am concerned for my dogs' safety as the deer often charge them. I have to turn o n my hose because when I throw things (such as tennis balls) at them it doesn't deter th em. 7/13/2011 3:11 PM With so much human need in the c ommunity, I have a hard time ju stifying feeding the deer. I am an animal lover, but in tough times, feel I must feed people before/esp. children, before deer. 7/13/2011 3:07 PM Obvious lack of fear of people o n the part of the deer. They do not exhibit the natural shyness that I am accustomed to seeing after growing up in a ru ral area. These deer are more likely to be aggressive towards hum ans, if the opportu n ity arises. Also, humans are more likely to believe that the deer are harmless when in reality the deer are quite capable of causing serious injury to humans. 7/13/2011 3:07 PM Since my car was totaled by a d eer crossing IN 37 in 2010 it is a big concern 7/13/2011 2:53 PM I am concerned about our community's overreaction to deer, fra nkly. My back yard has 3 to 5 deer standing and sleeping in it daily, and I am proud o f it. Yes, sometimes they eat my hostas, and my veggies are under netting, but we be a \"s afe and civil\" community even to deer. 7/13/2011 2:13 PM Our neighborhood has many retirees and kids and we all love wat ching the deer. The deer build community as a topic of conversation. 7/13/2011 1:39 PM 164 Question 13. \"In the last three years, have you experienced any of the following deer damage to your property? If so, please indicate the degree of the damage.\" I don't grow vegetables, other t han herbs. Have tried to grow t omatoes and the deer devour them! 9/17/2011 11:26 AM You have to be kidding, they will eat anything. 9/16/2011 8: 54 AM Grow apple trees only for deer ple asure. The can have ALL they can find. 9/16/2011 8:38 AM Plants such as hostas 9/16/2011 6:21 AM The have broken several bird feeders 9/16/2011 12:17 AM Their urine kills grass. Where t hey sleep up near the house, th ey have killed the grass with their urine. On the g ood side, their urine also seem s to kill invasive climbing euonymus. 9/15/2011 8:07 PM We have no fruit bearing trees. However, the deer have eaten a trail through the ivy and deer repellent products are costly. 9/15/2011 4:14 PM Does like to park their fawns in our backyard during the day. T hey did it so regularly that the fawns created their own spaces in the yard (it's natural and not mowed grass) where little grew any longer. 9/15/2011 10:21 AM Actually not a concern, but appl ause: the fallen apples which might rot but instead are eaten by the deer. 9/15/2011 9:47 AM We have no fruit bearing trees o r a vegetable garden but if we did because they \"live\" in our yard I'm sure they would find them very tasty as well. 9/15/2011 9:38 AM flower boxes, potted plants! 9/15/2011 8:50 AM Deer have eaten flowering bulbs right out of the ground 9/15/2011 8:30 AM Damage to fencing - moderate 9/13/2011 9:50 AM Bucks are ruining trees 9/13/2011 9:16 AM Deer ate acorns from our 60' foot tree in our small backyard all winter and it was filled with manure 9/13/2011 8:50 AM The deer have decimated my garde ns. This is not just 'damage' b ut the complete elimination of many native species that I planted when I moved here 10 years ago. They were thriving until 5 years ago, but the deer browse since then has been too intense to allow anything other than a few unpalatable species to survive. 9/13/2011 7:36 AM Damage to wild vegetation in woods 9/12/2011 10:47 AM I don't grow fruittree, flower bed and vegetables for the concern of deer damage. 9/12/2011 9:56 AM Responses include serious tree damage at our previous house in Bloomington 9/11/2011 6:29 PM I'd say they probably destroy large chunks of our garden every spring and sometimes parts of our fence. 9/9/2011 4:04 PM Seeing them wounded and often b leeding, physically thinner each year and no longer \"wild\" animals, very passive and lethargic! 9/9/2011 12:54 AM I gave up on planting any flower s or vegetables on my .72 acre property. They eat everything. 9/9/2011 12:29 AM 165 native plants 9/7/2011 10:04 PM Browse line appearing at edge of woods behind homes... 8/5/2 011 4:06 PM We have a limestone terrace in our backyard that the deer love to climb through to eat plants. They even sometimes sleep on the top level. The wei ght of these deer walking on a fragile surface that was poorly constructed to beg in with has just decimated the terrace and caused thousands of dollars in damage . We have already spent rebuilding one level of the terrace. 8/3/2011 11:28 AM absolutely nothing growing naturally under trees; land looks st erile except for taller trees; no habitat for any other wildlife 8/1/2011 7:37 PM I do not bother trying to grow v egetables or fruitbearing tree s in my yard. 7/26/2011 1:00 PM Destroyed vegetable garden fencing. 7/24/2011 2:52 PM My yard, front and back is fille d with gardens, but I only have minimal damage because I choose to spray the plants that I know they like to e at or cover them with nylon netting which seems to w ork better than anything else I 've tried and I have tried many! 7/23/2011 10:26 PM Have had a lot of deer excrement in the back yard, although right now there is little. Don't do the trees and ornamenta ls...etc. so checked \"none\" I h ave a vegetable garden with a fence so the deer can't get in. 7/23/2011 1:13 PM The deer have paths through my p roperty. They wander from one p oint across the back around the side and across the street and back again. They rest along the way and eat up whatever they encounter. They birth, the life cycle proceeds outback...know what I mea n? 7/22/2011 3:16 PM Feed on bird feeder but so do squirels. 7/22/2011 1:35 PM The deer have eaten the Ivy righ t off our house. The are an inv asive pest. 7/21/2011 8:56 PM It has RUINED the undergrowth of our 3 acres of woods. 7/21/ 2011 8:55 PM None for vegetables because we had to fence the garden. If not, there would not be a garden. 7/21/2011 3:25 PM Deer stealing sugar water from a hummingbird feeder 7/21/201 1 1:26 PM We do not have any fruitbearing trees, but they have killed on e of our dogwoods by removing the bark. We have given up on growing flowers and vege tables, and most of our perennials are being de stroyed 7/20/2011 10:24 PM Herbs 7/20/2011 9:16 PM We don't have fruit trees. 7/19/2011 12:37 AM If I did not use stinky deer sprays, netting and other protecti on methods damage would be severe on almost everything. 7/18/2011 9:33 PM I have a large vegetable garden and orchard. Damage has been none to minimal because I invested a lot of money in a deer fence, similar to t he one at the community gardens near Winslow park 7/17/2011 9:07 PM We have just moved into this house and we are in the process of planting all of the above and very concerned about n ot getting plantings that the deer like. But I do not think that will stop them. I hav e seen deer pull down tree limb s from our neighbors, eat all of their hostas and flowers. 7/17/2011 4:16 PM 166 Tree death due to girdling (tearing bark off by rubbing antlers) 7/17/2011 8:44 AM I have sprayed with liquid fence just to have some flowers in m y yard. IN case you don't know, flowers are expensive! So is the spray! 7/15/2011 3:17 PM They eat just about everything that grows in my yard 7/15/2011 1:49 PM I used to have a vegetable garde n. Then I tried flowers. Now I just hide some herbs in amongst the weeds. 7/15/2011 1:16 PM I have too much shade for fruit s and vegetables 7/15/2011 10:57 AM I only checked other because my I know many people who have tol d me of plant damage and I've seen the fences around the gardens. I, however, have a second story deck with plants that the deer cannot access and they don't see m to bother my other plants in the yard. 7/15/2011 10:41 AM I have a high wooden fence all ar ound my property that has been in place for many years 7/15/2011 9:53 AM If we had fruitbearing trees an d vegetables they would have be en eated. 7/15/2011 9:29 AM Even though the deer have only killed one young peach tree in m y yard, I regularly lose any anticipated fruit harvest from all of my smaller fruit trees. I think I got one apple pie out of my apple tree an d one pear (although the droug ht was a complicating factor) no peache s, but that may have been a squ irrel as the pits we're left at the base of the tree. 7/15/2011 9:12 AM The deer do eat some of our flowers, but I don't mind. 7/14/ 2011 9:08 PM I have put fences around my veggie gardens and every night I put plastic sacks over my MANY beautiful daylilies. Take s about an hour or so. Then I have to take off the sacks in the morning. 7/14/2011 8:17 PM The deer have severely damaged several ground cover beds. 7/ 14/2011 7:31 PM Deers jump into our yard and cau se damage to some structures as sociated with the fences. 7/14/2011 7:01 PM I don't have flowers, vegetables, fruit trees. The deer eat eve rything else here. 7/14/2011 6:04 PM We don't grow a vegetable garden because of the fear of damage by deer....although we would like to. 7/14/2011 4:57 PM Yard... tracks, poop, spots from where they lay 7/14/2011 4: 37 PM The only way I can k eep plants is to fence them. 7/14/2011 3 :50 PM . About 10 years ago we added deer proff fences around some of ou r property which help keep the damage lower. Outside the fences, the wildflower cover is greatly diminished and the trees are damaged often. 7/14/2011 2:19 P M Rubbed street trees with bucks' antlers each fall. 7/14/2011 1:48 PM there are areas in my yard where work has been done and the deer stomped in the mud, had to have dirt brought in the smooth it back over to see d and straw. 7/14/2011 1:18 PM They ate 250 day lilies in a tri ce, last Spring. 7/14/2011 11:47 AM 167 trellis and other items have been knocked down by startled deer 7/14/2011 9:56 AM Mkes my dog bark hysterically in the middle of the night. I'm s ure the neighbors love that! 7/14/2011 9:20 AM THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL AND SHOULD B E VIEWED AS A COMPLIMENT TO LIFE . WHERE IS THE TOLERANCE TO EVER YTHING AND EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY? 7/14/2011 7:36 AM gave up trying to establish fuit trees and no longer put out a garden because of deer browse 7/14/2011 7:26 AM My main concern is deer vehicle collisions. A boy died on our road due to this. People come before deer. 7/13/2011 8:42 PM Lawn damage. 7/13/2011 8:21 PM Deer eat anything and everything in our yard. There are no 'resistant' plants with the population we have. Everything we plant has to be fenced an d deer will even knock the fencing over or eat anything they can reach inside or outside the fencing. Many native plants that don't gr ow large enough to get beyond t he reach of deer are almost impossible to establish or maintain on our property. 7/13/2011 7:39 PM We plant some vegetables in our yard specifically for the deer. 7/13/2011 7:00 PM bird feeder being emptied 7/13/2011 6:47 PM Hit two with my car! Ouch! Both times the deer seemed okay but it cost a deductible each time. 7/13/2011 5:27 PM The damage to my shrubs, flowers and ornamentals is from people who are enjoying Bryan Park but also thinks that means they can unapologetically let their unleashed dogs run haphazardly through the nonfenced part of our yard destroying flowers I have planted. Or, they allow their dog to defecate in our yard and then leave the mess. Most people enjoying our ne ighborhood are not like this, but you would be surprised how many are like this. But, we choose to live in this area, so we deal with it rather than move. 7/13/2011 4:03 PM We had one hibiscus shrub eaten by a deer 2 years ago while we were away on vacation. Otherwise, we have never seen evidence of deer on our property. 7/13/2011 3:56 PM We don't have a veg garden bec ause of the deer 7/13/2011 3:4 9 PM Culinary herbs 7/13/2011 3:47 PM Have given up trying to grow vegs and most flowers 7/13/2011 3:42 PM I have a good fence around my ya rd so they don't get in usually . 7/13/2011 1:32 PM It is impossible to grow anythin g that the deer eat. We constantly apply products but it doesn't help. 7/13/2011 1:12 PM Yard.....they have created pathways! 7/13/2011 1:10 PM The tops of my blue spruce (2 of then) were cut out in order fo r one of the fraternities to have Christm as trees! 7/13/2011 12:37 AM A deer impaled it's back leg ont o our fence..city police came out and shot it and animal control had to haul it away 7/13/2011 12:24 AM 168 I have a shade garden, and almos t all of my plants are eaten ye arly by the deer in the neighborhood. We finally put a fence up in our front yard, whic h has decreased the amount of damage, but there are still plants that are destroyed . 7/13/2011 12:20 AM I have deer resistant gardens ou t front and put all my vegetabl es and lilies in the back behind a fence. 7/13/2011 11:58 AM Pulled farm fence loose from post when jumping over 7/13/2011 11:48 AM Eating birdseed from birdf eeders 7/12/2011 11:04 PM I don't live in the city deer p ressure is Ok where we live bu t in town I see deer everywhere and not at time I would expect to see them. Now Bloo mington is like Brown County State Park was prior to the deer reduction hunts. 7/12/2011 2:14 PM Some \"nesting\" damage (where they have bedded down for the nigh t). 7/10/2011 9:29 AM stone walls 7/9/2011 10:25 PM Most of my yard fenced in and im pervious to deer, so only notic e damage in front, and on walks in other streets 7/8/2011 4:23 PM 169 Question 14. \"In the last three years, have you used any of the following methods to protect your property from deer damage? Check all that apply.\" Experts tell us nothing really w orks except killing the deer. 9/17/2011 11:26 AM hanging ribbons, old cds, walkin g around the property at night. 9/16/2011 8:33 PM dog hair 9/16/2011 8:21 PM Hunting Anyone doing such needs immediate arrest and life beh ind bars. Deer do not damage, only humans and their kids constantly damage. 9/16/2011 8:38 AM Deerresistant plants won't protect your property it's just that the deer don't like to eat them as much as they like other plants. The plants do not act as a repellant. 9/15/2011 8:07 PM They torn the netting! 9/15/2011 4:14 PM Deer have eradicated all the tulips, hostas, and all the ivy th ey could reach. They have severely damaged sedum, lillies, rose bushes, ferns, small trees, unidentified bushes and even a holly tree. I find one or more piles of deer feces in my yard virtually daily. All the repellent s, scar devices work for a sh ort time but not the long run. The herd needs to be thinned. 9/15/2011 2:58 PM Sensor lights at both my house a nd at neighbor's; these do not work 9/15/2011 11:27 AM Deer Away on organic spray has w orked but it is very expensive and must be sprayed at least once a month 9/15/2011 9:38 AM no need to protect the property. 9/15/2011 7:14 AM Outside dog 9/15/2011 6:56 AM does not apply 9/14/2011 1:56 PM Have had our dog chase them out of the yard. They don't take hi m very seriously and always return. At times they 've acted aggressively toward h im. 9/13/2011 9:50 AM Shouting, clapping hands 9/13/2011 8:50 AM The deer knock down fences, eat plants that are marketed as resistant, and do not seem repelled 9/13/2011 8:44 AM There is no practical method for protecting my front gardens fr om the overwhelming number of deer. In t he question below, the key iss ue is not the amount of money I have spent rec ently, but the loss of previous investment and loss of value to my property because of the damage to the landscapin g with native plants. 9/13/2011 7:36 AM My property is too large to effectively fence (within my budget ). They seem to eat some plants that are supposedly deerresistant so that concerns me that they are really not getting what they need. 9/9/2011 12:29 AM I have used scarecrows with some success in the past, though n ot in the last 3 years. 9/8/2011 3:37 PM Setting dogs on them. 9/8/2011 8:31 AM I try to chase them away wheneve r I see them on my property 9/7/2011 10:04 PM 170 Scarecrows. Or scaredeers... 9/6/2011 4:11 PM fence...all these devices costly 8/1/2011 4:43 PM BB Gun 7/24/2011 10:12 PM Adopted a large dog from the shelter. 7/24/2011 2:52 PM BB'S DO NO LASTING GOOD. 7/24/2011 2:13 AM Chasing them out of the yard 7/23/2011 1:31 PM Have a large noisy dog that chases them away. 7/22/2011 10:0 0 AM Even though we have used the abo ve devices these do not deter t he deer from damaging our property. 7/21/2011 8:56 PM we chase them with a supersoaker . It is more fun for us than scary for them 7/20/2011 10:24 PM Well, if you would permit bow hun ting in the city limits, I would help manage the population destroying my garden every year unless I wage consta nt war with water scarecrows. This year, they destroyed 14 tomatoes before I got the crows up, and even ate the okra and destroyed the plants, cropped the tops of the beans, and stripped my blackberries as they were almost ripe. LOTS of work . They have no natural predators. I do not wa nt to kill them all or see them d isappear. But I suspect there is an over population, and they can be destructive. 7/ 20/2011 4:10 PM Allow dogs loose ... with invisib le fnce collars, though someti mes they chase the deer across the fence line. 7/19/2011 6:41 PM Leaving our dog out in the back yard where the vegetable garden and apple trees are. 7/18/2011 1:33 PM Again we have just moved into th is house and we have just begun to plant. We are definetely on a deer route. I wo uld like to use fencing but our back yard is considered a front yard and we c an only put up a 4 ft fence. 7/17/2011 4:16 PM Verbal scaring 7/16/2011 7:17 PM I have used a natural repellant ( ginger?) around plantings I wanted to protect. 7/15/2011 10:16 PM I put up a high wooden fence many years ago 7/15/2011 9:53 A M We're careful not to have plan ts deer really like 7/15/2011 9:29 AM So far I have found that stringi ng fishing line along a row of 5 ft steel posts (with holes in them)the lines strung at both 4' and 2' heights, is a ter rific way of keeping the deer away. No electric shocks, but bumping into something unseen seems to spook them. 7/14/2011 10:09 PM The plastic grocery sacks over e ach daylily bud/flower cluster. Very tiring and tedious. I have begun considerin g an electric fence. 7/14/20 11 8:17 PM I try to chase them off with projectiles. 7/14/2011 7:01 PM I rent an apartment, so it's really not up to me 7/14/2011 6 :54 PM My husband clapping his hands, whistling and sayinng \"shoo\". It 's soooo funny I should film it for Utube. 7/14/2011 4:57 PM Placement of ornamental and herb plants in locations that are l ess accessible to deer. 7/14/2011 3:23 PM Fencing but it is more than 3 years old. 7/14/2011 2:36 PM Deer resistant plants were not! 7/14/2011 2:28 PM 171 throwing stuff at them, chasing t hem with the broom, 7/14/20 11 2:27 PM The deer interact with our fenci ng and have learned to walk aro und it. We are careful but we have had fawns sq ueeze through the fence where r acoons have damaged it. 7/14/2011 2:19 PM The only thing that works is pur posely designed deer fence 7 /14/2011 2:07 PM spray of beaten egg with water. It works. 7/14/2011 1:21 PM I acquired a 100lb German Shephe rd that's just as fast as they are, but I can't leave him out all night. 7/14/2011 11:47 AM Dogs and fencing. 7/14/2011 11:34 AM I would be pleased to invite ski lled hunters to my yard. 7/1 4/2011 11:20 AM air pellet gun 7/14/2011 10:24 AM electric fence surrounding garden area (in my fenced back yard this actually works) 7/14/2011 9:56 AM IF YOU WOULD TRESPASS ON MY PROPERTY I WOULD NO SHOOT OR GET RI D OF YOU. WAKE UP PEOPLE AND STOP BEING SO OPINIONATED AND ONLY SEEI NG YOUR SIDE OF LIFE. 7/14/2011 7:36 AM Tree wrap, yelling, headlights 7/13/2011 11:00 PM Have barky dogs. 7/13/2011 10:29 PM Fencing is not encouraged or in some cases permitted in our nei ghborhood 7/13/2011 10:01 PM Fence around garden 7/13/2011 9:35 PM An increase in the number of nei ghborhood residents and their p ets (e.g., dogs) seems to have alleviated property damage by deer. 7/13/2011 9:32 PM they do not always work. for example, in last year's drought conditions deer \"resistant\" plants were also eaten. I have given up gardening i n my yard and rent a plot where I drive in the evenin gs to vegetable garden. 7/13/2011 8:49 PM Shouting, yelling, throwing rocks. 7/13/2011 8:21 PM 1 fence around vegetable garden 7/13/2011 7:02 PM I have tried wire and mesh barri ers around plants. They eat any thing that grows through. 7/13/2011 5:30 PM We have a fence, but it was inst alled so our little dog could b e off a leash, not because of deer problems. 7/13/2011 4:03 PM organic homemade repellants in addition to storebought repell ants 7/13/2011 3:52 PM We have a fence, but the deer jump it. Last year the police sho t a deer that had broken it's leg trying to jump over a fence in our back yard. 7/13/2011 3:49 PM I've gradually figured out plant s that the deer are not interes ted in eating (daffodils, mint, most culinary herbs)... I do n't even bother with things t hey like to eat (tulips, sunflowers, etc...). 7/13/2011 3:47 PM Not used methods to protect my property as its not been any iss ue at all for us. That said, extensive hunting has been done on relatives properties to cull the deer population. Mostly Western Monroe County and Eastern Green. 7/13/2011 2:39 PM 172 I already have a short fence and a dog that seems to keep them out. Other yards in the area are not fenced so I thi nk the deer go to the areas of easy access. 7/13/2011 1:32 PM Have asked neighbor to quit feeding the deer but he has not sto pped. 7/13/2011 1:05 PM electic fence 7/13/2011 12:49 AM my dogs chase them awa y 7/13/2011 12:40 AM We have a fenced in back yard an d a dog. This deters the deer from our back yard, even though they will enter the back yards of our neighbors who have fences but not dogs. Part of their route in our neighborhood goes through thes e yards. They do have open access to our front yar d and that is where we have seen some damage. 7/13/2011 12:27 AM My yard is fenced, and I have dogs. Even so, I rarely see deer in my neighborhood. 7/13/2011 11:05 AM We moved in last July. I've been reluctant to plant anything as many of our neighbor's yards provide access to our yard for the deer to ent er. Want to talk with neighbors about helping to fence in their yards. 7/12/2011 7 :28 AM Seems pointless to try. All the methods my neighbors try either stink to high heaven or I could have a front yard of plastic bags I put over things neither is appealing. 7/11/2011 3:37 PM battery powered deer zappers 7/11/2011 11:13 AM Just bought some devices that are supposed to discourage them, but haven't put them out, yet. 7/10/2011 9:29 AM would have hunted if not in the city. 7/8/2011 11:09 PM We chase them whenever we see them. They are terrified of our b ig blue exercise ball, which when tossed or rolled from a safe distance, freaks them out. 7/8/2011 3:41 PM 173 Question 16. \"In the last three years, were you involved in a deer\u00ad vehicle collision in Monroe County? If 'yes,' please cite location.\" S. Walnut St. and Dillman Rd. 9/16/2011 7:20 PM Hillside, as mentioned above. 9/15/2011 1:13 PM Sare Rd. near Rodgers Renwick 9/13/2011 8:37 AM Pond 9/13/2011 8:10 AM N. Russell Rd. 9/12/2011 10:32 AM Highway 45 East 8/20/2011 3:12 PM Snoddy road 8/1/2011 4:43 PM High Street 7/25/2011 9:15 AM On Dec 23, 2009 (I believe) after a Christmas pie baking party, I hit a deer on Allen Street right off of 2nd St. There was a pack crossing and I tri ed to refrain from hitting any of them, but I hit one. 7/23/2011 1:13 PM No but i was behind a car on H illside that swerved and hit one. 7/19/2011 6:41 PM Rhorer Rd close to Old Walnut St reet Pike. Numerous close calls in this area and also on Snoddy Road and Rhorer Rd. close to Snoddy. Also, in our nei ghborhoodGran Haven Estates 7/18/2011 9:33 PM Not in Monroe County but in Indiana. My son was hit by a deer w hose hoof went through the windshield. He sits far enough back that he was not hurt but the car was totaled. My husband and I hit a deer on our motorcycle. A lot o f damage to the motorcycle. We were not hurt. 7/17/2011 4:16 PM 37 and tap road 7/17/2011 3:51 PM Rt 37, S bound near the Morgan County line. 7/16/2011 11:07 PM nearly, on Moore's Pike between r oundabout and S. High St. Maxwell Lane just after turning off S.High S t. 7/15/2011 4:44 PM We were involved in an indirect way. In about 2000 my children, then about 5 and 8 were playing in the backyard and came into the house telling me they had gotten very close to a deer. It made me very curious because at that t ime the deer would run the minute my kids slammed th e back door to go outside. Whe n I asked them to show me, they took me into the backyard and had me look across our small tributary creek that feeds into Jackson Creek into a small patch of woods that is in our neighbor's backyard. I didn' t see anything at first, then a very large buck with a huge rack reared up snorting trying to get to its feet. I was s o shocked and afraid at how close my boys may have been to this huge animal and I was c oncerned for the deer as well. It turned out to have most likely been hit by a car and had no use of its hind quarters and was immobile. I called every agency I could think of (by that time it was after 5pm) to get some he lp and really got the run around. After numerous phone calls to try to find someon e help me to put the creature out of its misery, I finally called the police. They came, and with a miserable atte mpt at shooting to kill the deer, it laid there and suffe red its death. I am emotional now as I recall the event. It was heartbreaking and horribl e for my kids to know this, even though I kept them inside. The next day I had just a s much trouble finding the rig ht place to call to 174 remove the decaying deer. I fina lly found someone (don't recall who) that came with a truck with a winch to haul the deer away. It was an ordeal to say the least. At the very least, there needs to be clear and concise measures for an incident such as this regarding our deer population. Every agency that I called would inform me that it was a \"city\" issue or a \"county \" issue, etc. 7/15/2011 10:41 AM Delap Road 7/14/2011 11:08 PM SR 37 southbound, just north of Bloomington HS South 7/14/20 11 3:23 PM South 446, just past the crossing of Knightbridge Rd. 7/14/2011 3:15 PM no collision, but so meany near misses I can't count them, most ly in the Green Acres are 7/14/2011 2:27 PM Across from the twin lakes baseball fields however traffic was very heavy so I was stopped and she bumped into me, then got up and ran away. We bo th were unharmed. 7/14/2011 2:09 PM not is the city breeden rd 7/14/2011 12:28 AM We might have crossed the Monroe County line, but I hit one on 46 heading back from Brown County. That road is terrible for deer. 7/14/2011 11:34 AM Well, nearly, twice. On High Street. 7/14/2011 9:20 AM MY ANSWER IS NO!!!!!!!!! IF PEOPL E WOULD STOP DRIVING SO FAST A ND OVER THE SPEED LIMIT THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HITTING DE ER. WHAT IF CHILDREN WOULD RUN IN FRO NT OF YOUARE YOU GOING TO GET RID OF THEM OR HIT THEM AND BLAME THEM FOR BEING IN THE ROAD? 7/14/2011 7:36 AM SR 45 close to Mt. Gilead road Robinson road Old SR 37 north of the MorganMonroe SF entrance 7/14/2011 7:26 AM Too many close calls to count on Arden, Wilton, Oxford, Thornto n 7/13/2011 11:54 PM Bottom Rd, near intersection of S impson Chapel and Bottom 7/ 13/2011 10:54 PM On the Bypass, by the Showalter house sign. Car was totaled, de er probably died, I was knocked out. Not fun!!! 7/13/2011 10:29 PM Hwy 45 and Breeden Rd hywy 46 curry pike road 7/13/2011 8:42 PM twice. 7/13/2011 PM I collided with a deer on Moore's Pk, just east of Smith Rd., and had a deer run into the right rear quarter panel of my vehicle on Winfield Rd. 7 /13/2011 7:40 PM Near New Unionville on Brummett's Creek Road. I was going slow enough that the deer got up and ran away, but I have come close many times on H wys 46, 45 and 446. 7/13/2011 5:47 PM By Sherwood oaks 7/13/2011 5:27 PM Winslow Road near Grossman Farm. 7/13/2011 3:47 PM on IN 37 south bound near the M onroe County Hospital 7/13/20 11 2:54 PM On State Road 45 E near line of city limits. I clipped one that jumped out of the darkness, but the deer shook it o ff and appeared to be fine. My car was okay too. 7/13/2011 2:15 PM 175 37 near Monroe Hospital. 7/13/2011 1:38 PM Hwy 45 and Curry Pike. 5,000 dollars of damage. Three deer hit the vehicle. 7/13/2011 1:12 PM Lost Mans Lane 7/13/2011 1:05 PM on unionville rd 7/13/2011 12:41 AM SR 46 West, near the western edge of the county 7/13/2011 12 :27 AM I was on High St, close to Hillside. It was the car in front of me that ran it over, but it traumatized me! 7/13/2011 12:23 AM I was westbound on State Road 45 between New Unionville and Blo omington, just east of where Mt. Gilead Rd. meets S.R. 45. 7/12/2011 5:55 P M This is in response to question 15. If I replaced all the landscaping the deer have damaged in my front yard, it would be over . Like I said, it seems pointless to replace at this juncture. 7/11/2011 3:37 PM at the Monroe/Brown County l ine near Long's Landing. 176 Question 17. \"What would you consider to be evidence of a successful deer management program? If, 'other,' please explain.\" people reeducated to see that t he deer deserve a place to live , what measures can be taken to protect property and how to plant. 9/16/2011 8:3 4 PM I love living in a city where I see deer roaming freely. The tr eatment of animals signifies the true condition of the hearts of human beings livi ng within that society. 9/16/2011 8:23 PM A community that focuses on far m ore serious issues and treats deer with respect and compassion. 9/16/2011 6:10 PM A strong declaration that deer a re part of our community and MU ST be treated with total respect and care. 9/16/2011 4:56 PM Stop making wild animal and property owner cohabatat issues co nstantly irritating enough to make monroe county tot ally disgusting! Stop Interferring with everything you can dream up. native wildlif e habitat require pledges for all to respect wildlife 9/16/2011 8:39 AM Total eradication of the into wn population. 9/15/2011 9:11 PM Let us hunt them! 9/15/2011 8:47 PM It seems the deer herd is pretty healthy. They look good. They seem to have a lot of food choices from our yards. They reproduce prolifically and th eir babies look healthy. They are cute and I wou ld like them out in the country , but they are SO out of place in town. 9/15/2011 8:09 PM The citizens of this community need to be educated about the im portance of the natural world and it's effect on our world. Humans have much mo re to lose in this irrational frenzy of fear, by co ntinuing to attempt to control and destroy nature, than by learning to apprecia te and coexist with it. 9/15/201 1 6:25 PM I have seen no indications of successful management programs; t he number of deer in the community has escalated in the past years new fawns ev ery spring and they grow up with no natural enemies. 9/15/2011 11:29 AM I don't know 9/13/2011 8:34 AM The complete elimination of deer in Bloomington. If individuals or organizations like Deer Park want to keep deer, then they should be required to fe nce them in. It should not be the burder of ever yone else to fence them out. 9/13/2011 7:39 AM Feeling of personal safety. Deer who run when they see people like they used to do. 9/12/2011 10:32 AM I am unaware of what deer eat, so more information about how to make my yard less interesting to deer would be nice. The property and surrou nding area is so little and highly trafficked that I wor ry about the deer and driver collisions. 9/12/2011 8:52 AM Reduced population of ticks an d 9/9/2011 12:55 AM Seeing the number of deer disappe ar in my neighborhood and spec ifically, my yard, would be encouraging. 9/9/2011 12:34 AM Educating the public about how t o peacefully coexist with the animals that inhabit our environment. After all, it's their world too. 9/7/2011 5 :13 PM More deers. 9/6/2011 4:11 PM 177 Distracted drivers scare me a lot more than the deer. I bike ev erywhere and I don't have a single issue with deer. However, Ipod clad walkers, bikers, drivers and those on cell phones have come so close to me while I am biking. 8 /5/2011 4:35 PM Less possibility of deer aggressi on as they are plentyful in wi th the city and parks... 8/5/2011 4:07 PM Reduced property damage 8/3/2011 11:29 AM Restoration of naturally lush fo rest ecosystems throughout the county with return of smaller animals/bird varieties to the scene 8/1/2011 7:40 PM There seems to be NO RECOURSE when you have a deer problem in y our very own yard; a successful deer program will include a system for recording concerns and tracking those concerns over time. 7/24/2011 10:18 PM I would suggest educating residents on how vegetation can be pr otected (e.g. repellents, fences, deerresistant plants) 7/24/2011 10:54 AM I have read that managing the de er through birth control is not a viable solution unless 90% of the deer were treate d. This doesn't make sense to me because if 50% of the does did not reproduce each spring due to birth control in salt licks or a similar delivery system, that wo uld mean 50% less new deer than if it wasn't used, wouldn't it? And, eventually, th e number would have to be reduc ed. THIS IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN. 7/23/2011 10:32 PM Unfortunately I think the deer will just be forced out. I prefe r the deer to dogs and cats that bring disease, noise, and destruction also. 7/23/2 011 1:33 PM Reduced incidence of pet related injury and death from deer. Reduced fear of going out at night for a walk by myself. 7/23/2011 1:14 PM I like the numbers abo ut where they are. I'd like to know how t he numbers have fluctated over the past several years. I would like to know mor e about deer contraception. 7/22/2011 10:49 AM We want the situation to return to where it was 5 years ago when we could actually grow a garden without worrying ab out it being devoured by the deer 7/20/2011 10:26 PM A trap, spay/neuter, and release by veterinarias and veterinary school students would be good way to deal with it. 7/19/2011 4:46 PM See earlier responses re: signs and educational campaigns to de al with many of these concerns (ecosystem, garden, landscaping damage; deer/veh icle collisons, etc.) 7/16/2011 7:46 PM THE BEST GOVERNMENT IS THE LEAST. DEAL WITH YOUR PERSONAL DEER PROBLEM IN YOUR OWN FASHION. 7/16/2011 6:59 PM Educate people to learn to live with and appreciate naturedri ving watchfully, planting deer resi stant shrubs e tc., even watching out for turt les on the roadand maybe even quit littering. Life i s shortwhy not be part of it instead of the incessant whining and resisting of everything in the natural world. 7/ 16/2011 12:38 AM The large number of deer/vehicle collisions is largely a people management issue, rather than a deermanagement issue. 7/15/2011 10:23 PM I like having the deer in our n eighborhood they are an asset . You could put up signs on streets warning unwary m otorists to watch out for deerjust like they need to do in the country. 7/15/2011 8:34 PM 178 no deer would make me happy 7/15/2011 3:18 PM Deer are above the preColumbian populations in Indiana. I don' t want to introduce predators so let's expand hunting. 7/15/2011 2:06 PM Honestly ... I have no idea. Deer are simultaneously annoying a s hell and impossibly cute. I like that my kids can s ee deer in our yard and it's evi dence that Bloomington has a viable \"urban forest\". Dee r just kind of come with a tree city designation. On the other hand, it's heartbreaking to see a deer limping around because you know it slipped on an icy road or was struck by a car. It also sucks to return home from vacation and find all your hasta s mowed to the nub. I guess I l ean to a reduced number of deer, but what should that population be and how much am I willing to spend to make it happen? 7/15/2011 9:19 AM Get rid of them. I fear it will take a small child being attack ed to get anything done. It is very sad 7/14/2011 6:27 PM If people would leave the area. 7/14/2011 3:01 PM Virtually no deer. Ours is an urban neighborhood. This is not a case of building in deer habitat. As I understand it , this population moved in arou nd 2003, and for some reason was allowed to grow. They seem to be two herds, of nine or ten each. 7/14/2011 12:46 AM There are devices to place on ve hicles that warn of deer in the vecinity. Raise enough garden fo both; you donate to shelters etc why not deer. Resident need to get on with their lives and enjoy the beauty of the animals.Orn amental yard are jus stuff to impress your neighbors Jones vs Smith's. 7/14/201 1 12:16 AM no deer 7/14/2011 11:48 AM Deer do not belong in the city on busy streets. 7/14/2011 11 :22 AM A reduced number of deer will automatically lead to all the abo ve! 7/14/2011 9:58 AM No task force needed either. 7/14/2011 7:58 AM Leave the animals alone. 7/14/2011 7:47 AM TOLERANCE TOLERANCE TOLERANCE TOLERANCE AND MAYBE YOU CAN CHANGE ALL THE OPINIONS YOU HAVE THAT YOU TRY TO FORCE ON OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE DECIDED T O OPEN YOUR BIG MOUTH. 7/14 /2011 7:38 AM This is the stupidest idea since well the flower pots all over our streets, millions of dollars in walking paths the list is endless how about a task f orce on getting jobs moved into our community that do not deal with IU or oops I for got there is nothing else but fast food and ??????? 7/13/2011 9:50 PM How do we know we need improved health? Are they not healthy no w? By \"community\", I mean urban area 7/13/2011 9:37 PM Deer are a nuisance animal in th e city. No solution that \"prote cts\" or increases deer population is reasonable. 7/13/2011 8:22 PM quit taking their land and building bloomington, lets discuss p arking downtown 7/13/2011 7:55 PM Resident complaints are not a go od indicator. Some people would complain if they lost one plant or saw any deer. Although anyone can have a collision, many could be avoided if people were more attentive and cautious drivers. Rab bits are almost as 179 big a problem as deer in some years and many people don't even know how to determine which animals are eati ng their plants. I don't believ e lost off ornamental landscaping should even be consi dered significant since lots of the ornamentals are probably nonnative and possibly invasive and wreck as much hav oc as the deer population. 7/13/2011 7:43 PM Sycamore Knolls has experienced several confrontations between pets and people by agressive does, even when fawns weren't visible. 7/13/201 1 5:37 PM Real success would be for your group to disband. 7/13/2011 5 :05 PM I think people need to accept the deer or move to an area that does not have a \"deer problem.\" 7/13/2011 4:04 PM Leagalize Bow hunting in the city 7/13/2011 3:13 PM controlled culling of the herd, with resulting meat distributed to local food banks. 7/13/2011 3:08 PM It is definitely a CITY problem and a danger to drivers in all areas of Monroe County., 7/13/2011 2:55 PM Deer are a part of our environme nt just like squirrels and birds. Ideally, I would like to leave the deer as they are and get a tax break on humane gar den/plant preservation methods like netting, sprays, fencing. 7/13/201 1 2:18 PM I think that the deer task force will be helpful in more urban areas, but don't feel like the rural areas really need muc h addressing. 7/13/2011 2:05 PM STOP taking natural forest land which is their natural habitat to build widen ....THEY WERE HERE FIRST................... 7/13/2011 1:42 PM Not having deer in my yard every time I come home at night. 7/13/2011 12:58 AM People management is whats needed. 7/13/2011 12:37 AM Fewer limping or injured deer 7/13/2011 9:33 AM Any one of the above would be welcome evidence. :) 7/12/2011 5:56 PM As previously stated, I like seeing deer in the neighborhood, but I am concerned for the herd(s) that they might be outgrowing their ability to live in a densely populated neighborhood, and face starvation, disease, or getting run over . Can we cull the herd in a human way every so often? Relocate a few deer, or steriliz e some of the females to keep the herd size in check? 7/12/2011 2:13 PM Deer do not belong in the city period. Up to 10 years ago we di d not have deer in our neighborhood, except in Deer Park. Now they are an every day, A LL DAY, experience, foraging for food. This year we h ad a deer with a totally torn up belly recooperating in our back yard. 7/9/2011 10:37 AM whatever management program you adopt there will be a cost that (i feel) will be much higher than any \"effect\" from the program. the deer will c ome back. the flowers will be eaten. this is t he complaint du jour. Give them a token solution you can afford. And save the money, time, and effort for things tha t you can really change like sidewalks, drainage, planting trees, etc. 7/8/2011 4: 52 PM 180 Question 20. \"What approach to deer do you prefer in your neighborhood? Before you answer this question, please familiarize yourself with the management options as summarized by the Task Force via its community outreach meetings or its Management FAQs. If 'other,' please explain.\" encourage natural predators of deer. 9/17/2011 11:30 AM I am totally against wounded dee r in our neighborhoods; this vi olence is a bad example for our children and a poor model of tolerance for all live forms 9/16/2011 8:36 PM Deer are beautiful animals who u nfortunately live in a town pac ked with people, homes and cars. I'd support steri lizing or relocating them st udies show that other communities HAVE done so successf ully otherwise, let's do the best we can not to hit them and to allow them to li ve in our community. Hunting, e uthanizing or sharpshooting??? You have got t o be kidding! 9/16/2011 6:13 PM If hunting, sharpshooting or trapping and euthanizing are ever permitted in this community, that would be HORRIFIC. 9/16/2011 4:59 PM Provide feeding areas, apple trees etc. Leave them alone! Do so mething constructive for a change you forced ugly bik e paths on us. spy on grass hei ghts. code enforcement crap. rental restricts. 9/16/2011 8:46 AM Sterilization is too expensive. This deer population is destroy ing our city. All gardeners have come to hate them for the money they cost us and the damage they create. Tall fencing is an option but will destroy the open fee l and sight line or many areas. Either cull the deer or update the fencing laws so we ca n protect our property. 9/15/2011 9:22 PM Bow and Arrow sharpshooters shou ld be encouraged to participate in a doe kill in specified sections of the communi ty that express the greatest loss. All meat should be given to the Community Kitchen . If a resident wants a kill t o happen on their property they could be requested to buy the permit for the sharpshooter. Other communities in other states have had success with this bow and arrow hunts; however, I did not see reference in the information that other communities had been contacted and yet this proc ess has taken more than a year so another three fawn are now grazing in th e yard! 9/15/2011 4:31 PM Sharpshooting is ridiculous. Som eone will get hurt. Over hostas ? This is a total waste of taxpayer funds. 9/15/2011 3:53 PM Repellents and scare tactics do n ot work in the long run. The herd needs to be thinned. 9/15/2011 3:00 PM Want neighbors to stop feeding! 9/15/2011 11:38 AM This problem is not going away i s only going to get worse I liv e in near east an old neighborhood. This is not country 9/15/2011 11:20 AM Several of these options are ver y costly so I'm sure that they are not an option. 9/15/2011 9:41 AM Fencing, moving to deer resistant plants and repellants already widely in use and only marginally effective. 9/15/2011 9:37 AM The meat from the deer could be donated to community food banks. 9/15/2011 8:41 AM 181 Educating people NOT to put out salt licks, or other things to attract the deer, would be helpful. Having neighbors who try to \"care\" for the wild ani mals in the neighborhood only adds to the p roblems. 9/15/2011 8:34 AM Maybe you could partner with the local resident who developed the electrical deer moving device and he could use B loomington as a case study of how to move deer out of an urban area into a fore sted area. Perhaps these devices could be used to drive the deer to forested areas . Once the deer have been moved to another area that needs them in town. Then we should raise the number of dee r that a hunter can hunt. giving either a small cash donation, tax write off but th ey have to donate the hunted venison to a food bank/co mmunity kitchen. As a fundraise r local restaurant chefs could put together a speci al venison dinner or/and cookbo ok that could be sold for deer management. 9/13/2011 9:37 AM Public education and deer resista nt plants should be pursued in conjunction with a control strategy such as hunting and sharpshooting and in order to achieve the most balanced approach and the highest viable social carrying capacity. 9/13/2011 9:02 AM I am a single parent. I could fence in my entire yard, but have considered it a very large expense. This year to grow food I have chosen to rent a p lot and drive my car to a garden. This seems asinine to me, but at least I will be a ble to grow food. 9/13/2011 8:46 AM I do not know to what extent a p lan is needed or which methods are best. 9/13/2011 8:35 AM I am not marking any of the othe r options because of possible m isinterpretation in compiled results of this survey. If we had the same biomass of rats in Bloomington, the city would have exterminators going door to door. The deer population throughout southern Indiana is ten times higher than the sustai nable level for protecting the plant biodiversit y. The concept of maintaining a n urban deer population is shortsighted nons ense. The current growth in the urban deer population is due to the previous availability of suitable food plants, but they are eliminating those plants as thei r population overshoots a dwind ling carrying capacity. 9/13/2011 7:51 AM Combination of suggestions depen ding on the findings 9/12/20 11 10:58 AM Bow Hunting 9/12/2011 10:22 AM Supports Sterilization in limited number of deer. 9/12/2011 9:58 AM Could \"herder\" dogs be used. (On a lighter note, how about tige rs from the Feline Rescue at Centerpoint IN? :) 9/11/2011 6:35 PM Address the cause of this develo pment which is over development and building activity and coming along with t he lack of green corridors that allow the deer to travel to the forest. Encourage green corridors at easements an d private lots. The deer are trapped in the city; the y did not choose this habitat. Fox, coyote, and other predators are a good prey animal management plan we have too many rabbits too and they eat my lettuce as well. A nd yes predators can live nea r humans. The literature shows that coyote liv e in Chicago and they will not eat your baby or pet dog !! 9/9/2011 12:57 AM 182 Just to comment, I think relocat ion (even with the consequences) should be part of the solution along with sterilization. Any option such as fenci ng or scaring deer away pushes the problem to the n ext neighbor. Its not the deer's fault they're not in a suitable habitat, so I hesitat e on other options in the direc tion of euthanizing or hunting. Similar to cat/dog population control, sterilization seems a better option, in spite of its problems. 9/9/2011 12:46 AM This is a technical question that I'm not qualified to answer. Other communities across the country face this problem. As with streets, city man agement, or any other municipal problem, the city shou ld follow best practices. 9/8/2011 8:34 AM the deer in my neighborhood are s o unafraid of people you don't even need a sharpshooter. you could get with in 5 feet of the deer and they don't even move 9/7/2011 10:07 PM The public is pretty well educat ed on this issue, deer resistan t plants don't address the issue of trying to use native plants, fencing is expensive and prohibited in front yards, contraception and sterilization too expensive, relocatio n unrealistic. Would like to see deer used as food source for Community Kitchen, etc . 9/5/2011 8:15 PM There are a lot of overreactive myths out there about deer. We have not been over run by deer in our \"neck of the woods\" and I am in a rural area. Other animals cause more damage to gardens, ie. rabbits, than the deer have last ye ar and this summer. I just think the loudest voices in Bloomington have been the mose UNINFORMED voices. Let's keep our heads cool and work this out thoughtfull y and responsibly. 8/5/2011 4:39 PM I only oppose those checked as th ey are costly and don't tend t o work well. Removal is usually proven to be the best option. 8/5/2011 4:11 PM Bow and arrow 8/3/2011 2:07 PM I would like to see a notforpr ofit catch deer and start a meat processing plant. Teach the unemployed how to work in the plant, and use the prod ucts to sell to the community or feed the poor. This creates jobs, feeds the poor, creates a manufacturing situation, and gro ws the tax base. \"Teach them to fish.....\" 8/1/2011 4:48 PM Reduction/elimination of the dee r population in the urban envir onment. Deer do not belong in neighborhoods that are 4060 years old within the city! There is no shortage of deer in Indiana there are too many deer in Indian a. This is not a natural situation. There are no predator s to keep the deer population i n check. Feed the needy with the meat th at can be harvested. 7/30/2011 12:02 A M I have fencing around my backyar d and the deer jump over it to enter my yard. 7/26/2011 1:03 PM I truly believe people make too much out of the whole thing! Ye s, they eat my prize roses......unless I take the respo nsibility of covering them or spraying them or moving them to our back yard that has a tall privacy fence (tha t they could jump over but don't) I recently had grandchildren living in our neighborhood for 5 years on Montclaire and although they were active and outside each da y playing, walking to and from school, etc. not ONC E did they feel threatened by a deer although they saw them daily. Do I believe ther e have been a few instances wh ere the mother doe 183 acted bold and not afraid? Yes, I do but I believe a little pub lic education about how to respond to this could go a long way in solving the problem. Twenty years ago, we lived on Sanibel Island, FL where alligators roamed the bike paths and sunned in people's back yards now that IS a dangerous animal, but the s chool children and adults were educated about how to avoid encounters. We lived fo r a year recently in Orange Co. California where there are many mountain lions roami ng the hills....once again, very dangerous animals and once again, people are expect ed to respect the signs and warnings in the paper about how to avoid contact and what to do if you see one. So, when I hear all the uproar over the predominately gentle, shy deer even though they eat plants we d on't want them to and a few try to protect their fawns from dogs (by the way, I h ave a dog and keep him away fro m any deer when we're walking it's pretty simple to head in the opposite dire ction when one is spotted) , I have to almost laugh and want to say, listen peopl e, we truly don't have a SERIOUS problem, just an inconvenient one. 7/23/2011 10:52 PM Basically I think the deer will just die out. The people and th eir pets have taken the habitat and made it too dificult for the deer to survive. Dogs and cats make niose, bring disease, and are destructive. The cats kill hundreds of b irds in our neighborhood, and use the sand boxes as bathroom boxes. I have never seen the so called \"aggressive deer\", although I can see that if they are attacked by a dog that they will respond.n I would like to see a committee formed to reduce the number of cats, frankly. 7/23/2011 1:41 PM Repellants and scaring devices.... where are they supposed to go ? That is not a good solution. 7/23/2011 1:17 PM Basically, anything to rid our neighborhood of deer. 7/21/2011 3:27 PM Deer resistant plants do not \"work\" eventually the deer eat t hem. Hunting and Sharpshooting there are food banks all over Monroe County th at could benefit from the food. We just need to or ganize the hunters and the dis tributors. 7/20/2011 10:30 PM What is \"sharpshooting?\" If it is to kill them, no. Allow bow h unting to thin the numbers to healthy levels and slow down the destruction over po pulation produces. I have a steel chain link fence around my yard, to keep neighbo rs from using it as conduit to park. They were tramp ling it and disturbing our cats. The deer simply jump right over it, plus it is open on one side to allow a drai nage path that goes under our back yard to enter tha t drains the south side of the entire neighborhood. 7/20/2011 4:15 PM Be smart on this ... these are no t Bambi. We have removed their natural predators and are feeding them our lawns. just like large rodents they ha ve run amuck. 7/19/2011 6:44 PM I understa nd that hunting cannot be done within the city limits. Will hunting outside the city limits possibly reduce t he number of deer within the city? 7/17/2011 10:10 PM I understand that it is not possi ble to introduce wolves, but that would be absolutely ideal. Try to find a way! 7/17/2011 11:55 AM MAKE THE DEER WEAR ORANGE JACKE TS SO THEY CAN BE SEEN AND AVOID ED 7/16/2011 7:01 PM 184 Helena Montana used sharpshooters about three years ago and too k out around 200 deer. It can be done. 7/16/2011 11:12 AM If deer are going to be hunted as part of a deer management program, the hunters MUST be experienced and tested for marksmanship ability (including archers and those who use firearms). They mu st obtain Monroe County Deer Ma nagement Program _Membership_ by passing m arksmanship tests. Deer who are hunted must be cleanly killed, not left inju red or halfdead, so ammunition and weapons must be approved by a Monroe County Deer Management Program _Membership Board_. 7/15/2011 10:56 PM Kill the deer and give the meat to the hungry, there's plenty of hungry people around. 7/15/2011 3:21 PM hunting if the meat can be use d by someone 7/15/2011 1:49 PM this entire phobia on deer is a waste of our time and taxpayer money. Stop obsessing about this. 7/15/2011 12:11 AM The Sarkas Tarzian property was deer habitat until it became De er Park; then fences were put up on the perimeter and the deer were removed to the n eighborhood. I suggest herding the deer back to Deer Park. 7/15/2011 9:34 A M I can't state strongly enough ho w I feel about hunting deer in the city limits. My kids are frequent visitors to the woods near my house and even the b est hunters occasionally miss their intended target. I'm neutral on the ide a of trap and euthanize as long as the traps themselves aren't lethal and can't accid entally hurt someone. 7/15/2011 9:23 AM I didn't think that sterilisatio n was a viable option but it if is, then that is a possibility. 7/15/2011 9:00 AM Not using guns, but skilled crossbowers to kill a huge amount of deer. This infestation has happened here in the last 3 or 4 years. It has grown rapidly and, as in people population explosions, ca n only grow exponentially until there is a fair amount of disaster. 7/14/2011 8:21 PM I believe that if deer are to be killed in any way that the deer meat should be utilized, given to food banks, etc. 7/14/2011 8:06 PM I dont feel as though we should have to fence all of our yards to deal with this issue. Sterilization and transporting to another area do not work. Kil l them, give the meat to the Community Kitchen and Shalom Center. 7/14/2011 6:31 P M I think there could be a \"hunt\" where the food then goes to the local foodbanks. Something must be done when we a re slamming on brakes in the mi ddle of the day as the deer cross High, Hillside, and other busy streets. 7/ 14/2011 4:39 PM The deer should be hunted and th e meat can be used in the many community kitchens or for the hungry. Take care of two problems at once. If you trap and relocate deer, they or other dee r can find their way back, not a very smart solution. If you trap and euthanize, be sure that the meat is used for food. An animal that is killed purposely should be eaten. 7/14/2011 4:17 PM People should leave the area. 7/14/2011 3:05 PM For those deer that are hunted the meet should be given to the needy or sold. 7/14/2011 2:33 PM 185 I live with hunters nearby const antly. They are singleminded, discourteous, dangerous, and do not observe \"season restrictions.\" My family is not able to walk safely on our own land during certain times of the year because of reckless hunters. I do not believe sanctioned hunts of any type would be healthy for deer or humans. We must find a better way to solve this problem. 7/14/2011 2 :25 PM no noncese approach is hunting. N ot only the hunters them selves would have food but if they got over quota they could give to food banks or others that were not able to afford meat in stores. Deer is a high protine low fat meat. Any other method is coastly and infective. Deer will come back to where they feel s afe and town in safe no hunters no natural preditors. With in 5=7 years it would be right back to where it is now. 7/14/2011 2:24 PM How do hunting and sharpshooting differ? 7/14/2011 2:09 PM I realize there is no easy or cheap solution. Or one that every one can easily stomach. But it should have been handled b ack when there were two deer. This isn't like \"weeds,\" where the solution is fo r people to adjust their idea of what plants are acceptable. Name a big mammal, and 20 of them in an urban neigh borhood is a bad idea. 7/14/2011 12:50 AM Put yourself in the deer's place....which one of the above woul d you like to be chosen for. I think euthanize might fit the bill best. I think all the Developers that took their lands from them should be trapped and shot! Then there would be no problem! 7/14/2011 12:23 AM There are hungry people in our c ommunity. Each of the deer can provide significant amounts of protein. Its solipsis tic and thoughtless to let thes e deer live here as if we, the people, were in a wild environment. But, since they are here, let them feed hungry people on a sustainab le basis. 7/14/2011 11:51 AM Citizens who consider this a rea l problem might be willing to c ontribute dollars to hire skilled hunters to do away with the deer and to process th e meat for the food banks. 7/14/2011 11:26 AM Ordinances (with stiff fines) fo r those (including some in my n eighborhood) who put out corn every night to feed the deer and other wildlifet hus encouraging them to stay. I don't mind bird feeder s (I have one), but not deer a nd rodent feeders! 7/14/2011 10:02 AM have a list of land owners that will allow hunting on their pro perty (bow or gun). Then, hunters can look at list a nd contact property owner. Their are always hunters looking for access and property owners that would allow hunting but no one ask. This would mesh the 2. Also a veniso n donation campaign for local food banks would help with acceptance of area residents and put venison to good use. 7/14/2011 9:11 AM I marked several possibilities since I think multiple approache s should be applied simultaneously to really be effective. I marked \"strongly oppos ed\" to several options since I believe that they would never be realistically consider ed (although might very well be effective if used) and so and indicating my suppor t for them would be totally worthless. 7/14/2011 8:36 AM 186 I hunt, but allowing open season in the city limits is madness. Extended hunting season may help. Placing a \"boun ty\" on deer may encourage more hunting. Donation of deer meat to local agencies would certainly please some. 7/14/2011 8:11 AM LEAVE THEM ALONE. There are more important things (like educati on for our children and the homeless) to wo rry about than the deer populat ion. 7/14/2011 8:00 WORK IN THE COMMUNITY KITCHEN OR HELP O THER PEOPLE AND STOP THE ATTACK ON ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE DEER. 7/14/2011 7:41 AM As discharging a firearm is illegal witin city limits sharpshoo ting is not an option. However, 'sharpshooting' or hunt ing with bow and arrow should b e considered as an alternative. The deer have to be culled. 7/14/2011 7:11 A M bow hunting, safer, quieter 7/13/2011 11:38 PM Hunting only to use meat to feed the hungry and or give meat to be used. 7/13/2011 9:53 PM you have to be very careful not to stress the deer they can bec ome too stressed and die 7/13/2011 7:57 PM Educate people. I hear negative comments about all sorts of wil dlife, not just deer. People have the wrong attitude a nd feel more compelled to take the easy route of eliminating animals rather than learning to live with them. Eve n coyotes have some impact on deer populations but most people would just as soon s ee them eliminated too, and any other predators tha t would have a positive impact on the deer population would be viewed even more negatively. 7/13/2011 7:49 PM My husband wants to shoot them with a paint gun. 7/13/2011 5:31 PM I really don't know what the sol ution is. The deer are beautful creations. 7/13/2011 3:59 PM Better lighting around busy street s (High Street, for example), so motorists can see deer crossing the road more easily. 7/13/2011 3:52 PM Trap and kill for butchering t hen in freezer 7/13/2011 3:17 PM Kosher butcher 7/13/2011 3:13 PM have extended hunting and give meat to the community kitchen 7/13/2011 2:58 PM The FAQ document is quite unhelp ful. It paints both \"handsoff\" and \"handson\" approaches as unrealistic and ma kes it really difficult to answ er question 20. 7/13/2011 2:27 PM STOP some of the construction...they have no where else to run to....................IT WAS THEIR HOME TO BEGIN WITH............ 7/13/2011 1:45 PM While there are not deer in my neighborhood, I believe they are a problem in Bloomington as a whole. I support action being taken to control the population. 7/13/2011 1:23 PM 187 I support management of the deer in the county if it means the deer are not killed or injured. The deer were here befo re man. Urban sprawl is a problem, and we continue to build houses everywhere there is land (it seems). The deer must go somewhere when the woods are torn down. 7/13/2011 1:17 PM Do something to increase deer's natural predators (wolves) in the area. Education public about how to live among w olves and deer (don't keep smal l dogs outside). 7/13/2011 1:14 PM Enacting a law against feeding deer and enforcing it with stiff fines. It is not enough to simply educate people. Most people know that it is unwise to feed deer. If they knew they could face stiff moneta ry penalties by doing so, with a high likelihood of being caught, fewer people would feed deer. 7/13/2011 1:00 P M Allow hunter to come in ones a y ear for a time kill as many as they want. 7/13/2011 12:54 AM They should rise to limit on deer hunting 7/13/2011 12:43 AM Too bad we aren't discussing thi s approach for other annoying p opulations. 7/13/2011 12:39 AM I am okay with hunting as an ove rall part of the solution, part iculary where the deer remains are put to good use, but I live in the city limits and so this is not an option for our neighborhood. 7/13/2011 12:31 AM Promote education on controlling human population so there is r oom for deer and eventually predators. County's p lan to increase lot sizes and control additional building on slopes is step in right direction. 7/13/2011 11: 54 AM Reintroduce large predators. Wolves, cougars. Reduce global hum an population. 7/13/2011 11:07 AM No good options, according to your FAQs, but if we could eat th em, the population would decline. Hunting with guns has dangers, maybe less with a rrows. How about running them to exhaustion, like some Africans do, and then kil ling them humanely? Probably impractical, but we nee d to come up with some answers. Thanks for your work on this. 7/13/2011 10:08 AM Organized program for selective harvest. 7/13/2011 9:48 AM With people on welfare in our co mmunity, and with our community kitchens going without enough food, why can't th e deer be harvested by experts and the meat given to the needy and sold to cover t he expenses of such an undertaking. Yes, I realize this is too obvious a choice for our socalled progressive town of Bloomington, but you can't say it isn't sensible. Deer are a food source in a co mmunity where there are people going hungry. 7/12/2011 11:39 PM What about tranquilizer dart and euthanize? 7/12/2011 11:37 PM 188 Question 21. \"Any other comments?\" I like seeing deer and other wildlife in the neighborhood. I think we should coexist in a healthy ecosystem. But we need to reduce the current pop ulation and find a way to control it, since the deer habitat decreases dramatically (e.g., Ramsey Farm) each year. I am willing to co ntribute my share to the cos t of humane control (birth control, sterilization), if the city will not pay for it. The deer have learned to make our yards their habitat, not simply a forage area. We have to learn to select plants that do not attract them, kno wing that they may still eat them. 9/17/2011 3:35 PM Public education is desperately needed. People need to be taugh t NOT to feed the deer because then they lose their fear of humans and can become very dangerous. (2) I have lived in Bloomington f or nearly 40 years. In that ti me the deer problem has worsened significantly, and my guess is in another 10 years the deer will outnumber the people. Why not ta ckle the problem now before it becomes even more difficult? 9/17/2011 11:32 AM Drive carefully and enjoy these beautiful creatures. 9/16/2011 8:39 PM Please consider the kind of commu nity we wish to be. I urge a d ecision that supports life and leans toward cooperatio n with our animal neighbors. I shudder at the thought of our children, whom we encourage to love animals, seeing bleeding, scared deer going through their y ards and along the streets. Ha ve you heard a deer scream? It is an ugly thing I do not want my children exposed t o. We need to be a safe and civil city for all beings. 9/16/2011 8:39 PM Please think carefully about cre ating a truly humane and sustai nable society before reaching your final judgment. The deer and other wild animals s hould have a place in our human world. We can prote ct our food with fences. 9/1 6/2011 8:26 PM Please make some logical decisions on this one. Killing deer be cause they are a nuisance or eat neighborhood plants is unacceptable. 9/16/20 11 6:14 PM Let's keep Bloomington the compa ssionate, caring and progressiv e community it long has been. Killing innocent d eer will be unacceptable. 9 /16/2011 5:01 PM Laws and fines against neighbors who purposely attract deer by feeding them and putting out salt or mineral b locks. 9/16/2011 10:43 AM The Eva Brown Home @ 3532 E. 3rd needs to become Deer refuge an d preserved as historic site at all cost, city needs to purchase and preserve it! We have community kitchens for homeless where our city operated feed and nesting acres to encourage wildlife habitat sanctuaries? There is NO management of anythin g in Monroe County. IU students are encouraged to register to vote when they don't live here, IU controls city politics! Hoosier acres needs golf cart permits between sm ith rd south side of third st. college mall and moor es pike... A far greater communi ty asset than worrying about our pe rmanent wild life welcome rsidents: racoons, possom, etc. 9/16/2011 8:46 AM the presence of wildlife like de er influenced me to buy my hous e in Bloomington 9/16/2011 12:26 AM Capture, contraception, and sterilization are not viable option s. 9/16/2011 12:20 AM 189 Glad the community is studying t he issue and planning to deal w ith it. 9/15/2011 10:32 PM It is ironic that Bloomington has a leash law for domesticated animals such as dogs and yet the city permits large a nd potentially dangerous animals to wander at will through our yards and city streets. 9/15/2011 9:40 PM Please take care of this issue. It is a matter of time before l ymes disease arrives with severe consequences. I am for cu lling and most or my neigbors a re also. 9/15/2011 9:24 PM We have a high enough population of deer. Open the town to a 1 week bow hunting season in the first week of November. All licenses required. 9/15/2011 8:49 PM I have successfully handled deer d amage with careful use of rep ellent sprays, planting deer resistant plants, and fencing one small area. I h ave never been threatened by deer. 9/15/2011 7:48 PM We have had one deer have three sets of twins in our back yard/ lot in the past 3 years. We enjoy seeing them, but have to block off our yard if we want to have any flowers or vegetables!!! They eat everything within sight if al lowed to get to it. We have spent hundreds of dollars o n fencing and liquid sprayon repellant to try to keep our flowers and tomatoes each summer, and sometimes it works and sometimes they still get in the \" barrier\" we put up with the fencing. I wish there were some sort of birth control you could add to corn or some f ood that they could eat and not reproduce anymore. thanks! 9/15/2011 6:07 PM It is time to take the issue of deer damage to garden plants seriouly. 9/15/2011 5:50 PM Do something!!!!! 9/15/2011 4:53 PM Interesting that the this site i s powered by SurveryMonkey so I suggest no more \"monkeying\" around by a committee or City Council and let's beg in the process of reduction where residents are calling for it and if a section of Bloomington or the 2 mile fringe doesn't want it....th at's okay to put them at the b ottom of the action. But please start with those of us requesting results. Thanks very m uch. 9/15/2011 4:31 PM NO sharpshooters!!! No bow hunters!!! Tell people to plant something the deer will leave alone. It works. 9/15/2011 3:54 PM I've lived in Bloomington for a y ear now and have been shocked by the number of deer within city limits. I've been in a deervehicle collision before that totaled my car (not in Indiana), so I'm par ticularly aware of the issue. I am very concerned about the possibility of deers transm itting diseases, too. 9 /15/2011 3:24 PM TAKE ACTION AND QUIT TALKING ABOUT IT. 9/15/2011 3:00 PM This is a quality of life issue for many people. It is also, at least potentially, a public health issue. My youngest children are teenagers, but I wonder about the little ones across the street and the deer fe ces that are scattered in our neighboirhood daily. 9/15/2011 2:48 PM I enjoy seeing the deer actually . We have delighten in watching fawns being raised this year. Even though they do e at plants in my yard, it's annoying but I should have selected a better deer resistant plant. They are part of the na tural landscape and ecosystem and we need to get along with them. We can intelligen tly select ways in 190 which to do that they don't ha ve that ability, only we do. I don't HAVE to have a garden in my yard that's why I can go to the farmers' market. People who insist on having things a certain way aren't in line with nature and real ity. 9/15/2011 1:52 PM The deer in my yard regularly de cimate approximately half of ex tensive plantings of hosta and other ornamentals. The most effective deterrent has b een a product called Liquid Fence expensive but wor th it. This, of course, involves labor to spray without the prospect of rain. 9/15/2011 1:20 PM Please, under all circumstance s, do not kill the deer. 9/15/2011 1:06 PM This entire Bloomington Community is being overrun by deer; I s ee them on Hillside Drive, Winslow Road, Sare Road, Snoddy Road, Rhorer Road, Smith Road, South Walnut, on and on most areas i n which I drive. I do believe w e have a serious problem with the deer population and while I know it is not an easy one to solve, something must be done. Otherwis e, greenspace for which Bloomington is well known will be decimated and flower and vegetable growers/lovers will no longer wish to live here. I am one of those! 9/15/2011 11:39 AM Not doing anything will mean a b igger problem later. The herds just get bigger and aggressive. Truly someone is going to get hurt 9/15/2011 11: 21 AM As far as community problems go, the growing deer population (i f it is growing) is pretty minor. I'd rather see the town and county put their reso urces elsewhere. Collisions would be a public safety problem, but I don't know how common they are. Highspeed collisions would be t he biggest problem, but that's not a neighborhood problem. I'd rather see the city and county concentrate on maki ng the area more bike friendly in stead of overly worrying about deer. 9/15/2011 10:27 AM Salt licks with contraceptives would be a reasonable way to lim it the number of deer in the city. As I write this, th ere are 5 deer lounging in my y ard which overlooks a creek. It's their mid morning ritual each day. They have eaten every impatient, hosta and begonia available. Our planter boxes on the porch pro vide a salad bar for them each morning. We have lost hundreds of dollars in plants. Our yard is shaded and so we are limited to the typ e of plants we can grow. Good Luck making everyone happy with this \"growing\" problem. 9/15/2011 9:47 AM Fencing is unsightly and expensive. Repellants of short duratio n, and the palate of deerresistant plants is small. 9/15/2011 9:38 AM I realize this is a difficult i ssue but it has become impossibl e to garden in my yard as it appears to be on a daily (or n ightly) migration path for many deer. If they are 'creatures of habit' who travel the same paths through neighborhood s, I can support planned killing with meat going to food pantries. 9/15/2011 9:19 AM Quality of life for both the deer and Bloomington citizens has suffered by having these beautiful creatures so clo se to our densely populated cit y. Please do not ignore the problem any longer!! 9/15/2011 8:53 AM I always drive 1015 miles under the speed limit when I am driv ing on High St. as I've had 2 incidents where I've almost hit a deer. I warn every one that drives that way to keep there eye out for deer . I also worry about the heal th of biodiversity among plant species. People need to understand that high deer p opulations are not only unsafe for us, but bad for the overall health of the deer as well. I think it would 191 be a great idea to donate the venison to local food banks. I wo uld even pay for the meat! I love venison! 9/15/2011 8:44 AM Have had baby deer born in back yard and left by mother to hide for day. Have seen as many as 8 deer in herd, travel ing through back yard. Completely eaten hostas and tomato plants this past summer. D eer seem to have a regular pat h through our back yard. We keep seeing some of say deer over and over (one doe ha s a distinctive limb, left front leg). Leave for work at 05:30 am, see lots of deer in yards in Gentry Esates. 9/15/2011 8:28 AM Plants and shrubs are things that can be replaced. Deer, if gon e, cannot be replaced. Respect our wildlife. An option for those opposed to the deer p opulation would be to relocate to the downtown area where there are fewer deer and less wildlife. Thank you 9/15/2011 8:27 AM My wife and I have walked our dogs in the neighborhood for years without any problems.Our dogs are accustomed to seeing the deer and the dee r do not seem to be bothered by the dogs, only cautious.. 9/15/2011 7:21 AM Hunting is probably the most humane thing you can do to lower n umber of deer in urban areas. Donate meat to food programs. 9/14/2011 1:58 PM HC 26 Married Couple If nothing i s done we may expect a doubling of the deer population yearly, alone with a doubling of deer/vehicle collisions, deer tick populations, with potential Lyme's disease implications, declin es in biodiversity, problems with ornamental and edi ble plants and so forth. we hav e created an ideal habitat for the deer and eliminated natural predators. It is ou r responsibility to protect human life and property as well as the natural environm ent. Through sharpshooting and donation of th e meat to food banks. If the ci ty does nothing about the deer, there will be more incidents of people trying to take things into their own hands such as occurred recently i n Morgan County. If the city d oes not eliminated the deer, then they must at least allow people to surround thei r property with high enough fences including front ya rds to keep the deer out! Our o nce beautiful front yard shade garden has been decimated by the deer. 9/13/2011 9:55 AM HC 25 I have lived here 11 years and until they put in Renwick I did not see deer in my yard. Once they started comin g in my yard and our addition I think i is a shame that something hasn't been done on Sare Rd. to keep automobiles from killing the deer and fawns. I really like the deer and they are welcome in my yard anytime. 9/13/2011 9:46 AM HC 22 I have deer in my backyard I am afraid to walk in the y ard without looking. I feel this is wrong that I should be afraid on m y own property I think the only way people in Bloomington will take decide to get serious is only a fter a child has been killed. 9/13/2011 9:30 AM We have a severe deer problem in SE Bloomington. Unfortunately, the solutions are likely to rankle many of our cit izens and thereby cause us to do too little to resolve the problem. I hope I'm wrong. HC 20 9/13/2011 9:17 AM Great job task force! Your thoro ugh, inclusive, balanced, open approach is impressive and appreciated. HC 17 9/13/2011 9:02 AM Encourage trained hunters with l arger limits or long season in county wide area HC 15 9/13/2011 8:52 AM 192 I read in the Commission minutes w here a member stated that dee r were a part of the ecosystem. I do not understand this as we are not allowing cougars within the city limits. I have enjoyed seeing occasional deer, but feel in creasingly frustrated by the growing population in my area. HC 14 9/13/2011 8:47 AM Pass a fencein, not fenceout, law regarding deer. Prohibit th e feeding (including salt) of deer within Bloomington. Eliminate the deer, either on a citywide basis or in response to specific complaint s I will happy to complain abo ut the deer that are in my yard daily if there is someon e with the authority to do some thing about the problem. Educate people about what they can do on their own property within the city and pass the appropriate laws regarding liability. For exa mple, if some shoots a deer with an arrow while on his or her property, but the deer r uns off to die elsewhere, is there any liabil ity issue? 9/13/2011 8:04 AM HC 6 14 years old 9/12/2011 10:54 AM HC 4 My cat has been attacked by does with no visible fawns 9/12/2011 10:22 AM I personally love seeing the dee r around but have almost, on se veral occasions, hit them driving very slowly through my neighborhood. Especially th e fawns. Also it's a daily battle to prevent them from eating my hosta, impatiens, p hlox, and other plants that both I and the deer love. I don't know what means i s best to control them. I know I don't want them killed. Thanks for this survey. 9/12/2011 7:19 AM I find it sad that we are spending time and resources on this b ecause some people with expensive gardens value them over animal wellbeing. I sig ned the original survey to study this issue but q uickly realized the proponents were focused instead on killing the deer. The only in tervention I support is somethi ng that will protect and enhance deer health. People with gardens can build fences i f they care that much. I've had a lot of damage to our garden and that's just the way it goes when you are sharing a habitat with different creatures. 9/9/2011 4:10 PM The FAQ was helpful to understand the Task Force's challenge. T his is tough, but the solution has to be a compromise that looks at the wellbeing of both the residents and the animals. Good luck and thanks for allowing us to provide input. 9/9/2011 12:48 AM I will not live in a community wh ere I can hear a gun shot and know an animal has been killed. I will not live in a community where I might see a n active hunter/\"sharpshooter\" or where I meet see a wounded/killed anim al. 9/9/2011 12:32 AM I'm sympathetic to the deer we h ave encroached on their ecos ystem through too much development and suburban sp rawl but I do think there ar e too many deer in our urban neighborhoods (i.e. 2nd Street) and this is probably bad for the deer and does damage to neighborhood gardens. I don't have a good solution in mind and I would like a solution of some sort, but I think doing nothing i s preferrable to enacting policies that are crue l to the animals. Good luck! 9/9/2011 12:21 AM As i shared in the survey, I bel ieve that education for the gar deners is important. I do not see a problem. The deer are fun to watch and are a part of the natural wildlife of this area. I do NOT support h urting, killing or relocating. thank you for soliciting input... 9/8/2011 7:39 PM 193 Anything that is done should be humane and should obviously not damage the people in the city (like shooting within city limits!) 9/8/2 011 4:52 PM I frequently see deer that are lame a doe with one lame back leg, and a young buck with front knees that \"buckle.\" II think he is the son of the lame doe (whose new fawn seems to be ok). When the young buck was a small fawn, we noticed the \"buckling\" of his front knees. He is most often seen with the d oe and the new fawn. They are often in our yard and neighborhood. 9/8/2011 4:38 PM I'm guessing that the City can't do much about this. The lack o f natural predators and abundance of food make our neighborhoods ideal deer breedin g grounds. If they are hunted it would be grea t if they could be used for foo d. 9/8/2011 3:41 PM Deer pose a threat not only to my family but also to my dogs wh o bring the ticks inside the house and threaten my family. I would like to see them eliminated from my yard and my neighborhood. 9/8/2011 3:39 PM My greatest concern is that if the deer population is allowed t o increase unchecked there will, in the near future, be much larger issues hungry/starving and injured deer; breeding deer being aggressive; destruction of vegetable gardens which is frustrating, expensive, and give s one the \"why even try?\" attit ude after a couple of seasons. Fencing veg gardens is expensive expensive to buy, e rect and maintain and many times does not solve th e problem, especially for a larger garden. Many types of fencing and netting hinder ingress and egress as appli es to bringing in tools and hoses. Having ornamentals ma y not be nourishing to the body , but a pretty neighborhood, or landscape, nour ishes the soul fencing total ly defeats those aesthetics. 9/7/2011 10:37 PM We never had such problems before Deer Park took down their fen ces and let all of their deer out. It is a HUGE problem to have this many urban de er. The only effective and humane way is to cull the deer. Thanks Task Force for all of your hours of work and for continuing the conversation and working for a solution. 9/7/2011 10:09 PM The problem is severe. I am strongly in favor of having bow hun ters kill off as many deer as possible, with the remains donated for food. Frankly, I foresee injuries to cyclists and possibly to children if the problem is not address ed. I simply cannot believe we as a community have tolerated this for so long! 9 /7/2011 12:51 AM You guys are doing a great job. Keep the deers coming. But mayb e put mittens on their antlers so they more quiet when I sleeping. 9/6/2011 4 :13 PM Appreciate the time that the Task Force has put into this probl em. I have been following the various reports and saw that some of the solution s I thought might work turned out to be unrealisti c. Hope you can find a way to r educe the herd so that while s ome are left, the overpopulation is controled. Would love to find Spring wildflowers returning to places in Griffy woods where they have been grazed to nothing. 9/5/2011 8:20 PM I am the owner and operator of KW Custom Deer Processing locate d on the southside of Bloomington. I woul d like to introduce the donatio n of the killed deer meat to our community through Fa rmers and Hunters against hunger. If there was funding raised to cover the butc her fee we could remove 100 deer from the Monroe 194 county area this year and the cost would be 5,000 dollars. I ca n be reached at 812 3256278 for questions 8/20/2011 3:14 PM I love the deerit is not their f ault. However, it is not in th e deer's or our best interest for them to continue reproducing with no predators. So although I may not like the action taken, SOME action is need ed and I will accept it. 8/ 14/2011 6:30 PM I hope this get read. The loudest, most offensive people are th e complainers about deer. The deer aren't the proble m. The uneducated loudmouths a re the problem. They did not invade our neighborhoodswe invaded theirs. The deer were here first, so how do we cohabitate thoughtfully, responsibly, and respectfully. As a matter of fact, why don't some of these complainers learn first how to get along with the other humans, their own species, before they start attackin g another species. Sandy Merritt/Stella Ridge resident 8/5/2011 4:41 PM Thank you! 8/5/2011 4:12 PM Thank you for addressing this issue. Your time volunteering to work on this issue is appreciated. 8/4/2011 3:03 PM The overpopulation of deer place s an undue burden to the workin g class who can't afford the deer damage to cars and gardens. My grandson had and accident with a deer and deer aslo destroyed his garden, neither of which he co uld affored on a salary for caring for disabled people. 8/3/2011 2:10 PM I enjoy the deer to a degree; ho wever, there are just too many of them. My dog has to go potty at all hours, and it's dangerous when my husband walks out at night and startles a deer sleeping underneath a tree or bush. Or when we go out and a baby is nearby (which means momma is nearby and ready to defend her you ng). We have baby deer in our yard numerous ti mes during the year. We also h ave a dog that is territorial, and I don't want my dog getting mixed up with a de er. We've also seen bucks in our neighborhood with full racks!!! It's rare, but we' ve seen a few of them. I have no idea if the males are aggressive, but we always try to steer clear of them. It's tough though when its around y our own home! 8/3/2011 11:38 AM For someone just moving to Monroe County, all the forest lands for sale look like they have been drenched in herbi cides. The forests look shockin gly dead compared to other suburban Midwestern for ests that harbor some deer but are also alive with rabbits, squirrels, owls, woodch ucks, raccoons, foxes, skunks, chipmunks, mice, toads, and all the other creatures hiding in or spying for food in the many various flowering and other understory p lants that make living near for ests so interesting. Have people in Indiana had this deer problem for so long that t hey have forgotten what forests are supposed to look like? 8/1/2011 7:52 PM I am amazed at how many people i n this community feed the deer! We definitely need to educate this group! 8/1/2011 4:48 PM I am most concerned about the a ggressive does since I have smal l children who play out in my yard where deer freely roam. The deer in our neigborh ood show no signs of fear towards humans and at times seem more aggressive than I would expect. 7/31/2011 7:59 PM Brown County State Park went thr ough this about 20 years ago. W hy does the wheel need to be reinvented at considerable cost and effort? 7/30/ 2011 12:04 AM 195 The deer have become a big probl em that seems to be getting wor se every year. My preference would be to limit the ir reproduction if feasible, bu t I would not be opposed to eliminating excess nu mbers. Although I like the anim als and enjoy watching them, their damage to ornamental plants is a big problem. I also worry that their current rate of repro duction is unsustainable and the problem will only worsen. I also think cardeer co llision, which seems to be one of the few constraints on their population, is terribly harmful to the car and occupan t and provides a terrible death for the ani mal. 7/25/2011 1:28 PM I have lived in my house for 3 s ummers, and this small but semi wooded yard has been the actual birthing spot and where the fawns stay hidden and nurse for the coming weeks. I can't let my chi ld walk to the house door from the carport alone because they are often so close and will NOT \"shoo\". Evening wa lks in the neighborhood are the same way with the dear not shooing and I have to cross the road with my toddler in my arms and my 3 year old too. The buck s have been in this neighborhood too, and they make y ou PETRIFIED as a mother of yo ung children when you are on a walk or even i n your driveway (as happened in fall 2009). I don't feel like I am safe, and I certainly don't feel like my childre n are safe when we are alone in the yard. And yet, the deer give birth every year in o ur yard, and still there is no recourse or provision to ensure our SAFETY. 7/24/2011 10:43 PM Thank you! We're counting on y ou for some relief! 7/24/2011 2:53 PM Thanks for taking on this proble m. I think it will be difficult to find a balanced approach for both the humans and the deer. 7/24/2011 10:44 A M Our neighborhood considers the p leasure of having the opportunity to live with the deer one of the benefi ts of our location and strongly oppose an y attempt to reduce or eliminate them. 7/24/2011 6:22 AM OVER 40 YEARS WE WORKED W/MASTER GARDENERS AND ARBORISTS TO HAV E A YARD WE COULD AFFORD AND HANDL E AS WE AGED, KEEP YOUNG TREES GROWING AND ADD BEAUTY TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND CITY. THE DEER H AVE TAKEN THIS ALL FROM US. WE WILL SOON BE LEAVING THE HOME WE HOP ED TO SPEND THE REST OF OUR LIVES IN. WE NO LONGER HAVE A CHOICE. 7/24/2011 2:22 AM Thank you for the opportunity to express my thoughts! 7/23/2 011 10:52 PM 196 JOINT CITY OF BLOOMINGTON \u00adMONROE COUNTY DEER TASK FORCE MEMBERS DR.
