Many of [us in North Liberty](https://www.stevens-family-chiropractic.com) have gone through life running from the next virus or bacteria that is going to make us \"sick\". We view germs like they are monsters lurking around every corner ready to pounce on us at every unsuspecting moment. We are surrounded by a world focused on trying to kill every virus or bacteria we can find. The problem, however, is that even with all of the pharmaceutical drugs, hand sanitizers, vaccines, air purifiers and handwashing stations we are still surrounded by \"germs\" in our environment all of the time. So when we are all exposed to that environment, why are some people \"sick\" while others remain symptom free? If it truly was the viruses and bacteria that made us ill then shouldn't we all be \"sick\"? The truth is that there is more to the equation than that. Our bodies were designed to protect itself and guard against our environment. So why then do the \"germs\" affect some people and not others? The answer is that their bodies weren't working right in the first place! When your body (specifically your nerve system and immune system) isn't functioning correctly they cannot protect you against the viruses and bacteria in the environment. So, what do we do? When trying to prevent yourself from \"getting sick\", you have two options. We can either continue the uphill battle of trying to kill all of the \"germs\" in your environment or we can focus on strengthening our body's ability to protect itself. A structural shift in your spine can lower your immune system's ability to fight off a virus or bacteria and lowers your body's ability to protect itself from the environment. Studies have shown that Structural Correction with specific Chiropractic care can improve the function of your body's immune system by up 200%-300%! To see if specific Chiropractic care may be the missing piece to you staying healthy, give us a call to schedule a complementary consultation at (319) 626-2006.
