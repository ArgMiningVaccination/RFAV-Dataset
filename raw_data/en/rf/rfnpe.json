The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has called antibiotic resistance one of the public's most urgent threats. Infections caused by resistant bacteria can be difficult to cure and can lead to serious illnesses or death. A.What is antibiotic resistance? It is when bacteria have become \"resistant\" to the antibiotic, meaning the antibiotic is unable to kill, allowing bacteria to continue to grow or multiply. A. A. A.Q. Q.Q.Q. What can be done to combat the problem? Prescribing the right antibiotic for a certain bacteria, at the right dose, for the right time frame. Additionally, educating patients about treating bacterial and viral infections differently is important.How is Hy-Vee helping? Hy-Vee pharmacists are committed to educating our patients on proper antibiotic use. Also, our pharmacies offer free medication disposal for anyone who has unused antibiotics.HY-VEE PHARMACIST: ANGIE NELSON Group Vice President, Retail PharmacyANTIBIOTICS 1:40 PMRefresh your senses with the sweet and decadent fragrances of Fall!

PHOTO Tobin BennettENJOY YOUR DAY! INDULGE IN YOUR FAVORITE FOODS WISELY. AND HAVE A HAPPY THANKSGIVING.I love Thanksgiving Day food. I call this the \"savory \" time of year because of the roast turkey, stuffing and pumpkin pie with all the herbs, sauces and warming spices worthy of the Big Meal. Fuel Early Eat throughout the day, beginning with a well-balanced, healthy breakfast, so you won 't feel starved at dinner. Toss leftover veggies into scrambled eggs, or top whole grain toast with ricotta cheese. Munch Healthfully Choose from your arsenal of healthy snacks before the holiday dinner. Two high-fiber crackers with 2 teaspoons natural peanut butter or a hard-boiled egg will control your hunger. Contribute to the Meal Offer to bring a dish. There may not be many healthy foods offered, and you 'll have at least one go- to option with ingredients that you know. Go for Healthy Nibbles Load up on light, clean appetizers and healthy fats, such as crudit\u00e9 with hummus. Set Your Sip Limit Give yourself a drink maximum before the meal begins. Remember to sip slowly and choose lower-calorie and lower-sugar options such as wine spritzers and vodka and seltzer. Exercise An hour spent burning calories will motivate you to make healthier choices later in the day. Drink Plenty of Water This will help keep you from overeating. It makes you feel full so you won 't stuff yourself. Control Portions This includes veggies\u2014unless you 've prepared them they could be loaded with sneaky ingredients like margarine or sugary sauces. Slice your own pie to control the size (skip the crust). Listen to Your Body Once you 're slightly satisfied, stop eating. Period. You'll have much better memories of a meal enjoyed than a meal overindulged in. Focus on the time spent with your family and friends.

FAMOUS FOR HER ROLE IN THE FAMILY SITCOM FULL HOUSE, SHE'S A FAN FAVORITE ON THE HALLMARK CHANNEL, WHICH BOASTS OVER 85 MILLION VIEWERS, DOMINATES THE PRE-CHRISTMAS SEASON WITH HOLIDAY MOVIES AND AIRS HER LATEST PROJECTS. SHE'S AN ACTOR AND PRODUCER\u2014 APPEARING IN EVERYTHING FROM A POPULAR SOAP TO SEINFELD\u2014PROVING HARD WORK AND TENACITY DELIVER LASTING SUCCESS. In a business where nothing is constant but change, Lori Loughlin has mastered the art of staying power. She was a natural talent with an unusual drive\u2014 play-acting with neighbor kids in her Hauppauge, Long Island backyard, modeling professionally by 11 and an established soap star in her teens. At 17 she made the cover of US Weekly for being one of, if not the hottest daytime teen actors and had a hefty fan base. A desire to succeed pushed her while still in high school to take the 5:35 a.m. train into New York with her dad, a foreman for the New York Telephone Company. She'd tape until 3 p.m. then go on modeling or casting calls. Evenings were spent studying and being tutored at home in high school coursework, keeping a commitment to good grades she' d promised to her parents. Her goal to make it didn' t mean compromising her values. She turned down the lead in the ' 80s coming-of-age blockbuster Blue Lagoon, due to nudity, the opportunity going instead to Brooke Shields. Television movies followed her soap days and then, in 1988, she got an offer for a six-episode gig WORDS Wini Moranville and Wanda Ventling PHOTO Chris Fortuna/Contour by Getty 032-039 LoriLoughlin_09.26.indd 33 9/27/18 4:33 PMon ABC' s Full House, a sitcom starring Bob Saget as Danny Tanner, a widowed father living with his kids and two roommates\u2014brother-in- law, Jesse, and best pal, Joey. Lori's character, Rebecca, was Tanner's cohost on a morning show. The Full House audience loved her character, so over the life of the show it was expanded\u2014dating and marrying ever-so-hunky Jesse and becoming a mom to twin boys and lovable Aunt Becky to Tanner' s daughters. After an eight-year run on Full House Loughlin went on to star in ABC' s Hudson Street with Tony Danza and the WB's Summerland series which she co-created. Her familiar face has also appeared as the lead in many Lifetime and Hallmark movies, in various guest roles on shows including Seinfeld and Blue Bloods and as a lead in 90210, Garage Sale Mystery, When Calls the Heart, and Netfl ix's Fuller House. Loughlin's work shows her a nity toward family-friendly content. \"I don't think I set out in my life going, you know, 'I'm going to do projects that are uplifting and have a positive message,\" Loughlin says. \"But I think as my career has gone on, it must be what I respond to, because those are the projects I seem to choose to do. Looking back at my 30-year career I say to myself, ' Yeah, you know ... maybe it has something to do with my own upbringing and my own values. It is what I gravitate toward. ' Sometimes you're in the mood to watch something dark and edgy; sometimes you're not. That, says Loughlin, is what's great about the way television works today: You have plenty of choices. \"People don't always want to be on the edge of their seat with their nerves so heightened,\" Loughlin says. \"Sometimes they just want to kick back and say, 'Oh, I just want to take a deep breath and relax and feel good,' or 'Oh, a murder mystery\u2014 I wonder who it was. But I'm not scared by it.' \"I think there's value in that. I also think there's value in being able to watch things as a family,\" Loughlin says. \"Full House always had a message about treating people the right way, being respectful, and being honorable. If you're going to use television for anything, why not use it to teach valuable lessons and enlighten people?\" Loughlin reunited with the Full House cast for Fuller House, a sequel on Netfl ix in its fourth season. \"It's like going home again. We've kept up over the course of all the years we weren't on the air. It's been like we never left. It's been fantastic,\" Loughlin says. Currently, Loughlin appears as Abigail Stanton in the Hallmark Channel's When Calls the Heart. Now in its sixth season, the series revolves around Hope Valley, an early-20th-century mining town in the Paci c Northwest. \"I'm really proud of that show,\" Loughlin says. \"I think they show the importance of community and friendships, love, faith and being there for one another. When you step on that set, you feel like you've been transported back in time.\" She also appears in Garage Sale Mystery, a Hallmark Channel whodunit movie series for which she also is executive producer. \"I feel like I've been blessed to be a working actor,\" says Loughlin, who admits she's taken roles other actresses may decline. \"I feel like I've always taken lemons, and made lemonade. I've tried to just stay in the game.\" For Loughlin, a positive outlook and a humble heart have been critical to her success. \"I was always excited to work. I think sometimes as an actor you want to be choosy, but sometimes people get so choosy they end up working themselves right out of the business.\" Loughlin credits her success to her parents and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, the creator of the Mossimo clothing line, whom she met in 1995. But she recognizes her own e ort, as well. \"You can have a good support group, which is fantastic, but at the end of the day you've got to pick yourself up and brush yourself o and continue to pursue and follow your dreams,\" Loughlin says. Full House always had a message about treating people the right way, being respectful and being honorable.

For me, just being home with my husband and our dog, making some dinner, and watching television. That makes me probably the happiest. I also think that being kind goes a long way. If there is conflict, take a deep breath and come back to it from a space of kindness and understanding. It's just a better way to be in the world. Q. WHAT 'S YOUR FAVORITE ROLE YOU 'VE PLAYED? a. There are three. I like: Jennifer Shannon from Garage Sale Mystery , I like Abigail Stanton from When Calls the Heart , and of course, always and forever, Rebecca Donaldson, from Full House . Q. Why do you think Full House was such a successful show? A. We had such incredible chemistry\u2014we really loved each other. If you watched us, you could tell that we were truly enjoying each other's company. You'd say to yourself, \"I'd like to spend time with these people.\" I also think that it brought some comfort to people, especially kids who had lost a parent or didn't have what was deemed the traditional-looking family. Q. Are you ever going to get tired of people asking questions about Full House ? A. No\u2014not even after 30 years. I'm thankful I have a show like that, one that people are still interested in, which is great. It's all good! Q. Do you like being in front of the camera? A. Yes, but mostly because I like acting and the process of acting. I 've wanted to act since I was 4 or 5 years old. Q. WHAT DOES BEING HEALTHY MEAN TO YOU? a. I think being healthy is feeling centered and happy. Q. What's your favorite way to de-stress? A. I love being in my home, having it quiet, and kicking back with the dog\u2014that's my favorite way of unwinding. A yoga class is good, too. entertainment was television, and our family would watch shows like Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley, and The Love Boat, as well as mystery shows like Columbo . You could sit down with the whole family and watch those shows. And everybody enjoyed them. Q. This year's Countdown to Christmas series on The Hallmark Channel will once again run an all-new holiday special of When Calls the Heart . Last year, Countdown attracted over 70 million viewers. What do you think accounts for its popularity? A. People have such a positive response to Christmas. Last summer, I posted a picture of myself in a beautiful green dress by a Christmas tree on a set that was decorated to the nines for Christmas. And so many people liked and commented on that photo, saying \"Oh my gosh, I can't wait for Christmas.\" That was in July! People love Christmas\u2014it's festive, it's a time for celebrating love and family, and in the Hallmark movies, there's romance, too. Q. How do you find contentment? Being kind goes a long away. If there is conflict, take a deep breath and come back to it from a space of kindness and understanding. It's just a better way to be in the world.\"Q. Who has impacted your career the most? A. I've always had good support from my family and my husband, but in the end, I'd have to say \"me.\" I don't want to sound like I'm not humble, because I'm very humble! Yet I'm the one who really worked hard and had to weather the rejection and continue on. In life, you have to stay in the game\u2014you've got to pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and continue to pursue and follow your passion. Q. What has been the biggest hurdle in your career? A. Working as an actor is always a hurdle! But I was always happy to work, so no job was too big or too small. Q. Did you watch much television growing up? A. Yes, because when I was a kid, I didn't go to movies all the time. One source of conflict, take a deep breath and come back to it from a space of kindness and understanding. hurdle!

Now, as the star and an executive producer of Garage Sale Mystery and When Calls the Heart, both on the Hallmark Channel, Loughlin appreciates hearing viewers tell her they watch the shows together as a family. \"I've heard people say, 'I love your mystery movies because I can watch them without having nightmares. Nothing's graphic, and I'm not scared.' Likewise, a lot of people tell me that they watch When Calls the Heart with their kids. I think there's value in being able to watch things as a family.\"The Hallmark Channel has been a good t for Lori Loughlin, who also appears in the cable station's popular Countdown to Christmas lineup of holiday-theme movies lled with romance, happy endings and everything Christmas. The annual lineup has a viewership in the 60 to 80 million range. \"People love Christmas! Maybe because it's festive,\" Loughlin says. \"There's certainly a religious aspect, but I think across the board it's that it's festive and it's time with family and it's a happy time. Whatever your religious beliefs are...it's just a time for celebrating family, and romance, and love, the holidays and coming together as families.\" \"I try to set a schedule workwise where I don't disappear for four months to do a series.

Studies show that moderate amounts of all types of alcohol are just as beneficial as red wine for heart health. It's thought that alcohol raises HDL (healthy) cholesterol, reduces the formation of blood clots and prevents artery damage caused by LDL (harmful) cholesterol). Also, remember to drink in moderation.CHEERS!Start your day with a well-balanced breakfast. Snack on yogurt, an apple or a handful of nuts an hour before the feast to help control how much you eat.

The brain and the spinal cord are the machinery that control emotions, thinking, coordination, the ability to move the limbs, heart rate and much more. Messages move from brain to spinal cord to branched-out nerve fibers throughout the body via 100 billion neurons that fire electrical signals, which become chemical signals, or neurotransmitters. Cognitive function is not fixed, says Dr. Chin. It is flexible, and we can improve it through lifestyle practices such as eating the right foods, exercising, getting enough sleep, communicating with others, reducing stress and challenging ourselves mentally, he says.

No surprise then that researchers study the practices of meditation and mindfulness as possible ways to counter this loss. Some suggestions from the Mayo Clinic: Engage in prayer. Silent or spoken words of faith can decrease anxiety. Practice mantra meditation by silently repeating a calming word or phrase to prevent distracting thoughts. Focus on awareness of the present moment through mindfulness meditation. Try tai chi, a gentle form of Chinese martial arts involving a series of flowing movements while deep-breathing. Focus on breathing deeply and slowly through the nostrils\u2014 paying attention to different parts of your body while imagining that you are breathing heat or relaxation into tense areas. GET A MOVE ON Aerobic exercise has brain benefits, says Dr. Chin. \"There 's a natural shrinkage of the brain as we get older. For people who are aerobically active, their brains stay larger for longer. \" In addition, he says, researchers are looking into whether areobic exercise thwarts amyloid plaques, abnormal collections of a naturally occurring protein; the plaques can disrupt the function of brain neurons.RIDDLE THIS TRY THESE BRAIN TEASERS FROM MENSA INTERNATIONAL OR LEARN MORE BY VISITING AMERICANMENSA.ORG WORD GAME: I'm a soothing color.

Stick to a sleep schedule, keep the room dark and slightly cool, get some exercise during the day, and avoid alcohol and heavy meals at night. FEED YOUR HEAD Your brain functions best on a balanced diet. Eat ample amounts of vegetables and fruits, which contain certain antioxidants that can pass blood vessels' strict filtering mechanism\u2014the blood-brain barrier.

The left hemisphere controls speech and analytic processes; the right handles artistic and imaginative activities and the ability to \" read \" facial expressions. The cerebellum is the cauliflower-shape structure just above the brain stem; it controls posture and balance and coordinates muscle tension in movement. Socializin g, tackling new projects and otherwise flexing our mental abilities can improve cognitive function, says Dr. Chin. \" Think about the interaction we have when we converse with people, \" he says. \"We're challenging our memory, we're challenging our language function, our attention function, our visual-spatial function. We 're really tapping into synapses throughout the brain for various reasons as we 're conversing. \" Less effective, in Chin's view, are repeated use of crossword puzzles, sudoku and word games, which he says challenges limited areas of the brain. \" Chances are you'll improve the language area of your brain ...but it doesn 't overflow or then move downstream to a different part of the brain, \" Chin says. \"Think of your brain as a muscle.

Many people think of psoriasis simply as a skin disease. The fact is, those who have psoriasis are at significant risk for other problems: diabetes, high blood pressure and autoimmune, Parkinson 's, heart and kidney diseases. Psoriasis is not contagious. Rather, it is thought to involve the immune system, where white blood cells attack healthy skin cells by mistake. Researchers believe both genetic and environmental factors play a role. Viral and bacterial infections from recurring infections such as strep throat are also factors. Although there are five types of psoriasis, plaque psoriasis is the most common, as it affects 80 percent or more of psoriasis patients. Plaque psoriasis causes raised lesions of silvery scales anywhere on the body, often on the scalp, knees or elbows and sometimes in the genital area or inside the mouth. \"The thick scaling is an indicator that the person is having to make new cells at a faster rate than people without psoriasis, \" says Carey A. Bligard, M.D., of UnityPoint Clinic Dermatology in Fort Dodge, Iowa. \"This uses lots of protein, so patients need to make sure they have a diet with adequate protein and vitamins. \" Along with diet and other lifestyle changes (see page 68 ), treatments include light therapy, topical and oral medications, and promising biologics that target certain substances in the immune system. \"If your psoriasis is mild, you will most likely have topical ointments to put directly on the plaques, but more severe cases may start immediately with systemic medications, \" says Dr. Bligard. \"We are fortunate to have many options for treating psoriasis now and treatment is always personalized for the patient's situation and disease severity. \" WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? PSORIASIS is a chronic skin disease in which skin cells go through their life cycle in days instead of the normal period of weeks. The extra skin cells form raised, red, scaly patches that may itch, burn or sting. Up to 40 percent of people with psoriasis may experience symptoms of arthritis, known as psoriatic arthritis, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.ECZEMA is an inflammation of the skin and is easily confused with psoriasis. Both form red, itchy patches. The patches are less pronounced with eczema and sometimes accompanied by oozing. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases estimates eczema affects 30 percent of the U.S. population, mostly children and adolescents.DERMATITIS is a general term that describes inflammation of the skin. Among the types: Atopic dermatitis is a form of eczema. Contact dermatitis is a reaction to a substance, such as a chemical or poison ivy. Seborrheic dermatitis causes stubborn dandruff. If you have dermatitis, it is recommended that you avoid scratching, because it can lead to infection. PSORIASIS IS A CHRONIC CONDITION RESULTING IN RED SCALY PATCHES OF SKIN. HERE 'S WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS TROUBLESOME\u2014YET TREATABLE\u2014DISEASE. PSORIASIS OCCURS IN ALL AGE GROUPS BUT IS PRIMARILY SEEN IN ADULTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 45 AND 64. how SEVERE? Cases of psoriasis are categorized by severity. MILD: Covers less than 3 percent of the body (example: both knees). MODERATE: Covers 3 to 10 percent of the body (example: knees and forearms). SEVERE: Covers more than 10 percent of the body (example: legs, forearms and scalp). ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THOSE AFFECTED BY PSORIASIS EXPERIENCE A MILD TO MODERATE FORM OF THE DISEASE. www.psoriasis.org/content/statistics PMIN 2013, THE TOTAL COST OF TREATING PSORIASIS WAS ESTIMATED BETWEEN $51.7 BILLION AND $63.2 BILLION.

Therefore, in order to improve any autoimmune condition, gastrointestinal health is going to be key. This includes cleaning up the diet to include plentiful sources of antioxidants and fiber, and balancing out gut flora with probiotics and prebiotics. \" \u2014Kristi Sanders, R.D., L.D.PHOTOTHERAPY Ultraviolet light is used to slow excessive growth of skin cells and temporarily clear symptoms. One form of light therapy is excimer laser, which concentrates ultraviolet light on affected areas. MEDICATIONS Psoriasis medications include topical treatments such as salicylic acid, steroid-based creams, coal-tar ointments and prescription retinoids. Oral and injectable medications are available for extreme cases. HOLISTIC Approaches include lifestyle changes such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol, quitting smoking and changing diet (see dietary considerations, right ). \"Keeping stress under control can decrease the chances of psoriasis flares, and getting enough sleep and a healthy diet are even more important for psoriasis patients, \" says Dr. Bligard. dietary considerationsACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL PSORIASIS FOUNDATION, ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF PSORIASIS PATIENTS MISSED AN AVERAGE 26 DAYS OF WORK PER YEAR DUE TO THEIR ILLNESS.TREATMENTS PHOTO Tobin Bennett Source: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5289118/ BALANCE | November 2018 68 066-069 Psoriasis_09.26.indd 68 9/27/18 10:41 AM Biologics\u2014drugs made from human or animal proteins rather than chemicals\u2014offer a major step forward in the treatment of severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

JOIN HY-VEE IN SUPPORTING THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO IMPROVING OURS. Scars from active military service may take a lifetime to heal and, sadly, some can only be managed the best we know how\u2014through love and compassion. For Dennis Dorman, a disabled Korean War veteran who suffers from PTSD, love and compassion has four legs and his name is Simon\u2014the service dog donated to Dorman through the Puppy Jake Foundation. When Dorman first learned of trained service dogs and how one could benefit, he searched in hopes of gaining the companionship and support from one of these furry friends. But the cost of breeding and training these special dogs is expensive and the price was more than he could afford. Three years ago, Dorman saw an advertisement on TV for the Puppy Jake Foundation, a program that donates service dogs to veterans in the Midwest, funded in part by Hy-Vee Homefront. Dorman applied, and within a year he was matched with his new best friend, a British Cream Labrador Retriever named Simon. Now, Simon is always by his side. \"Mostly it's to help with my mobility and PTSD,\" says Dorman. \"He'll lick my arm or lick my leg, and it just comforts me. Like a human reaching out and touching your hand, or when you're sad and someone puts their arm around you. It's about the same thing.\" The Puppy Jake Foundation is just one of many ways Hy-Vee's Homefront program helps support thousands of veterans, military members and their families. Here are a few ways that Hy-Vee gives back: Round Up Between November 1-18, Hy-Vee invites customers to round up their grocery bill to the nearest dollar, or more, with the entire donation going to support Operation First Response, Puppy Jake Foundation, Hope for the Warriors and American Red Cross. Hy-Vee matches these donations up to $100,000. To date, Hy-Vee and customers have raised over $1.4 million since Round Up started. Employing Veterans Hy-Vee is proud to recruit and hire veterans, service members and their families to join the employee-owned company.

He was deployed to Iraq in 2008 and later that year returned home to Iowa to begin his Hy-Vee career as a part-time employee at the Chariton Distribution Center. \"It's such a great company and the opportunities are endless,\" Bennett said. \"At the end of the day, they really take care of us and you can't ask for much more.\" One of Bennett's most memorable Hy-Vee experiences came over Labor Day weekend 2012, when his crew was tasked with organizing and dispersing one of the largest shipment days in the company's history. Bennett's leadership helped his team overcome several obstacles so they could successfully get all the orders out on time. Matt Bennett Larry Sandal's passion for his job is fueled by the family and team atmosphere that he found at Hy-Vee \u2014similar to his experiences in the South Dakota National Guard. Sandal joined the National Guard after high school in 2005. In 2007, Sandal went to Iraq for a year-long deployment. During his time in Iraq, he served as Logistics Specialist, using his specialty skillset to repair high-tech weaponry. Upon his return from over a year of active duty overseas, Sandal remained a reserve and began a career at Hy-Vee. He joined the Sioux Falls-area Hy-Vee team in 2008, and eventually became an Assistant Store Director at the Marion Road store in Sioux Falls. \"[I appreciate] the incredible family atmosphere in the stores,\" Sandal said. \"Every day is a wonderful experience.\" Sandal takes pride in making his customers happy and going out of his way to make their day special when they enter the store.Larry Sandal HIRING HEROES ARE YOU A VETERAN OR ACTIVE MILITARY MEMBER SEEKING EMPLOYMENT?

Both are simple, common tasks, but as muscle mass and fl exibility decrease with age, these ordinary movements can become di cult. Functional exercises enhance the ability of muscles and joints to perform these and other tasks e ciently. FOR AN EXERCISE TO BE FUNCTIONAL, MOVES NEED TO MIMIC A MOTION OF DAILY LIFE, USE THE SAME MUSCLES AND BE PERFORMED WITH SIMILAR SPEED AND RANGE OF MOTION. A deadlift, for example, requires picking up a barbell with heavy weights and, when done with correct form, you may notice a di erence the next time you help a friend move furniture. \"FUNCTIONAL EXERCISES CAN BE INTIMIDATING AT FIRST BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE PATIENCE AND SKILL WHILE LEARNING TECHNIQUES.

What if you could escape the boredom of endless hours at the gym? Well, your problem may have a solution in technology- based exercise\u2014an immersive style of fitness that uses screens, simulators and cutting-edge tech to raise your level of engagement, all of which can get you past the discomforts of a workout and lead to better results. It's a concept that Aaron Stanton, director of the Virtual Reality Institute of Health and Exercise in San Francisco, California, refers to as \"painless minutes,\" or various moments during exercise when pain is out of mind. \"You're not really aware you're exercising because you're so engaged,\" Stanton says. Whether it's an exercise bike with a video screen at the gym, indoor golf simulator or an interactive video game, there's more than one way tech can help you get active and see exercise in a new way. Technology-based exercise isn't just for your entertainment\u2014 its health claims point to a higher likelihood of completing your workout. A 2017 study by Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise found that less experienced exercisers who completed eight immersive cycling sessions with audio and visual engagement experienced greater satisfaction and lower perceived exertion than sessions with music only. Technology-based exercise has been around for a while. And upgrades are on the horizon with the advancement of virtual reality systems that will catapult you into more dynamic environments\u2014some requiring extra gear such as heart monitors, headsets, video screens, sound systems and motion detectors. \"This is an emerging field of exercise. Putting someone in an interactive experience is one of the best forms of painless exercise, \" Stanton says. If your workouts lack a spark, it might be time to rewire your connection for better engagement and a healthier lifestyle.

There wouldn't be any oxygen to breathe, let alone food to eat, clothing to wea r or fuel to burn. Plants are life-giving. Moreover, they 're life-enhancing. Plants provide comfort and reduce stress and anxiety. Because humans have evolved with the natural world, we feel at home when surrounded by plants. Not surprisingly, research shows that viewing nature is a more pleasurable experience than looking at a blank wall. In one study, patients who were in a waiting room with lots of healthy plants reported being happier and healthier than those in a waiting room with just a few scraggly plants scattered around. Another study showed that the simple presence of plants could positively influence health. Patients recovering INDOOR PLANTS ENHANCE JOB SATISFACTION IN OFFICE WORKERS, REDUCE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS, IMPROVE MOOD AND ENHANCE COGNITIVE HEALTH. THESE EFFECTS CAN POSITIVELY AFFECT RESISTANCE TO DISEASES AND CHRONIC STRESS.The catch: To effectively remove indoor pollutants, you need about 1 plant per 24 square feet of living space. Also, some plants are better at removing toxic vapors than others.INDOOR PLANTS CAN REMOVE 75 TO 90 PERCENT OF AIRBORNE CHEMICALS. CARING FOR A HOUSEPLANT CAN BE A MEDITATIONAL EXERCISE THAT TAKES US OUTSIDE OURSELVES. WE NURTURE THE PLANT AND PROVIDE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LIGHT, WATER AND NUTRIENTS. IN RETURN, THE PLANT IMPROVES OUR AIR\u2014 AND OUR MOOD. Therapeutic Effect: In one study, those who transplanted a plant felt more comfortable, soothed and natural than those handling a computer task. ROOTS from surgery who had plants and flowers in their rooms had lower systolic blood pressure and lower ratings of pain, anxiety and fatigue than those in rooms without plants and flowers. Studies also show that plants aid concentration and productivity at work while reducing sick time. Now that's a good benefit plan!

It's well-known that plants are oxygen factories, but did you know plants are natural humidifiers? They release moisture from tiny pores in their leaves through a process called transpiration. The extra humidity can help in dry winter environments in airtight homes and offices. Better yet, indoor plants are living air purifiers. NASA research shows that indoor plants absorb chemical pollutants such as formaldehyde and benzene that off- gas from various items in the home, such as carpets, flooring, paint, cleaning products, chemicals and cosmetics. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notes that the levels of several organics may be two to five times higher indoors than outdoors. The air in your home may be substantially worse to breathe than the air outdoors. Indoor pollutants can irritate the eyes, skin, nose and throat\u2014something to consider, given another EPA estimate: The average American spends 87 perent of his or her time indoors. How nice to know there 's a remedy as close as your nearest houseplant. SNAKE PLANT (Sansevieria trifasciata ) is one of the easiest houseplants to grow, tolerating a wide range of cultural conditions. It reaches 2 to 4 feet tall.DRAGON TREE (Dracaena marginata ) grows up to 6 feet tall unless cut back. It tolerates low light, but the foliage has more color with a few hours of sunlight.BAMBOO PALM (Chamaedorea seifrizii ), also called reed palm, is adaptable to most lighting conditions but prefers part shade. It grows slowly to 5 to 10 feet tall. ENGLISH IVY (Hedera helix ) is a very adaptable plant that takes sun or shade. When grown indoors, English ivy looks best trailing from a pot.PEACE LILY (Spathiphyllum spp.) can flower even in low-light conditions. It prefers bright, filtered light, not direct sunlight. Peace lilies grow from 1 to 6 feet tall. CHINESE EVERGREEN (Aglaonema spp.) is gaining fans because of its bright variegated foliage and low maintenance. Plants grow from 8 inches to 4 feet tall.

Germ theory\u2014the idea that bacteria and filth can spread disease\u2014 was a public health revolution in the 19th century. today it 's widely accepted that cleanliness is vital in preventing contagious illness. Use bleach or disinfectants to stop the spread of viruses like the flu, which can live on surfaces up to 24 hours, and norovirus, which can survive on surfaces up to a week, and wash your hands frequently.01 | SPONGES harbor bacteria from the many surfaces they 're used to clean. Moisture allows bacteria to multiply and transfer from surface to surface as you clean. To sanitize sponges, run them in the dishwasher on the hottest and longest cycle with a dry cycle to follow, or soak them in a mixture of one-half teaspoon bleach and one quart of water for 1 minute, then allow to air dry. You can also sanitize wet, metal-free sponges by microwaving for 1 minute. Microwaving dry sponges and metal scrubbers is a fire hazard.02 | BROOM bristles are designed to trap dust and debris. What about when dirt accumulates? Dismantle the brush, shake out the larger debris, then use your fingers and a paper towel to comb the bristles. Finish by cleaning bristles with soapy water. 03 | TOWELS, like sponges, are a breeding ground for bacteria. The hottest washing cycle on your washing machine and dryer will get them clean. Disposable paper towels are a safer option for food prep and eating surfaces.CLEAN UP YOUR ACT HOUSEKEEPING TOOLS CAN TRAP DUST AND BACTERIA.

Fight the buildup of soap scum by using nonabrasive cleaners and disinfectants.\u00bb TOILETS are prone to bacteria build- up and hard water deposits. Use a long- handled brush and toilet bowl cleaner on the interior, and use a nonabrasive cleaner and disinfectant on the seat.\u00bb KITCHEN SINKS need daily disinfecting.

CHEMICAL CLEANERS Cleaning products marketed as eco-friendly and \" green\" have taken over a considerable share of the market. On the plus side, many of them use less-abrasive ingredients, can come at a lower cost and help consumers live a more sustainable lifestyle. Some of the cons are questionable ingredients\u2014companies might \"greenwash \" labels to make products seem better for you than they are, and they can be less effective than traditional cleaning products. Familiar products, often faster-working and better at stripping stains and grime, can be composed of harsh chemicals that call for using oft-ignored precautions like respiratory masks.\u00bb DISINFECTANT wipes and sprays are meant to kill germs only and should be used on already clean surfaces. \u00bb GLASS cleaners dissolve and remove oily residue on glass surfaces and dry quickly without streaking. \u00bb METAL cleaning products dissolve grease and grime and polish metal, and often prevent tarnishing.\u00bb ALL-PURPOSE cleaning products penetrate soil, loosen it, and prevent it from re-attaching to the surface. \u00bb MULTI- SURFACE products remove grime from many smooth surfaces and leave a streak-free shine. \u00bb OVEN and stove-top cleaners dissolve grease and charred food.

PATHOGENS CAN LURK ON CUTTING BOARDS, IN UTENSILS AND, YES, EVEN FOOD. STICK TO THESE PRACTICES WHEN PREPARING, COOKING, REFRIGERATING AND FREEZING, AND KEEP THE FOODS YOU EAT SAFE. Bacteria can make its way into cooked foods that aren't cooled enough or reheated thoroughly (should be steaming hot) before eating. Refrigerate leftovers within 2 hours after a meal. CANNED FOODS have a long shelf life (2-5 years, less for tomatoes; check dates) if they don' t freeze or reach temperatures above 90 \u00b0F. A SMALL DENT in the can does not necessarily mean the food is unsafe. Discard DEEPLY DENTED CANS; if the can' s seam is damaged, bacteria can enter.RESEARCHERS HAVE IDENTIFIED MORE THAN 250 DISEASES CAUSED BY FOOD CONTAMINATED WITH MICROBES. HERE 'S HOW TO PLAY IT SAFE. Wash your hands before and after handling food, especially well after handling raw meat. Wash cutting boards, countertops and utensils with hot, soapy water after cutting raw meats prior to other foods. Sanitize cutting boards with a solution of 1 teaspoon chlorine bleach in 1 quart of water. Separate raw meat, poultry, fish and their juices from other foods to prevent spreading harmful bacteria to uncooked and ready-to-eat foods. Marinate meats in a sealed bag or covered dish in the refrigerator; do not use the same marinade on cooked foods unless it 's boiled first. Use separate cutting boards for fresh produce and raw meat, poultry and seafood. Always place cooked meats on a clean plate, never the same one (without washing) that held raw meat.

To keep cold foods cold (40\u00b0F or colder), nest dishes in ice- filled bowls, and serve food on small trays that you can replace often.SAFE SETUPMICROWAVE SAFE If food is thawed in a microwave, cook it immediately; isolated areas can become warm enough to allow bacteria to grow. Uneven cooking in a microwave can leave cold spots where microbes can survive; stir or check foods to make sure food is cooked thoroughly.SHOPPING TIP When shopping, keep raw meat, poultry and seafood separate from other foods in your grocery cart, and place them in plastic bags to prevent their juices from dripping onto other foods. Keep them separate at checkout and in your grocery bags, too.TOOLS FOR SAFETY Most refrigerators have a built-in thermometer. Set it to 40 \u00b0F or lower and verify the internal temperature regularly. Or set an appliance thermometer inside the fridge. Use an internal meat thermometer to check food temperatures to ensure they 're thoroughly cooked.IN THE DOOR The temperature of storage bins in the refrigerator door fluctuate more than in the fridge cabinet. Store eggs in the carton on a refrigerator shelf, not in a door. Keep your refrigerator door closed when not in use to avoid fluctuations in temperature.

Part D, for instance, o ers prescription drug coverage and is available in two ways: As a stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (Part D) administered by a private insurer. It adds drug coverage to Original Medicare and some other plans. Through a Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C) or other Medicare health plan o ering prescription drug coverage. These are generally o ered by private insurers through an HMO (health maintenance organization) or PPO (preferred provider organization). You must have Parts A and B to join a Medicare Advantage Plan. TO HELP YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT PLAN, HY-VEE PHARMACIES ARE OFFERING A FREE MEDICATION REVIEW AND PART D PLAN COMPARISON UNTIL DEC. 7 .HEALTH LINGO 101 COPAYMENT is your share of the cost of a prescription drug after the deductible is met. It is usually a fl at fee, so you might pay around $10 or $20 for a prescription drug. COINSURANCE is also your share of the cost of a prescription drug after the deductible is met\u2014usually a percentage. For example, you might pay 20 percent of the cost of a medication. DEDUCTIBLE IS THE AMOUNT YOU MUST PAY FOR PRESCRIPTIONS BEFORE YOUR PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN OR OTHER INSURANCE KICKS IN. DEDUCTIBLES VARY BETWEEN MEDICARE DRUG PLANS AND NONE CAN HAVE A DEDUCTIBLE MORE THAN $405 IN 2018. A B C HOSPITAL Part of Original Medicare.

Basically, you pay a deductible, then contribute either a copayment or coinsurance (but not both). MEDICARE: A federal insurance program for people age 65 and older or disabled. Patients pay part of the cost of medical expenses and a monthly premium for non-hospital coverage. MEDICAID: A federal-state assistance program serving low-income people of every age. Patients usually pay no part of the cost for covered medical expenses.WHAT' S THE DIFFERENCE? 098-103 Medicare PartD_Ads_09.26.indd 99 9/26/18 3:28 PMIN THE GAP Most Medicare drug plans have a temporary limit on what the plan will cover for drugs. In 2019, this coverage gap will begin after participants and their plan spend $3,820 on drugs. What it means: While in the coverage gap you'll pay no more than 25 percent for brand-name drugs and 37 percent for generics. Once you reach the $5,100 threshhold (including out-of-pocket costs and manufacturer discount), catastropic coverage kicks in and you pay only a small coinsurance amount or copayment for covered drugs the rest of the year. Going forward: The White House has proposed excluding the manufacturer discount from the calculation, which would substantially increase Part D enrollees' out-of-pocket costs.AVERAGE MONTHLY PREMIUM FOR PART D$41 ADD ON Choose a plan that o ers additional coverage during the gap. These plans may charge a higher monthly premium. Note: Make sure your medication is covered. CHECK FOR OFFERS See if the drug manufacturer o ers a pharmaceutical assistance program. MAKE THE SWITCH Talk to your doctor to see if a generic drug will work in place of a name brand. STATE YOUR CASE Inquire whether your state o ers a pharmaceutical assistance program.

You can change plans only during annual open enrollment, Oct. 15 to Dec. 7. Exceptions are made for those with limited incomes or who move into a nursing home or out of a plan's coverage area. If you are satisfied with your current plan and make no changes, you will automatically be re-enrolled unless the plan is no longer available, in which case you will receive notice of the termination and will need to choose a replacement plan. How do I know which plan is best for me? Visit the Medicare website at www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/ questions/home.aspx for an interactive tool that compares plans by zip code and offers a star rating system for plans in your area. Or stop by your local Hy-Vee Pharmacy for a free Medicare Part D plan comparison. How much will it cost? The monthly payment to Medicare or an insurance company for prescription drug coverage can vary widely among providers, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The average monthly premium for Medicare Part D in 2018 was $41. The cost may be higher, depending on your income. Where can I get help? The Medicare call center is open get Medicare drug coverage? Anyone on Medicare can sign up for drug coverage (Part D). There are no income requirements or physical exams, and you cannot be denied for health reasons or because you use several prescription drugs. What does Part D cover? Part D pays for outpatient prescription drugs, but not for over-the-counter medications, vitamins or prescription drugs for conditions such as erectile dysfunction, hair regrowth or weight loss. Doctor-administered drugs, including chemotherapy and dialysis, are covered by Part B. Do drug plans vary much? Plans can vary greatly in the cost of premiums and deductibles, as well as in the drugs covered and copayments charged. During the enrollment period ending Dec. 7, Hy-Vee pharmacies can help with a free medication review and Part D plan comparison.Q: Q: Q: GENDEN DERO BLABOR ERIT, CUS.DON' T BE LATE TO THE PARTY For most people, the initial enrollment period extends seven months (three months before their 65th birthday and three months after). If you miss this window and go 63 days or more without a Medicare drug plan or other creditable drug coverage * while enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B, you will have to pay a late- enrollment penalty. This penalty is 1 percent of the national base beneficiary premium ($33.19 in 2019) multiplied by the number of months without creditable coverage. So if you went 60 full months without coverage, you would pay a monthly penalty of $20 next year (.01 \u00d7 $33.19 \u00d7 60 months = $19.91, rounded to the nearest $0.10). If the national base beneficiary premium increases or decreases, the penalty would change accordingly.q&A *Examples include drug coverage from a current or former employer or union, Department of Veterans A airs, or health insurance coverage.

When buying seafood at Hy-Vee, rest assured knowing you've made a responsible choice. WORDS Beau Berkley PHOTO Tobin Bennett WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD? Hy-Vee is dedicated to selling seafood from sources that maintain or increase production over time without harming the habitat of delicate ecosystems. SEAFOOD 104 BALANCE | November 2018WHAT'S TRENDING 104-105 WhatsTrending_09.26.indd 104 9/26/18 3:30 PM SUSTAINABLESEAFOODWHY CHOOSE RESPONSIBLE SEAFOOD?HY-VEE'S SEAFOOD PROCUREMENT POLICY Fresh and Frozen Seafood Whichever seafood product you purchase, you'll be making a good decision if you're at Hy-Vee. All seafood is rated Best Choice or Good Alternative by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program, or is certi ed to an environmental standard equivalent. Shelf-Stable Tuna Hy-Vee sources shelf-stable tuna from sheries that are certi ed by the Marine Stewardship Council, or are rated Best Choice or Good Alternative by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program. Traceability Knowing where your food comes from is important to consider when thinking about responsible sourcing. Hy-Vee implements industry best practices and works with seafood suppliers to create reliable traceability systems. Social Responsibility Hy-Vee's strong values extend to seafood suppliers, which are expected to uphold human rights principles and identify, prevent and mitigate abuses such as human tra cking and forced labor. Policy Engagement At the core of long-term, sustainable seafood production is strong policy at the local, state, national and international levels. Hy-Vee stands behind positive seafood industry policy and management reform that leads to positive social, economic and environmental outcomes. PROUD TO OFFER RESPONSIBLE CHOICESAll Hy-vee fresh and frozen seafood is certi ed Responsible Choice, meaning it's been rated either Best Choice or Good Alternative by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch. HUMAN RIGHTS Hy-Vee works with organizations like Fishwise, a non- pro t that promotes the health of ocean ecosystems, and other organizations to prevent human tra cking, forced or unlawful labor and hazardous work conditions. \" We are all moving in the same positive direction in this issue, \" says Nate Stewart, Hy-Vee Executive Vice President, Perishables.ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS Certain shing methods can decimate aquatic habitats. Some shing gears are large and drag across the ocean fl oor, taking out shelter, food and breeding grounds for various populations of ocean life. \"When something is labeled Responsible Choice, as all of our seafood is, a customer can be assured that it 's shed responsibly, \" Stewart says. SEAFOOD POPULATIONS According to the Food and Agriculture Organizations of the United Nations, roughly one-third of assessed sh populations are over- shed. In addition to loss of sh populations, over- shing can harm economies in a ected areas. Buying responsibly farmed or caught seafood helps support healthy populations. Source: www.hy-vee.com/corporate/news-events/news-press-releases/hyvees-responsible-choice-seafood-initiative-ranked-no-2-in-the-us/In August, the environmental organization Greenpeace ranked Hy-Vee second out of the 22 largest supermarket chains in the United States for its sustainability efforts. The honor from Greenpeace is a part of the Carting Away the Oceans report, which ranks supermarkets based on efforts to protect oceans and seafood workers. Purchasing Responsible Choice seafood impacts more than dinner plans. You're supporting e orts to ensure that seafood populations remain plentiful, environments are left intact and working conditions are safe for shermen.
