1: INTRODUCTIONCOMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT -6-CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION Aspire Health Partners is pleased to be able to participate in the comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) with our other partners. This approach better enables us to address the needs of our patients in a collaborative manner and avoid duplication of efforts. The patients of Aspire with mental health and substance use disorders also suffer from other physical illness and disabilities that prevent them from living a fully healthy life. This needs assessment has given us a better picture of all the community needs of the people whom we serve and allows us, withour partners, to focus on the most severe and pressing concerns that willimpact the quality of their lives in Central Florida. Jerry Kassab President Aspire Health PartnersMESSAGE FROM THE LEADERS OF THE CENTRAL FLORIDA COMMUNITY BENEFIT COLLABORATION At Florida Hospital, our mission is to extend the healing ministry of Christ.As a not-for-prot healthcare organization, one of the ways we carry out thismission is by collaborating with community partners to improve the healthof the communities we serve. We've had the privilege of working together with Orlando Health, Aspire Health Partners and the Departments of Health representing our service areas on the CHNA to provide a baseline of health status in Central Florida. The health of a community is determined by the physical, mental, spiritual, environmental and social well-being of community residents. The CHNA examines some of these health factors that will help us identify the most critical health barriers that our communities face. These insights will theninform our Community Health Plans, allowing us to more effectively and efciently improve health in our community and better meet the needs of underserved populations in Central Florida. Daryl Tol President & CEO Florida Hospital & Central Florida Region of Adventist Health System Orlando Health is committed to reaching beyond our walls to touch lives in the places where our care is needed most. In order to provide this criticalcare, we align with those who share this commitment. Through the CHNA,we worked alongside our local health departments and other healthcareorganizations to identify the health needs of our community. We look forwardto continuing our collaborative efforts to improve the health and quality oflife in the Central Florida region. David Strong President & CEO Orlando HealthCOMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT -7-CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION The CHNA gives us a great opportunity to align our goals with our partners and focus in on what will be the most important health challenges ourcommunities will face. The Florida Department of Health in Lake County is determined to discover the most impactful health issues that we will strive to overcome in the upcoming years. We appreciate our partners' willingnessto address these issues in unison. Thank you for your continued interest in our CHNA and welcome, to what we hope will be an integral step in addressing a path to better health outcomes! Aaron Kissler, MPH Health OfficerFlorida Department of Health in Lake CountyMESSAGE FROM THE CEOS OF THE CENTRAL FLORIDA COMMUNITY BENEFIT COLLABORATION Participating in this regional collaboration for our CHNA has been tremendously helpful in identifying healthcare gaps that exist in our community and throughout the region. We believe partnering with the local health departments and other healthcare organizations in Central Florida to conduct this assessment will allow us to more effectively address the healthcare needs in our community and throughout the region. Collaboration is a key component to successfully impacting the health and social well-beingfor the populations we serve. John A. Moore, FACHE President South Lake Hospital The CHNA is an example of the commitment of the agencies that came together to make it happen. It is also a valuable asset to our community. It serves as a call to action to community leaders, elected ofcials, and thebusiness and faith communities to come together to positively impact all sectors of our community. The CHNA helps us to focus on health equity,heroin use, the homeless, hunger and HIV. It also allows us to create aroadmap and action plan for collective impact to make our community the healthiest place to work, live and play. Kevin Sherin, MD, FAAFP, FACPM Health Officer and Director Florida Department of Health in Orange CountyCOMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT -8-CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION The CHNA represents a collaborative, community-based approach to identify, assess and prioritize the most important health issues affecting a community. The CHNA looks at health status, barriers to care and other social determinants of health that can have an impact on individuals, families and the community as a whole. The Florida Department of Health in Osceola County has worked with our community partners and stakeholders in previous assessment cycles, through which we developed a Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) withspecic opportunities for improved health. The results of this most recent CHNA will provide critical information that will help us to continue to address short- and long-term strategies to further advance the health of our community. Belinda Johnson-Cornett, MS, RN-C, MBA Health Officer Florida Department of Health in Osceola CountyMESSAGE FROM THE CEOS OF THE CENTRAL FLORIDA COMMUNITY BENEFIT COLLABORATION This was a great opportunity to collaborate across jurisdictional lines to improve population health and implement interventions that are truly needed to make Central Floridians healthier. Moving forward with new data will allow us to focus on the social determinants of health and addressthe root causes of what is making people sick. Swannie Jett, DrPH Health Officer Florida Department of Health in Seminole CountyCHAPTER 2: ABOUT THE COL LABOR ATIONCOMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT -9-CHAPTER 2: ABOUT THE COLLABORATION ABOUT THE CENTRAL FLORIDA COMMUNITY BENEFIT COLLABORATION The Central Florida Community Benet Collaboration's Vision: To promote and inspire a culture of health by collaborating with traditional and non-traditional partners, ensuring access to healthcare resources, developing evidence-based programs and advancing health equity throughout the Central Florida region. Hospital community benet activities promote health and well-being by collaboratively addressing community health needs. In Central Florida, there is a well-established tradition of healthcare organizations, providers, community partners and individuals committed to meeting our local health needs. The region is home to several respected hospitals that are ranked in the nation's top 100, a Level One Trauma Center, nine designated teaching hospitals and the University of Central Florida College of Medicine. Florida's healthcare landscape continues to evolve since the passing of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010. Thirty states plus D.C. expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Florida did not and as of January 2015, just under 300,000 Floridians had enrolled into Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) since the beginning of the Health Insurance Marketplace's rst open enrollment period. Across the nation, approximately 11.2 million more Americans are now enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP (Health & Human Services, 2015). If Florida had expanded Medicaid, close to 850,000 uninsured people would have gained coverage. Despite the decision not to expand Medicaid, the ACA is working to make healthcare more affordable, accessible and high quality for the people of Florida (Health & Human Services, 2015). Lake, Osceola, Orange and Seminole Counties reduced their uninsured rate by a combined average of ve percent. Nationwide, approximately 16.4 million uninsured people have gained health insurance coverage \u2014 the largest reduction in the uninsured in four decades (Enroll America, 2015). Not only has the ACA increased the number of insured, the landmark legislation also has helped communities mobilize and develop Community Health Improvement Plans to improve community health outcomes. The ACA requires all licensed not-for-prot hospitals to conduct a Community HealthNeeds Assessment (CHNA) every three years. Not-for-prot hospitals must also develop measurable Implementation Strategies (i.e., a Community Health Plan, or CHP) to address the needs dened by the assessment. In addition, the hospitals must provide annual updates on these strategies in their IRS Form 990. In parallel with the not-for-prot hospitals, all 67 county health departments in Florida are required to conduct a CHNA. The purpose of the required assessment is to determine public healthpriorities for the next three to ve years. As a best practice for health assessment and planning, mostcounty health departments use Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnership (MAPP), whichwas developed by the National Association for City and County Health Ofcials (NACCHO), as theframework for their assessment. Many national and state public health organizations includingNACCHO and the Florida Department of Health use MAPP. As a result, Lake, Orange, Osceola andSeminole Counties used MAPP for their assessments. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 10 -CHAPTER 2: ABOUT THE COLLABORATION Given these new requirements for both not-for-prot hospitals and departments of health, in 2012, Florida Hospital, Orlando Health and Aspire Health Partners (formerly Lakeside Behavioral Healthcare) partnered to prepare the rst joint CHNA. In 2015, Florida Hospital, Orlando Health, South Lake Hospital, in afliation with Orlando Health, Aspire Health Partners and the Florida Department of Health in Lake, Orange, Osceola and Seminole Counties formed the Central Florida Community Benet Collaboration (\"the Collaboration\") to provide a broader perspective of the region's health needs. Community engagement is the process of working collaboratively with and through groups of people afliated by geographic proximity, special interest or similar situations to address issues affecting their well-being.It is a powerful vehicle for bringing about environmental, cultural, health and behavioral changes that will improve the quality of life of the community. It often involves partnerships and coalitions that help mobilize resources and influence systems, change relationships among partners, and serve as catalysts for changing policies, programs and practices (Principles of Community Engagement, ASTDR, CDC, 2011). The Collaboration engaged the consulting services of Impact Partners, LLC to lead Central Florida through an expanded CHNA. Impact Partners worked to build on top of the rst CHNA, completed in 2013, in order to maintain the integrity of the original benchmark data, to evaluate the progress of the previous priorities by comparing historical benchmark data and to measure long-term progress.Impact Partners conducts community engagement/assessment projects across the United States. Since each community is unique, their approach to better understanding a community's need is aligned with the Social-Ecological Model. The Social-Ecological Model is a comprehensive approach to health and urban planning that not only addresses a community's or individual's risk factors, but also the norms, beliefs, and social and economic systems that create the conditions for poor community health outcomes. Impact Partners subscribes to the notion that the social, natural and physical environments in which peoplelive, as well as their lifestyles and behaviors, can influence their quality of life and health outcomes.Communities can achieve long-term quality of life improvements, prosperous economies, and happy and healthy neighborhoods when ordinary citizens become involved and work together to affect change. Ordinary citizens can influence the direction of a community, not just people who already have power. The New Economy is simply this: when communities invest in quality of life assets and infrastructure, their economies grow and people prosper. Period.CHAPTER 3: EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCOMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 11 -CHAPTER 3: ExeeECUTIVE SUMMARY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The health of a community is determined by the physical, mental, environmental, spiritual and social well-being of all community residents. Achieving such a complex state of being requires an equally complex understanding of the determinants of each of these aspects of health. A Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) \u2014 driven by community input \u2014 is a systematic approach to collecting, analyzing and using complex data and information to identify priority areas for health improvement efforts. This CHNA report serves as a baseline of the health status of the four counties identied by theCollaboration as the geography of focus: Lake, Orange, Osceola and Seminole Counties located in Central Florida. Using national strategies including Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) and The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's County Heath Rankings as a framework for the CHNA, data were compiled from the most up-to-date, publicly available resources and primary research with community residents, providers and stakeholders. In order to provide more geographically granular information, facility utilization data were used to generate hot spots in the community. In combination with the other data sources, hot spotting allows the Collaboration to prioritize community need in the provision of care (Cutts, Rafalski, Grant, & Marinescu, 2014). The ndings from the Collaboration's CHNA demonstrate the need for improvement in social determinants of health, health status, access to care and built environment elements across the four counties. The four-county area falls short of HP2020 goals in multiple areas and is worse than state statistics in many others. Disparities in access and preventative care as well as food access demonstrate the need for concerted action in order to achieve health equity and overall health improvement for the entire population. Health disparities are differences in health outcomes between groups that reflect social inequalities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2011 Health Disparities and Inequalities Report, \"Since the 1980s, our nation has made substantial progress in improving residents' health and reducing health disparities, but ongoing racial/ethnic, economic and other social disparities in health are both unacceptable and correctable.\" Throughout this report, we will highlight health disparities in the identied CHNA region. There are benets to addressing the health of the community beyond simply having healthier residents.According to The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, improving the health of the community benetsthe bottom line of local businesses and the local economy. Healthier communities help to cultivate ahealthy, more productive workforce fueling future economic growth. Healthy communities are also associated with higher rates of education, which benets both workers and employers. Finally, healthiercommunities attract more talented employees and a healthier customer base that can strengthen theireconomies. The issues brought to light in this report are the product of a social determinants approach to health; that is, how the social conditions in which individuals live and work affect their physical health (Lang,Lepage, Schieber, Lamy, & Kelly-Irving, 2012). Thus, rather than prioritizing physical diagnoses thatmay need addressing, this reports aims to guide efforts toward changing the aspects of the environmentthat have causal links to those diagnoses. CHAPTER 4: SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL MODEL OF HEALTHCOMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 12 -CHAPTER 4: CHNA - SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL MODEL OF HEALTH COMMUNITY INFLUENCES:SOCIAL NORMS AS WELL AS THE INTERACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS AMONG ORGANIZATIONSSOCIETAL INFLUENCES: HEALTH, ECONOMIC, EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIETAL POLICIESRELATIONSHIPS INFLUENCES:ASSOCIATION WITH FRIENDS, FAMILY, CO/hyphen.caseWORKERS AND SOCIAL NETWORKSINDIVIDUAL INFLUENCES:ATTITUDES THATSUPPORT UNHEALTHY BEHAVIORSSOCIAL/hyphen.caseECOLOGICAL MODEL1 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT: SOCIAL/hyphen.caseECOLOGICAL MODEL OF HEALTH The Social-Ecological Model of Health (SEM) is a public health framework used to holistically describe four social levels of influence that explain the complex interaction between individuals and the social context in which they live and work. This Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) report serves as the foundation for improving health, wellness and quality of life in Central Florida. In order for the Collaboration and community partners to identify communities in need of public health services and strategically plan health interventions, it is rst necessary to understand the elements that influence health and well-being. Health and well-being is shaped not only by behavior choices of individuals but also by complex factors that influence those choices. The SEM provides a framework to help understand the various factors and behaviorsthat affect health and wellness. With this model, we can closely examine a specic health problem in a particularsetting or context. Human behavior is difcult to change and is nearly impossible to modify without understanding the environment in which one lives. In order to increase behavior that supports health and wellness, efforts need to focus onbehavior choices and factors that influence those choices. The SEM helps identify factors that influence behaviorby considering the complex interplay among individual, interpersonal, community and public policy factors. Itshows how the changes and interactions between these four levels over the course of one's life greatly affecthealth and wellness. By utilizing the SEM, the likelihood of developing sustainable interventions with thebroadest impact on health and wellness is increased. 1Social-Ecological Model, CDC.CHAPTER 5: METHODOLOGYCOMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 13 -CHAPTER 5: METHODOLOGY The four-county assessment covering Lake, Orange, Osceola and Seminole Counties collected and analyzed secondary and primary data that generated common themes for the region, county, ZIP code and neighborhood census tracts. Secondary data about health indicators, healthcare utilization and insurance coverage was gathered from sources including the U.S. Census, Florida Community Health Assessment Resource Tool Set (CHARTS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Data, County Health Rankings, the American Community Survey and hospital claims data. Primary data sources included a consumer survey, a provider survey, in-depth interviews with community stakeholders and community conversations. DEFINING THE COMMUNITY Using community health data, hospital claims data and geographic-specic utilization data, the Collaboration recognized the disparity between health status, socioeconomics and insurance coverage. Those individuals in the lowest income level without insurance have the greatest health needs and are most challenged in gaining access to high quality, affordable healthcare. In addition, the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) identied children and youth as the population most at risk for adopting poor health behaviors but with thegreatest opportunity for successful intervention. Each of the participating hospitals' Implementation Strategies and Community Benet Plans will address the health needs of the broader population with a special focus on those members of the population who demonstrate the greatest need. Each of the participating hospitals in the Collaboration discussed and agreed upon their respective targeted communities. Internal hospital patient census, existing community benet programs, as well as secondary data and community scans facilitated the specic community audiences to engage for the primary data collection. The targeted community audience for primary data collected included, but was not limited to, adults and children living below the poverty level, homeless/transient, unwed mothers, the disabled and their caregivers, children and adolescents, senior citizens, adults and children with a variety of education levels, adults and children from diverse racial identication, and healthcare professionals. SECONDARY DATA Existing data collected by other entities were utilized in the assessment. These data sources included the U.S. Census Bureau, including the American Community Survey; Florida CHARTS; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention BRFSS Data; County Health Rankings; and hospital utilization data. These resources provide data related to specic health indicators, built environment, healthcare access and utilization, and health insurance coverage. Data collected from these sources report incidence, prevalence or age-adjusted death rates (AADR) for each indicator. Incidence refers to the rate of new cases of a disease, reflecting the risk of contracting said disease,while prevalence indicates how widespread a condition is at a given point in time. AADRs are computed aftergiving consideration to the relationship between a given disease and how commonly it occurs in different agegroups. These numerical rates are reported per 100,000 residents. Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) objectives are used as benchmarks for a number of indicators in this report. Healthy People is an initiative of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that provides empirically-based national objectives for improving the health of all Americans. HP2020 is the 10-year agenda forimproving the nation's health launched in December 2010.COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 14 -CHAPTER 5: METHODOLOGY HOSPITAL HOT SPOTTING GIS METHODOLOGY Patients who frequently over-utilize healthcare services typically suffer from multiple chronic conditions, requiring frequent care provided by a number of different providers. Many also have complicated social situations that directly impact their ability to get and stay well. Too often high-utilizer patients experience inefcient, poorly coordinated care that results in multiple trips to emergency rooms and costly hospitaladmissions. Patient data from hospitals in the Collaboration allow the location analysis and mapping of local \"hot spots\" with high numbers of uninsured visits over-utilizing the healthcare system. In addition to the standard hospital patient data in most hot spotting projects, this hot spotting includes economic variables and conditions of the area to analyze the correlation between healthcare utilizations and the socioeconomic conditions in which people live. Step 1: Converting Hospital Excel Data to GIS Data The hospital systems rst sent patient data in the form of Microsoft Excel tables. These tables had no identifying information within them, with the exception of address data and visit IDs. While address data were essential to the development of hot spots, the East Central Florida Regional Planning Council (ECFRPC) did not analyze addresses or other identifying information. The uninsured visit data were split into admitting facilities and then further separated into inpatient and emergency room (ER) discharges. In order to reduce the size of data to be analyzed in the Geographic Information System (GIS), visits from out of state, addresses with P.O. boxes or those noted as \"homeless\" were removed, as well as addresses external to the service areas of the hospitals. This left only valid addresses within the region for the purpose of geocoding. A copy of the original data was kept for overall analysis based on type of visit. Florida Hospital for Children data were derived from Florida Hospital Orlando's facility data by querying patients who were age 17 and under at the time of visit.The ECFRPC then imported the Excel tables into ArcGIS 10.2 to \"geocode\" these addresses into a GIS. This was done using the ESRI-based address locator that places a point on the map for each record utilizing the address located in the Excel table. This process was completed separately for inpatient and ER/outpatient data tables, for each hospital, which resulted in the geocoding of more than 30 Excel tables. Step 2: Developing Hot Spots From Point Data Once point data were moved to the GIS database, the ECFRPC ran the 'point density' function in ArcGIS, which results in a weighted proximity average for each square block of land (known as a 'raster'). The results of the point density function are \u2014 overall \u2014 related to the spatial distribution of point (patient) data. If data are spread out over a large region with no true density nodes, then the output will be highlygeneralized and not useful. However, if the points conglomerate in certain areas, those areas are identied aspotential hot spots. Within the point density function, two parameters were set. One parameter was the proximity, which is a radius placed around each raster (or square piece of land in varying resolutions). This variable sets the distance fromwhich rasters are calculated. For example, if the resolution is approximately 400 feet and a raster has 12patients within that distance, then the raster is given a value of 12. When this is repeated across a geographicalstudy area, hot spots are identied as the conglomerations of rasters with the highest values. The second input was the size of each raster. The size of the raster is the length of the four sides of each raster square, which again are a series of aligned squares that overlay a map. When rasters are larger, the result ismore generalized and less detailed. With smaller raster sizes, very detailed maps can be completed. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 15 -CHAPTER 5: METHODOLOGY HOSPITAL HOT SPOTTING GIS METHODOLOGY, CONT'D. Overall, the size of the rasters in an output is a function of the spatial distribution of the points. For example, if the entire Central Florida region had just ve points of data, the raster size would naturally be very large to account for the lack of data. For the patient data, it was the ECFRPC's goal to obtain the smallest rasters possible to identify neighborhood scale trends and hot spots. Each hot spot model run (via the point density tool) was unique to the distribution of points. ArcGIS will take the spatial relationship of each point (for the dataset being analyzed) and assign customized parameters to each dataset. The ECFRPC then ran the tool for each hospital. If the point density tool showed neighborhood-level detail, then the process was completed. However, if the point density tool was too generalized, the parameters were customized until the output showed neighborhood-level results. Some hospitals had multiple model runs to obtain neighborhood-level results, while other hospitals only required one (or the 'default parameter') model run. Step 3: Identifying Hot Spots ArcGIS will automatically take the distribution of values assigned to each raster (from Step 2, above) and tranche these rasters into categories of classes. For example, a raster value of ve through 10 can be within one tranche, while raster values of 11 through 15 could be in another tranche. The ECFRPC utilized the default tranches assigned in ArcGIS and increased the number of classication categories to a range of 15 through 30. This means that, for each output dataset of rasters, 15 to 30 categories of values were assigned. Each of these classes was then assigned a color within the map, with higher values popping out more, becoming easier to identify. The boundaries of the hot spots were the edges of the rasters that met a threshold corresponding to the tranche (of values) for which each raster was assigned. For example, a hot spot boundary could consist of the three highest value tranches out of 30 total tranches, or the top tranche in a 20-tranche output. The boundaries of these hot spots were customized in order to obtain approximately 500 to 1,500 visits within each hot spot. Inpatient hot spots, in some cases, had less records due to aspects of their regional spatial distribution. Once a hot spot was identied, the ECFRPC then selected all of the visit records (or points) within the hot spot and exported the associated table data back into Excel for analysis. PRIMARY DATA Consumer Survey The survey was distributed both in hard copy (1,407) and via SurveyMonkey (291) with a total of 1,698 responses. While most respondents completed the survey in English, 331 were completed in Spanish, six in French and three in Creole. Data screening measures ensured that the surveys analyzed were valid andprovided useful data. First, survey responses were screened based on answers to two conflicting items fromthe public safety subscale. Responses that had similar answers to these two opposing questions wereassumed to be invalid and dismissed. Second, rather than discard an entire survey if it was incomplete,these cases were scanned for any subscales that were complete. The responses with completed subscaleswere included in the analysis. Finally, surveys with unidentied zip codes were not included in the nalanalysis. After data screening, 1,235 responses were analyzed. Provider Survey This survey, distributed electronically, included responses from 145 participants. The questions were mostly open-ended and explored respondents' views on the community's decits given a holistic denition of ahealthy community, issues related to healthcare services and forces of change in the community.COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 16 -CHAPTER 5: METHODOLOGY PRIMARY DATA, CONT'D. Stakeholder In-depth Interviews Interviews were conducted with 16 community stakeholders. Each interview lasted an average of 65 minutes. After each interview was fully transcribed, they were analyzed using qualitative analysis principles from NVivo 11. First, a basic word frequency was run for each question and related set of questions. Then, this word frequency was expanded to include words similar to those with the highest frequency. Finally, the context of the most frequently used words and phrases was examined to generate themes. The structured interviews asked questions about the following topics: -Community Health & Wellness Subscale - Physical - Mental & Behavioral Health - Environmental Health- Social Health -Risk Factors Subscale-Health Promoting Behaviors - Sickness & Death Behaviors -Healthcare Access Subscale- Primary Healthcare- Specialty Healthcare- ER and Urgent Care- Mental and Behavioral Healthcare- Dental Care -Forces of Change Subscale Basic information for each stakeholder is outlined in Table 5.1. Collaboration County-level Themes Members of the Collaboration developed a distilled list of county-level areas of concern based on the knowledge that each of them brought to the group about the needs of the residents in each county. Initially, any area of concern was heard and added to a list. Then, the group worked together in multiple rounds of voting to drilldown from dozens of topics to 10-15 areas of concern for each county. Community Conversations Six community conversation sessions took place with a total of 102 participants. These conversations employed the World Caf\u00e9/Cross Pollination method. Each participant was seated at a table with other participants. Eachtable engaged in conversation, writing down key thoughts and ideas on cards or sketching them out on paper.After 20-30 minutes, participants were asked to change tables, carrying thoughts from their previous table totheir new group. Throughout the process, a \"table host\" stayed behind at each table to share the insights of theprevious discussion with the new arrivals. After these small-group rounds, all participants convened for a large-group conversation and collective knowledge was \"harvested.\"COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 17 -CHAPTER 5: METHODOLOGY RETROSPECTIVE DATA EVALUATION The Collaboration conducted a retrospective data evaluation by looking backward and examining the priorities selected during the rst assessment and evaluated their relevancy to date. The Collaboration also reviewed andevaluated the progress of the Implementation Strategies addressing these previously agreed upon priority areas.

Orange County is by far the most populous of the assessment region and Osceola is the least populous. However, Osceola County has seen the largest percentage of growth (80 percent) since 2000. (See Chart 6.1) Population by Age (2014) Similar to the age distribution at the state level, residents between the ages of 0-14 are the largest age group. Orange, Osceola and Seminole Counties skew younger, while Lake County has a noticeably higher percentage of residents aged 65 and older than the other three counties. (See Chart 6.2) Permanent Resident Growth by Age (2014) Chart 6.3 breaks down the anticipated age breakdown for the population residing in the four-county assessment region. In the year 2020, residents aged 20-39 are still expected to make up the largest segment of the population. The year 2020 is expected to be the rst since 2000 that there will be more youth residents than middle-aged residents; people aged 0-19 will outnumber those aged 40-59. Across the region, each age group is expected to experience an increase from 2015-2020, with the largest increases among those aged 60-74 (20 percent) and aged 75+ (18 percent). (See Chart 6.3) Population by Gender (2014) All four counties have a gender distribution that is nearly equal, with slightly more women than men. Osceola County most closely mirrors the state proportions and Seminole County has the most unequal distribution. (See Chart 6.4) Population by Race (2014) Each county in the assessment is overwhelmingly White. Orange County has the largest percentage of Black residents. The largest percentage of Asian residents is in Seminole County. American Indian and Native Hawaiian each make up less than one percent in every county of the region and the state as a whole. (See Chart 6.5) Population by Ethnicity (2015) Just under a quarter of Florida residents are Hispanic or Latino. Seminole and Lake Counties are below the state level while Orange and Osceola have a larger percentage of Hispanic residents than the state. Osceola byfar has the most Hispanic or Latino residents, with nearly half of their population identifying as such. (SeeChart 6.6) Language Other Than English Spoken at Home (2014) Based on the number of Hispanic or Latino residents in Osceola County, it is not surprising that nearly half of those who live in Osceola speak a language other than English at home. Orange County also has a higherproportion of residents speaking a language other than English at home compared to the state level of 28percent. (See Chart 6.7)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 19 -CHAPTER 6: COMMUNITY PROFILE OF THE FOUR-COUNTY REGION ECONOMIC CONDITIONS Median Household Income (2000-2014) Seminole County consistently has a higher median household income than the other three counties in the assessment region and the state as a whole but has experienced a decline since 2010. Lake County has experienced consistent increases in median income since 2000; the other three counties peaked in 2010 thenslightly dropped in 2013, similar to what happened at the state level. (See Chart 6.8) Persons Living Below Poverty Level (2000-2014) Every county in the region has experienced an increase in the percentage of people living under the poverty line from 2000-2014. Osceola has the highest percentage at nearly 21 percent in 2014. Lake and Seminole have consistently seen percentages below the state level. Orange County was below the state level in 2000 and 2010, then reported higher percentages in 2013 and 2014. (See Chart 6.9) Title I Schools - Students Receiving Free & Reduced Lunch (2014) Title I designation provides additional resources to schools with economically disadvantaged students. Theseresources provide additional teachers, professional development, extra time for teaching, parent involvement activities and other activities designed to raise student achievement. Orange County has the highest percentage of Title I schools in the region while Lake County has the lowest. Regarding free and reduced lunch, Osceola County has the highest percent of students receiving free and reduced lunch while Seminole County has the lowest. (See Chart 6.10) Unemployment Rate (2008-2015) Every county in the region and the state saw their highest average unemployment rates in 2010. Seminole County has consistently had the lowest average unemployment rate in recent years, while Osceola has had the highest. The 2014 rates for all counties in the region returned approximately to their 2008 rates. (See Chart 6.11) Homeownership Rates (2000-2014) Lake County has consistently had the highest homeownership rates but also experienced the most signicant decrease from 2000-2014. Seminole County also has homeownership rates higher than the state level. Orange County has had consistently low homeownership rates. (See Chart 6.12) Cost Burdens of Households (2014) According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), households who pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing are considered cost burdened and may have difculty affording necessitiessuch as food, clothing, transportation and medical care. Severely cost burdened is considered more than 50percent of income for housing. Even with the high percentage of household income spent on rent and varyinghomeownership levels, the majority of people in each assessment county and throughout the state experienceno cost burden as dened by HUD. Osceola County has the highest percentage of residents who are costburdened or severely cost burdened. (See Chart 6.13 and Figure 6.1) Homeowner Cost Burden (2014) Homeowners are far less likely to be burdened by the cost of their home than renters. Seminole County homeowners nearly mirror the state level cost burden gures. Lake County homeowners experience the leastcost burden and Osceola County experiences the most. (See Chart 6.14)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 20 -CHAPTER 6: COMMUNITY PROFILE OF THE FOUR-COUNTY REGION ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CONT'D. Gross Rent as a Percent of Income - 5-Year Estimates (2014) Orange and Osceola Counties have very high percentages of residents who spend more than 30 percent of their household income on rent. In every county within the region and at the state level, a plurality of people spend more than 35 percent on rent. (See Chart 6.15) Cost Burden Experienced by Renter Households (2014) Seminole County residents are least cost burdened by their housing costs while Osceola County sees the highest levels of cost burden among its renters. (See Chart 6.16) Homeless People by County (2010-2015) Every county in the region saw a spike in homelessness between 2011-2013. While Lake County has a small population overall, in 2011 and 2012 its residents experienced a very high number of homeless individuals. In 2015, Orange County still had the highest number of homeless people in the four-county assessment region and it was the only county that had not experienced an increase from the previous year. (See Table 6.1) Income Inequality (2014) Income inequality refers to the uneven distribution of income across a population. One measure of income inequality involves generating percentiles for household income. Then, the income (in dollars) at the 20thand 80thpercentiles are used to generate a ratio; the higher the ratio, the higher the income inequality. All four counties in the region have a ratio lower than the state level, indicating more equal distribution of income.Osceola County is the lowest level of income inequality with the only ratio under 4.0 in the four-countyassessment region; Orange County has the highest level of income inequality. (See Chart 6.17) Key Findings Housing has been a major issue for every county in the assessment region. According to stakeholder interviews, homelessness continues to affect the community in a myriad of ways. Law enforcement utilizes resources to connect homeless individuals with mental health and substance abuse services as needed. Additionally, homeless individuals rarely utilize or have access to preventative care; rather, those experiencing homelessness use ERs as their primary source of healthcare. Low wages and lack of affordable housing contribute signicantly to the likelihood of experiencing homelessness. As mentioned previously, untreated substance abuse and mental health issues both contribute to the loss of wages that can lead to homelessness and make itsignicantly difcult to secure housing. Aside from homelessness, poverty is a theme that both secondary and primary sources of data point to as a community concern. The stress of living in poverty has a direct effect on a person's physical and mental healthand well-being. It also limits access to healthy and nutritious foods. The impact of poverty is discussed furtherthroughout the report.

About a quarter of the students in each of these counties are Black and another quarter are Hispanic. Orange County has a more diverse student population, with two-thirds of their students identifying as White, another third Black, and nearly 35 percent Hispanic. Osceola County has the lowest percentage of Black students and the highest percentage of Hispanic students at more than 55 percent. It should be noted that by measuring race and ethnicity separately, the percentages will total 200 percent instead of 100 percent. The reader should be mindful that students may identify as White or Black racially and still Hispanic ethnically. (See Chart 6.18) Student Race/Ethnicity by Number (2014/2015) Orange County has the most students in the four-county region (more than 250,000) while Lake County has the fewest (just over 52,000). (See Chart 6.19) High School Graduation Rate (2010-2015) Orange, Osceola and Seminole Counties have all seen at least a ve percent increase in graduation rates since the 2010-2011 school year. Lake County experienced a three percent increase from 2010-2011 to 2011-2012 and has steadily dropped one percentage point per year since the 2012-2013 school year. Seminole County has the highest graduation rate at 86 percent, eight percent higher than the state average. Osceola County is also above the state average by three percent. (See Chart 6.20) Student Absenteeism (2013/2014) The percentages reported in this chart reflect the percentage of students in each assessment county who were absent 21 or more days during the school year. Lake and Orange Counties have percentages nearly identical to the state average. Osceola's students are chronically absent more often than the state and the other counties in the region, while Seminole County has the lowest absentee percentage. (See Chart 6.21) Homeless Students (2012/2013 - 2014/2015)Between the 2012/2013 and 2014/2015 school years, Osceola County experienced increases in their already above-average percentage of students who are homeless. Seminole County's percentage remained the same across the three school years. Orange and Lake Counties experienced a decrease in the most recent school year. (See Chart 6.22) High School Gang Activity (2014) In 2014, Osceola and Seminole Counties had half the percentage of students in gangs as the state average. Lake County's percentage was in line with the state average at just over two percent. Orange County had the highestpercentage of students involved with gangs. As the county with the largest number of students, having thehighest percentage of students in gangs also means they had the most students (by count) involved in a gang aswell. (See Chart 6.23) Violent Acts per 1,000 Students Grades K-12 (2010-2012) Even with a recent downward trend, students in Orange County have consistently reported much higher rates of violent acts than other counties in the region and it is the only county to report 2012 rates above the statelevel. Lake and Osceola Counties have also reported declines between 2010-2012 with Osceola County at thelowest 2012 rate. Seminole County has seen a slight increase over the same time period. (See Chart 6.24)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 32 -CHAPTER 6: COMMUNITY PROFILE OF THE FOUR-COUNTY REGION SCHOOL AND STUDENT DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, CONT'D. Bullying Prevalence K-12 (2014) More than one-third of all students in the region and in the state experienced bullying that caused worry. Additionally, every county in the region saw at least a quarter of their students taunted or teased in the previous 30 days. Eight percent of students in Lake County had skipped school because of bullying \u2014 the highest percentage in the region. Lake County also had the highest percentage of students who reported having been physically bullied (kicked or shoved) in the previous 30 days. Lake County students were more likely than students in other counties to physically or verbally bully others, while Orange County students were more likely to cyberbully others. (See Chart 6.25) Key Findings It is quite possible that poverty is at the root of a number of these indicators. Osceola County, which has the highest percentage of students in poverty (26.2 percent) also has the highest percentage of chronically absent students and saw the highest increase in student homelessness. Meanwhile, Seminole County has the lowest percentage of students living in poverty (14.3 percent), the highest graduation rate, lowest absenteeism, fewest homeless students and lowest percentage of students involved with gangs.

Health Outcomes weigh Length of Life and Quality of Life equally and Health Factors are comprised of Health Behaviors (weighted at 30 percent), Clinical Care (20 percent), Social and Economic Factors (40 percent) and Physical Environment(10 percent). This results in numerical rankings given to each county in a state. Thus, decision-makers in said counties can see how they stack up relative to the other counties in their state on each of the aforementioned sixmeasures. They can also help these same decision-makers pinpoint areas of focus to improve the health and well-being of residents. All 67 counties in Florida receive rankings. In terms of Health Outcomes and Factors generally, Seminole County leads the way in the region by far as the fourth best in the state in both areas. (See Table 7.1) When the components of Health Outcomes are brokendown, Seminole County is fourth in the state for resident Length of Life and sixth in Quality of Life. Of the component parts of Health Factors, Seminole County continues to be the standout of the region in Social andEconomic Factors, but falls behind in measures of the Physical Environment. Lake and Orange Counties are both in the top 30 percent of the state for both Outcomes and Factors. Osceola County's Health Outcomes ranking is equally as impressive but they rank in the bottom third of the state on Health Factors. This is likely due to very low rankings on Clinical Care and Physical Environment. Osceola County also has the lowest score in the region for Social and Economic Factors.

Again, with the exception of Osceola County, all 2014 gures surpassed the 80 percent Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) target. Osceola County is the only regional county that has seen a decrease in the immunization rates for both two-year olds and kindergarten-aged children. As compared to two-year- olds, kindergarten-aged children are the best off in the four counties analyzed, as each county had immunization rates exceeding 90 percent, 10 percent above the HP2020 target. While Florida rates have remained somewhat constant from 2011-2014, regional counties have been less consistent. Lake County has seen an increase in kindergarten-aged rates, while two-year-old rates are unavailable. With the exception of Osceola County, where both age-based rates saw a decrease, immunization rates within Orange and Seminole Counties increased for kindergarten-aged children but decreased for two-year-olds. (See Chart 7.1) Influenza Vaccination 65+ (2007-2013) Influenza (flu) vaccination rates for adults aged 65 and older have decreased overall during the 2007-2013 time period for all four counties in the region, as well as the state of Florida. The 2010 time period saw increases in influenza vaccination rates within Orange County as well as the state of Florida; remained constant at 71.9 percent within Lake County; and underwent modest reductions in Osceola and Seminole Counties. The 2013 time period saw a somewhat signicant decrease from 2010; especially when compared to the changes observed during the 2007-2010 time period; with the exception of Osceola County, which saw a nominal decrease of 2.9 percent from 2010-2013. All other counties (as well as the state of Florida) saw at least a 10 percent nominal decrease over the 2010-2013 time period. The most signicant change occurred in Lake County; rates from 2010-2013 decreased from 71.9 percent to 51.8 percent, respectively. Florida, as a whole, saw a nominal 10.7 percent decrease within the same time period. (See Chart 7.2) Pneumonia Vaccination 65+ (2007-2013)From 2007-2013, pneumonia vaccination rates for adults aged 65 and older have remained relatively stable in Lake County, hovering just above 70 percent. Orange and Seminole Counties have seen increases over that time span. Osceola County increased by about four percent in 2010, but returned to its 2007 level in 2013. The state of Florida saw a similar peak in 2010; however, the state's 2013 rates were still higher than the 2007 level. Seminole, Lake and Orange Counties all have 2013 rates around 70 percent while Osceola is closer to 60 percent. (See Chart 7.3) New HIV Cases Reported (2010-2014) Orange County has consistently had the highest rate of new HIV cases from 2010-2014. Every county in the region, and the state of Florida, has experienced an increase over this time period. Osceola County's increaseis the starkest \u2014 a 40 percent increase. While Lake County's rate is not as high, they also saw a signicantincrease from 2010-2014. Lake and Seminole Counties remain lower than the state rate while Osceola andOrange Counties rates are higher. (See Chart 7.4)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 39 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY COMMUNICABLE DISEASES, CONT'D. New AIDS Cases Reported (2010-2014) Lake County's rate of new AIDS cases doubled from 2010-2014 but still remained lower than the state average. Seminole is the only county to see consistent decreases in the new AIDS rate over the same time span and currently has the lowest rate in the region. Orange County's rate is the only one in the region that is starkly higher than the state average; the county rate in 2014 was higher than in 2012 but still an overall decrease from the 2010 rate. Osceola County experienced a stark decrease in 2012 but the rate in 2014 increased to a level slightly higher than the 2010 rate. (See Chart 7.5) Key Findings Osceola County has seen a decrease, or no positive change, in the percentage of people, young and old, who are receiving vaccinations. Additionally, they have seen an increase in both new HIV and new AIDS cases. It is the only county in the region whose two-year-old immunization percentage is not at or above the HP2020 target. Across the region, we have seen a decrease in the number of two-year-olds who are fully immunized and, with the exception of Orange County, a decrease in the percentage of elderly adults receiving flu vaccinations. HIV and STIs in general did emerge as themes in Lake, Orange and Osceola Counties' concerns generated by the Collaboration.

The USPSTF is the leading independent panel of private-sector experts in prevention and primary care. The USPSTF recommendations are based on rigorous, impartial assessments of the scientic evidence for the effectiveness of a broad range of clinical preventative services, including screening, counseling and preventative medications. The mission of the USPSTF is to evaluate the benets of individual services based on age, gender and risk factors for disease; make recommendations about which preventative services should be incorporated routinely into primary medical care and for which populations; and identify a research agenda for clinical preventative care. Recommendations issued by the USPSTF are assigned a letter grade of A, B, C, D and I to help clinicians recommend appropriate services to their patients. For a complete list of grades and their denitions, please visit http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/grade-denitions#grade-denitions-after-july-2012. Women 40 Years+ Who Received a Mammogram in Past Year (2002-2010) 2012 USPSTF Recommendations: Women aged 50 to 74 years B Women aged 40 to 49 years CWomen aged 75 years or older IAll women I Women with dense breasts I In most of the region, and in the state, the number of women aged 40 years and older who received a mammogram in the previous year decreased from 2002-2010. Lake County is the only area in the region that has increased over that time period. In 2010, Lake County was also the only county in the region that had a rate above the state average. Osceola County had the lowest rate with less than half of women aged 40 years and older receiving a mammogram. (See Chart 7.6) Women 18 Years+ Who Received Pap Test in Past Year (2002-2013) 2012 USPSTF Recommendations: Women aged 21 to 65 years (Pap Smear) or 30 to 65 (in combo with HPV testing) A Women younger than 30 years, HPV testing D Women younger than 21 years D Women older than 65, who have had adequate prior screening D Women who have had a hysterectomy D In all counties in the region, and in the state, the number of women aged 18 years and older who received a pap test in the previous year decreased from 2002-2013. In 2013, Orange County is the only county in the regionthat had a rate above the state average. Osceola County had the lowest rate with less than 40 percent of womenaged 18 years and older receiving a pap test. (See Chart 7.7)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 44 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY Adults 50 Years+ Who Received a Sigmoidoscopy or Colonoscopy in Past Five Years (2002-2013) 2012 USPSTF Recommendations: Adults aged 50 to 75 years A Adults aged 76 to 85 years C In all counties in the assessment region, and in the state, the number of adults aged 50 years and older who had received a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy in the past ve years increased from 2002-2013. Orange County is the only county with a 2013 rate below the state average. Lake County has the highest rate and saw the largest increase over that time period. (See Chart 7.8) Adults 50 Years+ Who Received a Stool Blood Test in Past Year (2002-2013) Every county in the assessment region, and the state as a whole, has experienced a signicant drop in the percentage of adults aged 50 years and older who received a stool blood test in the past year. Lake County is the only one in the region with a 2013 rate above the state average. Orange County had the lowest 2013 rate. (See Chart 7.9) Men 50 Years+ Who Received a PSA Test in Past Two Years (2007-2010) 2012 USPSTF Recommendations: Men, screening with PSA D New 2017 recommendations are in progress Across the assessment region and around the state, the percentage of men aged 50 years and older receiving a PSA test in the past two years increased. Lake County's 2010 rate is the only one above the state level. Osceola County's rate is the lowest in the region. (See Chart 7.10) Key Findings Based on Secondary and Primary Data Analysis While statewide data show rather signicant changes from the 2002-2013 time period over a number of variables, counties within the Central Florida region have seen rather moderate reductions in positive health decisions for women and the population aged 50 years and older. However, trends on the statewide level as compared to trends at the county level are consistent in terms of the overall trend since the 2002 timeframe. PSA testing \u2014 across the board \u2014 rose approximately 15 percent to 20 percent across all counties and statewide. Another area of signicant improvement was the number of adults aged 50 years or older who have received a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy in the past ve years, with numbers exceeding historic gures. However, a downward trend can be seen on the statewide level and on the county level, across the board, formammograms and stool blood tests. Updated data for men aged 50 years or older who received a PSA test inthe past two years, as well as updated data for women aged 40 years and older who received a mammogram inthe previous year, were not readily available at the time of this study. When looking at other data sources utilized in this assessment, only Lake County's 2013 priorities cited cancer screenings as a concern for the community. Otherwise, preventative care did not emerge as an area of concernin other data collection methods.

Osceola County trended above the 30.5 percent goal in 2010, however, was able to move below this goal in 2013. Lake and Orange Counties both trended upward through 2010 with a decline through 2013. (See Chart 7.11) Middle School Students Reporting BMI At or Above 95thPercentile (2006-2012) The percentage of middle school students reporting a BMI at or above the 95thpercentile has remained relatively constant at the state level from 2006-2012. Lake County is the only county in the region to report an increase over that time period. It is also the only county whose 2012 level is above that of the state. Orange County peaked in 2008 and has steadily dropped since. Seminole County's trend has worked in the opposite fashion; the low point was in 2008 but has steadily increased since then. (See Chart 7.12) High School Students Reporting BMI At or Above 95thPercentile (2006-2012) The state's trend for high school students reporting a BMI at or above the 95thpercentile has been upward between 2006-2012. Lake, Orange and Seminole Counties have followed this trend. Lake County has the highest percentage and the only rate above the state level. Seminole County had been consistently low until 2012. (See Chart 7.13) Adults With Diagnosed Diabetes (2002-2013) The HP2020 goal for new cases per 1,000 population aged 18-84 years is 7.2 percent. The data presented in the graphic represent the percent of adults in each county who have ever been diagnosed with diabetes, thus it is not a true comparison to the HP2020 goal. There has been an upward trend regionally in the percent of adults who have been diagnosed with diabetes. Osceola County had a large increase (43 percent) between 2010-2013, while Seminole County's increase between 2007-2010 was 80 percent. Seminole County, however, experienced a30 percent decline in this indicator since 2010, the only county to decline in the region since 2002. Lake County,Orange County and the state of Florida, as a whole, have been showing a steady increase in the percent of adults with diagnosed diabetes. (See Chart 7.14) Diabetes Hospitalizations - Children, Ages 5-11 (2011-2014) The rate for hospitalizations due to diabetes for children aged 5-11 years in the state has fluctuated right around 40 per 100,000 since 2011. Orange County's rates have hovered right under that rate from 2012-2014. Osceola County experienced increases from 2011-2013 then a stark decrease for 2014. While Lake County has seen adecrease since their peak in 2012, their 2014 rate is still higher than in 2011. Seminole County reports a 2014rate that is signicantly lower than any other rate in the assessment region and much lower than the state level.(See Chart 7.15) Diabetes Hospitalizations - Children, Ages 12-18 (2011-2014) For diabetes hospitalizations among children aged 12-18 years, Lake County's 2014 rate is the highest it's been for the county and much higher than the state level. Orange County has experienced fluctuations each year buthas had an overall increase since 2011. Osceola County peaked in 2012 and has dropped to levels consistentwith the state in 2013 and 2014. Seminole County is the only one to report a 2014 rate lower than the previousyear's. (See Chart 7.16)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 49 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY CHRONIC CONDITIONS, CONT'D. High Blood Pressure Prevalence - Adults (2002-2013) The prevalence of adults with high blood pressure has increased across the region upwards of 57 percent in Lake County and 80 percent in Seminole County in 2010. As a region, in 2013, the prevalence of high blood pressure (hypertension) (33.7 percent average) is above the HP2020 goal of 26.9 percent, despite a decrease in 2013 from the uptick in 2010, while still slightly below the state at 35 percent. (See Chart 7.17) Adults With Hypertension Who Take Blood Pressure Medication (2007-2013) Every county in the assessment region has percentages lower than the state average of adults with hypertension who take blood pressure medication. Additionally, every county has experienced a decrease since 2007. Lake County has the highest rate, while Osceola County has the lowest rate. (See Chart 7.18) Adults Who Have Ever Been Told They Had a Stroke (2007-2013) In line with the state level trend, Lake, Orange and Seminole Counties have experienced an increase between 2007-2013 in the percent of adults who have ever had a stroke. Osceola County, despite a spike in 2010, still experienced an overall decrease over the same time period and reported the lowest rate in the region for 2013. Lake County reported the highest 2013 rate and was the only county whose rate was above the state average. (See Chart 7.19) Adults Who Have Ever Been Told They Had High Cholesterol (2002-2013) Within the four-county region, Lake County consistently experienced the highest level of high cholesterol, hovering around 40 percent, well above the 13.5 percent target for HP2020. Orange County appears to be trending downward with a decline of approximately 32 percent, despite a slight increase in 2010. Osceola County's prevalence of high cholesterol has experienced the same trend as Lake County's with a slight increase in 2010, though remaining relatively constant. Seminole County has experienced the largest increase in the percentage of adults having been told they have high cholesterol, increasing from 26.7 percent in 2002 to 37.4 percent in 2013 (41.3 percent in 2010). This is an increase of 40 percent from 2002-2013. (See Chart 7.20) Heart Disease Age Adjusted Death Rate (AADR) by County (2014) Osceola County's AADR for heart disease is the highest in the region and much higher than the state level. Lake County is also marginally higher than the state. Orange and Seminole Counties are under the state rate with gures right around 150 people per 100,000. (See Chart 7.21) Age Adjusted Hospitalizations From Congestive Heart Failure (2010-2014) Hospitalizations from congestive heart failure have decreased across the assessment region and throughout the state. Lake County has the lowest rate in the region and is the only rate below the state level. Orange County hasconsistently had the highest rate since 2010. (See Chart 7.22) Rectal Cancer Incidence (2008-2012) Lake County has mimicked the state's gradual decrease from 2008-2012, but remains higher than the state.Every county in the assessment region reported 2012 rates above the state average. Seminole County hasremained the most stable with a slight increase since 2008. Orange and Osceola Counties have fluctuated year-to-year with Orange experiencing a marginal increase and Osceola a marginal decrease from 2008-2012. (SeeChart 7.23)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 50 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY CHRONIC CONDITIONS, CONT'D. Breast Cancer Incidence (2008-2012) Lake and Seminole Counties mirror the steady decrease in breast cancer incidence that has been seen at the state level. However, both counties' rates remain above the state average. Orange and Osceola Counties have experienced marginal decreases between 2008-2012. (See Chart 7.24) Lung Cancer Incidence, Age Adjusted (2010-2012) Seminole County is the only county in the assessment region with rates consistently below the state level for lung cancer incidence and experienced a decrease from 2010-2012. Osceola County has experienced a 40 percent increase over the same period. Orange County experienced a less severe increase after dipping slightly in 2011. Lake County has decreased since 2010 despite having a 2012 rate that is higher than the previous year. (See Chart 7.25) Adults Currently With Asthma (2002-2013) Regionally and statewide, there has been an increase, overall, in the percent of adults currently with asthma. Lake County experienced their largest jump between 2010-2013 from 6.2 percent to 8.7 percent. While Orange County had a signicant decline in 2007, their numbers increased to above their 2002 baseline in 2010, and since has declined to below eight percent in 2013. Between 2002-2010, Osceola County's prevalence of adults currently with asthma doubled to more than 10 percent. Seminole County has shown an upward trend in adults currently with asthma since 2007 from 6.4 percent to just over eight percent. (See Chart 7.26) Students With Known Asthma (2006-2012) Every county in the assessment region has seen an increase in both middle and high school students with known asthma. In 2010, Osceola County had the highest percentages by far. Orange County experienced a large jump from 2010-2012 that put them above the state average for 2012. (See Chart 7.27) Asthma Hospitalizations Ages 1-5 (Rolling Rate 1991-2014) Overall, children within the age range of 1-5 have the highest rate of hospitalizations due to asthma than children aged 5-11 years and 12-18 years. In Lake County, the admittance rate in the 1-5 year age range has remained relatively consistent, with a slight downward trend, fluctuating around the 700 per 100,000 rate range trending down to 639 and upward of 897. In Orange County, hospitalizations of children ages 1-5 due to asthma experienced a sharp increase in rates since 2007-2008. In Osceola County, children in the 1-5 yearage range have the highest rate of hospitalizations due to asthma (compared to other age groups). OsceolaCounty experienced the strongest upward trend in hospitalizations due to asthma in the 1-5 year range.This trend is inconsistent with the regional trend that has a stronger increasing trend of hospitalization inolder children. Seminole County has the lowest rate of hospitalizations in children aged 1-5 years, wellbelow the state's rate. (See Chart 7.28) Asthma Hospitalizations Ages 5-11 (Rolling Rate 1996-2014) In the 5-11 year age range, Lake County has experienced an overall downward trend, especially until about2005. Since 2007-2008, this age range in Lake County has experienced an increase in hospitalizations due toasthma. This increase is similar to the increase in hospitalizations trend since 2007 in the other counties.(See Chart 7.29)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 51 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY CHRONIC CONDITIONS, CONT'D. Asthma Hospitalizations Ages 12-18 (Rolling Rate 1996-2014) Since 1996 there has been a steady increase in hospitalizations due to asthma for teenagers in every county within the assessment region. Every county was below the state level until Osceola County's increase in 2009-2011; it has continued to increase above the state average since. Orange County has also reported rates higher than the state level since 2010-2012. Lake County has remained the lowest since 2006-2008. (See Chart 7.30) Key Findings Based on Secondary and Primary Data Analysis With regard to juvenile diabetes, the rates for children aged 12-18 years are higher than those for children aged 5-11 years, indicating either an increase in diabetes diagnoses or an increase in severity of symptoms. While blood pressure rates have increased, fewer of those diagnosed with hypertension are taking blood pressure medication. Overall, children within the age range of 1-5 years have the highest rate of hospitalizations due to asthma than children aged 5-11 years or 12-18 years. As a region, the rate of asthma hospitalizations is increasing faster in teenagers than other age ranges. Only Osceola County is outside this norm with a faster rate of increase in children aged 1-5 years. Diabetes, cancer and heart disease repeatedly are discussed by both decision-makers in the region and by consumers. Data collected using a variety of methods draw strong connections between diabetes, poverty, and access to quality and nutritious foods. While primary data did not directly connect cancer to the use of tobacco and vape products, both emerged as concerns in the region. Finally, in the experience of those who provided input, heart disease may be addressed by increasing access to healthy food and reducing inactivity among residents. The use of tobacco products may also contribute to heart disease as a regional concern.

Alzheimer's disease had the largest decline in rates, followed by cancer. Heart disease has fluctuated tremendously over the six-year period despite a decline between 2010-2012. Although unintentional injury remained relatively constant between 2008-2012, there was an increase in the 2014 calculations. The AADR from chronic lower respiratory disease has fluctuated slightly since 2008. The death rate due to diabetes has remained relatively constant with minimal fluctuations. (See Table 7.3) Top Causes of Death - Orange County (Rate per 100,000) (2008-2014) In Orange County, the AADR for all leading causes of death, except unintentional injury and cerebrovascular disease, have declined. Cancer deaths have declined in Orange County to below the HP2020 goal of 161.4 per 100,000. While heart disease continues to decline from 2008, the AADR rate still remains signicantly higherthan the HP2020 goal. Chronic lower respiratory disease related deaths also continue to decline. The diabetesAADR shows a decrease between 2008-2010, however, it fluctuated between 2010-2014. Unintentional injuryAADR, while remaining steady in previous years, increased between 2012-2014, moving above the HP2020 goal. After a decline in AADR for cerebrovascular disease between 2008-2010, there has been an increase in the AADR since 2010, pushing the rate also above the 34.8 per 100,000 HP2020 goal for Orange County. Alzheimer's disease related AADR has remained relatively constant. (See Table 7.4) Top Causes of Death - Osceola County (Rate per 100,000) (2008-2014) Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in Osceola County (207.4 AADR) and continues toincrease to twice above the HP2020 goal of 103.4 per 100,000. Cancer, the second leading cause of death is below the HP2020 goal but over the past six years has encountered fluctuations, resulting in little overall change. Chronic lower respiratory disease and cerebrovascular disease, while the AADR showed variations in an increase/decrease in rates, there is an overall downward trend in the AADR for these diseases. Cerebrovascular disease AADR has moved below the HP2020 goal of 34.8 per 100,000. Unintentional injury related deaths had been below the HP2020 goal of 36.4 per 100,000. However, between 2012-2014, AADR rose to 42.7 per 100,000. Diabetes and Alzheimer's disease AADR both continue to fluctuate, with a slight downward trend for diabetes and an upward trend for Alzheimer's disease. (See Table 7.5) Top Causes of Death - Seminole County (Rate per 100,000) (2008-2014) Cancer and heart disease are the leading causes of death in Seminole County. The AADR for these diseases have fluctuated since 2008, however, overall show a downward trend. While the cancer-related AADR has decreasedbelow the HP2020 goal, heart disease is still well above the goal mark of 103.4 per 100,000. Chronic lowerrespiratory disease and unintentional injury AADR have risen since 2008, with unintentional injury slightlysurpassing the 36.4 per 100,000 rate for the HP2020 goal. While cerebrovascular disease AADR had decreasedbetween 2008-2010, it has since increased nearly to its 2008 level, and above the 34.8 per 100,000 rate for theHP2020 goal. Diabetes and Alzheimer's disease related AADR have both fluctuated around 2008 levels, showingno true trend. However, deaths due to diabetes continue to be well below the 65.8 per 100,000 rate for theHP2020 goal. (See Table 7.6)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 63 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH, CONT'D. Key Findings Based on Secondary and Primary Data Analysis Cancer is the leading cause of death throughout the four-county region, followed by heart disease, despite an increase in heart disease rates between 2012-2014. Although both rates have decreased since 2008, cancer and heart disease result in approximately four times the number of deaths than the next top cause of death, unintentional injury. Unintentional injury related deaths are the only cause that has shown a steady increase across the region. Respiratory disease related death has generally trended downward, however, remained level between 2012-2014. While regionally AADR for cardiovascular disease experienced a decline between 2008- 2010, the death rate has been gradually increasing near the 2008 level. Diabetes AADR has steadily declined from 2008 across the region, while Alzheimer's disease has fluctuated resulting in little overall change since 2008. AADR from respiratory disease and external causes has fluctuated between 2008-2014 with no true trend. Data from Florida CHARTS show that these top seven leading causes of death at the very least account for double the number of the eighth leading cause of death \u2014 diseases of the kidney such as nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis.COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 64 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY TABLE 7.3 TOP CAUSES OF DEATH - LAKE COUNTY (RATE PER 100,000) (2008-2014) Source: Florida Charts 2016: Florida Department of Health Bureau of Vital Statistics.

When analyzed by type and age group, unintentional death from falls was the number-one cause of unintentional fatal injuries with a CAAR of 16.78, and was the highest cause of death of those aged 65 and older. Falls combined with unspecied motor vehicle deaths and poisoning (the top three causes of unintentional deaths) made up 74 percent of unintentional fatal injury occurrences in Lake County. Data indicate that rearms were the leading method of suicide (CAAR 6.76), followed by poisoning, suffocation and then drowning/submersion. Lake County had a total of 43 suicides in 2013. More than 53 percent of these instances occurred in the 55+ age range, ages 35-54 accounted for 35 percent of suicides and the remaining instances were among those aged 20-34 years (12 percent).Infant injury deaths were mostly attributed to suffocation. Motor vehicle (unspecied) was the leading cause of injury death in children aged 1-14 years and young adults aged 20-24 years. Poisoning occurred highest in teenagers aged 15-19 years. Poisoning and motor vehicle related deaths, both as pedestrians and unspecied, were even in the millennial age range, ages 25-34. Ages 35-44 were very close in causes of injury deaths led by motor vehicle (unspecied), followed by poisoning. Poisoning was the leading cause of unintentional fatal injuries in those aged 45-54 years. Falls began to show as the number-one cause of unintentional fatal injuries in adults aged 55-64 years, followed by motor vehicle accidents and poisoning. Lake County has experienced a faster increase in the number of unintentional deaths related to falls than the state. Beginning in 2006, the AADR began to grow consistently and at a faster rate than historically through 2014. While regionally, Orange, Osceola and Seminole Counties appear to follow the same trends and fluctuations, Lake County has denitely experienced an increase beyond that of the other counties. Orange County In Orange County, in 2013, the majority of fatal injuries were classied as unintentional at a CAAR of 34.21 followed by suicide at a CAAR of 10.08. When analyzed by type and age group, unintentional death from falls was the number-one cause of unintentional fatal injuries with a CAAR of 10.88, and was the highest cause of death for those aged 65 years and older. Falls, poisoning and motor vehicle (occupant) comprised the top three causes of unintentional deaths, though the top two (falls and poisoning) accounted for more than 55 percent ofall unintentional fatal injuries in Orange County during 2013. Data indicate that rearms were the leading method of suicide (CAAR 4.94), followed by suffocation and poisoning. Orange County had a total of 122 suicides in 2013. The 45-54 year age range experienced the largestnumber of suicides, followed by the 25-34 age range. Approximately 58 percent of suicides occurred in thepopulation between 25-54 years of age, 34 percent occurred in the 55+ age range, and eight percent occurred forthose aged 15-24. In 2013, data indicate that infant deaths were attributed to suffocation; drowning/submersion was the number- one cause of toddler deaths (ages 1-4); motor vehicle (pedestrian) was the leading cause in children (ages 5-14)followed closely by drowning, poisoning and other motor vehicle accidents; poisoning was the top cause ofunintentional deaths for those aged 15-64 years. However, in the 20-24 year age range category, poisoningjoined with motor vehicle (occupant, motorcyclist) as the leading causes of unintentional fatal injuries. Again,for ages 65 years and older, falls were the number-one cause of unintentional injury deaths. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 67 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY INJURIES, CONT'D. Orange County, cont'd. Relatively, Orange County displays the same increase in deaths related to unintentional falls. There was a steady decline from 1995-2002. Since 2002, there has been an upward trend in the AADR from unintentional falls in Orange County. Osceola County In Osceola County, in 2013, the majority of fatal injuries were classied as unintentional at a CAAR of 41.36, followed by suicide at a CAAR of 9.42. When analyzed by type and age group, unintentional death from falls was the number-one cause of unintentional fatal injuries with a CAAR of 12.04, and was the highest cause of death for those aged 65 years and older. Falls, poisoning and motor vehicle (occupant) comprised the top three causes of unintentional deaths, though the top two (falls and poisoning) accounted for more than 51 percent of all unintentional fatal injuries in Osceola County. Data indicate that rearms were the leading method of suicide (CAAR 4.87), followed by suffocation and poisoning. Osceola County had a total of 28 suicides in 2013, with the 55-64 year age range comprising 28 percent, followed by ages 45-54 at 21 percent and ages 25-34 at 18 percent. Approximately 50 percent of suicides occurred in the 25-54 year age range, 42 percent occurred in the population aged 55 years and older, and seven percent occurred in those aged 15-24. In 2013, data indicate that most infant deaths were attributed to suffocation. For toddlers (ages 1-4) drowning/submersion was the number-one cause of death. Motor vehicle (pedestrian) was the leading cause in children aged 5-14 years followed closely by drowning, poisoning and other motor vehicle accidents. Poisoning was the top cause of unintentional deaths for those aged 15-64 years. In the 20-24 age range, poisoning was joined with motor vehicle (occupant, motorcyclist) as the leading cause of unintentional fatal injury. Again, for residents aged 65 and older, falls were the number-one cause of unintentional injury deaths. There has been tremendous fluctuation in Osceola County in regard to the AADR of unintentional falls. The rate had remained relatively constant from 1995-2007, fluctuating mostly between three and ve AADR. In 2007, while still fluctuating, the level of variation increased drastically between four AADR and 10-12 AADR. Historically, Osceola County has been below the state rate until about 2012. In 2014, Osceola County was still above the state rate but was heading in a downward direction. Seminole County In Seminole County, in 2013, the majority of fatal injuries were classied as unintentional at a CAAR of 35.72 followed by suicide at a CAAR of 13.47. When analyzed by type and age group, unintentional death frompoisoning was the number-one cause of unintentional fatal injury with a CAAR of 10.78 followed by falls at aCAAR of 9.92, although the total count for these mechanisms was equal (48). Poisoning, falls and motor vehicle(unspecied) comprised the top three causes of unintentional deaths, though the top two (falls and poisoning)accounted for more than 59 percent of all unintentional fatal injuries in Seminole County. Data indicate that rearms were the leading method of suicide (CAAR 6.56), followed by suffocation (CAAR 3.29) and poisoning (CAAR 2.66). Seminole County had a total of 61 suicides in 2013, with the 45-54 year agerange comprising 24 percent, followed by ages 35-44 at 23 percent and ages 55-64 at 20 percent. Approximately57 percent of suicides occurred in the 25-54 year age range, 38 percent occurred in the 55+ age range and vepercent occurred in those aged 15-24. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 68 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY INJURIES, CONT'D. Seminole County, cont'd. In 2013, Seminole County had no unintentional fatal injury deaths for infants. Data indicate that drowning/submersion was the number-one cause of unintentional toddler deaths (ages 1-4); only one unintentional injury death (motor vehicle - unspecied) was noted in children (ages 5-14) which was also the leading cause in teenagers (ages 15-19); poisoning was the top cause of unintentional deaths for those aged20-64. For ages 55-64, poisoning was the number-one cause of unintentional injury death until falls became number one. Seminole County has been experiencing an increase in the AADR of unintentional falls. Historically, the county, while varying in rates around the three AADR range through 2001, began experiencing more intense fluctuations beginning in 2002 with a sharp decline. Then, by 2004, the AADR rose to above ve and while still fluctuating began an upward trend in 2008. By 2012, Seminole County moved slightly above the stateAADR and began to decline again in 2013, falling below state level. Motor Vehicle Crashes (2005-2014) While Lake County's AADR for motor vehicle crashes has decreased since 2005, it remains higher than the state level and the HP2020 goal of 12.4 per 100,000. Osceola County has also decreased since 2005, but appears to be increasing in recent years. Seminole County is consistently lowest in the region for deaths frommotor vehicle crashes. (See Chart 7.31) Non-Fatal Hospitalizations From Motor Vehicle-Related Injuries (2012) Across the region, children aged 1-5 experienced the highest rate of hospitalizations from motor vehicle- related injuries. The trends and breakdown of the region mimic that of the state pattern. Lake County rates are higher than in other counties and the state in all age categories except for ages 1-5. Orange County, while exceeding the state rate for children ages 1-5, falls below the state rates for all other age categories. Osceola County has the highest rate in the region, and is above the state rate for hospitalizations for children ages 1-5. Osceola County also exceeds the state rate in all other age categories for non-fatal hospitalizations for motor vehicle-related injuries. Seminole County experiences the lowest rates of hospitalization for all child age categories across the region. Seminole County also falls below the state rates for non-fatal hospitalizations for motor vehicle-related injuries. (See Chart 7.32) Child Motor Vehicle Deaths (2012-2014) Lake, Osceola and Seminole Counties had approximately six deaths related to motor vehicles for children aged 5-21 between 2011-2013. Orange County had approximately 20 deaths for children aged 5-21, with manymore injured. In Seminole County, between 2008-2010 approximately 42 children aged 1-5 were killed orinjured in motor vehicle crashes. In Orange County, approximately 249 children aged 1-5 were killed orinjured between 2008-2010. In Lake County, nearly 50 children aged 1-5 were injured or killed between 2008-2010. In Osceola County, approximately 73 children aged 1-5 were injured or killed between 2008-2010. Across the region, for those aged 19-21, the crude death rate as a result of motor vehicle crashes is trending upward. Lake County experienced a large increase in this rate between the reporting periods for ages 12-18,while the other counties experienced a decline. Orange County had a downward trend in all age groups exceptchildren aged 1-5 and ages 19-21. Osceola County had an upward trend in all age ranges except for ages 5-11,which was recorded at 0. In Seminole County, while ages 19-21 and 5-11 trended upward, there was minimal change in children aged 1-5. (See Chart 7.33)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 69 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY INJURIES, CONT'D. Unintentional Falls by County, Age Adjusted (1995-2014) Generally, in both the region and the state, there has been an increase in the death rate from falls since 1995. Lake County has seen the starkest increase; the county began to consistently increase faster than the rest of the region in 2007. Orange, Osceola and Seminole Counties remained under the state average until 2012, when they all saw rates above the state level. Osceola County remained above the state average in 2014. (See Chart 7.34) Unintentional Poisoning by County, Age Adjusted (2012-2014) In the assessment region and in the state, the AADR from poisoning has increased. The increase has been morepronounced in the region than in the state. Lake County is the only county in the region below the state level,while only marginally so. Orange County had the highest rate in 2014. (See Chart 7.35) Drowning by County, Age Adjusted (2012-2014) In the assessment region, and in the state as a whole, deaths from drownings have increased. Lake County had the highest rate in 2014 and is the only county with a rate above the state level. Osceola County had the lowest rate for both 2012 and 2014 and experienced the smallest increase over those two years. (See Chart 7.36) Key Findings Based on Secondary and Primary Data Analysis Accidental deaths appear to be increasing in the assessment region, with increases in deaths from unintentional falls, poisonings and drownings. Deaths from motor vehicle crashes have started to rise in recent years after years of decreases. Young residents, those aged 19-21, are most likely than other age groups to die in a motor vehicle incident. The members of the Collaboration noted a need to focus on accidental deaths from the perspective of the mobility and safety of elderly residents.

Orange County peaked in 2013 but fell in 2014 to 5.2. Osceola County has maintained an infant mortality rate below both the HP2020 goal and the state level from 2012-2014. Seminole County saw its rate fall below the goal in 2013 and continue that downward trend in 2014. (See Chart 7.37) Births to Uninsured Women (2012-2014) While they have decreased over time in all four counties, births to uninsured women are highest in Orange and Osceola Counties and lowest in Seminole County. Percentages in Lake and Seminole Counties have remained below the state average during the 2012-2014 span. (See Chart 7.38) Births to Mothers With Less Than a High School Education (2012-2014) Births to mothers with less than a high school education have steadily declined from 2012-2014 in Lake, Orange and Osceola Counties. Seminole County has also seen an overall decrease despite a slight uptick in 2014. Seminole County has consistently been the lowest in the region and well below the state level. Orange and Osceola Counties have also consistently remained below the state level. While Lake County was above the state average in 2012 and 2013, their 2014 rate caught up to the state average. (See Chart 7.39) Births to Unwed Mothers (2012-2014) Births to unwed mothers have remained nearly constant for every county in the region and in the state as a whole. From 2012-2014, the largest change (increase or decrease) was a 1.4 percent increase in Lake County. The other counties changed by no more than 0.5 percent over that three-year span. (See Chart 7.40) Births to Mothers Who Were Obese During Pregnancy (2012-2014) The percentage of births to mothers who were obese during pregnancy has decreased in both Lake and Seminole Counties from 2012-2014, contrary to the upward trend at the state level. Orange County's percentage has remained about the same despite a small increase in 2013. Osceola County has increased slightly from 22.7 percent in 2012 to 24.4 percent in 2014, mirroring the slight increase at the state level. (See Chart 7.41) Repeat Births to Mothers Ages 15-19 (2012-2014) This indicator describes the percent of births to mothers aged 15-19 years that were not the mothers' rst child. Lake and Osceola Counties have seen an increase in the percent of repeat births to mothers aged 15-19; LakeCounty's 2013 and 2014 rates are above the state average while Osceola County, despite its increase, is belowthat level. Orange County has declined to a rate below the state average in 2014. Seminole County has remainedmarginally below the state level with the exception of a peak in 2013. (See Chart 7.42) Births to Mothers With First Trimester Prenatal Care (2012-2014) The rates for the percentage of births to mothers who had rst trimester prenatal care were higher than thestate level across the four-county region. Osceola County saw the largest gains from 2012-2014 and Lake Countyincreased marginally. Orange County peaked in 2013, but returned to 2012 levels in 2014. Seminole Countydeclined slightly but remains ve percent above the state average. (See Chart 7.43)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 75 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY BIRTH CHARACTERISTICS, CONT'D. Preterm Birth Rate (<37 Weeks) (2012-2014) All counties in the assessment region have held preterm birth rates around 15 percent. Seminole County's 2014 rate is the largest deviation from that with a positive change toward 12 percent, the only county below the state average for 2014. (See Chart 7.44) Low Birth Weight (<2,550 grams) (2012-2014) Every county in the assessment region, and the state as a whole, has had low birth weight rates below 10 percent. Seminole County has consistently been below the state level, while 2014 rates for Lake and Osceola Counties were marginally higher. (See Chart 7.45) Births Covered by Medicaid (2012-2014) Osceola and Lake Counties have the highest percent of total births covered by Medicaid despite experiencing a slight decrease from 2012-2014. Seminole and Orange Counties have experienced slight declines as well. Both counties have consistently had rates below the state level. (See Chart 7.46) Key Findings Based on Secondary and Primary Data Analysis Infant mortality continues to be of concern in Lake County based on secondary data. Births to uninsured women are high in the assessment region and likely reflect a larger issue with insurance coverage, a theme addressed in a number of the primary data sources for each county. Single-parent households were marked as priorities in the 2013 CHNAs for Osceola and Orange Counties. Births to unwed mothers likely play a role in this concern, especially in Osceola County where approximately 50 percent of the births were to unwed women. Additionally, Medicaid appears to play a signicant role in helping expectant mothers as 40-60 percent of births in each of the four counties were covered by Medicaid. Medicaid expansion was listed as a force of change for the assessment region and the state.COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 76 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY CHART 7.37 INFANT MORTALITY (2012-2014) 0246810PER 1,000 LIVE BIRTHS Source: Florida Charts, 2016: Florida Department of Health, Bureau of Vital StatisticsLAKE ORANGE OSCEOLA 6.2 6.9 4.4 7.5 7.5 5.1 8.8 5.2 4.82012 2013 2014SEMINOLE 6.8 5.4 4.9FLORIDA 6.0 6.1 6.0HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 GOAL: 6.0 CHART 7.38 BIRTHS TO UNINSURED WOMEN (2012-2014)PERCENT OF BIRTHS Source: Florida Charts, 2016: Florida Department of Health, Bureau the most current open-sourced data available at the time the report was printed.

(CFCHS) is the managing entity overseeing state-funded mental health and substance abuse treatment services in four counties in Central Florida: Brevard, Orange, Osceola and Seminole. Three of those counties fall within the purview of this report: Orange, Osceola and Seminole. Basic conclusions from their 2015 Behavioral Health Needs Assessment are included below to supplement the secondary and primary mental health data gathered by Impact Partners for this CHNA. The following information is based on the amount of funding allocated to the Department of Children and Families each year by the Florida legislature. Service providers located in each managing entity region provide services based on this annual funding. Services may fluctuate based on the will of the legislature each year. From scal year (FY) 2013-2014 to FY 2014-2015, the number of adult mental health (AMH) clients decreased slightly in each county. It should be noted that the number of services provided is directly related to the amount of funding available each year as part of the budget for the state of Florida. Decreases among the child mental health (CMH) clients were higher when compared to their adult counterparts. However, the number of adult substance abuse (ASA) clients increased substantially from FY 2013-2014 to FY 2014-2015. Among child substance abuse (CSA) clients, numbers increased in Orange and Seminole Counties, while decreasing in Osceola County. The number of clients reporting \"homeless\" decreased signicantly for the AMH, CMH and CSA programs. ASA clients reporting their residential county as \"homeless\" increased 45 percent. Among ASA clients in Orange County, the number of clients living in a correctional facility more than doubled from FY 2013-2014 to FY 2014-2015. Employment, family income and poverty status among CFCHS clients was lower when compared to the service area population. The unemployment percentage for the managing entity's four counties ranged from 5.8-7.0 percent in June 2014. Among AMH clients, 58.1 percent had an employment status of 'terminated/unemployed' in FY 2014-2015. The percent of 'terminated/unemployed' ASA clients was similar at 57.5 percent. More clients in the ASA program identied as a 'criminal inmate' when compared to those in the AMH program. Adults in the mental health program were more likely to be 'disabled' than their ASA counterparts. Close to 30 percent of adult clients and 40 percent of child clients reported having no income. The percentages of clients receiving disability benets and public assistance were greater when compared to the service area population. Poverty among clients ranged from 78.9 percent to 98.5 percent, regardless of family size. This was much higher when compared to poverty in the service area where 16.5 percent of the population were at 0-99 percent Federal Poverty Level (FPL). As a result of changes made in FY 2014-2015, there were signicant increases in case management, intensive case management and inpatient units for AMH clients. Case management and inpatient units also increased forCSA clients along with crisis stabilization and in-home services. For ASA clients, units for methadonemaintenance, level 2 residential treatment, and individual recovery support for substance abuse increased fromFY 2013-2014 to FY 2014-2015. All units decreased for CMH clients with the exception of room and board level2 (supportive housing). The CFCHS conducted a consumer survey to determine the strengths and gaps in services provided to clients in mental health and substance abuse programs. A total of 883 consumer surveys were collected and analyzed. Themajority of respondents were in mental health programs and identied as adult consumers. Less than 20percent of respondents reported going outside of their resident county to access services. Individual counselingwas cited as the most important service for clients in all programs. Medicaid was the source of payment fortreatment for 58.7 percent of clients in mental health programs, 23.4 percent in substance abuse programs and37.7 percent for clients in both programs. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 82 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY QUALITY OF LIFE / MENTAL HEALTH, CONT'D. Regional Managing Entity Outcomes, cont'd. A provider survey collected responses from 18 network providers and other stakeholders of service who identied needed services, barriers and solutions to improve health outcomes. Crisis intervention/crisis stabilization services were identied by 55.6 percent of providers as a needed service for child and adolescent clients. For adult clients, housing was cited by most providers as a needed service; limited housing options create a signicant barrier to accessing treatment. The biggest barrier to care, according to 66.7 percent of providers, was limited funding/capacity for needed treatment services. Providers shared that increased education, training and collaboration among the various support services have helped to improve the system of care. However, many issues remain to be resolved. Coordinated community planning is needed to ensure all residents have access to appropriate services when care is needed. Surveyed providers indicated that this process is underway but needs to continue. Building strategic partnerships will leverage limited nancial resources, improve program effectiveness, increase capacity, and strengthen the role of the provider as they work within the county to address community health needs. A strengthened health system can provide all residents with the opportunity to attain optimal healthoutcomes. Adults Who Are \"Satisfied\" or \"Very Satisfied\" With Their Lives (2007-2010) The percent of adults who are satised or very satised with their lives increased only marginally in Lake County. Residents of Orange, Osceola and Seminole Counties were less likely to report life satisfaction in 2010 than they were in 2007 but these decreases were small and in line with the state-level trend. Lake County residents appear to be the most satised with their lives. (See Chart 7.47) Adults Who Have Ever Been Told They Had a Depressive Disorder (2013) Regionally, approximately 16.6 percent of all adults have been told they had a depressive disorder, a percent in line with that of the state. Lake County and Seminole County are slightly above the regional average at 18.5 percent and 17.2 percent respectively, while Orange and Osceola Counties are below the regional average at about 15 percent. (See Chart 7.48) Depressive Disorder by Age (2013) Age groups with the highest percent of adults who have been told they have a depressive disorder vary by county. Ages 18-44 in Seminole County have the highest percent, while in Lake and Osceola Counties, this fallsto the 45-64 year age range. In Orange County, those aged 65 and older have the highest percent. (See Chart 7.49) Depressive Disorder by Income (2013) Regionally, those making below $25k annually have a higher percentage of individuals diagnosed with adepressive disorder. In Lake County, those making less than $25k annually have a percent twice as high asthose making $25-50k annually. In Orange and Osceola Counties, the mid-range income has the largest percentof adults who have been told they had a depressive disorder. Across the region, the $50k or more income rangehas the lowest percentage. (See Chart 7.50)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 83 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY QUALITY OF LIFE / MENTAL HEALTH, CONT'D. Children Aged 1-5 Receiving Mental Health Treatment Services (2008-2011) Seminole County children receiving mental health treatment services has consistently declined since 2004 and the rate has been signicantly lower than the other counties in the assessment region. Osceola County had the highest rate of young children receiving services in 2011 after a steady increase since 2008. The rates in 2011 for Orange and Lake Counties were both higher than their rates in 2008. (See Chart 7.51) Children in Grades K-12 Who Are Emotionally Handicapped (2003-2014) Overall, the percent of children who are emotionally handicapped has declined in every county in the assessment region and throughout the state as a whole. Only Lake County has consistently had a higher ratethan the state average, but the difference is marginal. (See Chart 7.52) Children Aged 5-11 Experiencing Sexual Violence (2003-2014) In Lake County, children aged 5-11 experiencing sexual violence peaked in 2004-2005 and again in 2011-2012. Despite a downward trend since 2012, Lake County still reports the highest rate in the region, one that is well in excess of the state level. Orange County's lowest rate was recorded in 2013 after consistent year-to-year increases from 2009-2012. Osceola County experienced rates of more than 100 children per 100,000 in 2004 and 2006. Since then, the rate has fluctuated between 70 and 90, settling on 76.7 in 2013, which is higher than the state average. Seminole County has consistently had the lowest rate over the 11 years from 2003-2013. The lowest rate in the assessment region was recorded in Seminole County in 2011. Since then, the rate has increased, but remains the lowest in the region and below the state average. (See Chart 7.53) Children Aged 5-11 Experiencing Child Abuse (2003-2014) Seminole County experienced a slight increase in children aged 5-11 experiencing child abuse from 2003-2013. Osceola and Lake Counties saw a slight decrease over the same time period. Orange County's trend closely followed the state level over the 11-year span, reporting slightly lower than the state average in 2013. (See Chart 7.54) Suicide Rate of Children Aged 12-18 (2012-2014) In 2013, every county in the assessment region reported rates at or below the state average for childhood suicide. Rates in Lake, Orange and Seminole Counties have decreased slightly from 2012-2014. In Osceola County, the rate dropped in 2013 then returned to its 2012 rate in 2014. Lake County had the highest rate in the region in 2014 and Orange County had the lowest. (See Chart 7.55)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 84 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY QUALITY OF LIFE / MENTAL HEALTH, CONT'D. Key Findings Based on Secondary and Primary Data Analysis The CFCHS report and stakeholder interviews point to an inappropriate use of emergency rooms (ERs) and jails to receive mental health services, especially in Orange County. While all residents may not actively seek out the ER or jails specically to receive mental health help, a large number of people are getting services this way. While it is a community asset to have multiple avenues for residents to access mental health services, jails and ERs are a less than ideal use of valuable resources. These same sources also point to a signicant overlap between homelessness, mental health needs and substance abuse. It is unclear in which direction this relationship functions but it is likely bi-directional: mental health issues can make it hard to secure or keep steady housing and homelessness can exacerbate mental health symptoms. The link between substance abuse and homelessness likely operates in a similar manner. Their connection is supported empirically by the Behavioral Health Needs Assessment and anecdotally by law enforcement interviewed for this CHNA. Providers in the CFCHS assessment and stakeholders from the CHNA discussed the importance of wrap-around services and coordinated care when addressing the intersectionality of poverty, homelessness and mental illness/substance abuse. Access to mental health services was discussed as a concern in every county across nearly every data collection method of the CHNA. Substance abuse was also a common concern among residents, providers and stakeholders. Funding for mental health service providers in Central Florida likely limits the availability of services to residents. Of the seven managing entities in the state, CFCHS (serving Orange, Osceola and Seminole Counties) has an estimated funding amount per individual with mental illness or substance use disorders of $98.22. This is the lowest in the state and $15 per person lower than the statewide average. Lutheran Services Florida is the managing entity for 23 counties, including Lake. Lutheran receives the second- lowest amount of funding per person. Overall, funding for mental health in Central Florida is lacking. Mental health indicators have improved for children in the region as a whole. However, Lake County children might be left behind in this trend. Lake County had the highest suicide rate among children, as well as the most children aged 5-11 in the region experiencing sexual violence and the highest rate of children who are emotionally handicapped.COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 85 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY CHART 7.47 ADULTS WHO ARE \"SATISFIED\" OR \"VERY SATISFIED\" WITH LIVES (2007-2010)PERCENT 15.3% 15.4%SEMINOLE 17.2%FLORIDA 16.8%CHART 7.48 ADULTS WHO HAVE EVER BEEN TOLD THE Y HAD A DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (2013)PERCENT OF ADULTS 2013 Source: Florida Charts, 2016: Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System0%10%20%This chart reflects the most current open-sourced data available at the time the report was printed.

Its 2012 rate was the only one in the assessment region above the state level. Seminole County had the lowest 2012 rate at 26.3 percent. Orange County peaked in 2008 and has since dropped just below the state level. Osceola County did not report data for 2012. The county was at its lowest level in 2010, after peaking in 2008. (See Chart 7.56) High School Students Without Sufficient Physical Activity (2006-2012) The percent of high school students without sufcient physical activity has steadily decreased in Lake, Orange and Seminole Counties, as well as throughout the state as a whole. Osceola County's percentage has increased marginally from 2006-2010. While Seminole County's 2012 rate was the lowest in the assessment region, all three of the counties reporting data for that year were within three percent of each other and lower than the state level. (See Chart 7.57) Adults Who Are Sedentary (2002-2013) Across the assessment region, the lowest rates of adult inactivity occurred in 2007. In Lake and Seminole Counties, the rate has not changed much from 2002-2013. Orange County has seen an overall decrease in sedentary adults over that time period, while Osceola has seen a slight increase. In 2013, Lake and Osceola Counties reported rates above the state average.(See Chart 7.58) Adults Who Are Current Smokers (2010-2013) Despite a marginal increase since 2010, Osceola County has the highest percentage of adults who are current smokers. Lake County has the fewest percentage of current smokers among adults after a one percent decrease between 2010-2013. Seminole County, previously the highest percentage in the region, experienced a substantial drop of six percent over the same period and is now below the state level; the other three counties are as well. (See Chart 7.59) Adult Current Smokers Who Tried to Quit Smoking at Least Once in Past Year (2010-2013) In 2013, three-quarters of Lake County adult smokers attempted to quit at least once in the previous year \u2014 asubstantial increase from the number of people who tried in 2010. The other three counties in the assessment region also experienced increases in this indicator. Orange County smokers tried to quit the least often but still reported percentages above 50 percent. Only Orange and Osceola Counties had rates below the state level. (See Chart 7.60) Middle School Students Smoking Cigarettes in Past 30 Days (2012-2014) Middle school students smoking cigarettes in the past 30 days has declined across the assessment region andthroughout the state of Florida. Orange County had the lowest percent of middle school-aged smokers in 2014,while Lake County had the most. While the percent of middle school children who smoke cigarettes is low, thenumbers are still concerning. (See Chart 7.61) High School Students Smoking Cigarettes in Past 30 Days (2012-2014) High school students are more likely to smoke cigarettes than middle school students but have still seen adecrease since 2012. Similar to the middle school data, Lake County high schoolers are the students most likelyin the assessment region to smoke cigarettes. Students in Seminole County are the least likely. (See Chart 7.62)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 91 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTORS, CONT'D. Binge Drinking Among Adults (2007-2013) Binge drinking among adults varies by county. Lake County has seen a marginal increase from 2007-2013 as has Orange County. Osceola and Seminole Counties have both experienced decreases, which are morepronounced in Seminole County. For 2013, only Orange County had binge drinking percentages above thestate level. (See Chart 7.63) Binge Drinking Among Middle and High School Students (2012-2014) Among middle and high school students, binge drinking is declining across the board. The highest rate forhigh schoolers in 2014 was in Seminole County and the lowest in Osceola County. None of the countiesstudied for this assessment had high school or middle school binge drinking percentages above the state level.In 2014, Lake County middle school students were just as likely as the average Florida middle schooler tobinge drink. (See Chart 7.64) Heroin Use in Middle and High School (2010-2014) Heroin use among middle and high school students has decreased in Orange, Osceola and Seminole Countiesfrom 2012-2014. Lake County experienced a slight drop in 2012, but returned to its 2010 rate in 2014.Seminole County experienced the most signicant decrease over that time period. (See Chart 7.65) Heroin-Related Deaths (2011-2014) Compared to 2011 rates, every county in the assessment region reported higher rates of heroin-related deathsper 100,000 in 2014. In the years between, the rates have fluctuated differently in each county. Lake Countyreported a slight decrease in 2012 and a steady increase since then. Orange County's rate has been up anddown every year from 2011-2014. Osceola County peaked in 2012 and has decreased since then, yet their rateis still higher in 2014 than it was in 2011. Seminole County had its highest rates in 2012 and 2013. OnlySeminole County reported a rate per 100,000 below that state level in 2014. (See Chart 7.66) Heroin-Related Mortality - Orange County (2010-2015) Due to the increase in heroin-related deaths in Orange County, resources have been allocated to address thisemerging community issue. The recent surge has been linked to the closing of pain clinics. This mirrors theroot cause of the increase in heroin use across the county: individuals who have become dependent onprescribed narcotic pain medications, but can no longer receive any, turn to heroin to meet the need of theiraddiction. Data have been made available from the Florida Medical Examiner to convey the gravity of the problem heroin presents. According to the 2013 Florida Medical Examiner's Annual Report, deaths caused by heroinincreased 78.7 percent in the state compared to 2012. Additionally, a recent study by the CDC issued earlierthis year, shows the number of heroin users in the U.S. has grown by more than 300,000 in the last decade.Another study by the CDC issued earlier this year showed a steady increase in the number of drug-poisoningdeaths involving heroin. In Orange County, the number of heroin-related deaths has increased nearly six-foldsince 2010. Both heroin-related mortality and deaths with heroin present in the blood stream at the time ofdeath are on the rise. Most of the deaths occur in white males. (See Charts 7.67 - 7.69) Low Perceived Risk of Drug Use Regarding perceived risk of drug use in each county, high school students are less likely to perceive drug useas risky compared to their middle school counterparts. There is no data recorded for this indicator morerecently than 2010. (See Table 7.8) Perceived Availability of Drugs Middle school students have decreased in their perceived availability of drugs in every county and the state asa whole. A similar trend exists among high school students in the assessment region as well. Additionally, in COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 92 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTORS, CONT'D. 2014, high school students in each county perceived a more limited availability of drugs than their middle school counterparts. (See Table 7.9) Perceived Availability of Handguns Across the board in 2014, middle and high school students perceived a lower availability of handguns than in 2010, with the exception of Lake County high school students. Lake County middle school and high school students were more likely than students in the other counties in the assessment region to perceive handguns as available. In 2014, Lake and Osceola Counties' middle schoolers and Lake County high schoolers have perceptions higher than the state level. (See Table 7.10) Poor Family Management Across the region and the state of Florida, the percent of poor family management has decreased for both middle and high school students from 2010-2014. In 2014, Osceola County middle school students and LakeCounty high school students saw the highest percentages. (See Table 7.11) Family Conflict Regarding family conflict, percentages have dropped for middle schoolers across the region and in the state. This trend is also true for high school students in Lake, Orange and Osceola Counties. There has been a slight increase for Seminole County high school students. Family conflict for Seminole County middle schoolstudents is the only percent in the region below the state level for 2014. Orange County high school student percentage is the only in the region below the state level for that population. (See Table 7.12) Violent Acts Among Students Grades K-12 (2010-2012) Orange County has consistently had the highest rate of violent acts among students from 2010-2012 despite a signicant decrease over that time span. Lake and Osceola Counties also experienced decreases, while Seminole County saw a slight increase, contrary to the trend of the state as a whole and the other counties in the assessment region. (See Chart 7.70) Firearms Discharge, Age Adjusted Death Rate (2010-2014) The death rate from rearms discharge has fluctuated in Lake County from 13.2 in 2010, settling at 10.7 in 2014. Orange County's rate has remained around 9.0, with the exception of a spike in 2011. Osceola County's 2010 rate was remarkably low then jumped by an increase of nearly 70 percent in 2011. The following three years hovered around 7.5. Seminole County has shown the least extreme fluctuations and a general marginal decrease from 2010. Every county in the assessment region reported 2014 rates below the state average. (See Chart 7.71) Total Domestic Violence Offenses (2010-2014) When comparing domestic violence rates from 2010-2014 rates, every county in the assessment region except Seminole has experienced a decrease. In 2014, only Orange County reported a rate per 100,000 higher than thestate level. Osceola County experienced the most signicant decrease with a substantial drop between its 2013-2014 rates. (See Chart 7.72) Key Findings Based on Secondary and Primary Data Analysis Middle school students are not getting enough vigorous activity but high school students are getting more than in the past. Additionally, students are less likely to engage in risky behaviors (heroin use, cigarettes, bingedrinking) than in previous years. Smoking among adults has declined too. This might be due to the popularityof vapes and e-cigarettes as a supplement to traditional tobacco products. E-cigarette usage emerged as aconcern among community stakeholders, especially because the consequences of their use is still unknownand because of their appeal to young residents. Additionally, heroin use and smoking emerged as major themesin the Orange County collaborative themes and community conversations respectively.

The eastern portion of the county provides little access to parks. In the north central portion of Osceola County, near Kissimmee, there is a small patch of people within one-half mile of a park. A good portion of the county has no parks or data. The eastern portion of the county is comprised of wildlife management areas. In the western portion of Seminole County, there are both a number of people within one-half mile of a park as well as a number of ZIP codes in which there are no parks or data. The eastern portion of the county provides low access to parks. In the northern portion of Lake County, there are a number of people within one-half mile of a park. This is likely due to Ocala National Forest covering much of this portion of the county. The southern portion of the county provides lower access to parks.(See Figures 7.1 - 7.4) Recreation & Fitness Facilities (2011) In Orange County, most opportunities for recreation and tness facilities exist in the ZIP codes within the western portion of the county. These opportunities become more sparse or are not measured the farther east one goes. In Osceola County, most opportunities for recreation and tness facilities exist within the ZIP codes in the northwestern portion of the county. These opportunities become sparse or are not measured the farther east and south one goes. Most of Seminole County's recreation and tness facilities appear to be in the ZIP codes closest to the city of Orlando. Most opportunities for recreation and tness facilities in Lake County exist in the ZIP codes within the southern portion of county. These opportunities become sparse or are not measured the farther north one goes. It should be noted, however, how much of the state is colored in blue, indicatingquite a number of residents with access.(See Figures 7.5 - 7.8) Food Deserts (2011) Based on guidelines from The Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) Working Group, to qualify as a food desert census tract at least 33 percent of the tract's population, or a minimum of 500 people in the tract, must have low access to a supermarket or large grocery store (Community Commons, 2015). Some census tracts that contain supermarkets or large grocery stores may meet the criteria of a food desert if a substantial number or share of people within that census tract is more than one mile (urban areas) or 10 miles (rural areas) from the nearest supermarket. Residents of food desert census tracts may live within one or 10 miles of a supermarket; these residents are not counted as low access and thus not counted in the total (Community Commons, 2015). There are a number of food deserts dispersed around Orange County, a number of which overlap with high levels of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) beneciaries. The handful of food desert censustracts in Osceola County are in the same areas as those tracts with high proportions of SNAP recipients.Seminole County has three food desert census tracts near Sanford, Altamonte Springs and Oviedo. SeminoleCounty has the fewest food desert census tracts in the four-county assessment region. Nearly all of the fooddeserts in Lake County are located in census tracts with high percentages of SNAP recipients. (See Figures 7.9 -7.12) Modified Retail Food Environment Score (2011) The maps display the Modied Retail Food Environmental Index (MRFEi) Score by tract. The MRFEi is ameasure of the proportion of food retailers that typically sell healthy foods by census tract. Scores range from 0(no food retailers that typically sell healthy food) to 100 (only food retailers that typically sell healthy food).Areas with lower MRFEi scores have more food retailers, such as fast food restaurants and convenience stores,that are less likely to sell less healthy foods and fewer food retailers, such as supermarkets, that tend to sell COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 104 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY BUILT ENVIRONMENT, CONT'D. healthy foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. According to the data, relatively few areas in the Central Florida region score \"High Access\" with most of the area with moderate to low access. Two of the areas considered \"No Access\" are very rural and have very low residential population. Much of Orange County has a MRFEi score below 15 (low access, poor access or no access to healthy retail food outlets). Additionally, only two census tracts on the northern central edge of the county (near Maitland) have a score over 30, indicating high access. In Osceola County, nearly all areas have a MRFEi score below 15 (low access, poor access or no access to healthy retail food outlets). Additionally, only a handful of census tracts in northern central Osceola have a score over 15. None of the census tracts have a score high enough to indicate high access. Nearly all of Seminole County has a MRFEi score below 15 (low access, poor access or no access to healthy retail food outlets). Additionally, the entire county is without a census tract with a score over 30 (a score of 30 and above equals high access). A large portion of Lake County has a MRFEi score below 15 (low access,poor access or no access to healthy retail food outlets). Additionally, none of the counties' census tracts reportedhigh access scores (over 30). (See Figures 7.13 - 7.16) Family Households Receiving SNAP (2009-2013) A number of the residents in Orange County receive SNAP benets, mostly located in the center of the county. A number of Osceola County residents receive SNAP benets, mostly located near Kissimmee. A number of the residents in the Sanford area of Seminole County receive SNAP benets, the same area that is home to one of Seminole County's three food deserts. A number of the residents in the northern and southern portions of Lake County receive SNAP benets.(See Figures 7.17 - 7.20) Low-Income Population Living Near a Farmers' Market (2015) In Lake County, the census tracts near Leesburg have the highest percentage of low-income residents living near a farmers' market while the tracts in and around Eustis have no data or suppressed data. There is a large group of census tracts spanning from the City of Orlando in Orange County to Altamonte Springs in Seminole County. A ring of census tracts around this group has no data or suppressed data. In Osceola County, most of the low- income residents near Kissimmee have access to farmers' markets. The one large census tract that makes up the eastern and southern areas of Osceola County has low access. (See Figures 7.21 - 7.24) Fruit & Vegetables Expenditure (2014) The fruit and vegetable expenditures of residents in every census tract in the state were split into ve quintiles. Most of the tracts in the four-county assessment region fell in the fourth and fth quintiles, meaning they had the lowest expenditures. None of the census tracts in the region were in the top quintile in the state. (SeeFigures 7.25 - 7.28) Key Findings Based on Secondary and Primary Data Analysis The census tracts and ZIP codes closest to Orlando, Kissimmee and Altamonte Springs have better access to parks, as well as recreation and tness facilities, than most of the other census tracts in the assessment region.Across the region, there is a moderate amount of overlap between the location of food deserts and a highproportion of SNAP beneciaries. Not only are there issues with access to supermarkets and the like, the qualityof nutritious food available is lacking as evidenced by the MRFEi scores in the region as well as fruit andvegetable expenditures and access to farmers' markets among low-income residents.

133 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE ACCESS Adults With Health Insurance Coverage (2002-2013) Across the assessment region, while counties were typically increasing health insurance coverage since 2003, there was a sharp decline in coverage between 2010-2013. In part, the decline may be due to the Affordable Care Act and the recession. Where data were available, there is a general downward trend of insurance coverage across the sectors identied between 2010-2013. A few select groups experienced increase in the percent of insurance coverage between 2010-2013. These include Non-Hispanic Whites in both Osceola and Seminole Counties, as well as those making between $25k-$50k annually in Osceola County and those between the ages of 45-64 in Seminole County. Those in age ranges 45-64 in the other counties declined by upward of 20 percent. Across the region, the trends are very similar, with residents aged 65 and older experiencing the largest percent of insurance coverage and the smallest change, though downward. Additionally, regionally, those making more than $50k per year and the Non-Hispanic White population rank as the groups with the highest percentage of insurance coverage. Generally, residents with less than a high school diploma and making less than $25k per year experience the lowest percentage of health insurance coverage. This is most likely due to low wage, part-time employment opportunities for this sector of the population, therefore health insurance may not be attainable through employers. Lake County experienced an overall decline of insurance coverage across all categories, with the largest decline occurring in the population without a high school diploma (decrease of 34 percent), followed by those making below $25k annually (22 percent decline), and those between 45-64 years of age. In other words, the middle age, low-income, low educational attainment population has experienced a decline in the ability to have health insurance coverage in Lake County between 2010-2013. Lake County is consistent with the rest of the region in the fact that residents aged 65 and older have the largest percentage of health insurance coverage (98 percent), a fact that has remained relatively constant between 2010-2013. The next largest percent of residents with health insurance coverage are residents making more than $50k annually (90 percent), representing a decline of seven percent since 2010. In 2013, the Hispanic population only had a 51.7 percent health insurance coverage rate. Orange County experienced a decline in insurance coverage across all sectors identied in Charts 7.73-7.76, with the exception of those making less than $25k annually, which increased in coverage by 2.5 percent. The largest decline of insurance coverage occurred in those with less than a high school diploma (28.6 percent decline), which also has the lowest percentage of coverage at only 53 percent. This is followed by those making less than $25k per year, then by the Hispanic population. As with the rest of the region, residents aged 65 and older have the largest percentage of health insurance coverage at 96.2 percent. The population making morethan $50k a year follows at nearly 88 percent, then the Non-Hispanic White population and those with greaterthan a high school diploma. In general, the population with low wages and low education attainment has thelowest percentage of health insurance coverage. Osceola County experienced an increase in health insurance coverage in Non-Hispanic Whites (1.6 percent) and the population making between $25k-$49.9k (2.5 percent). The largest decline in the percent of health insurancecoverage occurred in the population with less than a high school diploma with a decline of 23.6 percent,followed by the Non-Hispanic Black population with a decline of 23.2 percent. Residents aged 65 and older, assimilar to the other counties in the region, have the greatest percentage of health insurance coverage with 97.6percent. This is followed by the population making more than $50k per year (83.7 percent) and the Non-Hispanic White population with a 83.3 percent coverage. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 134 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY In Seminole County, consistent with the other counties in the region, 98 percent of residents aged 65 and older have health insurance, compared to only 54.5 percent of those making less than $25k per year. The population between the ages of 45-64 had the largest increase in insurance coverage (6.5 percent), followed by the Non- Hispanic White population at 4.7 percent. Those making more than $50k per year follow the 65 years and older demographic with 95.4 percent insurance coverage rate, followed by Non-Hispanic White population. Seminole County's Hispanic population has the largest percentage of insurance coverage in the four-county region (85.5 percent). No data were available for the population with less than a college education. The greatest decline in insurance coverage occurred in residents aged 18-44 (14.1 percent). (See Charts 7.33 - 7.36) Percent Insured: Medicare (2009-2013) Most of Lake County has more than 25 percent of residents covered by Medicare. A large portion of eastern and southern Osceola County has between 20-25 percent insured by Medicare. The other notable cluster of high Medicare coverage is scattered around Orlando and Altamonte Springs. (See Figure 7.29) Percent Insured: Public-Funded Insurance (2009-2013) The largest area of residents who are covered by publicly funded insurance is central and northern Lake County. The same cluster found in the Medicare map around Orlando and Altamonte applies to this indicator as well. (See Figure 7.30) Percent Insured: Private Insurance (2009-2013) The high-density areas of those covered by private insurance are complementary to the publicly funded map. Much of the outer portions of Orange County and much of Seminole County is covered by private insurance. (See Figure 7.31) Uninsured Adults The state of Florida led the country in health insurance enrollment in 2015, enrolling more residents than California and Texas. For every county in the assessment region, the percent of uninsured decreased by at least four percent from 2013-2015. In all four counties, residents aged 18-34 were the highest uninsured age group. In 2015, Seminole County had the lowest uninsured percentage and Osceola County had the highest. (See Table 7.13 and Chart 7.77) Adults Who Could Not See a Doctor at Least Once in the Past Year Due to Cost (2007-2013) The percent of adults who could not see a doctor at least once in the past year due to cost has risen steadily in every county in the assessment region from 2007-2013. Osceola County residents are most likely to skip thedoctor and Seminole County residents are least likely. In 2013, Lake and Seminole Counties' percentages werebelow the state average. (See Chart 7.78) Subsidized Child Insurance by County (2015) Each county's count of children in subsidized programs is in line with its overall population size. Orange County has the highest number of active children and families in the region, while Lake County has the fewest.(See Table 7.14) Key Findings Based on Secondary and Primary Data Analysis Residents, providers and stakeholders discussed the impact of the cost of medical care and the cost of insurance. Because Florida did not expand Medicaid, members of the community believe that it is moredifcult for middle- and some low-income residents to secure affordable insurance. Thus, many CentralFlorida residents remain uninsured or underinsured.

COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 147 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS & FACILITIES, CONT'D. Total Licensed Florida Physicians (2010/11 - 2014/15) The number of total licensed physicians has remained relatively stable from FY 2010/2011 to FY 2014/2015. The most notable change over that time took place in Orange County with a seven percent increase in licensed physicians. Osceola County has the lowest rate, with less than 125 licensed physicians per 100,000 residents. Orange County has the highest rate of licensed physicians per 100,000 residents and is the only county in theregion with a rate above the state level. (See Chart 7.79) Total Licensed Florida Dentists (2010/11 - 2014/15) Seminole and Orange Counties experienced increases in the rate of licensed dentists per 100,000 residents while Lake and Osceola Counties saw decreases from FY 2010/2011 to FY 2014/2015. Osceola County has a rate signicantly below the state level with less than half the rate. Lake County is also below the state level, but not nearly as low. (See Chart 7.80) Ratio of Mental Health Providers to Population Lake County has the fewest mental health providers relative to the population while Orange County has the most. Across the assessment region and at the state level, the ratio of mental health providers to residents has improved. Orange and Seminole Counties have ratios that are more positive than the state level.(See Table 7.15) Emergency Room Services The only burn unit in the assessment region is part of the Collaboration conducting this CHNA and is one of sixin the state. Nine of the 11 primary stroke centers and both of the comprehensive stroke centers in the assessment region are also involved in the Collaboration. Two of the nine level one trauma centers in the state are in the assessment region and one is included in the Collaboration. Three of the four Level 1 and three of the six Level 2 cardiovascular service hospitals in the assessment region are involved in the Collaboration. (See Table 7.16) Transplant Services The only hospital in the assessment region for transplants is included in the Collaboration. (See Table 7.17) Total Licensed Hospital Beds There are 6,536 total licensed hospital beds in the four-county assessment region. Just over three-quarters of those (4,838) are operated by hospitals included in this assessment. Of the beds in hospitals included in thisassessment, 74 percent are located in Orange County. (See Chart 7.81) Total Licensed Acute Care Beds There are 14 hospital partners in this assessment that provide a total of 4,325 licensed acute care beds; morethan 80 percent of the acute care beds available in the four-county assessment region. Seventy-three percent ofthem are located in Orange County. (See Chart 7.82) Total NICU II and III Beds In Orange County, there are 130 NICU II beds across two Florida Hospital campuses (Winter Park and Orlando)and one Orlando Health campus (Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies). The 105 NICU III beds inOrange County are at Florida Hospital Orlando and Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies. (See Table7.18)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 148 -CHAPTER 7: HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS & FACILITIES, CONT'D. Total Comprehensive Rehab Beds There are 83 beds for total comprehensive rehabilitation in Orange County spread across two Florida Hospital campuses (Winter Park and Orlando) and one Orlando Health campus (Orlando Regional Medical Center). (See Table 7.19) Total Licensed Adult Psychiatric Beds Osceola Regional Medical Center has 25 licensed psychiatric hospital beds. Park Place in Osceola County has 50 crisis stabilization beds: 30 adult and 20 pediatric. (See Chart 7.83) Total C/A Psych and IRTF Beds South Seminole Hospital has 24 total child/adult psychiatric and intensive residential treatment facility beds. (See Table 7.20) Total Adult Substance Abuse Beds South Seminole Hospital also has 10 adult substance abuse beds. (See Table 7.21) Aspire Health Partners Visits Visits to Aspire Health Partners licensed hospital beds decreased from 2013-2015 regarding admissions, law enforcement admissions and walk-ins. (See Table 7.22) Key Findings Based on Secondary and Primary Data Analysis Access to mental health services was noted often across all data collection sources as a community concern. The ratio of providers to potential clients may contribute to this access issue. Additionally, the region has a wide variety of specialty services including NICU, psychiatric beds and trauma centers. Overuse of the ER remains a concern, as well. Residents continue to utilize ERs for non-emergency issues, straining resources. Additionally, resources and services appear to be clustered in Orange and Seminole Counties. Lake and Osceola Counties' residents may have to travel to access these services, especially if they are not offered closer to home.

While the percentage of women receiving mammograms has decreased in general, Black/African American women have seen a slight increase at the state level. Orange County has seen decreases for Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino women. Osceola County collects data on Hispanic/Latino women, which also show a decrease between 2010-2012. In Orange County in 2012, Hispanic/Latino women had the lowest percentage, but in Osceola County they received mammograms more often than White women. (See Chart 8.1) Women 18 Years+ Who Received Pap Test in Past Year by Race/Ethnicity (2002-2013) The racial data for pap tests are equally incomplete. There have been declines across racial groups from 2002- 2013. In 2013, Hispanic/Latino women in Osceola County were far less likely than White women to receive a pap. In Orange County, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino women had percentages higher than White women. (See Chart 8.2) Adults 50 Years+ Who Received a Sigmoidoscopy or Colonoscopy in Past Five Years by Race/Ethnicity (2002-2013) The racial data for sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy are similarly incomplete. Unlike the other preventative indicators, generally more adults are receiving the test than in the past. While the rate in Orange County has increased for White adults, it has slowly decreased for Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino residents. Hispanic/Latino adults in Osceola County have seen an increase similar to the general trend. (See Chart 8.3) Adults 50 Years+ Who Received a Stool Blood Test in the Past Year by Race/Ethnicity (2013) The data for adults aged 50 years and older who received a stool blood test in the past year are only complete in Orange County and at the state level. The rates across all racial and ethnic groups are below the state level with Black adults least likely to receive the test. Osceola reports Hispanic and White data which are both below the state level with Hispanics less likely to receive the test than their White counterparts. (See Chart 8.4) Men 50 Years+ Who Received a PSA Test in the Past Two Years by Race/Ethnicity (2010) None of the counties in the assessment region report data for Black or Hispanic males aged 50 years and older who received a PSA test in the past two years. At the state level, Hispanic residents are the least likely to receive the test. (See Chart 8.5) CHRONIC CONDITIONS Adults With Diagnosed Diabetes by Race/Ethnicity (2002-2013) As has been seen in many indicators, racial groups experience differing levels of AADRs for diabetes across Central Florida counties; however, there is more consistency to the gure for White individuals for diabetes.White populations are somewhat similar across counties. Rates for two out of three races within all countiesanalyzed decreased from the 2012-2014 time period, and no race decreased or increased across all countiesstudied during the 2012-2014 time period. The Black/African American population has a considerably increasedrisk for diabetes from a regional average perspective, while Hispanic/Latino and White rates are generally muchlower at the county (and regional) level. The lowest rate recorded was for the Hispanic/Latino population inOrange County, while the four highest rates of the 12 analyzed were part of the Black/African American COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 154 -CHAPTER 8: HEALTH DISPARITIES CHRONIC CONDITIONS, CONT'D. demographic. The increases in diabetes incidence for the Black/African American demographic in Orange and Osceola Counties from 2012-2014 are somewhat alarming compared to the disparities seen in other demographic groups. (See Chart 8.6) Adults Who Have Ever Been Told They Have High Blood Pressure by Race/Ethnicity (2002-2013) In Lake County, high blood pressure is up for both Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White residents; there are no data for Non-Hispanic Black Lake County residents. Orange County Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White residents have seen a steady increase from 2002-2013. Non-Hispanic Black adults peaked in 2010 then decreased signicantly in 2013. The same trend applies for Non-Hispanic Black adults in Osceola County. Osceola County Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White residents have seen a steady increase from 2002-2013. In Seminole County, there are only data for Non-Hispanic Black residents for 2007 and 2013. In both years, the high blood pressure percent was very high and increased in 2013. Hispanic residents also saw an increase while Non-Hispanic White residents peaked in 2010 and decreased in 2013. (See Chart 8.7) Adults Who Have Ever Been Told They Had a Stroke by Race/Ethnicity (2007-2013) Different racial groups experience differing levels of AADRs for cerebrovascular disease across Central Florida. However, outside of the gure for White persons, there is no clear consistency from county-to-county for rates from the Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino populations. Rates for all races within Orange County rose from the 2012-2014 time period, and rates in Lake and Seminole Counties rose for two of the three racial groups analyzed. All recorded rates reduced for Black/African American individuals over the time period outside of Orange County, while rates rose in three out of four counties for the Hispanic/Latinopopulation and rates increased for White persons in all four counties studied. Of the 12 county-race groups analyzed with historic data present, eight increased and four decreased. White individuals seem to be the most susceptible to rising rates from this historical analysis, although the Black/African American population has a considerably increased risk for cerebrovascular disease from a regional average perspective. (See Chart 8.8) Age Adjusted Death Rate for Coronary Heart Disease by Race/Ethnicity (2012-2014) Different racial groups experience differing levels of AADRs for coronary heart disease across Central Florida. However, outside of the gure for White persons, which is the highest in all counties studied, there is no clear consistency from county-to-county for rates from the Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino populations. Rates for all races within Lake County rose from the 2012-2014 time period, and rates in Osceola and Seminole Counties decreased for two of the three racial groups analyzed. All rates in Orange Countydecreased during the time period studied. All recorded rates reduced for Black/African American individualsover the time period outside of Lake County, while rates rose in two out of four counties for theHispanic/Latino and White populations. The White population has a considerably increased risk for coronaryheart disease from a regional average perspective and the Hispanic/Latino population is at the lowest riskregionally. (See Chart 8.9) Age Adjusted Colorectal Cancer Incidence by Race/Ethnicity (2008-2012) Across racial and ethnic groups, rectal cancer rates in Lake County fell except among Hispanic residents. InOrange County, all racial and ethnic groups saw an increase between 2008-2012, with a very pronouncedincrease for Black residents in 2012. Rectal cancer rates for all groups were lower in 2010 than in 2008 or2012. Hispanic residents saw the starkest increase between 2010-2012 of all the groups. In Seminole County,Black residents clearly had a higher rate than other groups in 2010 and 2012. White residents saw a decreasefrom 2008-2012. (See Chart 8.10)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 155 -CHAPTER 8: HEALTH DISPARITIES CHRONIC CONDITIONS, CONT'D. Breast Cancer Incidence by Race/Ethnicity (2008-2012) In Lake County, there was an overall decrease in rates of breast cancer among Hispanic residents between 2008-2012. White residents experienced a steady decrease during that time period as well. In Lake County, Black residents saw an increase in breast cancer rates year to year. In Orange County, White and Non-Hispanic residents saw a decrease every year. In Osceola County, Black and Hispanic residents' rates of breast cancer increased, while White and Non-Hispanic residents peaked in 2010 then decreased to rates lower than in 2008. Seminole County reported decreases across racial groups except for Black residents who peaked in 2010 then returned to a rate comparable to the 2008 rate in 2013. (See Chart 8.11) Lung Cancer Incidence, Age Adjusted by Race/Ethnicity (2008-2012) In Lake County, the rates for lung cancer in Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino residents increased from 2010-2012, while the rate for lung cancer in White residents decreased over the same period. In 2012, Black/African American residents had the highest rate in Lake County while Hispanic/Latino had the lowest. In Orange County, White residents decreased slightly. The rate for Black/African American residents increased from 2010-2012 with a peak in 2011. The rate for Hispanic/Latino residents in Orange County has slowlyincreased since 2010, but in 2012 was the lowest rate among all racial/ethnic groups in the county. In Osceola, the rate for White and Black/African American residents increased from 2010-2012, however the rate for White residents was higher. The rate for Hispanic/Latino residents has steadily risen and in 2012 passed the state level. In Seminole County, rates for White residents declined, but remained highest among the racial groups.Despite the increase over time for Hispanic/Latino residents, the group continues to report the lowest rates for lung cancer among the groups. (See Chart 8.12) Adults Currently With Asthma by Race/Ethnicity (2002-2013) Only Orange County has consistent data for Non-Hispanic Black residents regarding adults currently with asthma. The rate for this group increased steadily and was the highest among racial groups in Orange County in 2013. Hispanic residents have fluctuated, but most recent data suggest a decrease. White residents in Orange County declined generally with the lowest rate of adults currently with asthma in 2007. Lake County saw a stark increase in 2013 for both Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic residents. For the years included, there was an increase among Non-Hispanic Black residents in Osceola County. Both Non-Hispanic White and Hispanicrates were on an upward trend from 2002-2013. The difference between the two data points for Non-Hispanic Black residents in Seminole County is stark: the rate in 2013 was 10 times higher than the 2007 rate. White residents have experienced a decrease while Hispanic residents dipped in 2007 and increased to their highest rate in 2013. (See Chart 8.13) LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH Top Five Causes of Death by Race/Ethnicity Lake County 2014 In 2014, heart disease and cancer were the leading causes of death for both the White and Black/Otherpopulations at a rate of 154.2-174.7 AADR per 100,000. In the White population, unintentional injury, chroniclower respiratory and cerebrovascular disease, in that order, nished the top ve causes of death. In theBlack/Other population, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory and cerebrovascular disease completedthe top ve causes of death. When compared by ethnicity, in the Non-Hispanic community, heart disease (162.8AADR), cancer (160.2 AADR), unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease and cerebrovasculardisease were the top ve causes of death. The leading causes of death in the Hispanic community were heartdisease (143.1 AADR), cancer (121.0 AADR), cerebrovascular disease, unintentional injury and diabetes. (SeeTable 8.1)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 156 -CHAPTER 8: HEALTH DISPARITIES Top Five Causes of Death by Race/Ethnicity, Cont'd. Orange County 2014 In 2014, heart disease (154.4 AADR) was the leading cause of death for the White population followed by cancer (151.8 AADR), unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease and cerebrovascular disease. Cancer was the leading cause of death in the Black/Other population at a rate of 145.9 AADR per 100,000. This was followed by heart disease (130.4 AADR), cerebrovascular disease, diabetes and unintentional injury. When compared by ethnicity, in the Non-Hispanic community, heart disease (162.4 AADR), cancer (157.8 AADR), unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease and cerebrovascular disease were the top ve causes of death. The leading causes of death in the Hispanic community were cancer (119.7 AADR), heart disease (104.2 AADR), cerebrovascular disease, unintentional injury and chronic lower respiratory disease. (See Table 8.2) Osceola County 2014 In 2014, heart disease was the leading cause of death for both the White population (219.9 AADR) and Black/Other population (133.6). This was followed by cancer (White - 158.8 AADR; Black/Other - 96.7). In the White population, chronic lower respiratory disease, unintentional injury and cerebrovascular disease completed the top ve leading causes. In the Black population, heart disease and cancer were followed by chronic lower respiratory disease, Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease. When compared by ethnicity, in the Non-Hispanic community, heart disease (223.0 AADR), cancer (165.1 AADR), chronic lower respiratory disease, unintentional injury and cerebrovascular disease were the top ve causes of death. The leading causes of death in the Hispanic community were heart disease (181.3 AADR), cancer (121.1 AADR), Alzheimer's disease, unintentional injury and cerebrovascular disease. (See Table 8.3) Seminole County 2014 In 2014, cancer and heart disease were the leading causes of death, in that order, for both the White and Black/Other populations at a rate of 113.8-155 AADR per 100,000. In the White population, chronic lower respiratory, unintentional injury and cerebrovascular disease nished the top ve causes of death. In the Black/Other population, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes and unintentional injury completed the top ve causes of death. When compared by ethnicity, cancer was the leading cause of death for the Non-Hispanic (162.7 AADR) and Hispanic (96.0 AADR) populations followed (Non-Hispanics - 155.0 AADR; Hispanics 90.5 AADR). In the Non-Hispanic population, chronic lower respiratory disease, unintentional injury and cerebrovascular disease completed the top ve causes of death. Cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease and unintentional injury followed cancer and heart disease as the leading causes of death in the Hispanic population in Seminole County. (See Table 8.4) BIRTH CHARACTERISTICS Infant Mortality Within Race/Ethnicity (2014) Infant mortality rates are affecting the Black population at the highest rate within all four counties analyzed. Of the 12 indicators collected, the highest four rates are attributed to the Black population. The White andHispanic populations have similar rates, but these rates vary somewhat from county to county. White infantshave a higher mortality rate in Lake and Seminole Counties, while Hispanic populations are more at risk, onaverage, in Orange and Osceola Counties. (See Chart 8.14) Births to Uninsured Women Within Race/Ethnicity (2014) Hispanic mothers are also less likely to be insured compared to White and Black mothers. Hispanic motherslead both Black and White mothers in this category across all four counties analyzed. The Black population isgenerally more likely to have insurance as compared to the other racial demographics studied. (See Chart 8.15)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 157 -CHAPTER 8: HEALTH DISPARITIES BIRTH CHARACTERISTICS, CONT'D. Births to Mothers With Less Than a High School Education Within Race/Ethnicity (2014) Educational attainment at the time of birth is analyzed in this portion of the report by race and county of residence. While numbers varied among races on a county-by-county basis, the Hispanic population had the highest rates of this measure in three out of four counties studied. This is highlighted by a 19.2 percent rate in Lake County, which has the highest overall rates in Central Florida regardless of the racial demographic studied. White mothers are the least likely to have less than a high school education, primarily in Seminoleand Orange Counties, where rates are 6.3 percent and 9.6 percent, respectively. (See Chart 8.16) Births to Unwed Mothers Within Race/Ethnicity (2014) Unwed mothers, by race and county, are generally at or above the 40 percent level within all counties studied in this report. While numbers by select race differ when measured across counties, the Black population has the highest rate of unwed mothers in all four counties analyzed. White mothers, meanwhile, were much less likely overall to be unwed at the time of birth. However, when compared to the numbers collected for repeat births for mothers aged 15-19, there is no correlation. (See Chart 8.17) Births to Mothers Who Were Obese During Pregnancy Within Race/Ethnicity (2014) The rate of births to mothers who were obese during pregnancy is also representative of the obesity by race gures in this report, that show the Black population is the most at-risk demographic group within all four counties. Often, these gures exceed 30 percent. White and Hispanic mothers in Central Florida generally have numbers within the same range. However, there is a slightly lower rate for White mothers. (See Chart 8.18) Repeat Births to Mothers Ages 15-19 Within Race/Ethnicity (2014) While it may seem like common sense that there would be a correlation between births to unwed mothers and repeat births to mothers aged 15-19, repeat birth gures are somewhat sporadic and appear random across counties and racial demographics. There is one exception, however, as Hispanic mothers in Lake County havea 29.6 percent rate, 5.5 percent higher than the second largest gure of the 12 analyzed across counties and racial demographics. (See Chart 8.19) Preterm Birth Rate (<37 Weeks) Within Race/Ethnicity (2014) Preterm births also affect the Black population disproportionately as compared to the White and Hispanic populations. Similar to infant mortality rates studied regionally, the Black population has the four highest gures of the 12 studied across each county and racial demographic. Thus, the Black community is at thehighest level of risk for preterm births. White and Hispanic rates are nearly identical from county to county.(See Chart 8.20) Low Birth Weight (<2,550 grams) Within Race/Ethnicity (2014) The low birth weight rates follow the same trend as preterm births and infant mortality rates. The Blackcommunity has the highest rates, by a considerable margin, across all four counties studied. As was seen withpreterm births, White and Hispanic rates for low birth weights are fairly consistent and nearly identical for the2014 period. (See Chart 8.21)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 158 -CHAPTER 8: HEALTH DISPARITIES BIRTH CHARACTERISTICS, CONT'D. Births Covered by Medicaid Within Race/Ethnicity (2014) The Black community also has the highest percentage of births covered by Medicaid, with gures exceeding 63.2 percent or more in each county analyzed. The Hispanic population is also more susceptible than the average regional rates. Hispanic births covered by Medicaid within the region range from 56.5 percent in Seminole County to 65.7 percent in Osceola County. It is important to note that Osceola County has the highest proportion of Hispanic individuals among the four counties studied, which considerably increases the overall risk in terms of the number of individuals with Medicaid care. This could put Osceola County at a higher nancial burden to the medical community, as a whole, in terms of Medicaid cost per resident (for births only). (See Chart 8.22) QUALITY OF LIFE/MENTAL HEALTH Adults Who Had Poor Mental Health Days For 14 or More of the Past 30 Days Within Race/Ethnicity, By Income and By Education (2007-2013) In Lake County, no data existed for the Non-Hispanic Black population who had poor mental health days for 14 of more of the past 30 days. However, overall, the percentage of the population experiencing this indicator is rising in Lake County, increasing 34 percent in Non-Hispanic Whites and 39 percent in the Hispanicpopulation. The population with more than a high school diploma has the most consistent percentage in thisindicator and those making more than $50k annually generally account for the lowest percentage of thepopulation experiencing poor mental health. In general, in Lake County the population characteristics that show the highest percentage of poor mental health for 14 or more days in the past 30 days include Hispanics, those with a high school/GED or less, and those making less than $25k per year. In Orange County, there has been a sharp rise in the percentage of Non-Hispanic Blacks experiencing poor mental health days for 14 or more days in the past 30 days, rising 75 percent between 2010-2013. The Hispanic population experienced a decline of 50 percent between 2010-2013. The population with less than a high school education has experienced an upward trend. None of the demographic cross-sections showed a downwardtrend in Orange County. Generally, those making more than $50k annually had the lowest percentage of poor mental health days for 14 or more of the past 30 days than any other characteristic indicated. This is followed by Non-Hispanic Whites and those with higher educational levels. Generally, 2010 had the highest percentage in most of the categories, outside of the Non-Hispanic Black population and those with less than high schooleducation levels. Osceola County is experiencing declines in some characteristics associated with this indicator, especially in Non-Hispanic Whites, those with a high school diploma/GED and the population making more than $50kannually. The population making less than $25k per year has experienced a consistent upward trend from 2007,increasing 63 percent. Also, the Non-Hispanic Black population more than doubled its percentage of adultswith poor mental health days for 14 or more or the past 30 days between 2007-2010. This percentage thendrastically reduced in 2013 to below its 2007 level to 6.20 percent. As would be expected, the population withless than high school education and those making less than $25k per year experienced the highest percentage ofadults who have had poor mental health days for 14 or more of the past 30 days. In Seminole County, many of the categories in this indicator are relatively similar in terms of percentage, except for those making less than $25k annually, which has experienced the fastest growth in percentage (100 percentgrowth, with higher percentages than the other characteristics). The percentage of adults with poor mentalhealth days for 14 or more days of the past 30 days has shown an upward trend in the Non-Hispanic Whitepopulation, those making more than $50k annually, and those with educational levels above high school, as wellas those making less than $25k per year. The other characteristics have fluctuated between 2007-2013. (SeeCharts 8.23 - 8.25)COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 159 -CHAPTER 8: HEALTH DISPARITIES QUALITY OF LIFE/MENTAL HEALTH, CONT'D. Adults Who Always or Usually Receive the Social and Emotional Support They Need Within Race/Ethnicity (2007-2010) Lake County does not have data for Non-Hispanic Black residents and only one year of Hispanic data for adults who always or usually receive the social and emotional support they need. The data point for Hispanic residents was comparable to that year's rate for Non-Hispanic White residents. In 2010, the rate for Non- Hispanic White residents increased slightly. In Orange County, each group saw a marginal increase over time, with Non-Hispanic White residents reporting social and emotional support most frequently. In Osceola County, Non-Hispanic Black residents received the least support after a decrease in 2010. Hispanic residents experienced a decrease as well, while the rate for Non-Hispanic White residents remained essentially the same. In Seminole County, there is only one data point for Non-Hispanic Black residents, and in 2007 they had the highest rate. The percentage of adults receiving support decreased for both Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic residents in Seminole County. (See Charts 8.26) HEALTHCARE ACCESS Insurance Coverage by Race/Ethnicity (2013) Again, Lake County does not have data for its Non-Hispanic Black residents and is missing a year of data for Hispanic residents. Hispanic residents were insured at a much lower rate than Non-Hispanic White residents in 2013. In Orange and Osceola Counties, Hispanic residents were least likely to be insured while Non- Hispanic White residents had the highest insured rates. In Seminole County in 2013, Non-Hispanic Black residents were least likely to be insured, while Non-Hispanic White residents had the highest coverage rates. (See Chart 8.27) Key Findings A general decrease in preventative screenings applies even more so to minority residents where data are reported by race. Diabetes is a major concern for the region and Black residents specically. Black residents are also overrepresented in maternal and child indicators, especially infant mortality. Insurance coverage is an issue for racial minorities, especially Hispanic residents. There is also a foundational issue in underreporting data for minority populations; it is difcult to address racial disparities if there is no way of knowing where they exist.

However, this hot spot accounts for seven percent of the total uninsured inpatient visits to Arnold Palmer Hospital. Also, due to the uniqueness of the hospital, and the low sample size, to protect patient privacy, analysis was limited to diagnosis and cost. Additionally, due to the number of codes that fell into the fth spot, for primary and secondary codes, only the top four are analyzed. This also is due to the low sample size.

Residents of Seminole County appear to have the best overall outcomes, with the most encouraging County Health Rankings, positive student indicators including graduation rates and low violence, and improvements in communicable diseases and vaccinations, among other indicators. Seminole County also has the highest median household income. Orange County presents an interesting mix of encouraging indicators and room for improvement. Lake and Osceola Counties are lagging on a number of indicators and have the fewest resources in the region. The following areas of concern have emerged for the region as a whole. More county-specic assessment themes can be found in the following chapter. Affordability of care is a common theme across counties and nearly all data collection methods. This includes the affordability of doctor visits, prescriptions, hospital visits and insurance. Many residents have skipped doctor visits due to cost. The cost of care may also contribute to the decreasing levels of preventative care or early intervention of health issues. When preventative care and early action are not feasible or accessible, people wait to seek medical care until they are in an emergency situation. This is one contributing factor for the overuse of emergency rooms (ERs). Another factor is the limited access to mental health services. Providers and stakeholders agree that too many residents are utilizing the ER to address under-treated and untreated mental illness. Finally, there is continued evidence that the uninsured over-utilize the ER. If insurance is unaffordable, people go uninsured, leaving the burden of care heavily on the shoulders of hospitals. The need for mental health services is another theme that was consistent across the region and with nearly all data collection sources. There is some evidence based on the CFCHS Behavioral Health Needs Assessment and secondary demographic data that a racial disparity exists between those who need mental health services and those who actually receive them. Substance abuse is also a concern separate from the general umbrella of mental health. Providers and some residents are concerned about heroin in the community, a concern that is gaining prominence on the national stage. Both mental health and substance abuse are closely tied to homelessness which is major concern across the region. The relationship between these variables is unclear, but likely bi-directional; that is, mental health and substance abuse issues make it difcult to secure stable housing and homelessness exacerbates substance abuse and mental health issues. Untreated mental illness and substance abuse make it difcult to maintain gainful employment and stable housing. Additionally, the stresses of homelessness can exacerbate mental health symptoms and substance abuse. Another major contributor to the issue of homelessness is a lack of affordable housing. There are high levels of cost burden among renters and primary data sources lament the cost of housing. Povertyis a powerful latent variable across the region. It is no accident that the county with the highest median income (Seminole County) has residents with the best outcomes. Poverty increases stress and limits options for care. Residents and community stakeholders alike have concerns about access to quality and nutritious foods. There are numerous food deserts in the region, and many of them overlap with census tracts where a highproportion of residents live who receive public food assistance. In these areas, there either isn't a supermarket orthey are too far away. In the absence of nearby supermarkets and other fresh food providers, residents turn tofast food and convenience stores. These establishments often offer calorie-dense, low-nutrient foods. A dietprimarily composed of these foods contributes to the three chronic diseases most often mentioned in all datacollection sources: obesity, diabetes and heart disease. When paired with limited recreation/tness and parkopportunities, as well as built environment issues such as walkability and bike-friendly infrastructure,residents are more likely to have a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. These chronic diseases appear toconsistently and disproportionately affect minority populations. Specically, diabetes is clearly an issue in theBlack community. Finally, there are serious concerns about infant mortality among Black residents. While the region and state are near the Healthy People 2020 target, Black residents have signicantly higher infant mortality rates. CHAPTER 11: NEEDS ASSESSMENT SUMMARY BY COUNTYCOMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT - 317 -CHAPTER 11: NEEDS ASSESSMENT SUMMARIES BY COUNTY The county assessment summaries that follow include basic demographic information for each county, as well as high-level overviews of the four assessment components of the MAPP model: community health status,community themes and strengths, local public health systems and forces of change. For each county, there is also a list of themes selected by the Collaboration. Dozens of themes were generated based on the data and the Collaboration utilized a democratic voting process to select 10-15 for each county. These themes will be used in the Implementation Strategies plan. LAKE COUNTY CHART 11.1LAKE COUNTY POPULATION BY RACE / ETHNICITY (2014) Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2015.
