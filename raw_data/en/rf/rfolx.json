On average, adults usually experience cold two to five times a year whereas children and geriatrics may get affected at a higher rate. Naturally, cough and cold are the self-defense mechanisms that usually occur to prevent germ infections. In medical terminology, cough is define as a reflex action that is stimulated by inflammation on mucosal surface of throat and lung airways. Coughing helps to cleanse the lungs and airways from foreign substances that entered nostrils and throat. Causes Virus remains the main cause of infection at the upper respiratory tract (nose, pharynx and larynx), which causes cough and cold. Rhinovirus and Coronavirus are the viruses that cause most of the infection. Apart from that, you may also get cough and cold due to allergic reaction caused by dust, smoke, pollen, perfume and animal fur. Extreme weather that is too hot or too cold may weaken body defense system, causing the body to be more susceptible to bacteria or virus infection. Signs and Symptoms Early signs and symptoms of a common cold usually include a dry and painful throat, and body weakness. This is then followed by the symptoms below: - Runny nose : usually the liquid is clear in colour, followed by production of mucus that is thicker. - Blocked nose : occurs due to irritation and inflammation of blood vessels. This will cause narrowing of nasal airway and mucus production will cause the patient to sneeze. - Cough : occurs due to irritation at pharynx. At early stage, the cough is usually dry and without phlegm. At the later stage, severe bronchial congestion may cause severe cough with phlegm. For children, there will be rise in body temperature, loss of appetite and vomiting when they cough. - Pain in the ear : occurs due to mucus production behind the eardrum, causing pain and hearing problems as well as temporary loss of sense of smell and taste. - Headache : occurs due to inflammation and congestion of nasal and sinus airways.
