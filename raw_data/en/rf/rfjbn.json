When a sufficient number of individuals in a population are immune to a [disease](https://www.britannica.com/science/disease), as would occur if a large proportion of a population were vaccinated, [herd immunity](https://www.britannica.com/science/herd-immunity) is achieved. That means that if there is random mixing of individuals within the population, then the pathogen cannot be spread throughout the population. Herd immunity acts by breaking the transmission of infection or by lessening the chances of susceptible individuals coming in contact with a person who is infectious. Herd immunity provides a measure of protection to individuals who are not personally [immune](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/immune) to the disease\u2014for instance, individuals who, because of their age or underlying medical conditions, cannot receive vaccines or individuals who received vaccines but remain susceptible. Herd immunity played an important role in the successful eradication of [smallpox](https://www.britannica.com/science/smallpox), and it is vital in preventing the spread of diseases such as [polio](https://www.britannica.com/science/polio) and [measles](https://www.britannica.com/science/measles). Adverse reactions Vaccination carries some risk of reaction, though [adverse effects](https://www.britannica.com/science/side-effect) typically are very rare and very mild. The most common reactions to vaccines include redness and soreness around the vaccination site. More severe adverse reactions, such as [vomiting](https://www.britannica.com/science/vomiting), high [fever](https://www.britannica.com/science/fever), seizure, brain damage, or death, are possible for some vaccines. Such reactions are exceptionally rare, however\u2014occurring in less than one in a million people for most vaccines. Severe reactions also tend to affect only certain populations, such as persons whose immune systems are compromised by preexisting disease (e.g., [HIV](https://www.britannica.com/science/HIV)/ [AIDS](https://www.britannica.com/science/AIDS)) or who are undergoing [chemotherapy](https://www.britannica.com/science/chemotherapy). Claims have been made that vaccines are responsible for certain adverse health conditions, particularly [autism](https://www.britannica.com/science/autism), [speech disorders](https://www.britannica.com/science/speech-disorder), and [inflammatory bowel disease](https://www.britannica.com/science/inflammatory-bowel-disease). Some of those claims focused on [thimerosal](https://www.britannica.com/science/thimerosal), a mercury-containing [compound](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compound) used as a preservative in vaccines. Some people believed that autism was a form of [mercury poisoning](https://www.britannica.com/science/mercury-poisoning), caused specifically by thimerosal in childhood vaccines. Those claims have been discredited. Still, misinformation and fear generated by false claims about associations between autism and vaccines had a significant impact on individuals' perceptions about vaccine safety. In addition, most individuals in countries where vaccination is widespread have never personally experienced vaccine-preventable disease. Thus, the focus of concern for some people shifted from the negative effects of vaccine-preventable disease to the possible negative effects of the vaccines themselves. [Complacency](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Complacency) about vaccine-preventable diseases, combined with concerns over the effects of vaccination, led to decreasing levels of vaccination coverage in some areas of the world. As a consequence, not only were individuals susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases, but, at population levels, vaccination rates dropped low enough to cause losses of herd immunity, thereby allowing outbreaks of disease. Such outbreaks brought high costs to societies, especially in terms of health and medical care, disability and economic strain, and loss of life. In the 20th century in [Japan](https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan), [England](https://www.britannica.com/place/England), and [Russia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Russia), for example, numbers of children [vaccinated](https://www.britannica.com/science/pertussis-vaccine) against [whooping cough](https://www.britannica.com/science/whooping-cough) dropped sufficiently low so as to enable outbreaks of disease that involved thousands of children and resulted in hundreds of deaths.
