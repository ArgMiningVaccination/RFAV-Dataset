I chose to do a retreat over New Year's Eve to start 2023 with continued health, rather than party and have a hangover. Reading the reviews, this retreat promised peaceful, tranquil, revitalising...diminish stress, rest, balance your body mind & soul..... It delivered 20% of what was promised. You need to understand that this is NOT a retreat & is misleading to advertise as one. It's a resort - a very beautiful one - that can also have screaming kids & babies, because it's just a resort that has all kinds of guests. So if you \"luck out\" as I did, there will be no peace at all. The air conditioner didn't work in my room & they didn't attend to fix it until 5 minutes before check out. The room was beautiful, but very very hot & was difficult to sleep. On every occasion, they were up to 1-2 hours late delivering my green juices which when all you're having is juice, is very stressful. And then on a few occasions, delivered the wrong juice or tea to my villa. This is despite my text messages as I was asked to correspond by text only. The massages were literally just skin rub-downs with oil. Except on the last day where the reflexology massage was rather good. However, they were always at least 10 minutes late to massages and you're left standing in the hot sun waiting. The yoga, however, was one on one. No one else showed up. And that was literally the highlight for me. I absolutely loved it! The hydrogen inhalation, it's hard to say. I'm sure there are benefits from this but it's not like you feel them straight away. The first time I went for this treatment they put the inhaler on incorrectly and so I didn't actually get any benefit. I asked her to check it but she said it was right. Thankfully the next time I insisted that someone else check it. And I was right, it was put on incorrectly so I didn't get the first session. I initially thought if I stayed an extra day, they could get things right & I could leave feeling relaxed after spending all this money & time attending. I was committed to helping them get it right. However after many discussions and text messages where they promised it would be ok, they again delivered my juice over an hour late and got the order wrong. Despite me texting. I know late juice seems small, but not when it's all you're having & you are a little hungry. I realize the good reviews for this \"retreat\" are around 6 months old, when Bali was still very very quiet & not many here on the island. So they would have had hardly any guests at all. The resort was full when I stayed, and they were just out of their depth. It's a shame as I live in Bali, and I originally planned to do this retreat every 3 months and bring girlfriends for getaways. I hope they get it right eventually because the resort is beautiful. The staff is really lovely too. They just aren't able to deliver sadly. I know this review sounds like a complaining Karen, but I feel I really need to prevent others from wasting money & coming away feeling stressed when I went there relaxed. JadePosted a year ago on BookRetreats The retreat has potential as the setting is beautiful, but the programme has a long way to go to feel fully relaxing. Hygeine standards of cups, plates etc and the showers need major improvement. The yoga was a massive let down, it is extremely high level/radical. It is nice to spend part of any class learning new concepts but most of the class was taken up by this. When you're only doing 3 classes per retreat its not enough to get into all the higher levels of breathing techniques and cleaning your third eye... I would have felt better and more fulfilled having some time to also do traditional yoga stretches and poses. A mix of learning and actually working out my whole body. BethPosted 2 months ago on BookRetreatsWouldn't stay again This didn't really feel like a retreat, lots of people staying we're just using it as accommodation, and the main reason lots of people stay there is to use the russian steam room they have there. I wouldn't say it was a wellness retreat. Lots of the healers/therapists seemed to just be people they called in. It didn't feel like a holistic experience and the menu was limited - 2 juices to choose from and no nutritional advice about the food options. The accomodation and location are beautiful. The staff were friendly but all in all, it wasn't the retreat experience I hoped for. Good for accomodation with optional treatments but not a \"retreat programme\" Given the money spent I felt it wasn't what I expected. However, the Balinese staff on site were friendly so can't complain there. ValeriyPosted a year ago on BookRetreats It was a fantastic experience. So nice atmosphere, very nice food and absolutely amazing staff. If you never try Russian sauna then you miss something in your life. This is the best sauna I ever saw in my life.
