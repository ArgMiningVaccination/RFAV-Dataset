The practice of Siddha medicine is very popular in the southern region. This system of medicine deals with herbal and herbal-mineral preparations. One such preparation is kabasura kudineer which consists of fifteen herbs which are developed by the Siddha formulary of India. Being a polyherbal combination, there are numerous health benefits of this preparation. In this article, we will learn more about kabasura kudineer, its health benefits, side effects, precautions, etc.1 As already mentioned, kabasura kudineer is a polyherbal formulation consisting of fifteen herbs in equal proportions. These herbs are rich in bioactive compounds like alkaloids which include piperine, piperlonguminine, oils like eugenol, stigmasterol, sitosterol and fatty acids like gallic acid. The composition of this preparation is given in the Kabasura kudineer shows numerous scientifically proven properties; some of which are mentioned below:1 Based on my experiences, Kabasura Kudineer is widely used for treating COVID 19 and many studies support it. However, Kabasura Kudineer along with Nilvembu Kudineer can be used to manage other viral infections like dengue, chikungunya, etc. [Dr. Siddharth Gupta, MD] Some of the potential benefits of kabasura kudineer are described below. It was only after Covid-19 that Siddha-based medicines gained the limelight due to surprising results shown by kabasura kudineer during the pandemic. The AYUSH Ministry of Government of India in 2020 approved kabasura kudineer for Covid-19 management. This preparation was approved as an immune booster. A study by Svenia et al. in 2021 stated that this polyherbal formulation might also help reduce inflammation in Covid-19 and also can inhibit the growth of viruses. This indicates that this preparation may positively impact Covid-19. However, you should not self-medicate and consult your physician for proper treatment of Covid-19.1 Asthma is a disease affecting the respiratory system, which makes it difficult to breathe and can sometimes trigger cough, wheezing and shortness of breath. A study conducted by Svenia et al. in 2021 stated that kabasura kudineer has an anti-asthmatic effect. This means that this preparation may provide symptomatic relief from asthma. The exact mechanism behind this effect is not clear, and thus, it is advised not to consider this preparation as an alternative to modern medicine. Kindly consult your physician for the proper management of asthma.1 Literature studies support the use of herbal preparations for managing diabetes. Harini et al. in 2022 conducted a study, and the results of this study show that kabasura kudineer may help in managing diabetes. This effect is attributed to the inhibition of enzymes like alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase; these enzymes are responsible for converting starch into glucose. This helps in reducing blood glucose and thus may positively impact diabetes. Also, it is advised not to consider kabasura kudineer as an alternative to modern medicine; you should always consult your doctor for proper management of diabetes.3 Ever wondered what happens to the medicines that we take for treating any health issues? The liver, the largest organ of your body, is responsible for the metabolism of these medicines and helps in converting the drugs into a form which is non-toxic and can be easily removed from the body. A study conducted by Svenia et al. in 2021 stated that kabasura kudineer might have a protective effect on the liver. However, due to limited studies, it is advised not to rely on kabasura kudineer as a remedy and kindly consult your physician for the proper management of any liver disease.1 A study conducted by Svenia et al. in 2021 stated that kabasura kudineer might help in inhibiting the growth of bacteria, viruses and fungi. Thus, this preparation may be an effective antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal agent and may help in managing infections caused due to bacteria, viruses and fungi. This effect may be hypothesized due to the modulation of the immune system, which may help in fighting infections. However, you should not consider this preparation as an alternative to modern medicine; it is always advised to consult a physician for the proper management of infections.1 Though there are studies that show the benefits of Kabasura kudineer in various conditions, these are insufficient and there is a need for further studies to establish the true extent of the benefits of Kabasura kudineer on human health. Due to the presence of various phenols, flavonoids, and to these properties, Kabasura Kudineer might be useful in pain management. [Dr. Rajeev Singh, BAMS] You must consult a qualified doctor before consuming any herbal supplements. You should not discontinue or replace your ongoing treatment of modern medicine with an ayurvedic/herbal preparation without consulting your doctor. Parthasarathy et al. conducted a study in 2021 that found that kabasura kudineer if consumed in excess amounts can result in damage to the kidney.5 Gnanashanmugam et al. conducted a study in 2018 that stated that Siddha medicines, if consumed in excess have a potential for mercury toxicity and may result in neuromyotonia, a rare nerve disease characterized by spontaneous muscle movements. Thus, it may happen kabasura kudineer which belongs to Siddha medicines may exert similar side effects.6 Although, the side effect profile of kabasura kudineer is not studied in depth, if you experience any adverse reactions to kabasura kudineer, it is advised to discontinue its intake and immediately contact a doctor or your Ayurvedic physician who has prescribed it, as they will guide you properly for your symptoms. Consuming kabasura kudineer is okay if taken in moderate amounts. However, the following considerations must be taken: Not enough studies are available regarding the interactions of kabasura kudineer; however, you must always seek the advice of your Ayurvedic physician about the possible interaction of kabasura kudineer with other drugs. Kabasura kudineer is a polyherbal preparation consisting of fifteen herbs developed by the Siddha formulary of India.1 In the market, kabasura kudineer tablets and powder/churna are available for use.1 There is a potential that kabasura kudineer if consumed in excess amounts can result in kidney injury. Mercury toxicity is also common with siddha medicines and therefore a similar side effect can also occur with kabasura kudineer if taken in excess.5 Yes, studies support the use of kabasura kudineer may positively impact diabetes. However, it is advised to not rely on kabasura kudineer and consult your doctor for the proper management of diabetes. The safety of kabasura kudineer during pregnancy is not well-established; it is therefore advised to avoid its use and consult your doctor for the same.
