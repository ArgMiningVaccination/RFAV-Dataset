DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 92-AWA-5] Amendment to New York Terminal Control Area, NY AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; amendment. SUMMARY This action amends the language describing the New York, NY, Terminal Control Area (TCA). A final rule that established the New York TCA was published on July 21, 1971. A portion of \"Area F\" of the New York TCA is being revised to describe the boundaries that coincide with - prominent geographic landmarks. This action involves amending language in the description of \"Area F\" of the New York TCA and will not alter the TCA's physical dimensions or the TCA airspace as depicted on aeronautical charts. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 U.T.C, May 27, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia P. Crawford, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP- 240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267-9255. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History A final rule that established the New York TCA was published in the Federal, Register on July 21. 1971, with an effective date of September 16, 1971 (36 FR 13376). The description, as then. published, for a portion of \"Area F\" ofthe New York TCA, indicates that the 6- mile radius circle of the LaGuardia (LGA) Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) intersects the LGA VOR 2640 radial at the west bank of the Hudson River. These two lines, however, do not intersect on the west bank but in the middle of the Hudson River. This amendment deletes the reference to the radial intersection and instead uses the landmark of the Hudson's west bank as the point of intersection with the 6-mile arc. The revision to the language in the description of the New York TCA, therefore, does'not involve a change to the physical dimensions. The dimensions as depicted on the aeronautical charts are correct. The coordinates depicted in the description of \"Area F\" have been updated to North American Datum 83. TCA's are published in section 71.401(b) of FAA Order 7400.7A dated November 2, 1992, and effective November 27, 1992, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The TCA listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the language in the description of \"Area F\" of the New York TCA by describing the boundaries that coincide with prominent geographic landmarks. The current boundary from the \"intersection of the LGA VOR/DME 3370 radial and the Erie Lackawanna Railroad tracks, thence south along the railroad tracks to the east branch of the Hackensack River, thence south ard west along the river to the LGA VOR/DME 2990 radial\" will be redefined as from the \"intersection of LGA VOR/DME 3370 radial and-the Conrail Railroad tracks, thence south and west along the railroad tracks to the LGA VORIDME 299 radial.\" The Conrail Railroad was formerly named the Erie Lackawanna Railroad and this amendment thus updates the description to reflect that name change. The boundary line will then run south to the 6-mile radius of LGA VORJDME and the west bank of the Hudson River. The remainder of the description will not require revisions. Accordingly. since this action does not involve a change in the actual dimensions, configuration. or operating reeJmnents of airspace, notice andpublic procedure. under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are necessary. The FAA had determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore-(1 is not a \"major rule\" under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a \"significant rule\" 'under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Parole Commission adopted a procedural rule relating-to the consideration of recorded audio and visual material (including audio and video tapes) at parole hearings. The rule requires the submission of recorded audio and visual material prior to the hearing for review and summarization. The rule notes that the Commission will normally consider only verbal and written evidence at hearings but that recorded audio and visual material will be considered if there is no adequate substitute to enable the Commission to make a finding of fact pursuant to 28 CFR 2.19(c). EFFECTIVE DATE: April 29, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard Preston, Office of General Counsel, 5550 Friendship Boulevard, Chevy Chase, Maryland 20815, telephone (301) 492-5959. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The increased frequency with which recorded audio and visual material has been presented for review at parole hearings requires the Commission to establish a procedural rule to govern the consideration of such material. The procedural rule that follows spells out the heretofore unwritten policy of the Commission concerning the submission of recorded audio and visual material. Since the vast majority of hearings areconducted at institutions where time and equipment limit the presentation of recorded audio and visual material, the Commission prefers to consider only verbal and written evidence (e.g., affidavits as opposed to videotaped statements) at hearings. However, recorded material has occasionally been admitted under the \"best evidence\" rule in parole revocation hearings and prisoners have sometimes presented recorded material for which no adequate substitute could have been found. The Commission recognizes the value of this material in assisting it in making findings of fact and will continue to consider admitting this type of evidence in all cases as long as it is submitted prior to the hearing for review. However, recorded material will only be reviewed at the hearing if the Commission finds that written or oral evidence is either not available, or inadequate to permit a finding of fact pursuant to 28 CFR 2.19(c). For example, the transcript of a videotaped cross-examination of a witness who is not deceased, would not be an adequate substitute for the tape itself if the Commission found that a credibility determination was essential. Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Statement.. The U.S. Parole Commission has determined that this rule is not a major rule within the meaning of Executive Order 12291. This rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities, within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

[FR Dec. 93-7167 Filed 3-29-93; 8:45 am] BILUNG CODE 4410-01-4-P DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR Part 1910 Control of Hazardous Energy Sources (Lockout/Tagout) AGENCY: Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Labor. ACTION: Final rule; supplemental statement of reasons. SUMMARY: On September 1, 1989, OSHA promulgated a final standard entitled \"Control of Hazardous Energy Sources (LockoutITagout),\" to protect workers from releases of hazardous energy during servicing or maintenance of machines and equipment. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in UAW v. OSHA, 938 F.2d 1310, remanded the lockout/tagout standard to OSHA for further consideration on three issues: first, the criteria used by OSHA in setting safety standards under section 3(8) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the OSH Act); second, justification for the final rule's preference for lockout over tagout; and third, OSHA's determination that the final rule should apply to all general industry workplaces in which hazardous servicing and maintenance operations take place. OSHA has determined that there are clear and' definitive criteria which guide and limit the Agency's discretion in establishing safety standards under the OSH Act. In applying these criteria to the lockout/ tagout standard, OSHA has determined that the standard complies with the statutory criteria. In addition, on the second remand issue, involving the standard's preference for locks over tags, OSHA has determined that such a preference is warranted by the fact that lock-based safety programs are less susceptible to human error and thus can be expected to save more lives and prevent more injuries than tag-based Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 1 Rules and Regulations programs. On the third remand issue, OSHA reaffirms and further explains its reasons for applying the standard throughout general industry. Finally, the Agency discusses two approaches to regulatory decision-making, formal cost- benefit analysis and risk-risk analysis, which the court suggested in its opinion as possible alternatives for OSHA to consider in setting safety standards. DATES: The final rule became effective January 2, 1990. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. James F. Foster, OSHA, U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Information and Consumer Affairs, room N-3647, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210; telephone: (202) 219-8151. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Introduction On September 1, 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) promulgated a final rule, entitled \"Control of Hazardous Energy Sources (Lockout/ Tagout),\" to protect workers against hazardous energy release during the maintenance and servicing of machines or equipment. 54 FR 36644, codified at 29 CFR 1910.147. The \"lockout/tagout\" standard \"covers the servicing and maintenance of machines and equipment in which the unexpected energization or startup of the machines or equipment, or release of stored energy could cause injury to employees.\" 29 CFR 1910.147(a)(1)(i) (emphasis in original), The standard requires employers to develop and implement energy control programs that\"ensure that before any employee performs any servicing or maintenance on a machine or equipment where the unexpected energizing, startup or release of stored energy could occur and cause injury, the machine or equipment shall be isolated from the energy source, and rendered inoperative.\" 29 CFR 1910.147(cX1). OSHA estimated that the standard would prevent approximately 122 fatalities, 28,400 lost workday injuries, and 31,900 non-lost workday injuries each year. 54 FR at 36652/3. OSHA found that the standard would reduce a significant risk of harm to workers and that it would be feasible to implement. Id. at 36684--85. Parties representing both labor and industry filed petitions for review of the standard in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The court rejected many of the challenges raised to the standard but remanded for OSHA to further explain its reasoning on several issues. UAWv. OSHA, 938' F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991). The principaL remand issue concernsthe criteria OSHA uses when it sets safety standards. Under section 3(8) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the OSH Act), such standards must be \"reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.\" In response to the National Association of Manufacturers' (NAM) argument that this statutory language is unconstitutionally broad, the court concluded that \"the interpretation offered by the Secretary is, in light of nondelegation principles, so broad as to be unreasonable.\" UAW v. OSHA, 938 F.2d at 1310. However, the court held that at least one limiting interpretation--cost-benefit analysis-- would avoid the overbreadth problem. In addition, the court stated that \"there may be other interpretations that conform to nondelegation principles.\" Id. at 1321. Accordingly, the court remanded to OSHA to identify \"intelligible principleisi that could control its discretion under \u00a7 3(8) * * *.\" Id. at 1325. The second remand issue involves what NAM contended was a rulemaking decision by OSHA that required a substantial expenditure to produce little or no benefit. NAM's contention involved a change from the proposed standard, which allowed an unrestricted lockout-tagout option, to the final rule, which prefers lockout (unless equipment is unlockable) but permits employers with lockable equipment to use tagout programs if they can demonstrate that such programs provide a level of safety equivalent to lockout. According to the court, \"[NAM] adduces data suggesting that the incremental safety gains from universal lockout were modest (averting 42 injuries, of which fully 26 would not even involve a lost day of work) and the incremental cost not immaterial ($2.3 million in the first year and $400,000 annually thereafter).\" 938 F.2d at 1323-24. The court required OSHA to address NAM's argument on remand. The final remand issue involves' OSHA's decision to apply the standard in all general industry workplaces in which hazardous servicing and maintenance operations take place. NAM contended that OSHA should have made industry-by-industry risk findings and only appliethe standard to those industries for which it made specific findings of significant risk. The court's remand order requires OSHA \"to explain its decision to impose lockout/ tagont even where the risk appears to be diminutive or zero.\" 938 F.2d at 1325. In response to the court's decision, OSHA has carefully reexamined the criteria it uses to set safety standardsand has reevaluated the lockout/tagout standard in light of those criteria. OSHA interprets the Act as requiring safety standards to meet the following criteria. A safety standard must substantially reduce a significant risk of material harm; the standard must be technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures being required already exist, can be brought into existence with availabletochnology, or can be created with technology that can reasonably be developed; the standard must be economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; the standard must achieve its regulatory goals in the most cost-effective manner, the standard must be at least as protective as existing national consensus standards; and the standard must be supported by the evidence in the rulemaking record and be consistent with prior agency action. These criteria shape and limit the agency's safety rulemaking discretion. OSHA believes this interpretation of the Act responds to the court's constitutional concern and establishes that the Act does not delegate excessive discretionary authority to OSHA. OSHA applied this interpretation in developing the lockonut/tagout standard. Later in this section, the agency explains how the standard conforms to each criterion. OSHA has also reevaluated its rulemaking decisions on the two other issues remanded by the court and reaffirms those decisions. As discussed in section II, the standard's preference for locks over tags is warranted by the fact that lock-based safety programs are less susceptible to human error and thus can be expected to save more lives and avoid more injuries than tag-based programs. Section I11 explains OSHA's reasons for applying the standard in all general Industry workplaces in which hazardous servicing operations take place even though available injury data showed a wide range of accident rates for different industrial sectors. OSHA has also evaluated two approaches to regulatory decision- making, formal cost-benefit analysis and risk-risk analysis, that are discussed in the opinion as possible interpretations of section 3(8). As described in section IV, OSHA already performs an extensive analysis, which includes estimations of compliance costs and of deaths and injuries prevented, when promulgating a standard. Moreover, the application of the statutory criteria set forth in section I assures that the agency's discretion is confined and that the standard produces substantial safpty benefits at a reasonable cost. Given this reality, the16613 16614 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations agency believes that formal cost-benefit analysis is not needed to meet the court's constitutional concerns. With respect to risk-risk analysis, OSHA has determined that study of risk-risk theory's empirical basis is needed before the theory can be evaluated for application in the OSHA rulemaking context. I. The Overbroad Delegation Issue Section 3(8) if the OSH Act requires that standards be \"reasonably necessary or appropriate\" to safe or healthful employment: The term \"occupational safety and health standard\" means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment. In UAW v. OSHA, the court noted that the Supreme Court's Benzene decision had interpreted the \"reasonably necessary or appropriate\" language of section 3(8) to require that OSHA find, before issuing any standard, that a significant risk of harm existed and that the standard would materially reduce that risk. IUD v. API, 448 U.S. 607, 646 (1980). Standards that regulate toxic materials or harmful physical agents (\"health\" standards) must also meet criteria in section 6(b)(5) of the Act. That section requires, \"to the xtent feasible * * * that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure tb the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life.\" OSHA has interpreted section 6(b)(5) to mean that health standards must eliminate all significant risk to the extent it is feasible to do so. The Supreme Court upheld that interpretation of section 6(b)(5) In the Cotton Dust case. ATM v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490 (1981). OSHA interprets section 6(b)(5) to apply only to health standards and not safety standards, such as the lockout/ tagout standard. See UAWv. OSHA, 938 F.2d at 1316. Without the constraint of section 6(b)(5), the court believed that the OSH Act did not limit OSHA's safety rulemaking authority sufficiently' to comply with the constitutional requirement that delegations of legislative authority not be overbroad. The court also concluded that OSHA's interpretation that safety standards must be technologically and economically feasible did not adequately narrow the agency's discretion because, as it understood OSHA's position, OSHA viewed feasibility of safety standards\"only as a ceiling, and not, as for toxics,as a floor.\" Id. at 1317. Thus, the court thought that OSHA's interpretation of section 3(8) permitted the agency, \"once significant risk is found, to require precautions that take the industry to the verge of economic ruin * * * or to do nothing at all.\" Id. The court viewed OSHA as claiming \"untrammelled power to dictate the vitality and even survival of whatever segments of American business it might choose,\" id. at 1318, as leaving \"opportunities for dangerous favoritism,\" id., and as ermitting imposition of compliance urdens \"even where the risk appears to be diminutive or zero.\" Id. at 1325. Having found OSHA's interpretation unreasonable, the court examined whether any limiting interpretation of the Act would narrow the agency's discretion sufficiently to satisfy the nondelegation doctrine. The court concluded that cost-benefit analysis would be an acceptable limiting interpretation of section 3(8) without specifying any particular form of that methodology. The court also concluded that \"there may be other interpretations that conform to nondelegation principles.\" Id. at 1321. Since at least one possible interpretation would satisfy the Constitution, the court remanded for OSHA to either adopt that interpretation or to adopt another interpretation that constrained its safety rulemaking discretion sufficiently. In response to the court's opinion, OSHA has carefully examined the statutory criteria that apply to safety standards. The agency has paid particular attention to the court's concern that OSHA's interpretation of the statute must not permit the agency free rein to push industries to the \"verge of financial ruin\" or to do \"nothing at all\" in the face of a significant risk to worker safety. OSHA certainly did not intend to claim such unfettered authority in the lockout/tagout rulemaking. The preamble to the rule, however, did not contain an explanation of the statutory criteria that apply to safety standards. In light of the court's opinion, OSHA is now setting forth its interpretation of the statutory standards that govern safety rules. The agency construes the OSH Act as establishing a number of clear principles that limit and guide OSHA's exercise of authority in standards proceedings. OSHA believes that its construction responds to the court's constitutional concerns and establishes that the Act does not vest excessive discretion in the agency. In issuing a standard, OSHA must find that: (1) The standard will substantially reduce a significant risk of material harm;(2) Compliance is technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures being required all Elady exist, can be brought into existence with available technology, or can. be created with technology that can reasonably be developed; (3) Compliance is economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; (4) The standard employs the most cost-effective protective measures capable of reducing or eliminating significant risk. In addition: (5) Under section 6(b)(8) of the OSH Act, any OSHA standard that differs from an existing national consensus standard must effectuate the Act's objectives better than the national consensus standard. Finally, (6) Standards must be supported by the evidence in the rulemaking record and be consistent with prior agency practice or supported by some justification for departing from that practice. These constraints apply to both safety and health rulemaking. The two types of rules differ, however, in that section 6(b)(5) mandates that health rules be as protective as possible: Once significant risk is found, the standard must eliminate that risk to the extent it is technologically and economically feasible to do so. Because section 6(b)(5) does not govern safety rules, OSHA retains more discretion to shape safety standards than health standards. That does not mean, however, that OSHA's discretion to issue safety standards is unconfined. OSHA's discretion is confined at the ceiling because safety standards cannot require of employers more than is feasible. The court thought there was an overbreadth problem because it understood OSHA to claim unbridled discretion below the ceiling to regulate with any degree of stringency it pleased and even to do \"nothing at all\" in the face of a significant risk toemployee safety. QSHA does not interpret the OSH Act to give it such a wide range of discretion. In setting safety standards, OSHA must act consistently with the Act's overriding purpose, which is to provide a high degree of employee protection. This purpose is evident from a number of statutory provisions. Section 2(b) of the OSH Act expresses the congressional \"purpose and policy * * * to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe * * * working conditions * .\" Section 6(a), which applied during the first two years after the Act became Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations effective, required that when OSHA adopted existing federal and consensus standards the agency must \"promulgate the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees\" in the event of any conflict. Section 6(b)(8) provides that when promulgating permanent safety or health standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, OSHA must explain \"why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard.\" Since the key purpose of the Act is worker protection, a standard that differs from a national consensus standard will only better effectuate the Act's purposes if it is. more protective. In addition, the OSH Act's \"general duty\" clause, section 5(a)(1), requires each employer to \"furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing death or serious physical harm to his employees.\" These and other statutory provisions make clear that the Act's purpose is to achieve a high degree of worker protection, and OSHA develops standards with that purpose in mind. The agency does not believe that the Act gives it the discretion to do \"nothing at all\" if it finds a significant risk to worker safety in a rulemaking proceeding. The notice-and-comment rulemaking process established by the Act assures that the agency is made aware of relevant evidence, of regulatory alternatives, and of the likely consequences of various courses of action. After issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, OSHA holds hearings and affords all interested persons an opportunity to submit written evidence. OSHA invariably receives comments that cover the entire spectrum of interests affected by the standard and finds those comments very useful in developing the final standard. The agency evaluates all comments that are submitted and explains the basis for accepting or rejecting all major suggestions for modifications to the proposed standard. The agency must support all of its findings with evidence in the rulemaking record. The need to explain and support its rulemaking decisions in the face of contrary evidence and argument assures that OSHA's rulemaking decisions conform to the statute's protective purpose while avoiding regulatory extremes. Another constraint on OSHA's rulemaking discretion is that significant departures from prior practice must be justified. OSHA's history of safety rulemaking offers no basis for believing that the agency is inclined to regulatoryextremes. OSHA has promulgated numerous safety standards, the vast majority of which Were not even challenged and none of which could seriously be described as relying on discretion to impose bankruptcy- threatening costs for minimal benefit or of otherwise threatening the vitality or existence of any industrial sector. The policies that have evolved during OSHA's 21-year history of rulemaking activity limit OSHA's discretion in future rulemakings. It is certainly true that any individual OSHA standard may Impose significant costs on industry. Congress decided, however, that affordable costs of providing safe and healthful workplaces are necessary costs of doing business. As the Supreme Court has pointed out: Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety as a cost of doing business. * * * Indeed, Congress thought that the financial costs of health and safety problems in the workplace were as large as or larger than the financial costs of eliminating these problems. ATMIv. Donovan, 452 U.S. at 519-522 (emphasis in original). The legislative history of the Act also demonstrates that Congress knew that some employers would pass compliance costs though to their customers but thought that price increases were justified by the need to achieve safe and healthful workplaces. \"We know the costs would be put into consumer goods but that is the price we should pay for the 80 million workers in America.\" S. - Rep. No. (1970), reprinted in Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Legislative History of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, (Committee Print 1971) (\"Leg. Hist.\") at 444 (Senator Yarborough). \"Of course, it will cost a little more per item to produce a washing machine. Those of us who use washing machines will pay for the increased cost, but it is worth it, to stop the terrible death and injury rate in this country.\" Id. at 324; see also 510-511, 517. Congress also believed that the nation as a whole would receive tangible benefits from the avoidance of workplace injuries and illnesses: ITJhe vitality of the Nation's economy will be enhanced by the greater productivity realized through saved lives and useful years of labor. When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, It is he and his family who suffer the most immediate and personal loss. However, that.tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupationalaccidents and disease, over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year 11970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product Is estimated to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation and medical expenses. * * * Only through a comprehensive approach can we hope to effect a significant reduction in these job death and casualty figures. Id. at 518-19 (Senator Cranston). OSHA recognized, however, that the costs an OSHA standard imposes must not exceed the limits of economic feasibility. The UAWv. OSHA court, lacking a discussion of the agency's interpretation of \"economic feasibility\" in the lockout/tagout preamble, inferred that the agency equates those limits with \"the verge of economic ruin.\" 938 F.2d at 1317. However, OSHA does not take such a draconian view of economic feasibility under the OSH Act. The Supreme Court has approved OSHA's view that a standard that permits an industry to \"maintain long-term profitability and competitiveness\" is economically feasible. ATMI v. Donovan, 452 U.S. at 530 n. 55. Similarly, the D.C. Circuit has stated that \"a standard is economically feasible if the cost of compliance does not threaten the 'competitive structure or posture' of the industry.\" National Cottonseed Prods. Aqs'n v. Brock, 825 F.2d 482, 487 (D.C. Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1020 (1988), quoting IUD v. Hodgson, 499 F.2d 467,478 (D.C. Cir. 1974). In specific rulemakings, OSHA has placed the line of economic feasibility considerably below industry- wide economic distress or bankruptcy. See for example, 43 FR 27360 (June 23, 1978) (proposed 200 pg/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise serious ossibility of industry-wide bankruptcy, ut impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring reconstruction of 90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200 pg/m3 level was not feasible for weaving and that 750 pg/m3 was all that could reasonably be required). See also 54 FR 29245-46 (July 11,1989) and AISI v. OSHA, 939 F.2d 975, 1003 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (OSHA raised engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous foundries to avoid the possibility of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole could have survived the loss of small firms.) A standard that is economically feasible may well have a disparate impact on different firms within an industry. A company with older, less efficient, and less safe machines and equipment will face heavier compliance16615 16616 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations costs than a competitor that is more efficient or that uses the latest technology. Indeed, for such a company, the cost of retrofitting existing machines in order to comply with OSHA standards may exceed the cost of relacing those machines. However, it is ly consistent with congressional intent for standards to force employers with inefficient and unsafe workplaces to either modernize their operations, becoming safe and efficient competitors, or go out of business. The D.C. Circuit has stated: It would appear to be consistent with the purposes of the Act to envisage the economic demise of an employer who has lagged behind the rest of the industry in protecting the health and safety of employees and is consequently financially unable to comply with new standards as quickly as other employers. IUD v. Hodgson, 499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974). Moreover, Congress recognized that a standard that applies uniformly to all employers in an industry will have the beneficial effect of eliminating any competitive advantage that one employer might gain by cutting corners on safety and health. Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201. Consistent with Congress' intent, OSHA views an economically feasible standard as one that-might push industry laggards, but not safety-conscious employers or the industry as a whole, to the \"verge of economic ruin.\" To summarize, an OSHA safety standard must: (1) materially reduce a significant risk to workers; (2) be both technologically and (3) economically feasible to implement; (4) be cost- effective; (5) effectuate the OSH Act's goals at least as well as any national consensus standard that applies to the same hazard; (6) adequately respond to any contrary evidence and argument in the rulemaking record; and (7) be consistent with past rulemaking policies except to the extent that OSHA justifies a departure from those policies. OSHA believes that these constraints assure that OSHA safety standards are highly protective to workers without imposing an undue burden on employers. The requirement that standards reduce a significant risk at a cost and in a manner that is feasible and cost-effective assures that, even without a formal cost-benefit analysis, OSHA standards \"produce a benefit the costs of which are not unreasonable.\" NGFA v. OSHA, 866 F.2d 717, 733 (5th Cir. 1989). OSHA believes that this interpretation effectuates the Act's purposes and resolves the constitutional concerns that animated the court's remand. In short, OSHA is affirming that its discretion in safety rulemakings is limited, and thatthe Act establishes clear criteria to guide the agency's exercise of its authority. The lockout/tagout standard illustrates how the statutory constraints operate in practice. To assess the risk presented by hazardous energy, OSHA examined accident data collected by a number of groups, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and OSHA Itself. See 54 FR at 36648-52. OSHA's contractor, the Eastern Research Group (ERG), estimated that inadequate lockout/tagout procedures led to 2% of all workplace injuries and 7.1% of fatalities. From ERG's data, OSHA estimated that in 1984 workers suffered 144 fatal injuries, 33,432 lost workday injuries, and 37,561 non-lost workday injuries due to inadequate lockout/ tagout programs. Moreover, ERG had found that lockout/tagout injuries tended to be significantly more severe than other workplace injuries, resulting in 24 lost workdays as compared to 16 lost workdays for the average lost-time occupational Injury. Based on this evidence, OSHA determined \"that the failure to control hazardous energy results in a significant risk to employees,\" 54 FR at 36684. OSHA also analyzed the injury reports to determine the underlying causes of lockout/tagout accidents and to develop measures to prevent similar occurrences. Accident data and other evidence showed that employees are injured or killed by uncontrolled energy during servicing/maintenance of industrial equipment (regardless of industrial sector, establishment size, or equipment type) due to five factors: Failure to stop the machine or equipment, failure to disconnect the machine or equipment from the power source before performing service or maintenance, failure to dissipate residual energy, inadvertent reactivation of equipment, or failure to clear all necessary areas before reactivation. The evidence also showed that the hazard could be substantially reduced if employers were required to take four steps: (1) Evaluate equipment and servicing practices and develop safe procedures; (2) Use locks or tags to limit worker ability to by-pass or overlook safety procedures; (3) Train workers in implementation of the safety program; and (4) Enforce the safety rules through monitoring and discipline. 29 CFR 1910.147(c)(4); (c)(7)(i)-(ii);(c)(6)(i); (c)(7Xiii); (c)(4)(ii). OSHA estimated that compliance with four-part safety program would prevent 85% of lockout/tagout relatedaccidents. Thus, the standard was estimated to prevent approximately 122 fatalities, 28,416 lost workday injuries, and 31,926 non-lost workday injuries annually. OSHA judged this to be a substantial reduction of risk. OSHA concluded that the standard is technologically feasible because its requirements-locks, tags, procedures, training, periodic inspections, and implementation--are devices and practices already in existence; OSHA found that 90 percent of large firms, 65 percent of medium-sized firms, 45 percent of small firms, and 20 percent of very small firms in high-impact industries already use lockout/tagout procedures. Ex. 71, \"Regulatory Impact Analysis\" (RIA), pp. IV-3, 4. To assess economic feasibility, the standard's estimated costs were compared to the gross and net income of affected establishments. Taking into account all costs, including purchase of materials such as locks and tags, modification of equipment and work practices, implementation, planning, administration, training, and periodic inspections, the costs attributable to the standard would total $214.3 million in the first year and $135.4 million in subsequent years. OSHA broke down these total figures into the costs that would be incurred by establishments of different sizes in both high- and low- impact industries. RIA, pp. VI-46, 47. For example, OSHA found that first-year compliance costs for high-impact firms would range from $120 for very small firms to $28,172 for large ones. OSHA concluded that when measured against operating costs and net income, these costs are negligible. On average, costs would not exceed 0.05% of operating costs or 2.2% of net income for the first year, or 0.03% of operating costs or 0.6- 1.5% of net income annually. Based on these figures, OSHA concluded that the standard would not have a significant impact on the financial structure or stability of any size manufacturing firm. RIA, p. VII-5. The agency further noted that the firms currently in compliance were able to compete successfully with those that were not, indicating that the net economic costs of lockout/tagout procedures would not be significant. OSHA assured that the standard would be cost-effective in.a number of ways. Having found that lockout would generally be safer than tagout, OSHA required that any new, overhauled, or modified equipment be equipped with lockout-capable energy isolating devices, which are readily available at no extra cost compared to unlockable devices. This provision improves worker protection, at no cost to employers, by providing an increasing Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations capability for employers to use lockout rather than tagout procedures. The standard is also cost-effective in excluding from coverage cord-and-plug connected equIpment for which adequate protection against inadvertent energization can be obtained by unplugging the equipment and maintaining the plug under the exclusive controlof the servicing worker. In addition, the standard is written in performance-oriented language that spells out general obligations but leaves employers free to achieve the regulatory goal at the lowest cost for each workplace. In particular, the standard permits employers to choose locks, tags, or a combination of both based on cost considerations, as long as the choice achieves the requisite level of safety. OSHA found that the standard would not have a disproportionate impact on small business. Indeed, small businesses would tend to experience less rather than more proportional impact because the standard exempts the cord-and-plug connected equipment that OSHA's contractor found is likely to be used in smaller establishments to perform the same types of tasks as manufacturing- type equipment in the largest establishments. Ex. 3-15, p. 3-134; RIA, p. VI-16. Moreover, OSHA's finding that the standard would have a negligible financial impact on all affected firms assures that the standard will not eliminate or threaten the vitality of any business segment. The rulemaking process assured that OSHA was made aware of regulatory problems and alternatives, enabling the agency to shape the rule to accommodate competing interests. For example, numerous commenters objected to the proposed standard's placement of locks and tags on an equal plane, saying that tags, but not locks, \"could be carelessly bypassed without major effort.\" 54 FR at 36654. Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA determined that \"the use of lockout devices will provide employees with a more secure and more effective means of assuring that equipment will not be reenergized while they are working on it.\" 54 FR at 36655. However, some employers reported that they had used tags successfully, with one company presenting evidence that it had suffered only one lost-time accident that was marginally related to the use of tags in over 488 million man-hours of work. This company suggested that the key to safety lay not in the use of a specific device but in \"good procedures and careful training combined with assurance of accountability.\" 54 FR at 36654. In light of the entire record,OSHA decided that the final standard should prefer the uso of lockout when equipment is lockable but permit the use of tagout where the employer can \"demonstrate that the tagout program will provide a level of safety equivalent to that obtained by using a lockout program.\" 29 CFR 1910.147(c)(3)(i). Thus, the rulemaking process led to a standard that assures employee protection while giving employers flexibility in choosing how to provide that protection. OSHA's evaluation of the rulemaking record resulted in other decisions that gave industry flexibility to meet the standard's protective goals. These decisions include: (1) Not requiring immediate replacement of equipment that is incapable of being locked with lockable equipment; (2- An exemption for minor servicing activities that are routine, repetitive and Integral to the production operation (29 CFR 1910.147(a)(2)(ii) (Note)); (3) An exception to the requirement that an employer document the required energy controlprocedure when certain conditions exist (29 CFR 1910.147(c)(4)(i) (Note)); and (4) Alternative requirements to the\"one person, one lock\" principle for complex group operations (29 CFR 1910.147(f)(3)(i)). The rulemaking process produced a standard whose cost per life saved is clearly reasonable. Dividing the standard's total annual cost of $214 million for the first year and $135 million for subsequent years by the 122 fatalities the standard will avoid annually yields a cost per life saved of between one and two million dollars. This calculation, it should be noted, overstates the standard's cost per life saved, for it does not reflect savings due to accidents avoided or attribute any of the standard's costs to the non-fatal accidents avoided. Moreover, the standard clearly does not impose excessive burdens on employers. The only equipment employers must purchase consists of inexpensive devices such as locks, chains, and tags. The main costs will be for developing lockout/tagout procedures, changing work practices to conform to those procedures, training employees to assure that the procedures are properly implemented, and conducting periodic inspections to assure continued effectiveness of the program. Such administrative and training costs are the type of costs businesses typically incur for a variety of reasons and will obviously not be overly burdensome. Indeed, the fact that many employers voluntarily Implemented effectivelockout/tagout programs even before the standard was issued demonstrates that compliance will not be unreasonably burdensome. The costs of lockout/tagout are consistent with other OSHA safety standards. OSHA's excavation standard, for example, eliminates 74 deaths and over 800 lost workday injuries. annually. at a cost of about $306 million, making the cost per life saved about $4.1 million. 54 FR 45954 (Oct. 31, 1989). OSHA's Grain Handling Facilities standard eliminates 18 deaths and 394 injuries annually at a total net cost of $5.9 to $33.4 million, for a cost-per-life- saved between $0.33 and $1.9 million. 52 FR 49622 (Dec. 31, 1991). The Process Safety Management standard is estimated to prevent 132 fatalities and 767 injuries/illnesses annually in years 1-5 and 264 fatalities and 1534 injuries/ illnesses in years 6-10. 57 FR 6402 (Feb. 24, 1992). The compliance costs to achieve these benefits would be $888.7 million in years 1-5 and $405.8 million in years 6-10. Id. at 6401. Thus, the cost per life saved would be $6.7 million in years 1-5, would decline to $1.5 million in years 6-10, and would average $3.3 million over the ten-year period. Finally, the lockoutltagout standard is consistent with section 6(b)(8), which requires that OSHA standards, when they differ substantially from an existing national consensus standard, better effectuate the Act's purpose. The proposed lockout/tagout standard was based on a national consensus standard, ANSI Z244.1-1982, \"American National Standard for Personnel Protection- Lockout/Tagout of Energy Sources- Minimum Safety Requirements.\" All of the protective provisions in the final standard are an outgrowth of the proposal and the ANSI standard. The main difference between the two is that the ANSI standard, like the standard OSHA proposed, permitted an unrestricted use of lockout or tagout. As described earlier, OSHA changed to a lockout preference in the final standard because the rulemaking record showed that it was more protective. Since the key purpose of the Act is worker protection, this change dearly effectuated the Act's objective. In addition, OSHA concluded that issuance of the lockout/tagout standard better effectuates the Act than sole reliance on 13 national consensus and established federal standards pertaining to equipment maintenance that OSHA summarily adopted in 1971 but whose scope was limited and whose efficacy was impaired by inconsistencies between different equipment and industries and by inadequate protective requirements.16617 16618 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations IL The Lockout Preference Issue The proposed standard afforded employers the option of either locking or tagging energy sources to prevent machines or equipment from being energized while employees perform servicing or maintenance. However, the rulemaking record showed that locks were generally more effective than tags at preventing inadvertent reenergization. When a maintenance worker applies a lock properly, reenergization of the equipment is absolutely precluded until the lock is removed. A tag only provides a warning and does not physically prevent another worker from ignoring the warning and energizing the equipment prematurely. Moreover, tags can become detached or damaged by either environmental conditions or by movement of materials, equipment, and personnel through the workplace. A number of parties to the rulemaking proceeding pointed to these inherent limitations of tags in their comments. Some commenters proposed that the final standard require employers to use lockout exclusively. OSHA rejected the suggestion that the standard mandate universal lockout for two reasons. First, some energy control devices currently in use are incapable of being locked out, and OSHA found insufficient evidence to show that it would be feasible to immediately replace such devices with lockable ones. Therefore, at a minimum the standard had to permit employers with unlockable equipment to use tagout. Second, some employers provided evidence that they had successfully implemented highly protective tagout programs. OSHA decided that employers with demonstrably successful tagout programs should be permitted to continue to use those programs. To minimize safety hazards from the Inherent limitations of tags while still permitting tagout where it is necessary or adequate, OSHA changed the final standard in three ways. First, the standard requires employers who use tagout to train employees in the limitations of tags and in specific precautions that must be taken to minimize the possibility that human error will render the tags ineffective. Tagout training must include the following: (A) Tags are essentially warning devices affixed to energy isolating devices, and do not provide the physical restraint on those devices that is provided by a lock. (B) When a tag is attached to an energy Isolating means, it is not to be removed without authorization of the authorized erson responsible for it, and it is never to bypassed, ignored, or otherwise defeated.(C) Tags must be legible and understandable by all authorized employees, and all other employees whose work operations are or may be in the area, in order to be effective. (D) Tags and their means of attachment must be made of materials which will withstand the environmental conditions encountered in the workplace. (E) Tags may evoke a false sense of security, and their meaning needs to be understood as part of the overall energy control program. (F) Tags must be securely attached to energy isolating devices so that they cannot be inadvertently or accidentally detached during use. 29 CFR 1910.147(c)(7)(ii). Second, the final standard requires employers with lockable equipment to use lockout unless the employer is able to show that the use of tagout will provide a level of safety equal to that of a lockout program. 29 CFR 1910.147(c)(3). This provision was specifically designed to permit those employers who had already developed and implemented effective tagout procedures to continue to use those procedures. Although all employers were afforded this option, OSHA recognized that few employers were likely to choose it. For employers with lockable equipment who had not already developed successful tagout programs, the cost of a lockout program will b~e lower than tagout; equipment costs are roughly equal and tagout involves additional costs for the tagout- limitation training that must be offered and for other steps employers must take to assure that tagout is as effective as lockout. The lower cost and generally greater effectiveness of lockout would give employers strong incentives to choose that option. The third change requires that newly installed machines or equipment, and machines or equipment that are replaced or undergo major repair, must be equipped with lockable energy isolating devices. 29 CFR 1910.147(c)(2)(iii). By requiring that lockable equipment replace unlockable equipment in the ordinary course of industrial modernization, this provision will result in a future increase in the use of lockout instead of tagout. The provision imposes no cost on employers. because lockable energy isolating devices are readily available and are no more expensive than unlockable ones. RIA P. VI-2o.NAM argued to the court that OSHA failed to justify the provision that requires employers to use lockout unless they can demonstrate that their use of tagout provides a level of safety equal to lockout. NAM contended that the change from the unrestrictedlockout-tagout option in the proposed rule to the lockout preference in the final rule provided little additional protection while imposing significant additional cost. NAM suggested to the court that the change would avert only 42 injuries annually, of which 26 would not even involve a lost day of work, at a cost of $2.3 million in the first year and $400,000 annually thereafter. 938 F.2d at 1323-24. In its retnand order, the court instructed OSHA to reevaluate the lockout preference provision in light of the figures offered by NAM. OSHA has reevaluated the lockout preference provision as well as the other changes that OSHA made to the final standard in light of its finding that lockout is more protective than tagout. The agency reaffirms its finding that lockout is a superior means of protection. Moreover, OSHA concludes that none of the changes impose costs that are not reasonably related to safety gains. Two of the provisions--the l out preference provision challenged by NAM and the requirement for .eventual installation of lockable energy isolating devices-produce safety gains at no cost to employers. The third provision-the requir6ment for specific tagout training--assures that employees involved in a tagout program understand the limitations of tags. This information is vital if tagout programs are to achieve an acceptable level of effectiveness..Under the lockout preference provision, which applies only to employers with lockable equipment, employers can freely use lockout. They can use tagout only if they can demonstrate an equal level of safety to lockout. For employers who use lockout, the final standard imposes no additional duties, and therefore no additional costs, over the proposed standard. Employers who choose tagout under the final standard will incur additional costs over the proposed standard: they must expand employee training to assure that employees are aware of the limitations of tagout and must take other steps to assure an equal level of effectiveness. But no employer with lockable equipment is required to incur these additional costs because all such employers may use the less costly lockout option. Hence, whatever additional costs are incurred by employers who choose tagout are not costs imposed by the standard but are costs incurred through their own choice. Moreover, by affording employers the option of using tagout, the standard expands employer choice and avoids imposing on those employers who have already developed successful tagout programs the costs of converting to Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations lockout. Thus, the lockout preference provision permits all employers to minimize their costs while assuring that workers are adequately protected. Although the lockout preference provision imposes no cost on employers, it will produce safety benefits to employees by increasing the use of inherently more protective lockout procedures. The provision gives employers a financial incentive to use lockout by imposing additional safety measures, and associated higher costs, on employers with lockable equipment who choose to use tagout. Moreover, the lockout preference provision encourages use of lockout by putting employers on notice that lockout is generally the more effective means of protection. Allowing an unrestricted lockoutltagout option, as the proposed standard did, would imply that OSHA considered both means of protection to be equally effective and would induce some employers to choose the less protective tagout option. The provision requiring installation of lockable energy isolating devices also produces safety gains for employees at no cost to employers. The provision does not require employers to retrofit existing equipment but only to install lockable devices when they either install new equipment or when equipment undergoes major repair or replacement. Lockable energy isolating devices are readily available at no extra cost. RIA, p. VI-20. Thus, the provision assures an increase, over time, in the percentage of equipment that is lockable while avoiding costs on employers for converting to lockable equipment. In turn, it assures a gradual increase in the use of lockout, with a corresponding increase in worker protection due to the safety advantages of lockout. Unlike the lockout preference and lockable-device provisions, the provision on tagout-limitation training imposes costs on employers. In its Regulatory Impact Analysis, OSHA attempted to quantify the impact of tagout-limitation training based on the assumption that 15 minutes would need to be added to general energy control training to train each worker involved with tagout procedures on the specific points listed in the standard. This training increment would amount to $7.2 million in the first year of the standard and would sharply decline thereafter, since the standard requires retraining only when there is a change in job assignments, equipment, or procedures, or when the employer has reason to believe that employee knowledge of energy control procedures is inadequate. RIA, pp. VI-43, VI-45. It is clear, however, that the actual cost of tagout-limitation training will be less.Fifteen additional minutes will rarely be necessary, since the basic training required by the standard would necessitate. training in the characteristics and proper use of tags by employers who rely on tags. The - specific items of tagout-limitation training required by the final standard simply clarify this already-existing duty and assure that all employees involved in tagout programs are taught certain specific points that are vital to the safe use of tags. Even in establishments where 15 additional minutes are used. the additional time and cost represent a small percentage of total training costs even as they assure a critical step in worker understanding. OSHA believes that such training is a minimum step that employers must take to assure that tagout programs are sufficiently protective and is entirely consonant with cost. OSHA has examined the figures NAM presented to the court purporting to show the injuries averted and additional costs of the lockout preference provision. For the following reasons, those injury and cost figures do not accurately reflect the effects of the lockout preference provision and do not in any sense offer a meaningful comparison between the proposed and final standards. NAM obtained the figures it presented to the court by comparing the Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis (Preliminary RIA) for the proposed standard to the RIA for the final standard. NAM subtracted the estimated safety benefits in the final RIA from those in the preliminary RIA to conclude that the final standard would prevent 16 more lost-workday and 26 more non-lost-workday injuries than the proposed. Similarly, NAM compared the cost of the final standard to that of the proposed by subtracting the cost figures reported in the respective RIAs. NAM argued to the court that the final standard differed from the proposed in two ways, first, by adding the lockout preference provision, second, by altering language to clarify an exception to the scope of the standard that applies when minor servicing takes place during normal production operations. NAM suggested that the difference in injury and cost estimates between the final and proposed standards had to be attributed to these two changes and that OSHA had therefore not justified the lockout preference provision. NAM's approach does not lead to an accurate comparison between the costs and benefits of the proposed and final standards. The differences in compliance costs and injuries averted between a proposed and final standardcannot be computed simply by comparing the Preliminary RIA with the final RIA. The final RIA, like the final standard itself, incorporates the information the agency gained during the rulemaking process. It is a more accurate assessment of the standard's regulatory impact and supplants the original RIA, which was necessarily based on less complete information. Indeed, the proposed standard explicitly noted that the figures that were being presented reflected a \"Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis.\" 53 FR at 15516. OSHA indicated that those figures were subject to change when it invited \"public comment on these estimates'for incorporation into the final RIA that will accompany the final rule.\" OSHA believes that the final RIA contains reasonable estimates of.the final standard's compliance costs and injuries averted, and OSHA relied on those figures in developing the final rule. The Preliminary RIA played no role in OSHA's ultimate rulemaking decisions. OSHA believes that the three changes to the final standard discussed in this section will produce substantial safety benefits by minimizing the use of tagout and upgrading tagout's effectiveness where it is used. Although all employers have the option of using tagout, virtually all employers with lockable equipment will choose to use lockout rather than expend the additional money and effort needed to develop tagout programs that are equally effective. OSHA anticipates that the employers who choose the tagout option will be those who already have extensive experience in developing and implementing tagout programs that are demonstrably protective. Employers with unlockable equipment will use tagout but must assure that employees are trained in tagout's limitations. OSHA estimated that the standard would prevent 85% of hazardous energy accidents. RIA, pp. VI-55, 57. In future years, as the percentage of lockable equipment rises to 100%, industry will move to full use of lockout (or equally effective tagout) procedures. OSHA estimated that full use of lockout would prevent 95% of accidents. RIA, p. VI- 50. Thus, the changes to the final standard will provide immediate safety benefits and those benefits will increase over time. OSHA is confident that the final standard will be significantly more protective than the proposed standard. Although OSHA originally estimated that the proposed standard, with an unrestricted lockout/tagout option, would be 85% effective, the evidence in the rulemaking record demonstrated1-6619 16620 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations that the rule would not reach that level of effectiveness because of the inherent limitations of tags. Therefore, in promulgating the final standard, OSHA readjusted its estimate of the proposal's effectiveness to 80%. RIA at V-5, VI-56. The estimated 5% higher effectiveness level of the final standard compared to the proposed translates into seven fewer deaths annually and a corresponding decrease in both lost-workday and non- lost-workday injuries. Having reevaluated the evidence on the relative effectiveness of lockout and tagout, OSHA reaffirms its finding that lockout is the preferred means of protection and concludes that the modifications to the final standard that reflect this finding are cost-effective ways of providing additional protection compared to the unrestricted lockout/tagout option in the proposed standard. III. The Disaggregation Issue The lockout/tagout standard applies in all \"general industry\" workplaces I in which hazards associated with the unexpected energization of machinery and equipment during servicing and maintenance occur. Lockout/tagout hazards are so pervasive and arise during such a wide variety of servicing and maintenance activities that any attempt to define the standard's scope by employer sector within general industry would result in the standard excluding some hazardous servicing and maintenance activities from coverage. To avoid having the standard be underinclusive while at the same time avoiding the imposition of compliance burdens where no hazard exists, OSHA drafted the standard to impose a compliance duty on employers only to the extent that hazardous servicing and maintenance activities in fact take place in their workplaces. In the rulemaking, OSHA examined records showing that accidents attributable to the failure to control hazardous energy had occurred throughout general industry. See 54 FR at 36646-52. NAM, pointing to evidence that the injury rate varied among industries, contended that OSHA should have eliminated from coverage industry sectors whose reported incident rates were low. The court remanded for OSHA \"to explain its I The standard does not cover construction. agriculture, and maritime'employment; installations under the exclusive control of electric utilities for the purpose of power generation, transmission and distribution; exposure to electrical hazards from work on. near, or with conductors or equipment in electric utilization installations; and oil and gas well drilling and servicing. OSHA determined that these industries and workplaces possessed unique characteristics that required further study. 54 FR 36657-36659.decision to impose lockout/tagout even where the risk appears to be diminutive or zero.\" 938 F.2d at.1325. OSHA has reevaluated the evidence on which NAM relied that shows variations in injury rates among industries. For the following reasons, OSHA does not believe that this evidence supports the suggestion that the standard should specifically exclude industrial sectors from coverage under the standard. As explained earlier, OSHA determined that without the protections of the lockout/tagout standard, workers face a significant risk of material harm every time they perform service or maintenance work on powered industrial equipment. 54 FR 36,647-48, 36652-53. OSHA also found that hazardous servicing occurs in almost all industrial sectors. Data gathered by ERG according to Standard Industrial Classification code group showed that all manufacturing industries, SICs 20 through 39, have high concentrations of equipment and servicing accidents. Seventeen low impact groups between SICs 40 and 79 have less equipment that requires servicing and lower accident rates than do the manufacturing sectors, but each does engage in some servicing and maintenance activities that require lockout/tagout protection. Railroads (SIC 40): servicing of climate- controlled railroad cars, machine-shop operations, and material handling equipment; Public Transit (SIC 41): servicing of vehicles, tire repair machines, hydraulic lifts and hoists: Trucking and Warehousing (SIC 42): servicing of conveyors, freight elevators, industrial trucks, forklifts, cranes; Water Transportation (SIC 44): servicing of engine room equipment, heating plants, cranes hoists; Transportation by Air (SIC 45): servicing of airplanes, helicopters, mobile passenger loading tunnels, baggage handling equipment such as conveyors, escalators, elevators; Pipelines Except Natural Gas (SIC 46): servicing of pipelines transporting hazardous substances or substances under high pressure or temperature; Transportation Services (SIC 47): servicing of railroad car heating, ventilation and refrigeration, grain leveling and car cleaning equipment, weighing and packing equipment; Communications (SIC 48): servicing of installation hoisting equipment, high voltage equipment; Electric, Gas and Sanitary Services (SIC 49): servicing of water, steam, irrigation and sewerage pipelines, hoisting apparatus, power transmission devices; Wholesale Trade-Durable Goods (SIC 50): servicing of manufacturing operations conducted as a secondary business or as part of a vertically integrated operation, servicingof scrap metal recycling equipment, hoists, conveyors, saws, planers; Wholesale Trade-Nondurable Goods (SIC 51): servicing of grain elevators and augers, conveyors, hoisting equipment; Food Stores (SIC 54): servicing of packaging machinery, conveyors, meat cutting equipment, ovens; Personal Services (SIC 72): servicing of laundry and dry cleaning equipment; Business Services (SIC 73): servicing of heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems, electrical systems, centrifuges; Automotive Repair, Services, and Garages (SIC 75): servicing of hoisting equipment, hydraulic lifts, repair machinery; Misc. Repair Services (SIC 76): servicing of welding repair equipment; Amusement and Recreation Services (SIC 79): servicing of large rides and other amusement equipment with moving parts. Summarized at RIA, pp. 11-10, 11. Additional sectors with \"negligible\" concentrations of powered equipment also occasionally have workers involved in servicing or maintenance. RIA summary at pp. 11-10, 11. Low reported accident rates or equipment concentrations for some SIC sectors do not mean that servicing workers in those sectors are not exposed to a significant risk. First, SIC designations reflect only the primary work activity at a workplace, not the entire range of activities. Thus, an accident occurring in an operation in an employer's secondary area of activity may be attributed to the SIC representing the firm's major activity, skewing the data for both SICs. Or an accident may involve employees of a contractor and be reported under the contractor's SIC rather than the SIC in which the hazardous machine or equipment was located. A particular SIC may exhibit a low rate of hazardous energy accidents because relatively little servicing and maintenance takes place in that SIC even though the servicing and maintenance that does take place is just as risky as that in a SIC in which such activities are more common. Moreover, a particular SIC may show a low accident rate because many employers in that SIC are already protecting their employees against lockout/tagout hazards. The fact that responsible employers are protecting their employees would not, however, justify OSHA's failure to issue a standard that requires other employers to provide the same needed protection. In addition to the inherent limitations of accident data organized by SIC codes, defining the scope of a standard by SIC codes would restrict the standard's ability to adapt to circumstances that cannot be precisely foreseen when the standard is promulgated. As noted above, a workplace's SIC designation is Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations based on its primary activity, but the primary activity in many workplaces changes over time. The coverage of hazardous servicing activity that takes place in a workplace should not depend on the fortuity of the SIC code it happens to be in at any given time. Moreover, SIC codes themselves are periodically redefined at the 3 and 4 digit levels. If the standard's applicability is defined by SIC codes, such redefinitions will affect coverage in a manner that is unpredictable and that may well deny coverage where it is needed. Even if SIC designations provided a sound means of defining a standard's coverage, the available accident data did not prove that any industry sectors were free of risk from hazardous energy. The data covered a relatively limited time span and were affected by some degree of mis-reporting and under-reporting. For example, the ERG report, which showed no injuries for five low impact SICs (Ex. 3-15. p. 3-9), reflected incidents from only one set of reports during a four-month period in twenty- five states. Ex. 3-15, pp. 3-5, 3-8. Given the inherently hazardous nature of servicing operations and the limitations of SIC reporting, the absence of injury reports over a four- month period in a limited geographic area did not support an inference of no or low risk. Accordingly, OSHA expressed the standard's coverage in performance terms rather than SIC codes. The standard applies to all servicing and maintenance activities during which employees can be injured if machines or equipment become unexpectedly energized or if stored energy is released but not to servicing and maintenance that present minimal and readily controlled risk, such as work on electrical equipment that can be deenergized by simply unplugging it, and minor servicing activities that take place during normal production operations. Thus, each covered employer's burden is determined by the frequency and complexity of servicing actually undertaken. For similar reasons, OSHA decided not to limit the standard to particular equipment. By its terms the standard applies only when the unexpected energization or release of stored energy could cause injury to employees. Machines and equipment that present no hazard are excluded from coverage. The court referred to sewing machines as a type of equipment that might present less of a hazard than larger, more powerful machinery. For sewing machines like those used at home, not of industrial size and configuration, thestandard's cord-and-plug exemption would apply. Industrial sewing machines used in high impact sectors like SIC 23, Apparel Manufacture, plainly present electrical and puncture hazards. Moreover, industrial processes and equipment are constantly changing, and restricting the standard to machines and equipment that are in use at the time of promulgation would fail to recognize that newly developed equipment can be just as hazardous as equipment currently in use. OSHA believes that the best approach is the one it has taken: the standard applies to all machines and equipment for which inadvertent energi-zation during servicing or maintenance will expose employees to injury, and only to such machines and equipment. This approach assures that workers are protected wherever lockoutltagout azards exist but that compliance burdens are not imposed where there is no hazard. IV. Cost Benefit Relationship In UAW v. OSHA, the D. C. Circuit held that the \"reasonably necessary or appropriate\" language of section 3(8) could be interpreted to include a cost- benefit balancing formula or other explicit mechanism for judging whether the benefits of safety standards justify the costs. 938 F.2d at 1319. The court ruled that the statutory construction apparently relied on by OSHA in the rulemaking vested unconstitutionally 'broad discretion in the agency but that the overbreadth could be cured by adoption of a suitably limiting construction. The court stated that adoption of \"cost~benefit analysis\" would be an acceptable interpretation, but observed that there could be other permissible interpretations that would also cure the overbreadth problem. Section I sets forth the construction of the statute that OSHA relies on in establishing safety standards. Under OSHA's interpretation, numerous decisionmaking criteria assure that the costs of safety standards are reasonably related to their benefits. Safety standards must substantially reduce a significant risk of material harm with measures that are technologically capable of being done and at costs that most affected employers can absorb or pass on. OSHA must choose the most cost-effective means for meeting the regulatory goals. OSHA's findings as to the costs and benefits of each standard must be supported by substantial evidence based on a rulemaking record. Finally, safety standards must reflect OSHA consideration of significant rulemaking comments, existing consensus standards, and policychanges. The agency believes that this construction addresses the court's concern that the agency not claim unconstitutionally broad discretion and that it not impose large costs for insignificant safety gains. OSHA's decisionmaking process thus assures that the resulting standard produces substantial benefits at a reasonable cost. OSHA safety standards therefore meet a qualitative cost-benefit test announced by the Fifth Circuit: The test under section 3(8) is an intermediate one between the feasibility mandate of section 6(b)(5) and a strict cost- benefit analysis that requires a more formal, specific weighing of quantified benefits against costs.* * * section 3(8) only demands that the expected costs of OSHA regulations be reasonably related to the expected benefits, leaving considerable discretion for the agency as long as it is exercised on substantial evidence and with an adequate statement of reasons. National Grain 8 Feed Ass'n v. OSHA, 868 F.2d 717, 733 (5th Cir. 1989) (internal quotations omitted). See National Grain 8 Feed Ass'n v. OSHA, 903 F.2d 308, 311 (5th Cir. 1990) (approving OSHA's Supplemental Statement of Reasons for grain dust standard as meeting Fifth Circuit's requirement for cost-benefit justification). The agency specifically finds that the relationship between the benefits secured by the lockout/tagout standard and the costs it imposes is reasonable. The standard will save approximately 122 lives and 28,400 lost workday injuries each year, at a cost of $214 million in the first year and $135 million thereafter. Focusing only on the fatalities the standard is expected to prevent, the cost per life saved is $1.2 million. 54 FR at 36685/2; RIA V1l- 1. When compliance costs are atusted to account for the cost savings to employers from the accidents prevented, the net cost per life saved falls to $0.19 million. Id. Even these modest figures overstate the cost per life saved, for they do not take into account the non-fatal injuries that will be prevented. The cost per life saved compares favorably with other OSHA safety standards, and OSHA believes that the cost-benefit relationship is favorable by any reasonable measure. As noted above, OSHA believes that its existing interpretation of section 3(8) satisfies the D.C. Circuit's concern that its rulemaking discretion not be overbroad. However, in light of the court's opinion, the agency believes it would be useful to explain in more detail the manner in which it gathers and uses economic data in promulgating16621 16622 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations safety standards as well as the limitations on its use of such data. Economic analysis is an essential element of both feasibility and cost- effectiveness analysis and an integral part of OSHA's decisionmaking. Economic analysis begins with the initial crafting of a proposed rule. Data and information are gathered systematically on a variety of elements including the costs of possible control and abatement measures, the prevalence of existing control measures, and the impact of work injuries and safe work practices on productivity, OSHA uses this information in conjunction with information such as any new emerging control technologies to select from among the abatement techniques that appear to be the most affordable and efficacious. When a proposal is published in the Federal Register, the economic component of OSHA's analysis is discussed in the preamble along with OSHA's risk and benefit analysis. The full Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis is also made available to the public. Included in such information are the underlying data sources and specific methodologies used that support the economic assessments made by the agency. Once such information is published and made available, OSHA encourages the public to comment on the analysis and to provide any additional data or information that may improve the preliminary estimates. Upon the completion of the comment period, OSHA carefully reviews all the additional economic and technical information that the public has provided and uses such information to develop its Final Regulatory Impact Analysis, which contains the economic assess;nt that is used in crafting the final rTe. Each final rule is strongly influenced by the comments received as to the accuracy of OSHA's preliminary estimates and any new information. In light of all the available evidence, OSHA determines the costs and benefits of the standard as a whole, assesses the overall cost-effectiveness of the standard, and evaluates its overall economic impact on the regulated community. The agency's \"cost-effectiveness\" analysis assures that the standard reduces significant risk at the least cost to employers. \"Cost-effectiveness analysis\" is defined in The Dictionary of Modern Economics (Pearce, 1983) as: * * * a technique closely related to cost- benefit analysis. It differs in that it asks a different question, namely, given a particular objective which is the least-cost way of achieving it? It aids choice between optionsbut cannot answer the question whether any of the options are worth doing. It is utilized when there are difficulties in associating monetary values with outcomes of projects but where the outcomes can be quantified along some non-monetary dimension. The lockout/tagout standard's Regulatory Impact Analysis relied primarily on such cost-effectiveness analysis to identify and provide economic comparisons of the various trade-offs between different versions of the final rule. Such analysis provided the agency with information as to the benefits that could be obtained for a given cost. That information was then used in developing what the agency deemed the most cost-effective regulation to address the workplace hazards identified. In its lockout/tagout decision, the court discussed a form of cost-benefit .analysis (hereinafter \"formal cost- benefit analysis\") that would systematically monetize and weigh costs and benefits of proposed safety standards both within and outside the* workplace. The analysis would attempt, among other things, to assign monetary values to saving a human life and to avoiding suffering and would account for indirect effects of the standard attributable to possible reduced wages or increased consumer prices that resulted from employer compliance costs. 938 F.2d at 1320. The court suggested this sort of formal cost-benefit analysis could assure that the agency did not engage in decision-making that is unconstitutionally unfettered. The court did not indicate that the exact approach it described is the only approach that would pass constitutional muster. Indeed, the court stressed that it was open to OSHA on remand to identify an alternative construction that conformed to nondelegation principles. 938 F.2d at 1321. OSHA has carefully considered the issue remanded by the court. OSHA believes that when considered in their entirety, the criteria it applies to safety rulemaking assure that OSHA's decision-making process is sufficiently constrained to satisfy constitutional principles. Thus, OSHA believes that it has in fact met the court's constitutional concern even while it has not adopted the specific methodology referred to by the court. OSHA also believes that problems associated with formal cost-benefit analysis militate against its use in safety rulemaking. The formal cost-benefit analysis discussed by the court is generally understood to require that all the costs and benefits of a particular action be identified, monetized and compared. Each stage of this analysis- selection of relevant costs and benefits,assignment of monetary values, and judgment of relative worth-presents complex policy and factual issues, the resolution of which is not necessarily more precise or rational than resolution of the issues OSHA currently addresses and which could result in significantly protracted agency rulemaking. Even proponents of formal cost-benefit analysis do not consider it a panacea. \"There are costs to quantitative analysis * * *. One cost is bad decisions resulting from endowing the estimated numbers with too much confidence and tending to ignore unquantified aspects; this cost is the flip side of dismissing analysis as useless.\" Lester B. Lave, The Strategy of Social Regulation: Decision Frameworks for Policy, The Brookings Institution, Washington, DC (1981) pp. 133-34. Moreover, in OSHA's judgment, its statutory mandate to achieve safe and healthful Workplaces for the nation's employees limits the role monetization of benefits and analysis of extra- workplace effects can play in setting safety standards. Congress enacted the OSH Act for the purpose of \"assur[ing] so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation'safe and healthful working conditions.\" 29 U.S.C. 2(b). \"Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety as a cost of doing business.\" American Textile Mfrs. Inst. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 519-522 (1981). See discussion above at pp. 14- 15. In sum, there are significant limitations to formal cost-benefit analysis, both in its capacity to order decision-making and in terms of its relation to achievement of the statutory purposes. The concurring opinion in UAW v. OSHA refers to a related approach, termed \"risk-risk\" analysis, suggested recently by Professor Wildavsky, a political scientist, and others. See 938 F.2d at 1326-27. OSHA has previously determined that systematic study of risk-risk theory's empirical validity, advantages and disadvantages is needed before the theory can be evaluated for use in the OSHA rulemaking context. In its proposed standard for Air Contaminants in Construction, Maritime and Agriculture industries, for example. OSHA posed a series of questions relating to the theory's empirical basis. 57 FR 26002, 26005-29009 (June 12, 1992). The questions were framed to test whether, as risk-risk theory posits, the net health benefit of the proposed standard would be positive or negative Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations for the workers who would be affected by the standard's impact on workplace risk and, possibly, income. OSHA has also noted that apart from the empirical questions raised by risk- risk theory, serious questions exist about the analysis' appropriateness for OSHA given the specific statutory commands of the OSH Act, particularly the Act's focus on workplace rather than societal risks and benefits. Thus, if and when risk-risk analysis is found to have an empirical basis, the agency would have to evaluate the analysis in light of those statutory considerations. In the meantime, OSHA is.confident that the type, level and sophistication of economic analyses it currently performs assure that its standards are protective, cost-effective, and economically and technologically feasible. The Agency has identified several key advantages in its approach to assessing the costs and benefits of a standard in the context of risk and feasibility determinations: * A necessary first step in reaching an economic feasibility determination is to develop representative compliance scenarios. These help identify very costly regulatory provisions and areas of duplication or internal discrepancy. * Cost and benefit estimates, based upon the compliance scenarios, help identify high cost and low benefit provisions that may require additional study. This often results in the development of more efficient regulatory alternatives. * A comparison of the estimated costs with industry profit and revenue estimates (i.e., economic feasibility assessment) helps to identify sectors where high economic burdens may need to be mitigated through some form of regulatory relief, such as extended compliance dates. There are, of course, limits to the accuracy of the cost and benefit information OSHA can develop. Such limitations include: * Inaccurate or incomplete data- OSHA frequently is regulating in areas where data are incomplete. For health standards, exposure data are often lacking or do not provide the accuracy that the agency needs. Often, industry data do not record the specific cause of accidents or illnesses. OSHA surveys designed to collect the necessary data are limited by budget and resource constraints. In addition, surveys take time to develop and complete, and requir a careful tradeoff of quantity of intormation requested with the likelihood and accuracy of response. Finally, the accuracy of the results are constrained by data disaggregation problems.* Reliance on assumptions--The Supreme Court, in the Benzene decision, required OSHA to demonstrate significant risk. For health standards, such as benzene, risk estimates are commonly based upon mathematical models (e.g., dose response curves) and the benefits are quantified by estimating the number of future fatalities that would be prevented under various exposure reductions. For safety standards risk is based upon the assumption that past accident patterns are representative of future ones. OSHA estimates benefits by determining the percentage of accidents that will be. prevented by compliance with the standard (e.g., locking out or tagging out energy sources). * Quantification issues-The anticipated benefits accruing from an OSHA standard are usually understated because many benefits cannot be quantified with any degree of accuracy (e.g., potential productivity gains). In addition, since the quantified benefits are usually in assorted units of measure (e.g., number of lives saved, injuries prevented, etc.) cost-effectiveness ratios are partial or incomplete. * Decreasing accuracy as the estimates are disagregated-Every model and survey is subject to certain limitations. For example, subsector analysis decreases in accuracy as survey data are disaggregated. Thus, OSHA has more confidence in the accuracy of its estimate of the aggregate annual cost of the lockoutltagout standard than it has in the individual industry estimates. Moreover, costs for individual firms can be expected to vary depending on specific circumstances-some firms may not experience any costs while others would experience costs above the average for their industry. This effect is also evident in the benefit estimates of a safety standard. As stated above, these estimates are based upon the assumption that past accident patterns are representative of future ones: While at the aggregate this may be true, this can lead to some perverse results if data are disaggregated. Since there are only a finite number of discrete events (e.g., accidents, fatalities, irijuries). disaggregation (by industry, size of firm, location) will often reveal the existence of a hazard but no previous history of problems (e.g., zero accidents of the type under consideration). This is one of the reasons that the Department has maintained that quantitative cost-benefit analysis based on such data should not be used to exclude specific groups from protection. At the extreme, it is always possible to find individual firms or workers with no history of accidentseven though others using the same or similar practices have incurred problems. But some technical limitations and resource constraints are unavoidable in any system for gathering and evaluating broad-based cost and benefit data. Over all, the Agency is confident that the Regulatory Impact Analysis provided sufficient detail and guidance for the development of the lockout/tagout standard, resulting in a standard consistent with all constitutional requirements. To the degree that OSHA determines that added forms of economic analysis can improve the decisionmaking process and improve the quality of its regulations, the agency will continue to explore and incorporate new approaches, Authority: This document was prepared under the direction of David C.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: OSM is announcing its decision to approve a proposed amendment to the Utah permanent regulatory program (hereinafter, the \"Utah program\") under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment consists of changes to provisions of the Utah Coal Mining Rules pertaining to termination of jurisdiction. The amendment is intended to revise the Utah program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background on the Utah Program. I. Proposed Amendment. III. Director's Findings. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments. V. Director's Decision. VI. Procedural Determinations. I. Background on the Utah Program On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Utah State program for the regulation of coal exploration and coal mining and. reclamation operations on non-Federal - and non-Indian lands (the Utah program). General background information on the Utah program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and an explanation of the conditions of approval, appears in the January 21, 1981, Federal Register (46 FR 5899). Actions taken subsequent to approval of the Utah program are codified at 30 CFR 944.15, 944.16, and 944.30. II. Proposed Amendment By letter dated November 5, 1992 (Administrative Record No. UT-0ao), Utah submitted to OSM a proposed amendment to the Utah program pursuant to the SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1201-1328, and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR chapter VII (the Federal regulations). Utah submitted the proposed amendment in response to a required amendment at 30 CFR 944.16(p) that OSM placed on the Utah program in the September 11, 1992, final rule Federal Register notice (57 FR 41692, Administrative Record No. UT- 777). The provision of the Utah Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposed to amend is Utah Administrative Rule (Utah Admin. R.) 645-100-452, concerning termination of jurisdiction. OSM published a notice in the January 14, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 4390), announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on its adequacy (Administrative Record No. UT-822). The public comment period closed February 16, 1993. ilii. Director's Findings After a thorough review pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, the Mrector finds, as discussed below, that Utah's November 5, 1992, proposedamendment is no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulation. In response to a required program amendment codified at 30 CFR 944.16(p), Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645-100-452, which sets forth those conditions that necessitate reassertion of regulatory jurisdiction over coal mining and reclamation operations after bond release. Existing Utah Admin R. 645-100-452 provides that, following a termination under Utah Admin R. 645-100-451, the Division will reassert jurisdiction over a site if it is demonstrated that the bond release or written determination referred to under Utah Admin R. 645-100-451 was based upon fraud, collusion, or misrepresentation of a material fact by the perinittee. Utah proposed to delete the phrase \"by-the permittee\" from Utah Admin. R. 645-100-452 because fraud or collusion could apply to any party (not just the permittee) involved in the bond release process. Proposed Utah Admin. R. 645-100- 452 is substantively identical to, and is therefore no less effective than, the corresponding Federal regulation at 30 CFR 700.11(4d3(2). The Director approves the proposed rule and removes the required amendment at 30 CFR 944.16p). IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments 1. Public Comments The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment. No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held. 2. Agency Comments Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the heads of other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Utah program. A. Bureau of Land Mmgement By letter dated December 15, 1992, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management said that it had no concerns regarding the proposed amendment (Administrative Record No. UT-809). B. Fish and Wildlife Service By letter dated December 17, 1992,. -the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said that it had no comments on theproposed amendment (Administrative Record No. UT-811). C. Bueau of Mines By letter dated December 18, 1992, the U.S. Bureau of Mines said that it had no comments on the proposed amendment (Administrative Record No. UT-Sl0). D. Department of Labor By letter dated January 14, 1993, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MISHA) stated that the proposed amendment does not conflict with current MSHA regulations (Administrative Record No. UT-819). E. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(1)(i), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of EPA with respect to those aspects of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and the Clean Air Act, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.L The change that Utah proposed to its rule does not pertain to air or water qualty standards. Nevertheless, OSM requested EPA's concurrence on the proposed amendment. EPA did not respond to OSM's request for concurrece. F. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4L OSM solicited comments from the Utah SHPO and ACHP. Neither the SUPO nor the ACHP commented on the proposed amendment. V. Director's Decision Based on the above finding, the Director (1) approves Utah's November 5, 1992, proposed revision to the Utah program at Utah Amin. R. 045-10- 452 and (2) rerwes the required amendment 30 CFR 944.Wip). The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 944, which codify decisions concerning the Utah program, are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA: Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations VI. Procedural Determinations 1. Executive Order 12291 On July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSM an exemption from sections 3. 4, 7, and 8 of Executive Order 12291 for actions related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatory programs, actions, and program amendments. Therefore, preparation of a regulatory impact analysis is not necessary, and OMB regulatory review is not required. 2. Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required. by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11. 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met. 3. National Environmental Policy Act No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)). 4. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.). 5. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations forwhich an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The EPA is finalizing the update of the Outer Continental Shelf (\"OCS\") Air Regulations proposed inthe Federal Register on December 31, 1992. Requirements applying to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent with the requirements of the corresponding onshore area (\"COA\"), as mandated by Section 328(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (\"the Act\"), as amended by ihe Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The portion of the OCS Air Regulations that is being updated pertains to the requirements for OCS sources for which the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (Santa Barbara APCD) and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD) are the designated COAs. This final action incorporates the requirements contained in \"Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources\" (March 10, 1993) and \"Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources\" (March 10, 1993).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 31, 1992 in 57 FR 62537, EPA proposed to approve the following requirements into the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations: \"Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources\" (December 15, 1992) and \"Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources\" (December 15, 1992), with some modifications as set forth in the proposal. Theise requirements represent the first update of part 55 and are being promulgated in response to the submittal of rules from local air16625 16626 Federal Register I VoL 58. No,. 50 / Tuesday, March 3. 1993 1 Rules and Regulatns pollution control agenda& EPA has evaluated the above requirements to ensure that they are ratiomUly related to the attainment or maintenance of federal or state ambient air quality standards or part C of title I of the Act, that they are not designed expressly to prevent exploration and development of the OCS and that they are applicable to OCS sources. 40 CFR 55.1. EPA has also evaluated the rules to ensure that they are not arbitrary or capricious, 40 CFR 55.12(e). In addition, EPA has excluded administrative or procedural rules. A 30-day public comment period was provided in 57 FR 62537. EPA received one comment letter that did not result in a change to the final rule. Please refer to Docket A-.92-70, available at the addresses given above, for the response to comments. EPA Action In today's notice, EPA takes final action to incorporate the proposed changes into 40 CFR part 55. No changes were made to the proposal set forth in the December 31, 1992 notice of proposed rulemaking. EPA is approving the submittal as modified in the ' proposal under section 328(a)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7627. The intended effect of approving these requirements is to regulate emissions from OCS sources in accordance with the requirements onshore. Section 328(a) of the Act requires that EPA establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries that are the same as onshore requirements. To comply with this statutory mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore. Administrative Requirements A. Executive Order 12291 (Regulatory Impact Analysis) The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291. B. Regulktory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules that am likely to have a\"significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.\" Small entities inchde small businesses, organizations, and govemmental jurisdicbns. As was stated in the final OCS reriudla,the OCS rule dtes nst apply to any small entities, and the structure of the rule. avets direct impact. adl mitigates ikrdict impacts on smatientities. Thisc6nssteancy update merely incorporates onshore requiremants into the OCS rule, to maintain consistency with onshore regulations as required by Section 328 of the Act and does not alter the structure of the rule. The EPA certifes that this notice of final rulemaking will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements contained in the final OCS rulemaking dated September 4, 1992 under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 35012 et seq. and has assigned OMB control number 2060-0249.

ACTION: Policy statement. SUMMARY: The Chief, Common Carrier Bureau (the Bureau) adopted an Orderpermitting the administrator of the 800 Number Administration Service Center (NASC), upon written customer authorization, to make Responsible Organization (RESPORG) changes in the Service Management System (SMS). The Bureau also concluded that there could be a separate rate element for this service in the SMS tariff. In addition, the Bureau dismissed without prejudice a request that the NASC also be permitted to make 800 traffic routing changes. This action will promote fair competition in the provision of 800 services. This action was taken pursuant to a Petition for Declaratory Ruling filed July 10, 1992 by Sprint Communications Company (Sprint). EFFECTIVE DATE: This order is effective April 29, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary Phillips, (202) 632-4047, Policy and Program Planning Division, Common Carrier Bureau. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Bureau's Order, adopted March 10, 1993, and released March 11, 1993 (DA 93-294). The full text of this decision is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (room 239), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. The complete text of this decision may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractors, International Transcription Services, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. Summary of the Order 1. 800 service is an interexchange service in which a subscriber agrees in advance to pay for all calls made to its 800 number from a specified area. Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) will soon implement a new \"data base\" system of 800 access. Under this system, LECs will identify the 800 service provider for each 800 call by querying a regional data base (Service Control Point or SCP) that contains 800 service information associated with each 800 number. This 800 service information will be loaded into each SCP via the SMS, a centralized data base system. All 800 service records must be loaded into the SMS for downloading to the regional SCPs. In addition, all changes in 800 service records must be entered in the SMS. The NASC administers the 800 SMS. 2. Only one entity-the RESPORG- will be permitted to access each customer record in the SMS to make changes to that record, including a RESPORG change. With the implementation of 800 data base access, a customer's current 800 carrier will generally become that customer's Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 /- Rules and Regulations RESPORG. Subscribers will be able to change RESPORGs, however, at any time, and the FCC has held that they may choose any entity to serve as their RESPORG, provided that entity meets tariffed RESPORG eligibility criteria. 3. On July 10, 1992, Sprint filed a petition for declaratory ruling requesting that the Commission authorize the NASC administrator to make certain 800 traffic routing and RESPORG changes to the SMS. In particular, Sprint asked that the FCC authorize the NASC to make SMS or. RESPORG changes that would be contrary to the interests of the incumbent RESPORG. Sprint argued that if a subscriber's 800 service provider is serving as its RESPORG and the subscriber wants to shift some or all of its traffic to another carrier, or if it wants to change RESPORGs, the existing RESPORG would receive advance notice of these changes. Sprint claimed that this situation would raise competitive concerns in that it would give the RESPORG an opportunity to take measures to dissuade its customer from making the changes. 4. The Bureau granted Sprint's petition in part and dismissed it without prejudice in part. Specifically, the Bureau concluded that the NASC should be'permitted, with written customer authorization, to make RESPORG changes. The Bureau reasoned that the public interest would not be well served by a system requiring that an 800 service provider acting as RESPORG receive advance notice that a customer is. at a minimum, transferring its 800 account coordination to a third party--often a competitor-and quite possibly shifting most of its 800 business to a competitor as well. The Bureau also concluded that there could be a separate rate element for this service in the SMS tariff. At the same time, however, the Bureau found that the record did not contain sufficient information about the benefits or costs of authorizing the NASC to make traffic routing changes, and it therefore dismissed this request without prejudice.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) announces implementation of a flexible starting date for the\"regular\" season for the fixed gear (nontrawl) sablefish fishery off California, Oregon, and Washington, and 72-hour closed periods both immediately before and immediately after the regular season. The flexible starting date for the regular season would precede by 3 days the earliest sablefish fixed gear season opening in the Gulf of Alaska. This action is intended to preserve traditional fishing opportunities for many smaller Pacific coast nontrawl vessels by preventing premature achievement of the nontrawl harvest guideline by intensive early season fishing by large nontrawl vessels prior to the opening of the Gulf of Alaska sablefish fishery. It is necessary to maintain stability in the nontrawl sablefish fishery, to extend the Pacific coast nontrawl sablefish fishery to the maximum extent practicable, and to minimize the safety risks that would arise for operators of small vessels if they were compelled to fish in severe winter weather to assure themselves a portion of the annual harvest guideline. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 1. 1993. ADDRESSES: Copies of the Environmental Assessment/Regulatory Impact Review (EA/RIR) are available from the Pacific Fishery Management Council, 2000 SW First Avenue, suite 42D, Portland, Oregon 97201. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William L Robinson at 206-526-6140, Rodney R. Mclnnis at 310-980-4030, or the Pacific Fishery Management Council at 503-326-6352.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) makes recommendations to the Secretary for the management of fisheries under the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). This action is being taken under procedures for addressing socio- economic issues set forth at section I1.B.4,(c) of the appendix to 50 .CFR part 663. An analysis of the biological, social, and economic impacts involved in changing the beginning of the nontrawl sablefish season is contained in the draft EA/RIR that is available from the Council (see ADDRESSES). Background ' Sablefish constitutes one of the most valuable components of the groundfish fisheries off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California (the Pacific coast) and Alaska. Although taken in both trawl and nontrawl fisheries, sablefish is the principal species harvested by the nontrawl fleet. Nontrawl fishing effort in the Pacific coast sablefish fishery has increased dramatically during recent years, resulting in shorter seasons. Contributing to this effort increase, especially early in the year, has been participation by large nontrawl vessels that traditionally fish off Alaska. Delayed openings of the Alaska nontrawl sablefish fishery have resulted in a 3-4 month \"window\" where operators of nontrawl fishing vessels can fish in the Pacific coast sablefish fishery prior to leaving for Alaska. The result has been rapid achievement of the nontrawl sablefish harvest guideline off Washington, Oregon, and California, and preemption of fishing opportunities for many smaller, local vessels that fish only the Pacific coast fishery. These vessel operators traditionally have relied on a longer season that has given them the ability to focus fishing effort during periods of better weather. Now, competition for the available harvest forces operators of smaller vessels to take greater risks fishing in severe winter weather. Increased early season fishing effort for sablefish also encourages the harvest of sablefish nearer to the late winter spawning season when flesh quality and product yield may not be as good as later in the season. A more detailed discussion of the background appears In the preamble to the proposed rule at 57 FR 53313 (November 9, 1992). The Council considered public comment on several alternative dates at its September and November 1991 meetings and considered the advice of its advisory subpanel, Scientific and Statistical Committee, Groundfish16629 16630 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Management-Team, and the public. The Council concluded that by linking the beginning of the Pacific coast regular season with the earliest season opening in the Gulf of Alaska, effort would be distributed more evenly between the two areas, counteracting the recent trend towards increased effort in the Pacific coast area early in the year. Nontrawl fishermen who traditionally fish only the Pacific coast would be afforded longer seasons and be able to fish in better weather, and sablefish yield and quality could be improved. Consequently, the Council recommended that the regular season for the Pacific coast sablefish nontrawl fishery begin 3 days prior to the earliest scheduled openings of any regulatory district in the Gulf of Alaska. All regulatory districts in the Gulf of Alaska normally open at the same time in order to distribute fishing effort throughout the Gulf of Alaska, thus avoiding adverse biological and social impacts (wastage, gear conflicts, grounds preemption, etc.) that could occur as a result of allowing the entire fishing fleet to concentrate sequentially In each area. The Council recommended near- concurrent openings of the Pacific coast and Gulf of Alaska nontrawl sablefish fisheries for some of the same reasons. The Council chose to begin the Pacific coast regular season 3 days prior to the earliest Gulf of Alaska season opening because it presumed that those boats that choose to fish in Alaska will have departed for Alaska at least 3 days prior to the opening date. In 1992, the Gulf of Alaska nontrawl sablefish fisheries opened on May 15. The above discussion applies only to the regular sablefish season, which is characterized by the absence of trip landing or frequency limits, except for those necessary to restrict the harvest of undersized (juvenile) sablefish. Limited sablefish landings are allowed both before and after the regular season during \"open periods,\" i.e., when one can legally fish. These landings are regulated under restrictive trip landing and frequency limits, classified as\"routine\". management measures at 50 CFR 663.23(c)(1)(i)(E), allowing bycatch in non-sablefish fisheries and some very small directed sablefish nontrawl fisheries, mainly off California. In order to facilitate enforcement of trip landing and frequency limits that are effective prior to and after the regular nontrawl sablefish season, the Council also recommended that the taking and retention, possession, or landing of sablefish be prohibited for 72 hours immediately prior to and immediately after the regular season. This will discourage fishermen fromgetting a head start on the regular season by stockpiling sablefish caught in excess of the trip limit before the regular season begins, and will facilitate the transition from unlimited landings to landings regulated by trip limit following the close of the regular season. This rule also provides a procedure by which the NMFS Northwest Regional Director will announce each year the date on which the regular nontrawl sablefish season off the Pacific Coast will begin, once the earliest Gulf of Alaska opening date is known. Normally, the Regional Director will include the regular season opening date and the dates of the initial 72-hour closure in the \"Notice of Annual Harvest Specifications and Management Measures\" published in the Federal Register at the beginning of each fishing year, but may announce the date in a separate Federal Register notice, at a later date, if the Alaska season opening changes following publication of the \"Notice of Annual Harvest Specifications and Management Measures.\" The end of the regular season and implementation of the second 72-hour closure also will be announced in the Federal Register. The proposed rule for this action was published in the Federal Register at 57 FR 53313, November 9, 1992, and the comment period ended December 7, 1992. No comments were received. The Secretary concurs with the Council's recommendations, and therefore the final rule is substantively the same as proposed, with minor stylistic changes. Classification This rule is published under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act), 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq., and was prepared at the request of the Council. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (Assistant Administrator), has determined that this rule is necessary for the conservation and management of the Pacific coast groundfish fishery and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. The Council prepared an Environmental Assessment and Regulatory Impact Review (EA/RIR) for this rule. Based on the EA/RIR, the Assistant Administrator concluded that there will be no significant impact on the human environment. You may obtain a copy of the EA/RIR from the Council (see ADDRESSES). The Assistant Administrator determined that this is not a major rule requiring a regulatory impact analysis under Executive Order 12291.The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Small Business Administration when this rule was proposed that, if adopted, it would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Assistant Administrator has determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approved coastal zone management programs of the States of Washington, Oregon, and California. The determination was submitted for review by the responsible State agencies under section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act. The State of Washington concurred in this determination. The States of Oregon and California did not comment within the statutory time period, and therefore consistency Is assumed. This rule does not contain a collection-of-information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. NMFS issued a Biological Opinion under the Endangered Species Act on August 10, 1990, pertaining to Amendment 4 of the FMP; a second Biological Opinion specific to the whiting fishery Impacts was issued on November 26, 1991; a third Biological Opinion analyzing the impact of the entire groundfish fishery on newly listed species of salmon was issued on August 28, 1992. They concluded respectively that implementation of the FMP (including Amendment 4) and the conduct of the groundfish fishery are unlikely to jeopardize the continued existence of any of the listed species considered. Implementation of this rule will not result in impacts that differ from those discussed in these Biological Opinions, and NMFS has concluded that further consultations are not necessary. This rule does not contain policies with federalism implication sufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. The Assistant Administrator, pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, finds good cause for making this rule effective prior to 30 days after its publication as final. If this rule is not effective by April 1, the large-scale target fishery will open on that date under existing regulations and effort is expected to be at least as great as in the past. As a result, the nontrawl allocation would be taken rapidly, in large part by vessels which would then depart for the Alaska fishery, preempting fishing Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations opportunities for the generally smaller, local fleet. Therefore, a delay in implementation after April 1 is contrary to the public interest. This action is based on the best available scientific information. The public participated in the November 1991 and November 1992 Council meetings at which this action was considered.

General background information on the Iowa program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval of the Iowa Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Proposed Rules program can be found in the January 21, 1981, Federal Register (46 FR 5885). Subsequent actions concerning Iowa's program and program amendrments can be found at 30 CFR 915.15 and 915.16. II. Proposed Amendment By letters dated December 30, 1992, and January 5, 1993, (Administrative Record No. IA-374) Iowa submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Iowa submitted the proposed amendment in response to an August 1, 1986, letter (Administrative Record No. IA-280) that OSM sent in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(c) requiring certain provisions of the State program to be updated for consistency with the Federal regulations through July 1 1986. The guidance document submitted by Iowa is intended to fulfill the requirements of 30 CFR 816.116(a)(1) and 817.116(a)(1) that standards for revegetation success and statistically valid sampling techniques for measuring success shall be selected by the regulatory authority and included in an approved regulatory program. The 33 page guidance document is divided into seven major sections: (1) Introduction; (2) definition of terms; (3) general requirements; (4) revegetation success standards; (5) sampling procedures and techniques; (6) statistical analysis of sampling data; and (7) 31 pages of appendices include the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) productivity data for four counties in Iowa. Due to the length and complexity of the document, only a brief summary of the contents is included in this notice. The introduction to the document includes a summary of the regulations that apply to the evaluation of revegetation success and the applicability of the guidance document to surface mining permits. The section on definition of terms provides definitions for the terms permit, permittee, reference area, control area, statistically valid, and the acronym USDA-SCS. The section entitled general requirements and exclusions of revegetation includes applicable regulatory requirements for: (1) The control of erosion; (2) sampling and harvest time periods for different types of crops; (3) required dates for the reporting of revegetation data; (4) the procedures to be used to average test plot data or annual crop data; (5) areas that are to be excluded for the requirements for measuring revegetation success; and (6) the requirements for the establishment and maintenance of reference areas.The section on revegetation success standards establishes the vegetation production performance standards for all of the approved land uses. For prime farmland, the permittee may either establish a reference area or utilize USDA-SCS county soil survey production data by soil mapping unit to compare with the yields on the reclaimed lands to demonstrate equal or greater average yield for 3 years during the 5 year responsibility period. Iowa proposes to use either corn or soybeans as being the row crops requiring the greatest rooting depth. For pasture lands, the forage production must be greater than or equal to 90-percent of the pasture reference area or the forage production calculated using the USDA-SCS animal unit month (AUM) data for the county soil mapping units. For cropland, revegetation success will be achieved when the crop production yields are greater than or equal to 90-percent of that crop's reference area or as calculated using the USDA-SCS crop yield data by soil map ping unit for that crop. This standard must be met for any 2 years of the 5 year responsibility period except for the first year. For industrial, commercial, residential, recreational, wildlife, and forested land uses, revegetation success will be met when the site achieves a ground cover density of 80-percent composed of approved species for 2 consecutive years. In addition, for forest land uses, there must be at least 80- percent survival of live trees and/or shrubs 3 years after the date of initial planting. There will be a minimum of 200 surviving trees and/or shrubs per acre. For abandoned mined lands, the revegetation must meet the general requirements for revegetatlon and the vegetative covrrust be capable of stabilizing the soi lfface from erosion. The permittee may choose to restore the area to a noncropland land use and meet the revegetation standard of that use or achieve a ground cover density of 70- percent for 2 consecutive years. Iowa proposes to allow the permittee to establish a control area that could be utilized to calculate a climatic correction factor to adjust yield data. Iowa proposes the methods of establishment and maintenance of the control area and the methods for calculation of the correction factor. In the section entitled sampling procedures and techniques, Iowa proposes that the permittee must use the methods approved in the guidelines in order to (1) provide random selection of sampling sites, (2) a sampling techniqueunaffected by the sampler's preference, and (3) sufficient samples to represent the true mean of the vegetation characteristics. Iowa proposes sampling methods to determine row crop and small grain production for corn, soybeans, and wheat. Iowa proposes sampling methods to determine forage crop production and cover. In the section entitled Statistical Analysis of Sampling Data, Iowa proposes methods for the statistical analysis of production data by a statistical comparison using a standard t-test or using two randomized group t- tests. Iowa proposes a method for statistical analysis of ground cover measurements at a 90-percent confidence statistical interval. In the appendices, Iowa provides tabular information from the USDA- SCS soil survey crop production data by soil type for the counties of Lucas, Mahaska, Marion, and Monroe. Iowa also provides a copy of the document entitled \"Iowa Soil Properties and Interpretations Database\" that explains how the USDA-SCS crop production data is generated. III.

Procedural Determinations Compliance With the National Environmental Policy Act No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). Compliance With Executive Order No. 12291 On July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSM an exemption from sections 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Executive Order 12291 for actions related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatory programs, actions, and program amendments. Accordingly, preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not necessary and OMB regulatory review is not required.

Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations. Compliance With Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of Statei'egulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731. and 732 have been met.

Subsequent actions concerning Wyoming's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 950.12, 950.15, 950.16, and 950.20. H. Proposed Amendment By letter dated July 24, 1992, (Administrative Record No. WY-19-O1) Wyoming submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Wyoming submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative to improve its program. The regulations that Wyoming proposes to amend are:,Department of Envirobmental Quality, Land Quality Division Rules and Regulations, chapter XIII, Section 6(a) Exception; chapter 1. Section 2(e) Definitions, (Amendments). OSM published a notice in the September 11, 1992, Federal Register (57 FR 41715) announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period ended October 13, 1992. During its review of the amendment, OSM identified various concerns relating to the proposed Rule. OSM notified Wyoming on the concerns by letter dated November 17, 1992. (Administrative Record No. WY-19-08). The issues raised in that letter included: The need to clarify whether Wyoming's definition of amendment would include all procedures, informational needs, and the public notice requirements as specified for a new permit application; a need to clarify the meaning of various terms including, \"permit area\", \"term of permit\", \"permit renewal\", and \"permit revision\", and clarification of apparent conflicts regarding the detail of information needed for certain items in a permit application. Wyoming responded in a letter dated January 28, 1993, by submitting additional explanatory information (Administrative Record No. WY-19-10). In that letter, Wyoming provided clarification and/or proposed rule changes for the following: That all informational requirements for a permit application also apply to a permit amendment; that all coal mining permit amendments require public notice (associated proposed rule change at chapter XIV, section 6(a)); that a State approved permit area is consistent with the Federal program permit area; that amending a permit by up to 20 percent of the total permit acreage without public notice does not apply to coal16636 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Proposed Rules mining operations (associated proposed rule change at chapter XIV, section 2(b)), that the liability underbond shall be for the entire permit area (associated proposed rule change at chapter XII, section 2(a)(vii)); that signs and markers are placed around the perimeter of the permit area; that the phrase \"term-of- permit\" is parallel in meaning to the Federal \"term-of-permit\"; and that certain information required in the permit application will apply to the entire permit area .(associated proposed rule changes at chapterjl, section 3).

Background on the Wyoming Program On November 26, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Wyoming program. General background information on the Wyoming program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition ofcomments, and conditions of approval of the Wyoming program can be found in the November 26, 1980, Federal Register (45 FR 78637). Subsequent actions concerning Wyoming's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 950.12, 950.15, and 950.16. Hl. Proposed Amendment By letter dated March 9, 1993, (Administrative Record No. WY-22-01), Wyoming submitted proposed rules along with a proposed statutory amendment to its permanent program pursuant to legislation passed by Wyoming's 52nd Legislature (1993 General Session). The Wyoming proposed amendment is submitted to satisfy a condition placed on its program at 30 CFR 950.11(c), (condition \"c\"); to establish requirements which are consistent with the Federal attorney's fees and intervention regulation at 43 CFR part 4. Proposed Chapter V of the Department's Rules of Practice and Procedures addresses the attorneys' fees rules portion of condition \"c\". The Wyoming Legislature also modified Wyoming Statute (W.S.) 35-11-437(0 by requiring that whenever an order is issued under this section, at the request of any person, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) as determined by the director to have been reasonably incurred by the person for or in connection with his participation in the proceeding, including any judicial review of agency actions, may be assessed against either party as the court or the director deems proper. This subsection shall apply only to administrative contested case proceedings under the provisions of this act relating to the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with Public Law 95-87, as that law is worded on August 3, 1977. For payments from the department, the following shall apply: (i) The issues resolved in the contested proceeding are those in the original complaint that were raised within the statutory time frames under W.S. 35-11-406(p) or within an enforcement action; (ii) the contribution of a person who did not initiate the proceeding shall be separate and distinct from the contribution made by a person initiating the proceeding; (iii) the person shall establish the existence of specific violation of applicable statute or rule. Additionally the legislature added a new subsection W.S. 35-11-437(g) that requires attorney's fees, expert witness fees or other fees or costs not exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) per hour.16637 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Proposed Rules Concurrent with the review of Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedures, OSM will also conduct a review of chapter II and VI (Administrative Record No. WY-22-2). This review and approval is necessary because Wyoming promulgated the three above referenced Chapters of the Department's Rules of Practice and Procedures on August 3, 1982 and submitted the same to OSM as a formal amendment to its program on August 18, 1982. These permanent rules are to replace emergency rules that had been submitted to OSM for review on May 26, 1982. In that review, OSM found that Wyoming did not fully satisfy condition \"c\" and therefore extended the deadline for Wyoming to meet the condition (September 27, 1982 Federal Register (47 FR 42351)). Wyoming indicated in a letter of August 27, 1992, that the Chapter II or VI had not changed since being issued in August of 1982 (Administrative Record No. WY- 22-2). The proposed rule package is intended to satisfy the condition placed on the approved State Program and bring Wyoming's program into compliance with the purposes and intent of SMCRA. I. Public Comment Procedures In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed Rules and Statutes establish requirements which are consistent with Federal atto,'-evs' fees and Intervention regulations , 43 CFR part 4 and the SMCRA se i 525(e).

Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate questions. The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to comment have been heard. Persons in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons in the audience who wish to testify have been heard. Public Meeting If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public earing, may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting at the OSM office listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed under ADDRESSES. A written summary of each meeting will be made a part of the administrative record. IV. Procedural Determinations Compliance With Executive Order 12291 On July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSM an exemption from sections 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Executive Order 12291 for actions related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatory programs, actions, and program amendments. Accordingly, preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not necessary and OMB regulatory review is not required. Compliance With Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsection (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met. Compliance With the National Environmental Policy Act No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

Those sources . complying by means of an add-on control device are required to test the capture efficiency of each control system. On November 3, 1992 (57 FR 49662), USEPA proposed to extend the date by which sources must certify the capture efficiency of each control system from July 1, 1991, to July 1, 1993. That proposed rule offered an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed rule. On March 8, 1993 (58 FR 12913-12914), USEPA published a notice which announced that a public hearing on the proposed rule was scheduled for April 19, 1993, and reopened the public comment period from March 8, 1993, until May 19, 1993. Unfortunately, in the DATES section of that notice it was incorrectly stated that the hearing was scheduled for April 1, 1993, and that the public comment period Would remain open until May 3, 1993. The DATES section should have read as set forth below. USEPA regrets any inconvenience this error may have caused. DATES: A public hearing has been scheduled for Monday, April 19, 1993, at 1:30 p.m. The public comment period is reopened from March 8, 1993, until May 19, 1993. ADDRESSES: The location of the public hearing is the Lake Huron Room on the 12th Floor of the Ralph H. Metcalfe Federal Building, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Written comments on this proposed rule should be addressed to J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief, Regulation Development Section (AR-18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Comments should be strictly limited to the subject matter of the November 3, 1992 (57 FR 49662), proposed rule.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven Rosenthal, Regulation Development Branch, 18th Floor Southwest, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 886-6052.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Enid A. Gerena, (215) 597-6863, at the Region IIn address above. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 26, 1988, EPA issued a SIP call to Pennsylvania notifying the State that its SIP was substantially inadequate to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone. See 53 FR 34500 (September 7, 1988). A SIP call is a finding made by EPA pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(H) in which EPA identifies a SIP to be inadequate to attain and maintain the NAAQS. In a June 14, 1988 follow-up letter, EPA more specifically identified deficiencies in Pennsylvania's VOC regulations which need to be corrected in order for the regulations to meet the CAA requirements as interpreted in EPA policy and guidance. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted on November 15, 1990. Public Law 101- 549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A), Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that ozone nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone. Areas designated nonattainment before enactment of the Amendments and which retained-that designation and were classified as marginal or above as of enactment are required to meet the RACT fix-up requirement. Under section 182(a)(2)(A), those areas were required by May 15, 1991, to correct RACT. RACT fix-ups were also required under pre-amended section 172(b) as that requirement was interpreted in pre- amendment guidance.' The SIP call letters interpreted that guidance and indicated corrections necessary for specific nonattainment areas. The Allegheny County nonattainment area is classified as moderate.2 On October 16, 1991, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania submitted a formal revision to its State Implementatibn Plan (SIP). Therefore, this area is subject 1 Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of the Post-8? policy, 52 FR 45044 (Nov. 24, 1987); the Bluebook. \"Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice\" (of which notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988); and the existing CTG's. 2 Allegheny County retained its designation of nonattainment and was classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon enactment of the Amendments. 56 FR 56694.16639 Federal Register f\" Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Proposed Rules to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. The changes to the regulations submitted on October 16, 1991 represent Pennsylvania's response to EPA's 1988 SIP call for the Allegheny County portion of the Pennsylvania SIP. The SIP revision under review consists of amendments to Article XX, Rules and Regulations of the Allegheny County Health Department Air Pollution Control, which includes the following sections: (1) Section 101, Definitions; (2) Section 501, Equivalent Compliance Techniques; (3) Section 504, Temporary Shutdown of Incineration Equipment; (4) Section 505, Surface Coating Processes; (5) Section 506, Alternative Standards for Surface Coating and Graphic Arts Sources; (6) Section 507, Volatile Organic Compound Storage Tanks; (7) Section 508, Gasoline Loading Facilities; (8) Section 512, Compliance Schedules; (9) Section 531, Graphic Arts Systems; (10) Section 534, Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing Fugitive Sources; (11) Section 801, Definitions; and (12) Section 806, Installation Permits for new and Modified Major Sources. This document will address regulatory changes to all of the above sections except sections 801 and 806. Regulatory changes to sections 801 and 806 will be discussed in a separate rulemaking notice. Content of Revised Regulations The Allegheny County Health Department, Bureau of Air Pollution Control, made the following changes to the Rules and Regulations of Article XX: 1. Section 101-Definitions The definitions of the following terms were amended to be consistent with EPA's recommended guidance: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), Clear Coat. Bulk Gasoline Plant, Bulk Gasoline Terminal, Capture Efficiency, Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products, Potential Uncontrolled Emission Rate, and Transfer Efficiency.compliance methods to be approved by EPA as a SIP revision. 3. Section 504-Temporary Shutdown of Incineration Equipment This section was amended to replace the term \"auxiliary fuel\" with the term\"natural gas\" to reflect current EPA guidance. 4. Section 505-Surface Coating Processes Subsection A was amended to lower the applicability thresholds for surface coating sources to the following rates: 3 lbs/hour, 15 lbs/day and 2.7 tons/year. In addition, clean-up and purge solvents are now required to be included when determining applicability. Also, the percent reduction equation requires the use of actual solvent density. Subsection B was amended to require the installation of monitoring devices and recordkeeping of specific parameters for surface coating processes for which EPA has issued Control Techniques Guidelines (CTGs). Subsection D was amended to correct the cited section number to 501. Subsection E was amended by changing the emission limits for miscellaneous metal parts (mmp) and products to 3.5 pounds per gallon or .42 kg per liter to be consistent with EPA guidance for extreme performance mmp coatings. 5. Section 506--Alternative Standards for Surface Coatings and Graphic Arts This section was deleted because sourcel which have coatings which do not individually comply with the emission standards will be required to obtain approval as a SIP revision to average their emissions across two or more coating lines. 6. Section 507-Volatile Organic Compound Storage Tanks Subsection B was amended by increasing the VOC reduction requirement for a vapor recovery and disposal system from 80 percent to 90 percent by weight to reduce uncontrolled emissions of VOCs. 2. Section 501-Equivalent Compliance 7. Section 508--Gasoline Loading Techniques Facilities This section was amended to Subsections C and D were amended to eliminate provisions which allowed for specifically include the vapor collection the use of alternative control systems system requirements for gasoline without EPA approvaL Also, the section loading racks and to maintain was revised to include compliance appropriate daily recordkeeping. requirements relating to sources of Subsection E was amended to remove volatile organic compounds and to a throughput exemption of 60,000 establish appropriate recordkeeping, test gallons or more of gasoline, and to adopt methods and procedures consistent with the new requirement for-loading EPA guidance. In addition, this section gasoline tanks at facilities with any requires all alternative or equivalent A stationary storage tanks having acapacity of 250 gallons or more when installed on or after January 1, 1979, or facilities with stationary storage tanks having a capacity of 2,000 gallons or more for tanks installed before January 1, 1979. In addition, this subsection contains an exemption from vapor tightness after all vapors have been disposed of from the dispensing delivery tank. Also, for stationary storage tanks having a capacity of 550 gallon or less and used for agricultural purposes; which are equipped with a submerged fill pipe, are exempt from this provision. Subsection G was amended to make the sentence grammatically correct. The exemption for gasoline tank trucks with a rated capacity of 4,800 gallons or more was deleted from these provisions. Subsection H was amended to require that records be kept for 2 years. 8. Section 512--Compliance Schedules New VOC sources subject to this regulation as of August 26, 1991 were required to be in compliance by August 26, 1992. In Subsection B. grammatical errors were corrected to clarify the .regulation. 9. Section 531-Graphic Arts Systems Subsection A was amended to include sources whose rotogravure and flexographic printing presses have a potential uncontrolled emission rate greater than 100 tons per year of VOC, including emissions from solvents used for clean-up and purging. Subsection B was amended to specify that an emission control system, in conjunction with an emission capture system, should operate with the best overall reduction in VOC emissions from each ink/press. Subsection C was amended to exempt presses which are used to check the quality of the image formation of newly etched or engraved printing cylinders provided that emissions are less than 400 pounds in any 30 day running period. 10. Section 534-Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing- Fugitive Sources Subsection B was amended to require that once a source becomes subject to a regulation it remains subject to the regulation even if its throughput should later fall below the applicability level of the regulation. Subsection C was corrected to include monitoring conditions as part of the detection and repair program for components. EPA's review of these regulatory changes indicates that the Allegheny County Health Department has1L6640 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Proposed Rules corrected the deficiencies and Inconsistencies identified by EPA in its existing VOC regulations. EPA is proposing to approve the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania SIP revision containing the amendments to Article XX, Rules and Regulations of the Allegheny County Health Department, for Air Pollution Control which was submitted on October 16, 1991. The approval of this SIP submittal does not include sections 801 and 806. The Allegheny County Health Department certified that public hearings relatedto these proposed amendments were held on June 5, 1991, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as required by 40 CFR 51.102. EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this notice or on other relevant matters. These comments will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional office listed in the ADDRESSES section of this document. Proposed Action EPA is proposing to approve the revisions to the Allegheny County portion of the Pennsylvania SIP, submitted on October 16, 1991, as meeting the requirements of section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7511 a(a)(2)(4) (RACT fix-up requirement). These revisions includes amendments to sections 101, 501, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 512, 531, and 534 of Article XX, Rules and Regulations of the Allegheny County Health Department, Air Pollution Control, which make the County's regulations consistent with EPA guidance. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant* statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on small businesses, small not- for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the Commonwealth is already imposing.Therefore, because the federal SIP- approval does not Impose any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. See Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). This action which proposes to approve revisions to the Allegheny County portion of the Pennsylvania SIP, and consists of amendments to sections 101,501,504, 505,506, 507, 508, 512, 531, and 534 of Article XX, Rules and Regulations of the Allegheny County Health Department, has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. The Regional Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the SIP revision will be based on whether it meets the requirements of sections 110(a)(2) (A)-(K) and 110(a)(3) and part D of the CAA, as amended, and EPA regulations in 40 CFR part 51.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Maritime Commission proposes to amend its rules to incorporate procedures designed to Implement the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act and the Negotiated Rulemaking Act. These amendments will require timely consideration of the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques to resolve disputes without resort to more costly and time- consuming litigation. DATES: Comments due May 14, 1993. ADDRESSES: Send comments (original and fifteen copies) to: Joseph C. Polking, Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 N. Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20573-0001, 202- 523-5725. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph C. Polking, Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, 202-523-5725. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public Law No. 101-552, the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (\"ADRA\"), and Public Law No. 101-648, the Negotiated Rulemaking Act (\"Reg-Neg\"}, amend the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., to authorize and encourage administrative agencies to permit the voluntary use of consensual alternative dispute resolution (\"ADR\") techniques-such as settlement negotiations, negotiated rulemaking, mediation and arbitration-in order to achieve faster and procedurally less expensive results in agency adjudications, rulemakings, contract disputes and other actions. In enacting the ADRA, Congress indicated that administrative proceedings have become too formal and lengthy and that alternative procedures may in some instances be more efficient. Because ADR procedures are not appropriate in every case, the ADRA sets forth situations in which the agency shall consider not using such procedures. These include precedent- setting cases, those where a formal record is essential, and those where maintenance of established policies is of special importance so that variation among individual decisions is not increased. Similarly, in enacting Reg-Neg, Congress was concerned that traditional rulemaking procedures may discourage16641 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Proposed Rules affected parties from meeting and communicating with each other. As a result, the parties may assume extreme conflicting positions, which can result in costly and time-consuming litigation. Reg-Neg is intended as an alternative process, under which the agency may establish and administer committees under the Federal Advisory Committee Act for the development of consensus positions regarding controversial regulations and policies. Reg-Neg establishes several criteria for the use of negotiated rulemaking. The ADRA requires agencies to adopt a policy that addresses the use of ADR and case manageroent. The ADRA also amends provisions of the APA, at 5 U.S.C. 556(c), which address the role of agency employees presiding at agency hearings. These amendments to the APA prescribe that such presiding officials may (1) hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of the issues by the use of ADR. (2) inform the parties as to the availability of one or more alternative means of dispute resolution, and encourage use of such methods, and (3) require the attendance at any conference held of at least one representative of each party who has authority to negotiate concerning resolution of issues in controversy. The Federal Maritime Commission (\"FMC\" or \"Commission\"), by a separate notice published this date, is issuing an interim Commission policy on ADR, in keeping with the requirements of the ADRA that agencies adopt such a policy. This proposed rulemaking further implements the ADRA and Reg-Neg by proposing amendments to the FMC's Rules of Practice and Procedure to implement the above-described amendments to the APA, and generally to encourage the use of ADR at the Commission to the fullest extent compatible with the law and the agency's mission and resources. Specific proposed changes to the Rules of Practice are discussed below. Scope of Rules Section 502.1 defines the scope of the rules and indicates that they apply to proceedings under the various shipping statutes administered by the Commission. This section already provides that the rules shall be construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every proceeding. This guideline thus applies essentially to all proceedings before the Commission conducted under part 502. In order to emphasize the importance the Commission places on the use of ADRin appropriate circumstances, this rule is proposed to be amended toinclude a reference to the mandatory consideration of the use of ADR in all proceedings. Negotiated Rulemaking A new \u00a7 502.56 is proposed to be added indicating that the Commission, either upon petition of interested persons or upon its own motion, may establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to negotiate and develop consensus on a proposed rule, if, upon consideration of Reg-Neg Act criteria, use of such a committee is determined by the Commission to be in the public interest. Orders Initiating Proceedings Section 502.61 currently requires that orders instituting formal proceedings specify dates for commencement of any hearing and for issuance of the initial and final decisions. The Commission also has had a long-standing policy of including a statement in such orders that oral hearings and cross-examination will be utilized only upon a proper showing that they are necessary for the development of an adequate record. See Informal Statement of Policy, 17 S.R.R. 457 (1977). In order to emphasize this policy of avoiding trial-type hearings, it is proposed that \u00a7 502.61 be amended to codify the requirement of inclusion of such a statement in orders initiating proceedings. It is additionally proposed that this policy be further emphasized by adding to the mandatory language a requirement that \"prior to the commencement of oral hearings, consideration must be given by the parties and the presiding officer to the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution.\" Opportunity for Informal Settlement Section 502.91 currently provides parties an opportunity to submit facts, argument and offers of settlement to the presiding officer without prejudice to their rights. It is proposed that this section be amended to further emphasize the availability of ADR procedures and to encourage their use. A specific provision would be added regarding use of mediators and settlement judges. Prehearing Conferences Section 502.94 currently provides that a presiding officer may direct the parties to a proceeding to attend a prehearing conference to consider various matters designed to expedite the completion of proceedings, including offers of settlement and simplification of the issues. This section is proposed to be amended to require that, at any prehearing conference which is called,consideration be given to whether the use of ADR would be appropriate or useful. Functions and Powers of Presiding Officers Section 502.147 of the FMC's rules describes the functions and powers of presiding officers in formal proceedings. This rule is proposed to be amended to indicate that the presiding officerhas authority to inform the parties as to the availability of one or more alternative means of dispute resolution, to encourage use of such methods, and to require consideration of their use at an early stage of the proceeding. As indicated above, the presiding officer has authority to hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of the issues by consent of the parties. This authority to. promote settlements is proposed to be enhanced by inclusion in this section of a reference to the use of ADR and by including specific authority for transmittal of a request of parties for the appointment of a settlement judge or a mediator, as provided by \u00a7 502.91. The rule is further proposed to be amended to allow the presiding officer to require the attendance at any such conference, pursuant to the ADRA, of at least one representative of each party who has authority to negotiate concerning resolution of issues in controversy. Finally, the provision which allows the presiding officer to permit submissions of facts, arguments, and offers of settlement is proposed to be amended to permit the presiding officer, if the parties so request, to issue informal opinions providing tentative evaluations of the evidence submitted. Although the Commission, as an independent regulatory agency, is not subject to Executive Order 12291, dated February 17, 1981, it nonetheless has reviewed the rule in terms of this Order and has determined that this rule is not a \"major rule\" as defined in Executive Order 12291 because it will not result in: (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment. productivity, innovations, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign- based enterprises in domestic or export markets. The Commission certifies, pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(n), that because this rule deals only with agency16642 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Proposed Rules practice and procedure, it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, including small businesses, small organizational units and small government jurisdictions.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [Docket 93-034-1] Availability of Environmental Assessments and Findings of No Significant Impact Relative to Issuance of Permits to Field Test Genetically Engineered Organisms AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: We are advising'the public that four environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance of permits to allow the field testing of genetically engineered organisms. The environmental assessments provide a basis for our conclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating a plant pest and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its findings of no significant impact, theAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that environmental impact statements need not be prepared. ADDRESSES: Copies of the environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact are available for public inspection at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect those documents are encouraged to call ahead on (202) 690-2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Arnold Foudin, Deputy Director, Biotechnology Permits, Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental Protection, APHIS, USDA, room 850, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436-7612. For copies of the environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact, write to Mr. Clayton Givens at the same address. Please refer to the permit numbers listed below when ordering documents. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation, interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations setforth the procedures for obtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906). In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assessed the impact on the environment that releasing the organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued permits for the field testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting the field tests. Environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared by APHIS relative to the issuance of permits to allow the field testing of the following genetically engineered organisms: Permit No. Permittee Date Issued Organisms Field test location 92-330-02, renewal of North Carolina State Uni- 03-02-93 Tobacco plants genetically engineered to express a North Carolina. permit 91-322-01, Is- versity. coat protein of tobacco etch virus (TEV). on 02-04-92. 92-349-01, renewal of Frito-Lay.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION (rONTACT: Kenneth M. Pusateri or Carole J. Council, at the address above or telephone (202) 208-6400. Dated: March 25, 1993. John T. Conway, Chairman. The Need for Critical Experiment Capability Dated: March 23, 1993. The end of the international competition in manufacture of nuclear weapons, and the transition to largescale dismantling of nuclear weapons, have generated strong pressures to reduce the defense nuclear budget and to close down many defense nuclear facilities and operations. At the same time, the development of firm plans for a Complex 21 to serve future nuclear defense needs has slowed. These trends lead to a possibility that capabilities and functions necessary for current and future needs could be terminated along with those no longer required. One of these, important for the avoidance of certain types of accidents, is support of nuclear criticality control. Because of the importance of avoiding criticality accidents, the Board carefully follows the state of criticality control at DOE's defense nuclear facilities. This interest has been evident as Board members and staff have reviewed practices at the Pantex Plant. The Board believes it is important to maintain a good base of information for criticality control, covering the physical situations that will be encountered in handling and storing fissionable material in the future, and to ensure retaining a community of individuals competent in practicing the control. In the course of retrenchment of its activities In recent years, the Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies have terminated use of all but one of its general purpose facilities for conducting neutron chain- reacting critical experiments with fissionable material. The research at these facilities had served programmatic purposes of diverse DOE programs, as well as laying a general experimental basis for practices that ensure averting criticality accidents. The Board is informedthat there is now a strong possibility that the last DOE facility capable of general purpose critical experiments will be shut down in the near future, due to lack of funding. This possibility arises because no single. program of the Department has an overriding need for this remaining facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and therefore no single program office is motivated to provide its financial support In this period of budget stringency. A certain complacency fed by some years of freedom from criticality accidents seems also to underlie this possibility. The Board observes that the art and science of nuclear criticality control have three principal ingredients. The first is familiarity with factors that contribute to achieving nuclear criticality, and the physical behavior of systbms at and near criticality. This familiarity is developed in individuals only through working with critical systems. It cannot be imparted solelythrough learning theory and using computer codes. The second is theoretical understanding of neutron multiplication processes in critical and subcritical systems, leading to predictability of the critical state of a system by methods that use theory benchmarked against good and well characterized critical experiments. The third is thorough familiarity of nuclear criticality engineers with the first two factors, obtained through a sound program of training that indoctrinates them in the experimental and theoretical aspects. The Board has reviewed the status of benchmarking the theoretical methods of criticality control against existing critical experiments and has found that there are notable failures of theoretical analysis to account for the results of a number of experiments. It is not known whether this discrepancy results from inadequate nuclear data used in the analysis or from inadequate care in conducing the experiments and recording their physical features. Both factors could contribute. In addition, it seems that on the average there may be a small non-conservative bias in overall predictions of the theory. In spite of these shortcomings, conservatism in methods used to develop the limits to be applied during handling and storage of fissionable material seems to have led to adequate safety in recent years. The Board believes that in the interest of continued safety It is important to clear u the existing discrepancies, which are obstacles to confident understanding of criticality control. To do so will require conduct of further neutron chain- reacting critical experiments targeted at the major sources of discrepancy between the theory and the experiments, as well as careful analysis of the experiments. Finally, the Board believes that there is no guarantee that the physical circumstances of handling and storage of fissionable material in the future will always be found in the realm of benchmarked theory. This point is especially important under circumstances that will exist for a number of years to come, with increasing amounts of fissionable material to be stored in a variety of chemical and physical forms. This does not appear to be an appropriate time to eliminate an ability to ensure that such activities will be free of criticality hazard. For safety purposes it will be necessary to retain the capability to perform experiments under conditions not foreseen at this time. This capability once lost would be most difficult to reproduce, and it could be approximated only at great cost and16654 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 I Notices after substantial time, deterring such development even if it were needed badly. For all the above reasons, the Board believes that continuation of an experimental program of general purpose critical experiments is necessary for continued safety in handling and storing fissionable material. It is needed to improve the basis for the methodology. It is needed as part of the process of properly educating criticality control engineers. It *is neededto ensure the capability of answering criticality questions with new and previously researched features. Therefore the Board recommends that: 1. The Department of Energy should retain its program of general purpose critical experiments. 2. This program should normally be directed along lines satisfying the objectives of improving the information base underlying prediction of criticality, and serving in education of the community of criticality engineers. 3. The results and resources of the criticality program should be used in ongoing departmental programs where nuclear criticality would be an important concern. John T. Conway, Chairman.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Mexus is a Texas corporation headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The exported gas would come from production areas in the United States with surplus supplies of natural gas. Mexus states that the short- term nature of the requested authorizatiou protects against the possibility that a national or regional need for the exported gas might develop during the period of the authorization. In deciding whether the proposed export of natural gas is in the public interest, domestic need for the gas to be exported and any other issues determined to be appropriate will be considered, including whether the arrangement is consistent with the DOE policy of promoting competition in the natural gas marketplace by allowing commercial parties to freely negotiate their own trade arrangements. Parties, especially those that may oppose the application, should comment on these issues as they relate to the requested export authority. NEPA Compliance The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPAL 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., requires DOE to give appropriate consideration to the environmental effects of its proposed actions.

It is asserted that the facilities proposed to be abandoned were authorized in Docket No. G-296 on October 1942. It is maintained that the pipeline is located on the Mississippi River and, as a result thereof, presents significant maintenance problems. Southern also requests authorization to abandon service to the Point Lookout Hunting Club since it is the only customer served by the facilities to be abandoned and has consented to the abandonment because it has switched to propane. Southern states that the proposed abandonment would not affect the capacity of Southern's pipeline system or require termination of service to any other customer.

ACTION: Notice of Availability of Pollution Prevention Grants. SUMMARY: EPA is announcing the availability of approximately $4.5 million in FY 93 grant/cooperative agreement funds under the Pollution Prevention Incentives for States grant program. The purpose of this program is to support State, Tribal and regional- basedprogrms that address the reduction or elimination of pollution across all environmental media: air, land, and water. Grants/cooperative agreements will be awarded under the authority of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:. EPA Regional Pollution Prevention' Coordinator. Contact names for each Regional Office are listed under unit IV. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Since its inception in 1989, approximately $20 million has been awarded to 62 State, Tribal, and regional organizations under EPA's multimedia pollution prevention grant program. In March 1989, EPA awarded approximately $4 million to 13 States and one regional organization. At that time, the program was called the Source Reduction and Recycling Technical Assistance (SRRTA) State grant program. In 1990, the program was renamed Pollution Prevention16664 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices Incentives for States (PPIS) to acknowledge EPA's increased emphasis on multimedia pollution prevention. EPA awarded approximately $7 million to 26 State organizations in May 1990 under the PPIS program. In October 1991, $4.5 million was awarded to 16 State agencies and in October 1992, still an additional $3 million was awarded to 16 State agencies. In November 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (the Act) (Public Law 101-508) was enacted, establishing as national policy that pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible. Section 6603 of the Act defines source reduction as any practice that: (i) reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant. or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; and (ii) reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants, or contaminants. EPA further defines pollution prevention as the use of other practices. that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants through: -increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water or other resources, or -protection of natural resources by conservation. Section 6605 of the Act authorizes EPA to make matching grants to States to promote the use of source reduction techniques by businesses. In evaluating grant applications, the Act directs EPA to consider whether the proposed State programs will: (1) Make technical assistance available to businesses seeking information about source reduction opportunities, including funding for experts to provide on-site technical advice and to assist in the development of source reduction plans. (2) Target assistance to businesses for whom lack of information is an impediment to source reduction. (3) Provide training in source reduction techniques. In addition to this grant making authority, the Act authorizes EPA to establish a national source reduction clearinghouse, expands EPA's authority to collect data to better track source reduction activities, and requires EPA to report periodically to Congress on EPA's progress in implementing the Act. 11. Pollution Prevention Strategy In January 1991, EPA formally announced its Pollution PreventionStrategy, a comprehensive document designed to provide guidance and direction for incorporating pollution prevention within EPA's existing regulatory and non-regulatory programs. The Strategy affirms EPA's belief that pollution prevention can benefit both the environment and the economy. The Strategy discusses several activities that form the basis for implementing EPA's program, including identifying and overcoming obstacles to prevention, expanding public participation, enhancing State capabilities in pollution prevention. providing outreach and training, and using the existing regulatory framework to provide incentives for prevention. The Strategy also outlines EPA's approach to facilitating pollution prevention initiatives in several sectors. This includes EPA's 33/50 Project for the industrial sector. The 33/50 Project targets for reduction specific high-risk chemicals jn the industrial sector that are reported and tracked in the Toxics Release Inventory. The Agency is seeking voluntary commitments to reduce environmental releases through prevention practices. EPA's goal is to release aggregate environmental releases of these targeted chemicals by at least 50 percent by 1995. Other sectors being addressed include agriculture,. . transportation, energy, Federal facilities, and consumer. Consistent with the Act, the Strategy includes using State grants to foster exchange of information about source reduction techniques, to disseminate. such information to businesses, and to provide technical assistance to usinesses. m. Availability of FY 93 Funds With this publication, EPA is announcing the availability of approximately $4.5 million in grant/ cooperative agreement funds for FY 1993. The Agency is currently in the process of pursuing a delegation of grant authority to the EPA Regional offices which would formally transfer the decisionmaking authority and awarding process for the PPIS grants to the Regions. Apart from this formal delegation process, the Regional offices will be assuming greater responsibility for the solicitation of interest, screening of proposals and the actual selection of awards. This fifth round of awards will represent a more direct and active Regional role in determining FY '93 awardees. PPIS national guidance will be provided to all applicants, along with any supplemental guidance the Regions may wish to provide. Interested applicants should contact their RegionalPollution Prevention Coordinator for more information. In accordance with the Act, eligible applicants for purposes of funding under this grant program include the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, any agency or instrumentality of a State including State universities and all Federally-recognized Indian tribes. For convenience, the term \"State\" in this notice refers to all eligible applicants. Local governments, private universities, private non-profit entities, private usinesses, and individuals are not eligible. Organizations excluded from applying directly are encouraged to work with eligible applicants in developing proposals that include them as participants in the projects. EPA strongly encourages this type of cooperative arrangement. 1. The Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance. The number assigned to the PPIS program is 66.900. Organizations receiving pollution prevention grant funds are required to match Federal funds by at least 50 percent. For example, the Federal government will provide half of the total allowable cost of the project, the State half of the total allowable cost of the project. A grant request for $100,000 would support a total allowable project cost of $200,000, with the State also providing $100,000. State contributions may include dollars and/or in-kind goods and services. 2. Eligible activities. In general, the purpose of the PPIS grant program is to support the establishment and expansion of State-, regional-, or local- based multimedia pollution prevention programs. EPA specifically seeks to build State pollution prevention capabilities or to test, at the State level, innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies. Funds awarded under the PPISgrant program must be used to support pollution prevention programs that address the transfer of potentially harmful pollutants across all environmental media: air, water, and land. Programs should reflect comprehensive and coordinated pollution prevention planning and implementation efforts State- or region-wide. States might focus on. for example: a. Developing other multimedia pollution prevention activities, including but not limited to: Providing direct technical assistance to businesses; collecting and analyzing data to target outreach and technical assistance opportunities; conducting outreach activities; developing measures to determine progress in pollution16665 Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices prevention; and identifying regulatory and nonregulatory barriers and incentives to pollution prevention and developing plans to implement solutions, where possible. b. Institutionalizing multimedia pollution prevention as an environmental management priority, establishing prevention goals, developing strategies to meet those goals, and integrating the pollution prevention ethic within both governmental and non-governmental institutions of the State or region. c. Initiating demonstration projects that test and support innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies. 3. National eligibility criteria. Proposals accepted for review under this program must qualify as pollution prevention as defined by section 6603 of the Act. In May of 1992, EPA released a \"Statement of Definition\" as the formal embodiment of the Agency's working definition of pollution prevention, consistent with the Act and the Strategy (see unit VI). Copies of this definition are also available through your Regional Pollution Prevention Coordinator. Grant/cooperative agreement applications must address the following national criteria in order to be eligible to apply for an award. a. The proposal should seek to build, State pollution prevention capabilities or test, at the State level, Innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies. b. Multimedia opportunities and impacts should be identified. A multimedia pollution prevention program addresses the prevention of pollution in and across all environmental media (air, land, and water) and endeavors to reduce or eliminate transfers. c. Significant needs of the State or region should be addressed and areas for significant riek reduction are targeted and integrated into overall pollution prevention goals and implementation strategies. Proposals are encouraged to address the goals of EPA's Pollution Prevention Strategy and to support participation in EPA voluntary programs such as Green Lights (fosters use of energy-efficient lighting) or the 33/50 Program. d. The pollution prevention activities of other programs or organizations in the State or region should be integrated and leveraged into the proposed program, as appropriate. Proposed activities augment and complement, pollution prevention activities already underway in the State. e. Measures of success should be identified. There is a reasonableexpectation for significant accomplishments in pollution prevention and there is an adequate system planned for measuring progress with environmental and/or programmatic indicators. f. Proposals should also identify plans for long-term implementation of a multimedia pollution prevention pogram beyond the initial projectfuding period. 4. Program management. Awards for FY 1993 funds will be managed through the EPA Regional Offices. 5. Contact. Interested applicants are requested to contact the appropriate EPA Regional Pollution Prevention Coordinator listed under unit IV to obtain specific instructions and guidance for submitting proposals. For general information on EPA's Pollution Prevention grant program, contact: Lena Hann, Pollution Prevention Division (7409), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260-2237. 6. Other grant programs. EPA's Pollution Prevention Strategy recognizes that there are substantial opportunities to promote prevention in the sectors, including agriculture, energy, and transportation, and commits the Agency to work with other Federal agencies to develop specific strategies for these sectors. To support this goal, EPA has established separate pollution prevention grant progams to target the following sectors with a high potential for risk reduction and for significant gains in pollution prevention: a. Agriculture. EPA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are jointly administering a State grant program focused on sustainable agriculture. The program, Agriculture in Concert with the Environment (ACE), supports initiatives focused on the economic implications of sustainable agriculture, training, demonstrations of promising sustainable farming practices, and research on the effect of agricultural chemicals on wildlife and fish habitat. b. Energy. The U.S. Department of Energy and EPA are jointly managing a State grant program entitled National Industrial Competitiveness through Efficiency: Energy, Environment, and Economics (NICE3). The goals of the NICE3 program are to foster new industrial processes and/or equipment that can significantly reduce the generation of wastes in industry, to improve energy efficiency, and to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. industry. The ACE and NICE3 grant initiatives are funded and managed separately from the PPIS grant program discussed in this notice. For further informationon these programs, please contact the following persons:.ACE: Harry Wells. EPA, (202) 260- 4472 NICE3: Dave Bassett, EPA, (202) 260- 2720 c. Indian tribes. Though Indian tribes are encouraged to apply for a PPIS grant, many may experience difficulty in providing the 50 percent match which is required. Potential applicants from Indian tribes should be aware that as an alternative they are eligible to receive grants/cooperative agreements under EPA's Multimedia Assistance Agreements for Indian Tribes Program. The primary purpose of these multimedia assistance agreements is to directly assist tribes in developing the capacity to manage their environmental programs. Pursuant to Agency policy. pollution prevention should be the strategy of first choice in these programs. Only a 5 percent match is required in this program. Tribal governments should contact the Indian Coordinator in the EPA Regional Offices for more information. IV.

Mediar State Grants In November of 1992, in support of both the Act and the Strategy and to further integrate pollution prevention16666 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 ( Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices into the Agency's existing regulatory programs, EPA released a Guidance for the Integration of Pollution Prevention into Media State Grants. The Agency- wide pollution prevention Guidance, beginning with the FY 1994 State grants cycle has four goals: 1. Promoting pollution prevention in State programs supported through Federal grants by establishing National Principles to guide workplans negotiated between Regional Offices and States. 2. Ensuring that grant requirements as interpreted by EPA/State workplans are flexible enough to support innovative State pollution prevention activities. 3. Establishing a simple accounting process to share information on successful State projects, and identify statutory or other barriers to funding State proposals. 4. Euilaing sustained State capacity in pollution prevention to the extent consistent with statutory grant requirements. The new Guidance is designed to help integrate pollution prevention into the Agency's activities as required by the Act. In other words, it will now be possible, as a result of this guidance to use traditional media State grants to support pollution prevention purposes. By emphasizing flexibility, the Guidance complements other Agency efforts to build a productive environmental management system in partnership with the States, and improve coordination with existing State pollution prevention programs. EPA s FY 1994 grant programs, in conjunction with the States, should build on the Agency's many successful pollution prevention efforts to explicitly promote pollution prevention in State workplans (also called agreements). This Guidance will be incorporated into the annual Agency Operating Guidance as well as program-specific Guidance developed in conjunction with the State/EPA Operations Committee. Program Guidance, intended to tailor the Agency-wide commitment to each grant program, will be applied by EPA Regional offices and States in the development of grant-assisted work. In general, the Guidance applies to all of the Agency's media-specific State grant programs. For further information, or for a copy of the Guidance, contact the Pollution Prevention Policy Staff in the Office of the Administrator, at (202) 260-8621. VI. Definition of Pollution Prevention EPA's \"Statement of Definition\" as released in May of 1992 follows: The following EPA \"Statement of Definition\" Is a formal embodiment of whathas been the Agency's working definition of pollution prevention, and is consistent with the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 and the Agency's 1991 Pollution Prevention Strategy. It makes clear that prevention is our first priority within an environmental management hierarchy that Includes: 1) prevention. 2) recycling . 3) treatment, and 4) disposal or releaf. While it is subject to further refinement, this definition should provide a common reference point for all of us. As you review and apply the definition in your work, please keep the following points in mind: * As always, whether the pollution prevention option is selected in any given situation will depend on the requirements of applicable law, the level of risk reduction that can be achieved, and the cost- effectiveness of that option. * Accordingly, the hierarchy should be viewed as establishing a set of preferences, rather than an absolute judgment that prevention is always the most desirable option. The hierarchy is applied to many different kinds of circumstances that will require judgment calls. Drawing an absolute line between prevention and recycling can be difficult. \"Prevention\" includes what is commonly called \"in-process recycling\", but not \"out-of process recycling.\" Recycling conducted in an environmentally sound manner shares many of the advantages of prevention, e.g. energy and resource conservation, and reducing the need for end-of-pipe treatment or waste containment. As EPA looks at the \"big picture\" in setting strategic directions for the decade ahead, It is clear that prevention is key to solving the problems that all our media programs face. including the increasing cost of treatment and cleanup. In the common-sense words of Benjamin Franklin, \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" Please use the Statement of Definition of Pollution Prevention in all of your EPA activities. POLLUTION PREVENTION: EPA STATEMENT OF DEFINITION (pursuant to the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 and the Pollution Prevention Strategy) Under the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, Congress established a national policy that: * pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible; .pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible; * pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible; and disposal or other release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner. Pollution prevention means \"source reduction\", as defined under the Pollution Prevention Act. and other practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants through:-increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water or other resources, or -protection of natural resources by conservation. The Pollution Prevention Act defines \"source reduction\" to mean any practice which: -reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; and -reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants or contaminants. The term includes: equipment or technology modifications, process or procedure modifications, reformulation or redesign of products, substitution of raw materials, and improvements in housekeeping, maintenance, training, or inventory control. Under the Pollution Prevention Act, recycling, energy recovery, treatment, and disposal are not included within the definition of pollution prevention. Some practices commonly described as \"in process recycling\" may qualify as pollution prevention. Recycling that is conducted in an environmentally sound manner shares many of the advantages of prevention -it can reduce the need for treatment or disposal, and conserve energy and resources. Pollution prevention approaches can be applied to all pollution-generating activity. including energy, agriculture, Federal, consumer as well as industrial sectors. The impairment of wetlands, ground water sources, and other critical resources constitutes pollution, and prevention practices may be essential for preserving these resources. These practices may include conservation techniques and changes in management practices to prevent harm to sensitive ecosystems. Pollution prevention does not include practices that create new risks of concern. In the agricultural sector, pollution prevention approaches Include: -reducing the use of water and chemical inputs; -adoption of less environmentally harmful pesticides or cultivation of crop strains with natural resistance to pests; and -protection of sensitive areas. In the energy sector, pollution prevention can reduce environmental damages from extraction, processing, transport and combustion of fuels. Pollution prevention approaches Include: -increasing efficiency in energy use; -substituting environmentally benign fuel sources; and -design changes that reduce the demand for energy.

SUMMARY: This notice announces EPA's approval of an application for testmarketing exemption (TME) under section 5(h)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and 40 CFR 720.38. EPA has designated this application as TME-93-8. The test marketing conditions are described below. EFFECTIVE DATES: March 18, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Gal A. Cooper, New Chemicals Branch, Chemical Control Division (TS-794), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, rm. E-611, 401 M St. SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260-1855. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 5(hX1) of TSCA authorizes EPA to exempt persons from premanufacture notification (PMN) requirements and permit them to manufacture or import new chemical substances for test marketing purposes if the Agency finds that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the substances for test marketing purposes will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. EPA may impose restrictions on test marketing activities and may modify or revoke a test marketing exemption upon receipt of new information which casts significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activity will not present an unreasonable risk of injury. EPA hereby approves TME-93-8. EPA has determined that test marketing of the new chemical substance described below, under the conditions set out in the TME application, and for the time period and restrictions specified below, will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. Production volume, use, and the number of customers must not exceed that specified in the application. All other conditions and restrictions , described in the application and in this notice must be met. The following additional restrictions apply to TME-93-8.

ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA Is initiating a testing consent agreement development program under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). To allow the Agency to make greater use of enforceable consent agreements (ECAs), EPA conducted an \"open season\" initiative and solicited testing consent agreement proposals for chemical substances or groups of chemicals identified by the public, industry, the Interagency Testing Committee (IT, and EPA as being of mutual concern. Having reviewed the proposals received, EPA is now initiating the formal ECA process for some of the chemical substances/groups. This notice serves three purposes. First, it identifies and gives a tiered priority ranking to those chemical substances or categories of chemical substances for which EPA has chosen to pursue ECA negotiations. Second, it requests interested partieswho want to monitor or participate in negotiations to develop ECAs for the first tier substances to identify themselves to EPA. Third, it outlines proposed target schedules for the first tier of chemical substances. DATES: To be designated an \"interested party\" for the Tier I substances, written notice must be received by EPA on or before April 29, 1993. EPA will contact all interested parties who have expressed a desire to participate in or monitor negotiations in accordance with 40 CFR 790.22(b)(3) to advise them of meeting dates.

L Background On July 17, 1992, (57 FR 31714, document control number OPPTS- 42052K), EPA established an \"open season\" or period of time for industry and others to submit testing consent agreement proposals on any substances for which the Agency has not Issued final test rules. The Agency offered this\"open season\" because EPA has been approached by chemical companies interested in negotiating consent agreements for substances that are, or expected to be, the subject of proposed test rules. EPA's procedures for requiring the testing of chemical substances and mixtures under section 4 of TSCA include the adoption of ECAs and the promulgation of test rules. See 40 CFR part 790. ECAs may be adopted where timely consensus on a testing program can be reached by EPA, affected manufacturers or processors, and other interested parties. If timely consensus cannot be reached or seems unlikely, and the Agency makes certain statutory findings under TSCA, then EPA will issue a test rule under TSCA section 4. This notice describes the ranking of the \"open season\" proposals received and the criteria used in establishing theranking tiers. Additionally, it requests all \"interested parties\" who wish to monitor or participate in testing negotiations for the Tier I substances, listed below, to identify themselves in writing to EPA. As per the July 17, 1992 notice, persons who submitted testing program proposals are already considered \"interested parties\" of record. Ii. Ranking of Testing Proposals The Agency has received 22 testing program proposals for 12 chemical substances and 4 chemical categories. EPA has evaluated all the proposals and, because of the number received, has established three tiers of priorities for handling them. The factors considered in establishing these tiers included: (1) Comparison of the testing program proposal with EPA's views concerning testing needs; (2) the likelihood of success in negotiating an ,ECA; and (3) the Agency's programmatic priorities for action on given chemical substances or categories. Further, while all the proposals have been evaluated and all but one has been ranked, EPA will consider additions or modifications to the proposals in the second and third tier of substances before soliciting interested parties. EPA is interested in further consideration of proposals regarding members of the glycidol and its derivatives category beyond those already identified in Tier H below. The three tiers and the chemical substances under each tier are shown in the following table: Chemical substance CAS No. 1. Tie L Moetadtois / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices Chemical substance CAS not considered favor- able to proceed toward negotlang ECAs.. Carbon Olsufide 75-15-0 Two additional proposals, on Brominated Flame Retardants and the Multi-Chemical Neurotoxicity Endpoint Rules, were submitted after the formal \"open season\" closing date. Both proposals have been evaluated. The Brominated Flame Retardants proposal has not yet been ranked. The proposal submitted regarding the Neurotoxicity Endpoint Rule was concluded to have a low likelihood of success in negotiating an ECA. This conclusion was based on the remote likelihood of achieving a consensus on the many issues raised in the proposal, particularly in developing an agreement on an alternative methodology for memory and learning, and the judgment that any such negotiation would involve significant amounts of time and resources. Further, the voluntary testing proposal restricted the scope of the chemical substances to be tested to only a subset of the substances in EPA's proposed rule. This decision also app lies to the separate proposal received on Tetrahydrofuran (CAS No.109-99-9), which is part of the proposed Multi-Chemical Neurotoxicity Endpoint Rule. EPA has therefore decided to proceed with rulemaking for the chemical substances in the Multi- Chemical Neurotoxicity Endpoint Rule. m. Other Substances Subject to Voluntary Testing The following chemical substances were the subject of offers to conduct voluntary testing through participation in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)/ Screening Information Data Set (SIDS) OECD/SIDS program is a voluntary international testing effort designed to obtain a basic level of test data on chemical substances produced in the largest quantities worldwide. For more information on the OECD/SIDS program, refer to \"For Further Information Contact\" in this notice.EPA has tentatively decided to proceed with the OECD/SIDS voluntary testing p= for the substances listed above and has so informed the offerors. These substances were all designated for riority testing consideration by the teragency Testing Committee (ITC) in its 28th Report. EPA is working with the ITC to have it reconsider its' designations in light of the OECD/SIDS testing offers. If the ITC does not alter its' designations, the Agency will proceed with negotiation of ECAs. IV. Identification of Interested Parties for Tier I Substances EPA is soliciting interested parties to monitor or participate in testing negotiations for the substances listed in Tier L These negotiations will be conducted pursuant to the procedures described in 40 CFR 790.22. Submitters of testing proposals in response to the Federal Register notice of July 17, 1992 are already considered interested parties and do not have to respond to this notice. Additionally, any persons who respond to this notice on or before April 29, 1993 will be given the status of\"interested parties\" and will be afforded opportunities to monitor or participate in the negotiation process. These \"interested parties\" will not incur any obligations by being so designated. Negotiations willbe conducted in meetings open to the public. The negotiation time schedule for each chemical will be established at the first negotiation meeting. If a consent agreement is not established in inciple within the agreed upon time- ame and EPA does not choose to extend the negotiation time period, negotiations will be terminated and testing will be required under a test rule. V. Public Meetings and General Schedules for N-Methylpyrrolidone, Diglycidyl Ether of Bisphenol A, Aryl Phosphates, and Cyclohexane Public meetings will be held to initiate negotiations for the above chemical substances at EPA headquarters, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, from either 9 'a.m. to 12 noon or 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., in Rm. 101, Northeast Mall. Proposed dates for the meetings are shown in the table below. Persons interested in attending these meetings should notify Stephanie Roan, (202) 260-1105, two weeks before the meeting for their specific chemical substance. The deadline to be designated an interested party for all Tier I chemical substances is 30 days from the publication of this notice. Note that the negotiating meeting schedules are staggered to accomodate the varyingcomplexities of the chemical substance proposals and to allow sufficient time for all parties to reach consensus. EPA will use its best effort to send a draft consent agreement to each of the interested parties approximately three weeks before the public meeting for their particular chemical substance. Further, to facilitate attendance at these meetings, EPA will contact all interested parties who have expressed a desire to participate in or monitor negotiations and advise them of the exact meeting dates and times. The Agency expects to reach agreement in principle within 8 weeks of these public meetings. The following is a tentative general meeting schedule to initiate negotiations for the Tier I chemical substances: Chemical Substance Meeting Date N-Methylyolldone .......

ACTION: Notice of interim alternative dispute resolution (\"ADR\") policy and opportunity for comment. SUMMARY: The Federal Maritime Commission (\"Commission\") has developed an interim policy describing how it intends to implement the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act and the Negotiated Rulemaking Act. The Commission's policy is designed to encourage the consensual use of ADR mechanisms to resolve disputes, in appropriate circumstances. DATES: Comments are due by May 14, 1993. ADDRESSES: Send comments (original and 15 copies) to: Joseph C. Polking, Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20573-0001, (202) 523-5725. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:. Joseph C. Polking, Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, (202) 523-5725. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public Law 101-552, the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (\"ADRA\"), and Public Law 101-648, the Negotiated Rulemaking Act (\"Reg-Neg\"), amend the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., to authorize and encourage administrative agencies to permit the voluntary use of consensual ADR mechanisms--such as settlement negotiations, negotiated rulemaking, mediation and arbitration-in order to achieve faster and less expensive results in agency adjudications, rulemakings, contract disputes and other actions. ADR procedures may not be appropriate in every case. Section 5 U.S.C. 572(b) of the ADR sets forth situations in which the agency shall consider not using ADR, including precedent-setting cases, those where a formal record is essential, and those where maintenance of established policies Is of special importance so that variation among individual decisions is not increased. Reg-Neg is intended as an alternative to the traditional rulemaking process, under which the agency may establish and administer committees under the Federal Advisory Committee Act for the development of consensus positions regarding controversial regulations and policies. Reg-Neg establishes several criteria for the use of negotiated rulemaking, including: (1) There are a limited number of identifiable interests;16681 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices (2) these can be adequately represented; (3) the parties are willing to negotiate in good faith; (4) the agency has the resources to undertake the process: and (5) the agency is committed to use the result of the negotiation in formulating a proposed rule if at all possible. The ADRA specifically requires agencies to adopt a policy that addresses the use of alternative means of dispute resolution and case management It also requires that a senior agency official be designated as the agency's Dispute Resolution Specialist and that training be provided for that official and for other employees involved in implementing that agency's policy on ADR. The Secretary of the Commission has been designated as the agency's Dispute Resolution Specialist and is responsible for coordinating the Commission's ADR activities and procedures. Inquiries and suggestions regarding the Commission's ADR functions may be made to the Dispute Resolution Specialist ((202) 523-5725). The Dispute Resolution Specialist and the Chief Administrative Law Judge have attended training on the theory and practice of ADR. Similar training Is being provided to other Commission employees whose responsibilities will call for consideration of the use of ADR. The Commission has developed an interim ADR policy which is described below. Interested persons are encouraged to comment on this policy statement and to provide suggestions for other specific uses of ADR at the Commission or other procedures to facilitate the use of ADR. ADR Policy and Procedures It is the Commission's policy to encourage the use of ADR to the fullest extent compatible with the law and the agency's mission and resources. Commission employees and all other persons involved in disputes before the Commission are required to consider at an early stage whether the use of ADR techniques would be appropriate and useful in a particular matter. Prior to enactment of the ADRA the Commission already had in place several different alternative methods for resolving disputes without resort to formal hearings. In consultation with the Administrative Conference of the United States and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Commission has developed additional procedures designed to enhance the use of ADR. The Commission envisions that the application of these procedures could be enlarged even further as experience is gained and welcomessuggestions from the public in this r e Commission's policy regarding the use of ADR is reflected in the following rules and proceduresI General philosophy. Rule I of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, which defines the scope of the rules, states that all of the Commission's rules \"shall be construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every proceeding.\" 46 CFR \u00a7 502.1. This guideline thus applies to all proceedings before the agency conducted under Part 502. In order to emphasize the importance the Commission places on the use of ADR in appropriate circumstances Rule I includes a reference to the mandatory consideration of the use of ADR in all proceedings. ADR concepts also can be promoted by application of Rule 10 which states that the requirements of a particular rule may be waived \"to prevent undue hardship, manifest injustice, or if the expeditious conduct of business so requires.\" 46 CFR 502.10. Time limits for hearings and decisions; avoidance of oral hearings. In orders Instituting a formal investigation or noticing the filing of a complaint, the Commission specifies dates for commencement of any hearing, and issuance of the initial decision and final Commission decisions. 46 CFR 502.61. Further, it is the policy of the Commission to seek to avofd costly and time-consuming litigation by prov Ilng in all orders initiating proceedings that: prior to the commencement of oral hearings. consideration must be given by the parties and the presiding officer to the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution. Hearings shall Include oral testimony and cross-examination, in the discretion of the presiding officer, only upon proper showing that there are geouine issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of sworn statements, affidavits, depositions, or other documents or that the nature of the matter in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross- examination are necessary for the development of an adequate record. Opportunityfor settlements. The Commission encourages settlements of formal proceedings. Interested parties are urged to make use of all the procedures set forth in the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure which are designed to simplify or avoid formal litigation and to assist the parties in reaching settlements. Parties may submit facts, argument and offers of settlement to the presiding officer without preudice to ISome of the procedures described herein are the subject of a proposed rulemaking in Docket No. 93-- 06. and have not yet been adopted.their rights. In addition, the rules specifically provide for the consensual use of settlement judges and mediators to assist the parties in achieving a settlement. 46 CFR 502.91. Prehearing conferences. Under the Commission's rules, the Commission or a presiding officer may direct the parties to a formal proceeding to attend a prehearing conference,.at which there may be considered the following: Offers of settlement; simplification of the issues; use of admissions of fact and documents that will avoid unnecessary proof limitation on the numbers of witnesses; and consolidation of the examination of witnesses by counsel. 46 CFR 502.94(a). This rule also provides that, at anyprehearing conference which is called. consideration be given to whether the use of ADR would be appropriate or useful. Informal conferences may be called at any time during a proceeding for similar purposes. 46 CFR 502.94(b). Functions and powers of presiding officers. Rule 147 of the Commission's rules describes the functions and powers of presiding officers in formal proceedings. This rule provides that the presiding officer has authority to inform the parties as to the availability of one or more alternative means of dispute resolution, to encourage use of such methods, and to require consideration of their use at an early stage of theroceeding. As indicated in paragraph (d) of this section, the presiding officer has authority to hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of the issues by consent of the parties. This authority to promote settlements is further enhanced by the inclusion in this rule of a reference to the use of ADR and of a 1rvision for transmittal of a request of parties for the appointment of a settlement judge or a mediator, as provided by \u00a7502.91. The rule further allows the presiding officer to require the attendance at any such conference, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 556(c)(8), of at least one representative of each party who has authority to negotiate concerning resolution of issues in controversy. Finally, the presiding officer is permitted, if the parties so request. to issue informal opinions providing tentative evaluations of the evidence submitted. 46 CFR 502.147. Negotiated rulemaking. The Commission's rules dealing with rulemaking procedures specifically .authorize the use of negotiated rulemaking. This rule provides that the Commission, either upon petition of interested persons or upon its own motion, may establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to negotiate and develop consensus on a proposed rule,16682 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices if the Commission, upon consideration of Reg-Neg criteria, determines that use of such a committee would be in the public interest. 46 CFR 502.56. Informal procedure for adjudication of small claims. The Commission provides an informal procedure for adjudication of claims for $10,000 or less. Similar to binding arbitration, this procedure is conducted by a settlement officer. The record consists of written record and argument. The decision of the settlement officer is not subject to appeal by the parties, but may be reviewed by the Commission on its own motion. 46 CFR 502.301-305. Shortened procedure. For claims over $10,000, the Commission offers a shortened procedure whereby the parties may consent to have the complaint resolved by an administrative law judge upon a written record without oral hearing. The parties have the right to appeal the Initial decision to the Commission. 46 CFR 502.181-187. Nonadjudicatory investigations. The Commission conducts nonadjudicatory fact-finding investigations to aid it in discharging its responsibilities and in determining whether formal rulemakings or adjudicatory investigations are necessary. Such investigatory proceedings are usually non-public and voluntary cooperation is encouraged. 46 CFR 502.281-291. Conciliation service. The Commission provides a conciliation service under the direction of the Dispute Resolution Specialist. This procedure requires the consent of the parties to the particular dispute, and provides for the appointment of a conciliator who prepares a non-binding advisory opinion for the guidance of the parties. 46 CFR 502.401-406. Civil penalty settlement and compromise procedures. In formal, docketed proceedings, the parties may enter into settlements whereby a civil penalty for statutory violations is agreed to. Such settlement agreements must be approved by the presiding officer and are subject to review by the Commission. As an alternative to formal adjudications, the Commission's Bureau of Hearing Counsel is authorized to conduct compromise negotiations which may result in an agreement for the payment of a civil penalty without admission of violations of law. 46 CFR 505.1-505.5. This form of dispute resolution has been widely used at the Commission and has successfully resulted in the avoidance of many possible protracted formal adjudications. Informal inquiries and complaints. The Commission's Office of Informal Inquiries, Complaints and InformalDockets is available to assist shipping consumers and small businesses in resolving informal complaints, difficulties and misunderstandings with ocean carriers, terminal operators, freight forwarders, port -authorities and other persons. Aggrieved persons or entities are encouraged to avail themselves of this assistance prior to or in lieu of initiating formal proceedings. The Office can be contacted at (202) 523-5807. .Use of nonattorneys. Section 9 of the ADRA requires each agency to develop a policy with regard to the representation by nonattorneys of parties in ADR proceedings. The Commission's rules permit practice before the agency on behalf of others by qualified nonattorneys who have been admitted to practice. 46 CFR 502.27- 502.31. Practice is defined very broadly to include the rendering of advice and assistance in the presentation of any matter before the Commission, not just ADR proceedings. Persons may also appear on behalf of themselves or on behalf of their employer without having been admitted to practice. 46 CFR 502.27(c). The ADRA also requires that each agency that permits nonattorneys to practice shall ensure that any rules pertaining to disqualification of attorneys also apply, as appropriate, to other persons who provide representation or assistance. The Commission's rules at 46 CFR 502.30, regarding suspension or disbarment from practice, have equal application to attorneys and nonattorneys. Contract review. The ADRA requires each agency to review its standard agreements for contracts, grants, and other assistance and to determine whether to amend such agreements to authorize and encourage the use of ADR techniques. This provision has limited application to the Commission in that the agency provides no grants or other assistance. In regard to the few contracts that the Commission utilizes, the agency in the past has included standard Federal Acquisition Regulation (\"FAR\") procedures regarding resolution of disputes that may arise about the contracts. The ADRA requires that within one year the FAR be amended, as necessary, to carry out the Act. All future Commission contracts will conform to the amended FAR In regard to resolution of disputes. Miscellaneous. Either party to a filed service contract may request permission to correct clerical or administrative errors appearing in the contract's essential terms. 46 CFR 581.7(b). The Commission oversees the obligation of carrier conferences to provide for independent neutral body policing if aconference member so requests, to provide for a shipper consultation process, and to establish procedures for promptly and fairly considering shippers' requests and complaints. 46 U.S.C. 1704(b)(4)-(6).

ACTION: Notice of a Matching Program- Between HCFA and the Oregon Bureau of Worker's Compensation-HCFA will receive information from the State concerning work-related injuries and diseases. SUMMARY: Section 1862(b)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395(b)(2)) prohibits Medicare payment with respect to any item or service to the extent that payment has been made. or can reasonably be expected to be made promptly, under a workers' compensation law or plan of the United States or a State. HCFA has developed a model agreement to be used in negotiating individual agreements with State Workers' Compensation Boards. This agreement will allow HCFA to seek recovery of identified mistaken payments that are the liability of workers' compensation agencies. The matching report set forth below is in compliance with the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (Pub. L No. 100-503). EFFECTIVE DATE: No match will begin sooner than 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register. (April 29, 1993), and a copy of the model'Data Match Agreement will be sent to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, the House Committee on Government Operations and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

ADDRESSES: Please address comments to: Richard A. DeMeo, HCFA Privacy Act Officer, Health Care Financing Administration, Office of Budget and Administration, Room 2-H-4, East Low Rise Building, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21207-5187. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Herb Shankroff, Division of Operational Initiatives, Bureau of Program Operations, Room 368 Meadows East Building, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21207-5187. His telephone number is 410-966-7171. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: One of the priorities of HCFA is to encourage high quality and effective health care while pursuing strategies to contain or moderate health care costs and Medicare program expenditures. As required by the Social Security Act, one approach that HCFA employs to limit Medicare expenditures is the implementation of the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) provisions (42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)). HCFA primarily relies upon providers, physicians or other suppliers, and beneficiaries themselves, to identify situations where payment should be made by workers' compensation. In addition, Medicare contractors are instructed to identify and investigate claims for which the diagnosis or procedure is suggestive of accidental injury or of work-related illness. Often, however, Medicare contractors are unaware of the availability of workers' compensation and make primary payment by mistake. In these situations, the Medicare contractors must recover the mistaken primary payments to restore them to the Medicare Trust Funds. The identification of MSP situations and the recovery of mistaken Medicare payments frequently entails demonstrating to the other third party payer, such as a workers' compensation agency, its primary liability under 42 U.S.C. 1395y(b). The purpose of this matching program is to allow HCFA to identify workers' compensation cases that otherwise have gone undetected by the Medicare contractors. HCFA will receive, on a quarterly basis, computer listings of approved workers' compensation cases from the State of Oregon. These listings will be matched against the Carrier Medicare Claims Records (System of Records No. 09-70-0501) and the Intermediary Claims Records (System of Records No. 09-70-0503). After the match, HCFA will further develop the situation and determine whether a mistaken payment ofMedicare funds has been made. Such \"determinations generate demand letters to the identified insurer or payer. If the insurer or payer proves that it did pay primary, in addition to Medicare's mistaken primary payment, the beneficiary or provider is contacted by Medicare with a request for return of the duplicate payment. At this time, the beneficiary or provider will be provided an opportunity to respond to HCFA's finding that a mistaken payment was made and will be given an explanation of appeal rights. The determination that the beneficiary or provider Is responsible to refund Medicare is subject to all the appropriate Medicare review and due process rocedures. In addition, HCFA wil add what is known as an auxiliary record indicating those beneficiaries identified as being entitled to workers' compensation. This will prevent future erroneous Medicare payments. The Privacy Act permits disclosure of information from HCFA's records without a beneficiary's consent if the information is used for purposes that are consistent with the purpose for which the information was collected, such as establishing a beneficiary's claim for Medicare benefits and determining the correct amount of the Medicare payment. The information must also be collected and used in a manner consistent with Privacy Act procedures. Disclosure of information is permitted when the benefit of the use of the information outweighs the effect, or risk of an effect, on the privacy of individuals. Set forth below is the information required by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (Putt. L. No. 100-503). A copy of this notice will be provided to the Chairman of the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Chairman of the Committee on Government Affairs of the Senate and the Acting Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in OMB.

Ms. Sheryl Barrett at the above Reno, Nevada, address (Telephone: 702-784- 5227). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure self-sustaining members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to theUnited States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for the conservation of the species, establish criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans. The Mojave population of the desert tortoise occurs north and west of the Colorado River in parts of Inyo, Kern, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Imperial Counties in California; the western part of Mohave County in Arizona; Clark County. and the southern parts of Esmeralda, Nye, and Lincoln Counties in Nevada; and part of Washington County, Utah. The- principle causes of decline for this species are deterioration and loss of habitat, collection for pets or other purposes, elevated levels of predation, loss of desert tortoises from disease, and the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms to protect desert tortoises and their habitat. The recovery strategy includes: (1) Identification of six desert tortoise recovery units; (2) establishment of a system of Desert Wildlife Management Areas (DWMAs) within recovery units where management actions are recommended to effect recovery; and (3) implementation of specific recovery actions within DWMAs. Desert tortoise habitat is administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service; United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Bureau of Reclamation; United States Department of Defense; and other Federal, State, and local entities. Public Comments Solicited The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified will be considered prior to approval of the plan.16691 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices Authority The authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(0.

(Canstar USA) and certain of Its retail dealers who are unnamed co- conspirators, had, beginning at least as early as February 1990 and continuing at least through November 1990, engaged in a combination and conspiracy, in violation of Section I of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1, to fix the retail price of hockey skates with V2 blades (V2 skates) sold by Canstar USA to retail dealers throughout the United States. The complaint alleges that, in furtherance of this conspiracy, Canstar USA: (a) Established and communicated to retail dealers a minimum retail price for V2 skates purchased from Canstar USA; and (b) Obtained agreements from retail dealers to maintain the minimum retail price as a condition of receiving and continuing to receive V2 skates from Canstar USA. The complaint also alleges that as a result of the combination and conspiracy, retail prices of hockey skates with V2 blades have been fixed and maintained, and competition in sales of V2 skates has been restrained. The complaint seeks an adjudication that the alleged combination and conspiracy is illegal, and an injunction to enjoin Canstar USA from continuing or renewing the alleged combination or conspiracy and prohibiting Canstar USA from engaging in any combination or conspiracy or adapting any practice or plan having a similar purpose or effect. The United States and Canstar USA have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after16696 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices compliance with the APPA, unless the United States withdraws its consent. The Court's entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate the action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction over the matter for possible further proceedings to construe, modify or enforce the Judgment, or to punish violations of any of its provisions. II Description of Practices Giving Rise to the Alleged Violation of the Antitrust Laws Canstar USA, a Vermont corporation, is a leading seller of hockey skates in the United States. Hockey skates sold by Canstar USA are manufactured in Canada by Canstar USA's parent corporation. Canstar USA sells hockey skates to retail dealers which in turn sell them to consumers. In or about February 1990, Canstar USA began to announce its \"1990 Advertising and Distribution Policy for Select Professional Products\" (Policy) to its retail dealers. The Policy covered the sale of Bauer 2000 and Mega 10-90 hockey skates with a V2 blade option (V2 skates) to the general public. The V2 skate represented a new design in that its stainless steel V2 blade was tapered to permit greater speed, agility and maneuverability. The Policy announced a suggested retail price and a discount price (or minimum retail price) for V2 skates and provided that retailers who advertised V2 skates below the minimum resale price would have their allocation of such skates interrupted without prior notice for 90 days for a first violation, 180 days for a second violation, and an indefinite number of days (but in no event less than 180 days) for a third or more violations. After its announcement of the Policy, Canstar USA obtained agreements from certain retailers. to maintain a minimum retail price on these skates. An investigation into Canstar USA's Policy was begun by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice in mid 1990. In November 1990. Canstar USA advised its retail dealers by letter that it had not implemented any of the restrictions outlined in Its Policy and that it was cancelling the Policy, effective December 1, 1990. III Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment The parties have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment, In the form they negotiated, may be entered by the Court at any time after compliance with the APPA. The proposed FinalJudgment states that it shall not constitute an admission by either party with respect to any issue of fact or law. The proposed Final Judgment enjoins any direct or indirect continuation or renewal of the type of conspiracy alleged in the complaint. Specifically, Section IV enjoins and restrains the defendant from entering Into, adhering to, maintaining, furthering, or enforcing any contract, agreement, understanding. plan or program with any retail dealer to fix or maintain the resale prices at which hockey skates sold or distributed by the defendant may be sold or offered for sale in the United States by any retail dealer. Section IV provides that nothing in the section shall be deemed to prohibit the defendant from adopting suggested resale prices of hockey skates, communicating such prices to retail dealers or terminating, unilaterally and without any agreement or understanding with any other person, any dealer that departs from the suggested resale price. Section V of the proposed Final Judgment requires the defendant to send notices and copies of the Judgment to each retail dealer who participated in or received information from the defendant regarding its Policy and to each retail dealer who purchased V2 skates from Canstar in either 1991 or 1992. In addition, the defendant is required to send notice and copies of the Judgment to every other retail dealer who purchases V2 skates from Canstar USA within three years of the date of entry of the proposed Final Judgment. The defendant is also required to furnish a copy of the Judgment to each of its officers and directors and each of its non-clerical employees, representatives, or agents with supervisory or direct responsibility for the sale or advertising of hockey skates in the United States. In addition, the proposed Final Judgment provides methods for determining and securing the defendant's compliance with its terms. Section VI provides that, upon request of the Department of Justice, the defendant shall submit written reports, under oath, with respect to any of the matters contained in the Judgment. Additionally, the Department of Justice is permitted to inspect and copy all books and records, and to interview officers, directors, employees and agents of the defendant. Section VIU makes the Judgment effective for ten years from the date of its entry. Section IX of the proposed Final Judgment states that entry of the Judgment is in the public interest. Under the provisions of the APPA. entry of the proposed Final Judgment isconditional upon a determination by the Court that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest. The Government believes that the proposed Final Judgment is fully adequate to prevent the continuation or recurrence of the violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act alleged in the Complaint, and that disposition of this proceeding without further litigation is appropriate and in the public interest. IV Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigants Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited by the antitrust laws may ring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages the person has suffered, as well as costs and reasonable attorney fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair not assist the bringing of any private antitrust damage action. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the proposed Final Judgment hag no prima facie effect in any subsequent private lawsuit that may be brought against the defendant. V Procedures Available for Modification of the Proposed Final Judgment The United States and the defendant have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court after compliance with the provisions of the APPA, provided that the United States has not withdrawn its consent. The APPA provides a period of at least 60 days preceding the effective date of the proposed Final Judgment within which any person may submit to the United States written comments regarding the proposed Final Judgment. Any person who wants to comment should do so within 60 days of the date of publication of this Competitive Impact Statement in the Federal Register. The United States will evaluate the comments, determine whether it should withdraw its consent, and respond to the comments. The comments and the response of the United States will be filed with the Court and published In the Federal Register. Written comments should be submitted to: Ralph T. Giordano. New York Office, Antitrust Division, United States Department of Justice, room 3630, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York 10278. Under section VIII of the proposed Final Judgment, the Court will retain jurisdiction over this matter for the16697 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices purpose of enabling any of the parties to apply to the Court for such further orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate for the construction, implementation, modification, or enforcement of the Judgment, or for the punishment of any violations of the Judgment. VI Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment The alternatives to the proposed Final Judgment considered by the Government were (1) a full trial on the merits and on relief and (2) a Judgment containing relief ancillary to that provided in the proposed Final Judgment. In the view of the Government, such litigation would involve substantial cost to the United States and is not warranted because the proposed Final Judgment provides appropriate relief against the violations alleged in the complaint. The Government also believes that ancillary provisions are not necessary to achieve fully adequate and appropriate relief against any future violations of the nature alleged in the complaint. VII Determinative Materials and Documents No materials or documents were determinative in formulating the proposed Final Judgment. Consequently, the Government has not attached any such materials or documents to the proposed Final Judgment. Dated: Now York, New York, March 17, 1993. Respectfully submitted, Philip F. Cody, John H. Clark, Jeffrey J. Corrigan, Attorney, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, room 3630,26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York 10278, (212)264-0394. 93-7273 Filed 3-29-93; 8:45 am] BILUNG CODE 4410-01-M Proposed Modification of Final Judgment Notice is hereby given that defendant, Southern Pine Inspection Bureau (\"SPIEB\"), has filed with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana a motion to modify the Judgment in United States v. Southern Pine Association, et al., Civil Action No. 275, and that the Department of Justice (\"Department\"), in a stipulation also filed with the Court, has consented to modification of the Judgment but has reserved the right towithdraw its consent for at least seventy (70) days after the publication of this notice. The complaint in this case (filed February 21, 1940) alleged that the Southern Pine Association (\"SPA\") and its lumber company members had fixed prices, curtailed output, enforced an agreed policy of distribution and excluded others from engaging in trade and commerce. On February 21, 1940, a Judgment was entered against the SPA and its members which inter alia created the SPIB as a separate entity to perform lumber grading and standards activities. In 1969, the Judgment was amended to allow SPIB to incorporate in Louisiana as a non-profit corporation. SPIEB proposes to make three technical amendments to the 1940 Judgment: The first would allow SPIB to incorporate in any state it desires, not just Louisiana; the second would make two changes in the SPIB Board of Governors membership and selection designed to allow a mix of Governors representing both large corporate lumber mills, and smaller proprietary (or family) lumber mills; the third would delete a provision, never used, which allowed certain trade associations to claim a seat on the Board of Governors of SPIB. The Department has filed with the court a memorandum setting forth the reasons why the Government believes that modification of the Judgment would serve the public interest. Copies of the Complaint and Judgment, SPIB'S motion papers, the stipulation containing the Government's consent, the Department's memorandum and all further papers filed with the court in connection with this motion will be available for Inspection at room 3233, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 10th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20530, and at the Office of the Clerk of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, 500 Camp Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70130. Copies of any of these materials may be obtained from the Antitrust Division upon request and payment of the copying fee set by Department of Justice regulations. Interested persons may submit comments regarding the proposed modification of the decree to the Government. Such comments must be received by the Division within sixty (60) days and will be filed with the court by the Government. Comments should be addressed to Gary R.

USAir Group, Inc.; Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16 (b)-(h), that a proposed Final Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in United States v. USAir Group, Inc., Civil Action No. 93-0530. The proposed Final Judgment is subject to approval by the Court after the expiration of the statutory 60-day public comment period and compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16 (b)-(h). The complaint in this case alleges that the effect of proposed transactions between USAir Group, Inc. (\"USAir\") and British Airways, Plc (\"British Airways\"), pursuant to which British Airways has invested $300 million In USAir for approximately 20 percent of USAir's stock and the two carriers will initiate joint operations to provide U.S.- London air transportation services, may be substantially to lessen competition in the provision of non-stop scheduled airline passenger service between Philadelphia and London and the Baltimore/Washington metropolitan area and London, and in the provision of scheduled airline passenger service between interior U.S. points and London, in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18. By international agreement, airline service between the United States and London may be operated only from certain designated gateway cities, and the number of airlines that may serve each gateway is limited. USAir and British Airways are the only two airlines permitted to provide nonstop service on the Philadelphia-London routes and are two of three airlines permitted to serve the Baltimore/Washington-London route. In addition, the two airlines are among eight U.S. or British airlines that can provide connecting or one-stop service to passengers travelling between London and cities located in the Eastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The proposed Final Judgment requires USAir to sell to another U.S. Airline its authority to serve London from each of its -three gateways (Philadelphia, Baltimore/Washington16698 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices and Charlotte) within 45 days of the date it and British Airways begin joint operations from that gateway. The proposed Final Judgment further provides that if such sale is not made, USAir must surrender its authority to serve the route to the United States Department of Transportation which can then designate another United States airline to serve the route. Public comment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments, and responses thereto, will be published in the Federal Register and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Mark C. Schechter, Chief, Transportation. Energy, and Agriculture Section, Antitrust Division.

Defendant shall abide by and comply with the provisions of the Final Judgment pending entry of the Final Judgment; 4. This Stipulation and the Final Judgment to which it relates are for settlement purposes only and do not constitute an admission by defendant in this or any other proceeding that section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18, or any other provision of law has been violated; 5. In the event plaintiff withdraws its consent or if the proposed Final Judgment is not entered pursuant to this Stipulation, this Stipulation shall be of no effect whatever, and the making of this Stipulation shall be without prejudice to any party in this or any other proceeding.

X Termination This Final Judgment will expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of its entry. XI Public Interest Entry of this Final Judgment is in the public interest. Competitive Impact Statement Pursuant to section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (\"APPA\"), 15 U.S.C. 16 (b)-(h), the United States of America files this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment submitted for entry with the consent of USAir Group, Inc. in this civil antitrust proceeding. I Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding On March 15, 1993, the United States filed a Complaint alleging that a proposed partial stock acquisition of USAir Group, Inc. (hereafter \"USAir\") by British Airways Plc (hereafter \"BA\") and proposed joint operation between the two companies would violate section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18). The Complaint alleges that the effect of the transaction may be substantially to lessen competition in the provision of scheduled airline passenger service and nonstop scheduled airline passenger service in various U.S.-London city pair markets. Both USAir and BA provide such service. The Complaint seeks, among other relief, a permanent injunction ordering USAir to divest its authority to provide nonstop scheduled airline passenger service between Baltimore and London, between Philadelphia and London and between Charlotte and London. On March 15, 1993, the United States and the defendant filed a Stipulation by which they consented to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment designed to eliminate the anticompetitive efforts of the transportation. Under the proposed Final Judgment, as explained more fully below, USAir would be required to sell, within 45 days of its beginning to operate code-sharing service with BA from any of its getaways, its authority to fly scheduled passenger service from the gateway to London. If it should fail to do so, and the United States, in its sole discretion, has not granted a request by defendants for additional time to effect16700 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices the divestiture, the route authority would be surrendered by USAir to the Department of Transportation for designation of other U.S. airlines to serve these routes. The United States and the defendant have agreed that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with the APPA. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate the action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction to construe, modify, and enforce the Final Judgment, and to punish violations of the Final Judgment. H Events Giving Rise to the Alleged Violation A. The Proposed Transaction On January 21, 1992, USAir and BA entered into an agreement whereby BA acquired approximately 20% of USAir's equity for $300 million. USAir and BA have also agreed to begin jointly providing connecting air service between interior U.S. points and London using shared airline designator codes. USAir flights between interior U.S. points and the Baltimore, Philadelphia, Charlotte and Pittsburgh gateways will be designated with a BA flight number for connections to BA flights between the gateways and London. In addition, the agreement permits BA to make additional stock purchases and acquire more control over USAir within the next 5 years, to the extent permitted by U.S. law. If BA makes the additional purchases, the two companies have agreed to further integrate their operations. B. Analysis The Complaint alleges that the proposed transaction would violate section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18) because its effect will be to lessen competition between USAir and BA in the provision of scheduled airline passenger service and the provision of nonstop scheduled airline passenger service in multiple U.S.-London city pair markets, and may be substantially to lesson competition generally in the provision of such service. Air transportation between the United States and London is governed by a bilateral air services agreement between the governments of the United States and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (\"U.K.\") pursuant to which air service must be provided via a limited number of gateway cities. The bilateral also limits the number of airlines allowed to provide nonstop service between two gateways (usually to one airline from each country), andthe number of flights each airline may provide. As a result, service to all non- gateway points must connect or stop at a gateway. most people travelling between U.S. .cities and London have no substitute for scheduled airline passenger service to which they could turn if there were a small but significant and nontransitory increase in the price of scheduled airline passenger service. Scheduled airline passenger service can be provided either without stops at intermediate points or with stops or changes of planes at one or more intermediate points. Many passengers are particularly time-sensitive and value the greater speed and reliability provided by nonstop service. Such passengers would not substitute one- stop or connecting service for nonstop service in response to a small but significant and nontransitory increase in the price of nonstop service. BA serves London on a nonstop basis from fourteen U.S. gateways, including Philadelphia and Baltimore/ Washington. It is the largest provider of U.S.-London scheduled passenger air transportation, providing approximately 38% of all seats offered on nonstop flights between U.S. gateways and London. It provides service to non- gateway U.S. points through Interline connections with flights operated by U.S. airlines. USAir serves London from three U.S. gateways: Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Charlotte. It provides roughly 3% of all nonstop seats offered between the U.S. and London. The complaint alleges that USAir and BA compete in the provision of two relevant products, each offered in multiple geographic markets. First, they are the only two airlines providing nonstop service in the Philadelphia- London city pair, and two of only three airlines providing nonstop service between Baltimore/Washington and London. Second, they compete in providing one-stop or connecting scheduled airline passenger service between nongateway U.S. points, particularly those located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. regions, and London. USAir and BA are two of eight U.S. or British carriers authorized to serve London from eastern U.S. gateways at which passengers travelling to and from points in the Northeastern and Mid- Atlantic regions of the U.S. could make convenient connections to London. As measured by the number of seats on nonstop flights operated from the gateways offering reasonably convenient connections for northeastern passengers (Boston, New York, Newark, Philadelphia and Baltimore/Washington), the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of concentration for scheduled airline passenger service between northeastern U.S. cities and London is 2150. A combination of BA's 38% market share of available seats and USAir's 4.5% market share of available seats would increase the HI by 349 to 2499. Mid-Atlantic passengers can conveniently travel via Charlotte and Atlanta in addition to the northeastern gateways listed above. Using capacity measures (i.e., seats available on nonstop flights), a combination of BA and USAir would increase the HHI from 1993 to 2459. Using gateway capacity (i.e., seats available on nonstop flights from gateways serving the region) to measure changes in concentration may overstate the adverse effects of this transaction on competition for interior U.S. passengers, however. BA is not permitted under the bilateral agreement to operate service to interior U.S. points on its own aircraft (i.e., \"online service\"). Passengers wishing to use BA's transatlantic service must instead travel between the U.S. interior point and the U.S. gateway on flights operated by U.S. carriers and make an interline connection to the BA flight at the gateway. Because passengers prefer online service and because it is frequently more expensive for airlines to serve passengers on an interline basis than on an online basis, BA's gateway market shares, and the HHI measurements based on them, may overstate BA's competitive impact in these markets. Even if BA's competitive importance in interior markets is overstated by market share measurements based on seats available from gateways, the market for such services is nonetheless concentrated, and a combination of USAir and BA would increase concentration levels by a significant degree. Increases in concentration in these markets are particularly likely to harm consumers because the airlines serving them are permitted to meet 'under the aegis of the International Air Transport Association (\"IATA\") to agree on the prices they will charge. The IATA cartel makes it significantly easier for the carriers jointly to exercise market power. The Complaint alleges that the transaction may eliminate competition between USAir and BA and may substantially lessen competition in the relevant markets. Under the transaction, BA has purchased a 20% equity position and has the right to purchase up to 49% of USAir's equity. The airlines intend to coordinate their respective services at Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charlotte and Pittsburgh and16701 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices to offer code-sharing connecting service at those points. The joint service in combination with the substantial equity ownership will give each carrier a substantial interest in the other's traffic and profits on the routes between those gateways and London, and will thereby reduce each carrier's incentive to engage in competition which may negatively affect the other carrier's traffic and profits. The reduced incentive to compete, along with the lack of reasonable substitutes for airline service in those city-pairs and the barriers to entry by other airlines, indicates that the effect of the transaction may be substantially to lessen competition in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act. III Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment The United States brought this action because the effect of the proposed transaction between USAir and BA may be substantially to lessen competition in the provision of scheduled airline passenger service between numerous U.S, cities and London in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act. On the other hand, the transaction also promises to increase efficiency and competition in a number of significant respects. The joint operations by the two carriers will permit the introduction of nonstop service between Pittsburgh and London, will result in new online competition between interior U.S. points and points beyond London, and promises new or improved online service between interior U.S. points and London. These efficiencies are unlikely to be realized by either carrier acting independently because of provisions in the U.S.-U.K. bilateral agreement that restrict service to and beyond gateways. The risk to competition posed by the transaction can be significantly reduced and the significant procompetitive benefits preserved if USAir's route authority between its U.S. gateways and London is transferred to one or more U.S. airlines with an incentive to compete in U.S.-London city pair markets. To this end, the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment are designed to accomplish either (1) the sale of USAir's authority to serve U.S.- London routes to another U.S. airline or (2) in the absence of such a sale, the surrender of USAir's authority to serve that route and designation of another U.S. airline by the Department of Transportation. Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment would direct USAir to sell its authority to serve each of its U.S.- London routes within 45 days of thedate the two carriers begin to provide joint code-sharing service at the U.S. gateway for that route to a purchaser approved by the United States Department of Justice. By making the requirement to divest contingent on the initiation of joint service, this provision ensures that the competitive harm of the transaction (loss of an independent competitor) is not suffered until the machinery that can generate the anticipated procompetitive benefits (the new online joint service) is in place. Section V provides that if USAir does not complete a sale as required under Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment, it shall surrender the route authority to the United States Department of Transportation, which will then award to another United States airline the route authority that enabled USAir to serve Baltimore-London, Philadelphia-London and/or Charlotte- London. IV Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigants Section 4 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 15) provides that any person who has been injured in his business or property as a result of conduct forbidden by the antitrust laws (including section 7 of the Clayton Act) may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages suffered, as well as costs and reasonable attorneys fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing of any private antitrust damage action. Under the provisions of section 5(a) of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 16(a)), the proposed Final Judgment has no prima facie effect in any subsequent private lawsuit that may be brought. V Procedure Available for Modification of the Proposed Final Judgment The United States and defendants have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court after compliance with the provisions of the APPA, provided that the United States has not withdrawn its consent. The APPA conditions entry upon the Court's determination that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest. The APPA provides a period of at least 60 days preceding the effective date of the proposed Final Judgment within which any person may submit to the United State written comments regarding the proposed Final Judgment. Any person who wishes to comment should do so within 60 days of the date of publication of this CompetitiveImpact Statement in the Federal Register. The United States will evaluate the comments, determine whether it should withdraw its consent, and respond to comments. The comments and the response of the United States will be filed with the Court and published in the Federal Register. Written comments should be submitted to: Mark C. Schechter, Chief, Transportation, Energy, and Agriculture Section, Antitrust Division, Judiciary Center Building, 555 4th Street, NW., room 9104, Washington, DC 20001. VI Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment The proposed Final Judgment requires that USAir sell its Baltimore-London, Philadelphia-London and/or Charlotte- London international route authority .within a specified time after commencement of joint code-sharing operations with BA on any of those routes, or surrender the authority for designation by the Department of Transportation to another airline. Thus, compliance with the proposed Final Judgment would resolve the competitive concerns raised by the transaction with respect to nonstop and connecting service at the Philadelphia-London and Baltimore/Washington-London gateways and connecting service at the Charlotte gateway. Under the terms of the U.S.-U.K. bilateral aviation agreement, a U.S. carrier holding authority to serve London from the Baltimore/Washington or Charlotte gateways may seek permission from the Department of Transportation to transfer that authority to another U.S. gateway point. If permission is sought from and approved y the Department of Transportation, the transfer of USAir's Baltimore or Charlotte required by the Final Judgment may result in service patterns that differ from those that exist today. The United States considered a remedy that would require the transferee carrier to use the authority to serve specified gateways. However, that alternative was rejected because such a restriction in this case could harm airline passengers ,traveling to London as a whole by producing an inefficient allocation of the limited authority to serve London. Also, litigation is an alternative to a consent decree in a Section 7 Clayton Act case. The United States rejected this alternative because the sale or surrender of USAir's route authority required under the proposed Final Judgment, which likely would result in a transfer to a U.S. carrier that already provides16702 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices London service and possibly could result in the transfer to a new gateway, nonetheless would reduce the anticompetitive effects of the transaction while preserving the significant procompetitive effect discussed in Part IlI above. With the proposed relief, the procompetitive benefits of the transaction clearly outweigh its anticompetitive effects: Seeking to enjoin the transaction, which is the only other relief practicably available, would therefore not advance the public interest. The United States is satisfied that the proposed Final Judgment sufficiently resolves the antitrust violation alleged in the Complaint. Although the proposed Final Judgment may not be entered until the criteria established by the APPA (15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h)) have been satisfied, the public will benefit immediately from the requirements of the proposed Final Judgment because the defendants have stipulated to comply with its terms pending its entry by the Court. VII Determinative Materials and Documents. There are no materials or documents that the United States considered to be determinative in formulating this proposed Final Judgment. Accordingly, none are being filed with this Competitive Impact Statement. Dated: March 15, 1993. Respectfully submitted, Robert D.

Joseph H. Widmar, Director of 8:45 440-01-U Drug Enforcement Administration Denial of Application; Elliot F. Monroe, M.D. On November 5, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Elliott F. Monroe, M.D. at 2236 Dogwood, Pampa, Texas, proposing to deny his DEA application executed on January 22 1992. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Dr. Monroe's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. Monroe by registered mail, return receipt requested. The receipt indicates that the Order to Show Cause was received by Dr. Monroe on November 27, 1992. More than thirty days hove passed since the Order was received and the Drug Enforcement Administration has received no response thereto. Therefore, the Administrator concludes that Dr. Monroe has waived his opportunity for a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d) and 1301.54(e), enters this final order based on the information contained in the DEA investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57. The Administrator finds that on December 30, 1901, the Florida Medical Board revoked Dr. Monroe's license to practice medicine due to findings of unprofessional conduct, incompetence and negligence. Based on his lack of authorization to handle controlled substances In the State of Florida, Dr. Monroe's previous DEA Certificate of, Registration was revoked. See 57 FR 23246 (June 2, 1992). The Administrator also finds that Dr. Monroe filed a DEA application for registration, dated January 22,1992, and indicated that he never had a state professional license revoked, suspended, denied, restricted or placedon probation. In fact, Dr. Monroe knew, or should have known, that the Florida Board of Medicine suspended his medical license on June 13, 1989, end revoked his medical license oan December 30. 1991. Since DEA must rely an the trvthfulness of information supplied by applicants in registering them to handle controlled substances, falsification cannot be tolerated. Absent any explanation from Dr. Monroe, the Administrator is drawn to the inescapable conclusion that Dr. Monroe intended to make the materiel false statements on his DEA application for registration. The Administrator further finds that Dr. Monroe also falsified his DEA renewal applications, dated March 11, 1992, and April S,1992, for his previous DEA registration. On September 22. 1992. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dr. Monroe was charged in a three count indictment with knowingly and intentionally furnishing false and fraudulent information on his DEA applications in violation of 21 U.S.C. 843(a)(4)(A). On December 2, 1992, Dr. Monroe was found guilty on one count and, on February 2, 1993, was sentenced to a term of three months incarceration, to be followed by a term of supervised release for a period of one year. Having concluded that theme is a lawful basis for the denial of Dr. Monroe's application, and having concluded that his pending application for registration must be denied. the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824, and 26 CFR 0.100(b), orders that the application for registration. executed by Elliott F. Monroe, M.D., on January 22. 1992, be, and it hereby is, denied. The order is effective March 30, 1993. Dated: March 12,1993. Roberi C Boamr, A 3-29-93, CODE 4410-0-U Revocation of Registratlon; Floyd Zachary, D.D.S. On December 9, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Floyd Zachary. D.D.S., of 3022 Sanders Road, Live Oak, California 95953, and 4H46735. P.O. Box W, Represa, California 95671. The Order to Show Cause sought to revoke his DEA Certificate of Registration,. BZ2391415, and deny any pendingapplications for renewal of such registration. The Order to Show Cause alleged that effective June 11. 1992, the California State Board of Dental Examiners revoked Dr. Zachary's lich n to practice dentistry, and as a result, he is no longer authorized by State law to handle controlled substances. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). The Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. Zachary by registered mail. More than thirty days have passed since the Order to Show Cuse was received and the Drug Enforcement Administration has received no response thereto. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(a) and 1301.54(dL Dr. Zachary is deemed to have waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, the Administrator now enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based on the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57. The Administrator finds that, during the period of 1982 to i9S, Dr. Zachary experienced substantial emotional problems, including a \"paranoid personality disorder\". As a result, he was ordered by the California State Board of Dental Examiners to be examined by a physician and surgeon. Dr. Zachary failed to comply with the board's order, and effective August 28, 1986 the board revoked Dr. Zachary's license to practice dentistry. On November 2, 1989, the board reinstated Dr. Zachary's dental license after he submitted himself to a board- approved psychiatrist, who found him to be competent and who deemed it advisable for Dr. Zachary to undergo ongoing therapy. The reinstatement of Dr. Zachary's dental license was subject to a five-year probation, commencing on March 20, 1990, and a condition that he continue to undergo psychotherapy administered by a board-approved therapist. Dr. Zachary violated the terms of his probation by failing to continue psychotherapy, and as a result, the Board vacated Its November 1989 order, and again revoked Dr. Zachary's dental license effective June 11, 1992. The Administrator finds that as of June 11, 1992, Dr. Zachary's license to practice dentistry in the State of California has been revoked, end he is without authority to handle controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain the registration ofe practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state In which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(t). and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently See, James -L Nickens.

Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Corporation is a bank holding company incorporated in Ohio. Among its subsidiaries is the Bank, located in Cleveland, Ohio. As a result of a merger (the Merger) of the Bank with Ameritrust Company National Association (Ameritrust) effective July 13, 1992, the Bank is the trustee of the Fund, which is a group trust of which Ameritrust was the predecessor trustee. The Corporation represents that the Bank maintains the Fund as a bank collective investment fund pursuant to regulations adopted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and as a group trust pursuant to procedures promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service (the Service), for the investment16705 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / 'tuesday, March 30, 1993 I Notices of assets of employee benefit plans covered by the Act. The Fund Invests primarily in unsecured debt obligations of insurance companies, known as guaranteed investment contracts. As of October 30, 1992, the Fund had total assets of approximately $358,230,000, representing the Investments of approximately 235 investing plans (the Plans). One of the Plans, the Ameritrust Corporation Employees' Savings and Investment Plan (the Ameritrust Plan), is sponsored by the Bank as a result of the Merger, and covers employees of the Bank who were formerly employed by Ameritrust. As of October 30, 1992, approximately 2.03 percent of the assets of the Ameritrust Plan was invested in the Fund. 2. Among the assets in the Fund is the GIC, which was issued to the Fund by Mutual Benefit on July 7, 1989. The GIC provides for a single principal deposit of $5 million, and interest accrues on principal at the annual rate of 9.15 percent. The GIC requires Mutual Benefit to make annual payments of interest on January 31 ofeach year through 1996, a partial principal payment on January 31, 1992, and a final principal payment on January 31, 1996. The Corporation represents that Mutual Benefit timely paid the interest due under the GIC on January 31 of 1990 and 1991. 3. On July 16. 1991 Mutual Benefit was placed in conservatorship by the insurance commissioner of the State of New Jersey, and the Superior Court of New Jersey imposed a moratorium on maturity and most other payments with respect to Mutual Benefit group annuity contracts, including the GIC held by the Fund.' Mutual Benefit failed to pay the Fund the principal amount of $2.5 million and interest of $457,000, which was due January 31, 1992 under the terms of the GIC. However, on October 5, 1992, Mutual Benefit paid the Fund $84,552.39 with respect to its obligations under the GIG. Mutual Benefit failed to pay the Fund the interest payment which was due January 31, 1993. The Corporation represents that various plans for liquidation of Mutual Benefit's assets and payment of its obligations are under consideration, and that it is unknown whether, when and under what terms the holders of Mutual Benefit contracts, including the Fund, will recover the I The Department noles that the decisions to acquire end ld the GIC w govered by the B, Titde I of deAct. In dis proposed exemption, the Department is not proposing relef for any violations of Part 4 which may have arisen as s result of &e cqusttion end holding of the GIC.principal and Interest due under such contracts. As a result of these developments, the Corporation represents that the Fund is exposed to risk of loss on its investment in the GIC. The Corporation proposes to guarantee that the Fund will recover its principal investment in the GIC as well as the interest due under the terms of the GIC through its final maturity, and to make the Advances to provide the Fund with the GIC payments which are due but not timely or fully remitted. The Corporation is requesting an exemption for the Advances and the potential Repayments of the Advances under the terms and conditions described herein. 4. The proposed transactions are detailed in a restorative payment agreement (the Agreement) between the Corporation and the Fund, represented by the Bank, under which the Corporation agrees lo make the Advances as restorative payments to the Fund If, when, and to the extent that Mutual Benefit does not timely perform its obligations under the GIC. The Corporatin's obligations to make the Advances pursuant to the Agreement are conditioned upon the Corporation's obtaining the exemption proposed herein, a private letter ruling from the Service, and a waiver of enforcement action from the OCC. Under the terms of the Agreement, the GCiporation agrees to make an Initial advance (the Initial Advance) In the amount of the sum of the following: (a) The total principal and interest payments due January 31 of 1992 and 1993 under the GIC. reduced by the amounts actually received by the Fund with respect to such payments, as of the date of the Initial Advance, from Mutual Benefit, any conservator. trustee or other person performing similar functions with respect to Mutual Benefit. and/or any state guaranty fund or other entity, other then the Corporation, acting as surety or insurer with respect to Mutual Benefit or otherwise paying Mutual Benefit's obligations (collectively, the GIC Payers) plus (b) Interest thereon after the dates due under the GIC through the date of the Initial Advance at a rate equal to the average annual short-term yield earned by the Fund's assets during that period (the Fund's Average Rate), not to exceed a rate of 9.15 percent. Subsequent to the Initial Advance, the Corporation is obligated under the Agreement to make additional Advances to the Fund any time the CC Payors fail to pay the Fund in full any payment of principal or interest when due under the GIC, in the amount of the unpaid portion of the payment due. The Agreement requires the Bank topromptly notify the Corporation of the Fund's failure to receive any payments in full when due under the GIC, and the Corporation is obligated to make the Advance required under the Agreement within three business days of such notice. 5. The Agreement also provides for the Repayments of the Advances, specifying that the Corporation shall have no recourse against the Fund, the Bank or any of their respective assets for repayment of any Advance except as specified therein. The Repayments are restricted to amounts paid with respet to the GIC by Mutual Benefit or any other GIC Payors (the GIC Proceeds. To the extent that the total GIC Proceeds exceed the sum of all Advances, such excess amounts shall remain in the Fund, and the Corporation shall have no rights to any such excess amounts. The Corporation will not charge or receive any Interest on the Advances, and the total Repayments are limited to the total Advances under the Agreement. The Agreement provides that the Bank shall apply any GIC Proceeds received from the GIC Payors as follows: If GIC Proceeds are received at a time when a payment is due under the GIC terms, yet prior to an Advance with respect to such payment due, the GIC Proceeds shall be applied first to reduce the Corporation's obligation to make an Advance with respect to such payment due. If such GIC Proceeds received are in excess of the payment then due under the GIC terms, such excess shall be applied as a Repayment d the Advances previously made by the Corporation.

The Plan is a profit sharing plan with 18 participants as of April 7, 1992, and total assets of approximately $1,400,000 as of the same date. The persons having investment direction over the Plan assets affected by thetransaction are the trustees of the Plan, Ralph L Fletcher and Marguerite A. Fletcher, who are also members of the Plan's Advisory Committee. Ralph L. Fletcher is also the President, a Director, and the majority shareholder of the Employer. 2. The Office comprises 840 square feet of office space in a building (the Building) erected by the Plan in January 1981 and located at 1425 N. Broadway, Bartow, Polk County, Florida. The Building, the value of which represents aprpoximately 11% of the Plan's assets, was divided into three rentable offices: 840 square feet, 780 square feet, and 720 square feet, respectively. The Plan initially leased the Office to the Employer for an initial term of five years, which ended September 24, 1987, plus an additional five years, which ended September 24, 1992. In response to an exemption application filed by Ralph L Fletcher, the Department granted an exemption covering the initial lease, including the five-year extension thereof (the Initial Lease): Prohibited Transaction Exemption 82- 154 (PTE 82-154). 47 FR 42212 (September 24, 1982).2 For the years 1984 through 1991, the Plan realized an average annual rate of return of 12.07% under the Initial Lease. It is represented that since the inception of the Initial Lease, the Employer has always paid its rent on time and otherwise complied with all of the terms and conditions of the Initial Lease and PTE 82-154. The remaining two offices in the Building were leased to unrelated parties. 3. William H. Loftin, S.I.O.R. (the Appraiser), president of Loftin Real Estate, Inc. in Lakeland, Florida, has appraised the fair market rental value of the Office on a triple-net basis as $8.50 per square foot as of June 22, 1992. The Appraiser states that in a triple-net basis the tenant pays for all maintenance inside the building, his own insurance, his prorate share of the taxes, utilities, and janitorial service, but that the landlord is responsible for all outside maintenance. The Appraiser represents that he has no personal interest or bias with respect to the Office, the Building, or the parties involved. The Appraiser 2 From July 1990 until approximately April 1. 1991, Mr. Fletcher engaged in another prohibited transaction not covered by PTE 82-154: the leaing from the Plan of land located at 612 S. Florida Avenue in Lakeland, Florida for the purpose of constructing a billboard on that land. Mr. Fletcher has filed Form 5330, Return of Excise Taxes Related to Employee Bene it Plans. with the Internal Revenue Service reporting the 1990 portion of this prohibited transaction and represents that he will file Form 5330 reportlng the 1991 portion of this prohibited transaction to the IRS within 60 days of the date the Department concludes its action on the instant exemption application and will pay any excise taxes due wtith that period.states that he has 30 years experience as president of Loftin Real Estate, Inc., which engages in marketing, sales, and financing real estate, with specialization in industrial and commercial property. 4. The new lease has an initial term of five years, beginning September 25, 1992, and provides for the appointment of an Independent Fiduciary. Mr. Knowlton H. Shelnut, Jr. has been appointed to act as the Independent Fiduciary on behalf of the Plan with respect to the Plan's rights and obligations under the new lease, to insure compliance with all terms and conditions of the new lease, and to take any steps necessary to enforce the rights of the Plan thereunder. Paragraph 1(c) of the new lease specifies that the Independent Fiduciary shall be empowered to direct the Plan trustees with respect to this lease, including the Plan's rights thereunder and the enforcement of such rights, provided such directions are consistent with the terms of the Plan and the Act. The new lease contains two options to renew, each for an additional five-year period (10 additional years total),. subject to a determination by the Independent Fiduciary, in his sole discretion, that the proposed exercise of each renewal option is in the best interest of the Plan. Paragraph 4 of the new lease provides that if the Independent Fiduciary shall determine that any proposed extended term is not in the bt interest of the Plan, then the lease shall automatically terminate at midnight on the last day of the lease term or current extended term, as the case may be. 5. The rent for the first 12 months of the initial term of the new lease equals $8.50 per square foot per year, the fair market rental value of the Office, as determined by the Appraiser. The rent for each subsequent 12 months under the new lease during its initial term and also during each extended term (see preceding paragraph) will be adjusted automatically by the Independent Fiduciary based on changes in the Consumer Price Index specified in the new lease. In no event will such adjustment be less than the rental determined as of the previous adjustment. The anticipated rate of return to the Plan under the new lease is approximately 13% per year, according to the applicant. The applicant represents that if the proposed exemption is granted, the new lease agreement will be amended to provide that the rental rate under the new lease will be adjusted every five years to equal the greater of (a) the rent as automatically adjusted by the Independent Fiduciary based on increases in the Consumer Price Index16707 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices specified in the new lease, as described earlier in this paragraph, or (b) the fair market rental value of the Office as determined at that time by a qualified appraiser who is not related to the Employer. 6. The new lease is a \"triple-net lease\", requiring the Employer to pay for all costs, expenses and obligations relating to the Office during the term of the new lease (including any extended term), such as taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, utilities, telephone, cable television, garbage removal, and other services in connection with the Office. The Employer's prorata share of casualty insurance premiums and real property taxes paid by the Plan with respect to the Building will be the fraction determined by dividing the total floor area of the Office by the total floor area of the Building. The Employer is also required to maintain comprehensive general liability insurance with respect to the Office, naming the Plan and the Employer as insured, for at least $1,000,000 and in a form satisfactory to * the Plan. 7. Mr. Knowlton H. Shelnut, Jr. (the Independent Fiduciary), confirms that he has agreed to serve as an independent fiduciary on behalf of the Plan with respect to the new lease. He states that he is an attorney at law licensed to practice in the State of Florida and that aspart of his law practice, he has had extensive experience in the qualified retirement plan area since 1972 and with the Act since 1974, providing legal services in establishing, maintaining, and amending such qualified plans. He stated further that a substantial portion of his law practice is devoted to real estate law and that he has represented sellers, purchasers, and lenders in a substantial number of real estate transactions, including the sale, purchase, and financing of office buildings. Moreover, the Independent Fiduciary owns a professional office building in Lakeland, Polk County, Florida (the same county in which the Building is located) and has negotiated a number of office space leases, as an owner, as well as in his capacity as an attorney. The Independent Fiduciary states that through experience as both an office building owner and also a legal representative of real estate investors, he is generally familiar with the real estate market in Polk County, Florida, including that in Bartow, Polk County, Florida (where the Building is located). He represents that he understands and acknowledges his duties, responsibilities, and liabilities in acting as the Independent Fiduciary with* respect to the Plan. The Independent Fiduciary also represents that he has no relationship whatever to any of the parties involved in the exemption transaction and that he does not represent and has never represented the Employer, the Plan, the applicant, or any of their relatives, affiliates, principals, or relatives of such principals. 8. The Independent Fiduciary states that he has reviewed the exemption application, the terms and provisions of the new lease, the Appraiser's determination of the current fair rental value of the Office, the terms and provisions of another lease in the Building to an unrelated party (the U.S. Government), and the pertinent provisions of the Plan. The Independent Fiduciary also represents that he has been advised of the terms and provisions of the remaining lease in the Building and that he is familiar with the Building. Based upon his review, he makes the following representations: (a) In his opinion, the terms of the new lease compare very favorably with the terms of similar transactions between unrelated parties. (b) In his opinion, the new lease is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries. He states that he is familiar with the stable financial condition of the Employer, who has timely paid all required rent and otherwise complied with all of the terms and conditions of the Initial Lease during its ten year term (including its extended term). The Independent Fiduciary expresses the belief that it would be extremely difficult for the Plan to replace the Employer with another tenant willing to lease the Office under the same terms and conditions as set forth in the new lease. (c) In his opinion, in light of the relatively small portion of the Plan's total assets involved in the new lease, the transaction will have no adverse effect upon the projected liquidity requirements of the Plan or upon the diversification of the Plan's assets and will comply with the Plan's investment objectives and policies. (d) The Independent Fiduciary agrees to monitor the exemption transaction on behalf of the Plan, to ensure that the Employer fully performs and complies with all conditions required under the new lease, throughout the duration of the exemption transaction. In addition he agrees to take all appropriate actions to safeguard the interests of the plan with respect to the exemption transaction. 9. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction satisfiesthe exemption criteria set forth in section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) The rent for the first 12 months of the initial term of the new lease equals the fair market rental value of the Office, as determined by a qualified, independent appraiser; (b) The rent for each subsequent 12 months under the new lease will be adjusted automatically by the Independent Fiduciary based on changes in the Consumer Price Index specified in the new lease, but in no event will the adjusted annual rent be less than the annual rent for the preceding 12 months; further, the rental rate under the new lease will be adjusted every five years to equal the greater of: i) The rent as automatically adjusted each year by the Independent Fiduciary based on increases in the Consumer Price Index specified in the new lease, as described above, or (ii) the fair market rental value of the Office as determined at that time by a qualified appraiser who is not related to the Employer or any of its principals or affiliates; (c) The new lease requires the Employer to pay all expenses relating to the Office; (d) The Employer is also required to maintain comprehensive general liability insurance and casualty insurance with respect to the office; (e) The transaction involves only approximately 4% of the Plan's assets; (f) The Independent Fiduciary has determined that the transaction is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries; and (g) The Independdt Fiduciary has agreed to act on behalf of the Plan with respect to the Plan's rights and obligations under the new lease, to insure compliance with all terms and conditions of the new lease, and to take any steps necessary to enforce the rights of the Plan thereunder.

General Information The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: (1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 40416708 Federal- Register t Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices of the Act, which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; (2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; (3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and (4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations contained in each application are true and complete, and that each application accurately describes all material terms of the transaction which is the subject of the exemption.

In addition, no organization or individual who is an Independent Fiduciary, and no partnership or corporation of which such organization or individual is an officer, director, or ten percent (10%) or more partner or shareholder, may: (1) Acquire any property from, sell any property to, or borrow any funds from, Met, its Affiliates, or any separate account maintained by Met or its Affiliates, during the period that such organization or individual serves as an independent fiduciary and continuing for a period of six (6) months after such organization or individual ceases to be an Independent Fiduciary; or (2) Negotiate any such transaction, described above in paragraph (d)(1) of section IV during the period that such organization or individual serves as Independent Fiduciary. No Plan Fiduciary or sponsor of a Participating Plan or a designee of such Plan Fiduciary, sponsor, or Participating16711 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices Plan may serve as the Independent Fiduciary with respect to the Separate Account.

(f) Participating Plan or Participating Plans means plans qualified pursuant to section 401(a) or 403(b) of the Code which may participate in ownerships of Units in the Separate Account and which are subject to section 406 of the Act and section 4975 of the Code. (g) Plan Fiduciary or Plan Fiduciaries means the individual fiduciary or fiduciaries acting on behalf of each of the Participating Plans that invest in the Separate Account. (h) Properties means the geographically dispersed small- to medium-sized retail and office buildings, light industrial facilities, and residential apartment space with good operating income (and such other properties that may be acquired pursuant to changes in the investment guidelines for the Separate Account that are approved by the Independent Fiduciary) which Met has acquired or will acquire on behalf of the Participating Plans that invest in the Separate Account. (i) Seed Money means the total amount (not to exceed $100 million) actually contributed by Met to the Separate Account for the purpose of acquiring Properties. (j) Separate Account means the real estate equity pooled separate account invested in by plans, as described herein.

(1) Trigger Point means the point at which Met's ownership in the Separate Account will be decreased with the approval of or as required by the Independent Fiduciary. The Independent Fiduciary, acting on behalf of the Plans in the proposed transactions, sets the percentage of Met's ownership of Units in the Separate Account which serves as the Trigger Point. In this regard, the Trigger Point will arise only after the end of the Startup Period. (m) Units means the units of interest into which equity participation in the Separate Account is divided. (n) Wind Down means the period which begins on the date on which Met notifies all the Participating Plans in theSeparate Account that it has decided to termimte the Separate Account and concludes on the date on which no Units are held by any of the Participating Plans. The exemption is subject to the express conditions that the material facts and representations contained in the application are true and complete. and that the application accurately describes all material terms of the transaction to be consummated pursuant to the exemption. Effective Date: This exemption is effective on September 21, 1989, the first date a transaction described in Section I(a) herein occurred. Written Comments In the Notice, the Department invited interested persons to submit written comments and any requests for a hearing on the proposed exemption within forty-five (45) days of the date of publication of the Notice in the Federal Register, 58 FR 354, January 5, 1993. All comments and requests for hearing were due by February 19, 1993. The Department received no requests for hearing. However, the Department did receive one written comment with respect to the Notice from the applicant, Met. Met's comment requests certain modifications and clarifications of the conditions of the exemption contained in section III and the definitions contained in section IV. Met also requests certain corrections of the language of the Summary of Facts and Representation of the Notice. Met requests modification of the language in section 111(c) which provides, in part that, \"No Properties have been or will be purchased for the Separate Account during the Start Up Period with plan contributions or monies other than Met's Seed Money * * * .\" Met suggests adding after the words, \"Seed Money,\" the phrase, \"or Available Cash after all of Met's Seed Money has been expended to acquire Properties.\" Met states that this change is necessary to conform the language of the condition to the actual operation of the Separate Account. It is represented that during the Start Up Period, the purchase price of the last of the Properties acquired by Met for the Separate Account exceeded by a small amount the remaining Seed Money available for purchases. In order to close the sale, Met supplemented the amount remaining in Seed Money with cash from the accumulated income from the operations, of the Separate Account. Met states that this action was acceptable, as Available Cash is an appropriate source of funds for the Separate Account to use to acquire Properties. The Departmenthas no objection to Met's proposed modification, and accordingly, has amended the language of section 111(c). Met requests clarification of the requirement in section 1I(d)(5), that prior to the investment by any plan in the Separate Account, such plan be provided with a list of all the assets in the Separate Account, as of the end of the most recent fiscal pariod. Met points out that statements prepared at the end of each month do not provide a specific listing of the actual short-term or temporary investments held by the Separate Account. It is the view of the Department that an aggregate list of short-term or temporary investments on statements of assets for the Separate Account, will satisfy the condition set forth in section III(d)(5). Met requests modification of the requirement of section HIfdX7T, that copies of the most recent monthly reports on the Separate Account and the most recent monthly reviews and the quarterly updates of the valuation of the Separate Account, including a list of the holdings of the Separate Account during the periods, be disclosed to any plan prior to its investment in the Separate Account. Met states that because the monthly reviews and quarterly updates are internal working documents it is not necessary or appropriate for this information to be provided Participating Plans on a regular basis. Further, Met notes that the list of holdings of the Separate Account are already required under section I1(d)(5). A substitute condition in section II1(d)(7), Met suggests the following, \"copies of the most recent valuation statements for the Separate Account and copies of the most recent reports on the Separate Account that have been provided to Participating Plans.\" The Department concurs with Met's request and has amended the language of section III(d)(7). Met requests modification of the definition of \"Independent Fiduciary,\" as set forth in section IV(d)12), which rohibits the Independent Fiduciary om having an ownership interest in Met or its affiliates. Because Met is a mutual life insurance company that offers various types of individual and group insurance policies, Met is concerned that this definition would preclude an \"ownership interest\" acquired by the Independent Fiduciary as a Met policyholder. In order to &void such a result, Met proposes that the phrase, \"other than an interest acquired as the result of a policy of insurance or annuity contract or other generally available insurance product,\" be incorporated into the language of the definition. The Department concurs and16712 Federal Register' Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, ,March 30, 1993 / Notices' has amended the language of section IV(d)(2). Met requests modification of the language of section IV(d)(4) which states that the Independent Fiduciary may not also serve as a fiduciary of a Participating Plan. Met believes it 41 quite possible that an Independent Fiduciary may have, or may obtain, other advisory or asset management relationships with a Participating Plan that affect assets other than those invested in the Separate Account. Met believes that these other relationships should not affect the ability of a firm or individual to serve as Independent Fiduciary. The Department notes that one of the most important safeguards that can be built into transactions of this type is the appointment of the Independent Fiduciary who can objectively act on behalf of all the Participating Plans and who is otherwise independent of all the parties involved. The Department does not believe that Met's proposed modification is consistent with the Department's concept of an Independent Fiduciary under these circumstances and, accordingly, has determined not to revise the exemption in this regard. Met proposes modification of section IV(g) which defines \"Plan Fiduciary or Plan Fiduciaries,\" as the individual fiduciary or fiduciaries acting on behalf of each of the Participating Plans that invest in the Separate Account. Met, in its comment, proposes to modify the definition by deleting the words, \"that invest in the Separate Account,\" and adding to the end of the definition the phrase, \"with respect to their investment or participation in the Separate Account.\" For reasons stated above with respect to the proposed modification of section IV(d)(4), the Department does not believe that section IV(g) should be modified. Met requests clarification of the definition of \"Participating Plan,\" as set forth in section IV(f), and the definition of \"Separate Account,\" as set forth in section IV(j), which indicate that plans that participate in the ownership of Units in the Separate Account are qualified pursuant to section 401(a) or 403(b) of the Code and are subject to section 406 of the Act and 4975 of the Code. Met is concerned that these definitions will be read to limit the types of plans that will be permitted to participate in the Separate Account. In this regard, it is the view of the Department that these definitions should not be read to preclude other plans not covered by the Act or the Code, such as government plans, from investing in the Separate Account.Met requests that the definition of \"Properties\" in section IV(h) be amended to eliminate the reference to a specific $15 million dollar limitation on the purchase price of any of the Properties and to permit flexibility in 'the selection of appropriate Properties for the Separate Account, pursuant to future alterations in the investment guidelines for the Separate Account that are approved by the Independent Fiduciary. The Department concurs with Met. Accordingly, the Department has deleted specific reference to the $15 million dollar limitation in the definition. The Department also has modified the definition to make clear that the Separate Account may acquire other properties so long as there are changes in the investment guidelines for the Separate Account that are approved by the Independent Fiduciary. Met requests modification of the language in the third sentence of the second subparagraph of Paragraph #7, of the Notice which states that Annual Appraisals are to be prepared by an independent qualified appraiser each year \"on the anniversary date\" of purchase for each of the Properties in the Separate Account. Met would prefer that Annual Appraisals be prepared at any time during the month in which the anniversary date of purchase occurs. In this way, Met suggests that the independent appraiser would have more latitude within which to prepare his report. In the view of the Department, the language in the second subparagraph of Paragraph #7 was not intended to unduly hamper the independent appraiser. However, we also believe that valuations as of the\"anniversary date of purchase\" provides a consistent bench mark each year. Accordingly, we concur with Met's request for flexibility, and therefore, are of the view that each of the Properties may be appraised at any time during the month of the anniversary date as long as the appraisal reflects the value of the Property on the anniversary date. Met also requests modification of the language of the first sentence in the second subparagraph of Paragraph #5 which states that in the event of an increase beyond the Trigger Point through liquidity purchases of Units by Met from the Separate Account, Met\"proposes to reduce its percentage ownership in the Separate Account,\" through various stated methods. Met further states that similar language is contained in the last sentence of the second subparagraph of Paragraph #11. Met believes this language implies that it automatically would begin a program to reduce its ownership of Units, as soon as its percentage ownershipexceeds the Trigger Point after the completion of the Start-Up Period. Met is of the view that these representations overstate the actions that are required under the exemption after the Trigger Point has been reached. It is Met's belief that once the Trigger Point is exceeded after the Start Up Period, Met is required to provide the Independent Fiduciary its recommendations as to what actions, if any, should be taken to reduce the level of Met's participation in the Separate Account. Thereafter, no action would be taken with regard to reduction without the approval of the Independent Fiduciary. Accordingly, Met requests that the language of Paragraphs #5 and #11 be replaced by the phrase, \"Met will provide a recommendation to the Independent Fiduciary regarding whether its percentage of ownership in the Separate Account should be reduced.\" The Department does not agree with Met's interpretation of the relevant language of Paragraphs #5 and #11. Nor does the Department believe such interpretation is consistent with prior representations of Met and the Independent Fiduciary as summarized in those paragraphs. In the Department's view, the proposed modification suggests that once the Trigger Point has been exceeded, the Independent Fiduciary may act only after a recommendation by Met. Further, the proposed modification suggests that such recommendation by Met need not involve a plan to reduce its holdings in the Separate Account. It is the view of the Department, consistent with prior representations of Met and the Independent Fiduciary, that once the Trigger Point is reached, it is the responsibility of the Independent Fiduciary to take action on behalf of the Separate Account, regardless of whether Met offers or fails to offer specific recommendations. Once having determined that a reduction of Met's ownership in the Separate Account is in the interest of the Participating Plans, the Independent Fiduciary would have the further responsibility to decide the appropriate method by which such reduction would be accomplished. According to the representations of the applicant, Met's ownership in the Separate Account can be reduced either by using Available Cash in the Separate Account to purchase Met's Units or by selling Properties in the Separate Account to obtain cash proceeds for the same purpose. It is the obligation of the Independent Fiduciary to choose between these two alternatives. If, on the other hand, once the Trigger Point has been reached, the Independent16713 Federal Register / VoL 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices Fiduciary determines that It is not in the interest of the Separate Account to use Available Cash or to sell Properties to reduce Met's ownership, then it is within the discretion of the hndependent Fiduciary to decide to maintain the status quo with respect to Met's ownership in the Separate Account In the event the Independent Fiduciary makes such a decision, the Independent Fiduciary has within its discretion, under the exemption, the ability to adjust or raise the level of the Trigger Point. With respect to further modifications of the language of the Summary of Facts and Representations in the Notice, as published in the Federal Register, the Department concurs with the following: (a) In footnote 3, the Department recognizes that as of June 1991. the General Account of Met had contributed Seed Money in the amount of $100,000,000 to the Separate Account, and that the word \"approximately\" should be deleted; (b) The Department acknowledges in the second sentence of the third subparagraph of paragraph #14, that Landauer Associates, Inc. has five rather than seven fully-staffed offices in the United States providing professional real estate counseling services nationwide; (c) In the last subparagraph of Paragraph #16, the Department acknowledges that the investment guidelines of the Separate Account were established by Met, but were subject to the .approval of the Independent Fiduciary; and (d) In the last sentence of the third subparagraph of Paragraph #7, the Department notes that the words,\"quarterly updates,\" should be inserted after the phrase, \"Met's annualappraise s.\"Finally. two typographical corrections were made in the Notice, as published in the Federal Register. First, in the table in the fifth subparagraph of Paragraph #18, the date in item 4 should be February, 1992,. rather than 1991. Second, a phrase inadvertently omitted from the fifth and sixth sentences of the last subparagraph of Paragraph #12 in the Notice should be restored. The two sentences should read as follows: During the Wind Down period in order to provide further flexibility for Participating Plans, the Separate Account provides that any Participating Plan may elect to defer redemption with respect to Its Units in the Separate Account and maintain its participation in the Separate Account until the end. It is anticipated that the final distribution of money in the Separate Account to the Participating Plans who choose to remain will occur only after all the Properties have been sold.After giving full consideration to the entire record, including the written comment from Met, the Department has decided to grant the exemption. All comments submitted to the Department are included as part of the public record of the exemption application.

[FR Doc. 93-7231 Filed 3-29-93; 8:45 am) BILUNG CODE 7S10-01-M Request for Comments on Increasing Contractor Liability on Research and Development Contracts AGENCY: Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Public Law 102-588 requires that NASA carry out an assessment of the allocation of risk between NASA and its contractors for research and development contracts in order to identify options for allocating risk for correction of defects in materials and workmanship or other failures to conform to contract requiremepts. The genesis of the Congressional concern is the perception that contractors may not be accepting16715 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices sufficient responsibility for the consequences of their actions. Congressional interest was heightened by some well-publicized shortfalls on some major NASA programs. The discussion below covers one option being considered for increasing contractor liability. Public comment is requested on the validity of the approach. If the option below is selected for implementation, the proposed rule will be published for public comment prior to implementation. DATES: Comments are due on or before April 29, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. T. Deback, Procurement Policy Division, (202) 358-0431. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Government currently assumes the total responsibility for all costs under cost type contracts except in cases of fraud, willful misconduct, lack of good faith on the part of the contractor's senior management, or where the conduct of one or more of the Contracior's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. This concept is utilized in the inspection and acceptance clauses for cost type contracts for supplies and R&D (See paragraph (h), FAR 52.246-3 and -8)..After initial review of potential approaches to increasing contractor liability, several tenets became clear. The first was that we are not trying to penalize the contractor for failure to successfully accomplish research and development (R&D). The inherent riskiness of R&D is recognized, and it'is unrealistic to require a contractor to guarantee its success. The contractor is normally rewarded or penalized for end item performance on research and development through the use of award fees or incentive fees. Second, it was recognized that in all cost type contracts, even R&D, there are routine tasks for which the contractor could be held to a higher level of responsibility. These routine tasks include such things as moving and handling pieces of gear, machine shop operations, and packing and packaging of equipment. A third tenent was that NASA should not pay the cost of insurance either directly or indirectly for the additional risk that a contractor would incur by assuming a higher level of responsibility. This would not shift responsibility tocontractors but merely change the vehicle for paying for the corrections. Finally, realistic bounds should be placedon the contractor's liability. For example, a contractor could not be expected to agree to a test contract for $100,000 if as part of the contract he assumed total responsibility for a $500M piece of Government equipment. Basedupon these tenets, an approach was developed which increases contractor liability for the manner in which the effort under the contract is accomplished. The following principles would be incorporated into the current inspection and acceptance clauses referenced above: a. The clause would impose liabilities on the Contractor for failure to comply with the requirements of the contract. The liabilities imposed are above and beyond those currently imposed. Failures include the delivery of defective supplies or services. b. In agreeing to the liabilities imposed, the parties recognize that the Contractor is required to perform a variety of tasks, some of which involve research and development efforts, the success of which cannot be reasonably predicted, others which involve more routine operations subject to well- defined and generally accepted industrial practices. The Contractor will not be liable if, despite best efforts, the Contractor fails to achieve the contract's objectives of research and development, the success of which could not reasonably be predicted at the time of award. c. The Contractor will not be liable for losses which occur in routine operations if the Contractor has adopted and its employees were following generally accepted industrial practices for the activities in question. The Contractor shall have the burden of demonstrating to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that liability should not attach under this clause. d. The Contractor will be fully liable for failure to comply with the requirements of this contract in accordance with paragraph (h) of the inspection and acceptance clauses cited above. In addition, the Contractor shall be liable for any failure to comply with the requirements of this contract as specified below. e. No additional liability would be imposed beyond that imposed by other clauses of this contract if the Contractor can demonstrate to the Contracting Officer by clear and convincing evidence that the Contractor failed, despite best efforts, to achieve research and development objectives of this contract, the outcome of which could not have been reasonably predicted atthe time of award, or that the failure occurred notwithstanding that the Contractor had adopted and its employees were following generally accepted industrial practices at the time of the failure to comply with the requirements of the contract. f. If the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor is liable under this clause, the Contractor shall be responsible for the lesser of either of the following: (1) 50 percent of the cost to rectify any failure to comply with the requirements of this contract; or (2) 10 percent of the contract value at the time the failure occurred. g. The cost of insurance to cover potential liabilities imposed by this clause shall not be an allowable cost under this contract. h. These concepts would be used in fairly high dollar value cost type R&D contracts; it is currently assumed the threshold dollar value would be $50M. Deidre A.

[FR Doc. 93-7297 Filed 3-29-93; 8:45 BILUNG CODE REGULATORY COMMISSION [Oocket No. 50-295] Commonwealth Edison Co.; Zion Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements of Section III.D.1.(a) of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 to Commonwealth Edison Company (the licensee), for the Zion Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1, located in Lake County, Illinois. Environmental Assessment Identification of Proposed Action The proposed action would grant an exemption from section III.D.1.(a) of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50, which requires a set of three Type A tests (Containment Integrated Leakage Rate Test or CILRT) to be performed at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period and specifies that the third test of each set shall be conducted when the plant is shut down for the 10-year plant inservice inspections (ISI). The licensee's request is for a one-time exemption that will allow the third Type A test of the current 10-year service period to be performed, independent of the current 10-year16717 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March, 30, 1993 / Notices service period and the 10-year plant ISI, during a refueling outage in September 1995, approximately 43 months after the last one. Without the exemption the licensee would be required to perform the next Type A test during a refueling outage in October 1993, when the plant is shut down for the 10-year plant ISI, which means the last two Type A tests of the second 10-year service period would be performed 19 months apart. The exemption is in response to the licensee's application for exemption dated January 12, 1993. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed exemption is needed because the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, and the licensee's current refueling outage schedule, would require the third CILRT for the second 10-year service period to be performed when Unit I is shut down for the refueling outage in October 1993- which also is the 10-year plant ISI. This circumstance has arisen partially because NRC staff concerns with the validity of the test results from the second and third Type A tests of the first 10-year service period led the licensee to perform a fourth test for the first 10-year service period on July 7, 1984, approximately eight months into the second 10-year service period The first test of the second service period was performed in March 1988, 43 months after the last test and 51 months into the service period. The second test was not performed until 48 months later due to a 29 month fuel cycle which resulted from two major forced outages in which the unit was down for a total of 265 days. Without this exemption, the licensee would be required to perform the third CILRT during the October 1993 refueling outage, 19 months after the second Type A test. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The Commission's staff has determined that granting the proposed exemption would not significantly increase the probability or amount of expected primary containment leakage and that containment integrity would, thus, be maintained. Although the requirements in Section III.D.1:(a) that three Type A tests be performed in each 10-year service period and that the third test be conducted when the unit is shut down for the 10-year plant ISI would not be met, performing the third Type A test of the second 10-year service period approximately 43 months after the last one would meet the intent to perform the tests at approximately equal intervals of about a third of a 10-year service period, to ensure containmentintegrity. Consequently, the probability of accidents would not be increased, nor would the post-accident radiological releases be greater than previously determined. Neither would the proposed exemption otherwise affect radiological plant effluents. Therefore, the Commission's staff concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption involves a change to surveillance and testing requirements. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission's staff concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. Alternative to the Proposed Action Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the proposed action, any alternatives would have either no or greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce the environmental impacts attributed to the facility and would not meet the intent of the rule to perform CILRT at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in connection with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Final Environmental Statement, dated December 1972, related to the operation of the Zion Nuclear Power Station, Units 1 and 2. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons. Finding of No Significant Impact The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated January 12, 1993, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC andat the Waukegan Public Library, 128 North County Street, Waukegan, Illinois 60085.

[FR Doc. 93-7285 Corp.; Cushing Refinery Site; Environmental Assessment, Finding of No Significant Impact, and Opportunity for a Hearing [Docket No. 70-3073] The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering the issuance of a Special Nuclear Material (SNM) License No. SNM-1999 for Kerr-McGee Corporation (Kerr-McGee) to possess uranium and thorium at the former Cushing Refinery Site (Cushing Site). The uranium and thorium currently exists at the Cushing Site in the form of contaminated soil, sludge, sediment, trash, building rubble, and on building surfaces. Introduction Kerr-McGee submitted an SNM license application (application) on October 17, 1991, a revised application on September 25. 1992, and supplements on December 18, 1992, January 14, 1993, and February 23, 1993, to possess uranium and thorium at the Cushing Site. Kerr-McGee proposes to possess the licensed material during preliminary remediation activities in preparation for the decommissioning of the Cushing Site. The Cushing Site is located halfway between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, two miles north of State Highway 18 and a half mile east of Deep Rock Road. Under Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) licenses SNM-695 and SMB-664, Kerr- McGee chemically processed enriched, normal, and depleted uranium and natural thorium at the Cushing Site from 1962 through 1966. The licensed activities were conducted on a Kerr- McGee owned site, approximately 400 acres in size, that was also the location of a Kerr-McGee oil refinery operation. Materials were received in the form of UF6, mill concentrates, unirradiated scrap fuel elements, and various other chemical compounds. The licensee converted uranium to other compounds suitable for use in the nuclear fuel cycle and produced metal alloys of uranium and thorium.16718I Federal Register' / Vol: V8, No. 5\u00a7'/ Tuesday, March 30, 1963 \"/ Notices In 1966, the site was decommissioned in accordance with practices at the time and the license was terminated. Between 1972 and 1982, Kerr-McGee further decontaminated the site by shipping the more highly radioactive materials off site, and disposing of unknown quantities of contaminated soils and trash in an existing refinery sludge pit (Pit 4), in trenches located in the northeast corner of the site, and in inactive tank berms in the northwest portion of the site. The contaminated soil land trash disposed of on the Cushing Site remain at the original disposal locations in concentrations exceeding Option I of the Branch Technical Position (BTP) on \"Disposal or Onsite Storage of Thorium or Uranium Wastes From Past Operations\" (46 FR 52061). There are also areas of contamination, exceeding BP Option 1 limits, around and under the former uranium processing building and in the soils and sediments of Skull Creek, which was a discharge point for effluent from the uranium processing facility. Proposed Action The primary purpose for issuing SNM-1999, is to authorize the possession of the uranium and thorium on the Cushing Site. The license covers all uranium and thorium that exists at the site in concentrations and surface contamination levels that exceed natural background. Kerr-McGee proposes to possess the licensed materials during preliminary remediation activities. The proposed preliminary remediation activities are intended to: (1) Identify all areas on the Cushing Site that contain uranium and thorium in concentration levels above natural background, (2) excavate from the identified areas those materials that contain radioactivity in excess of NRC unrestricted release limits, and (3) consolidate the excavated material at designated temporary storage areas located on the Cushing Site or ship the material to a licensed low-level waste disposal facility. The proposed final disposition of the uranium and thorium to be consolidated in the temporary storage areas will be described in a decommissioning plan, which Kerr- McGee has committed to submit at later date. The decommissioning plan will describe the proposed procedures for completing the decommissioning and releasing the Cushing Site for unrestricted use. The Need for Proposed Action Uranium and thorium exist on the Cushing Site in concentration and surface contamination levels that potentially pose a long term risk to thepublic health and safety. Uranium and thorium have been identified in concentrations up to 968 pCi/g and 279 pCi/g, respectively. Also, exposure rates in excess of 500 uR/hr have been identified at limited areas on the Cushing Site. The issuance of SNM- 1999 will ensure that the contamination at the Cushing Site will be possessed in accordance with NRC regulations, and that the contamination will be reduced to levels that pose acceptably low risks to public health and safety, thereby allowing the release of the Cushing Site for unrestricted use. Alternatives to Proposed Action There are no alternatives to the proposed action. The Code of Federal Regulations, 10 CFR 70.20, requires a specific SNM license to possess, use, or transfer SNM. Environmental Impacts of Proposed Action The activities that the staff proposes to authorize through the issuance of SNM-1999 are expected to have an insignificant impact on the environment. In fact, the activities are anticipated to improve environmental conditions through the identification and consolidation of the contaminated material 'on the Cushing Site into known, controlled locations. Contamination currently exists at locations and in concentrations that are not known with certainty. The consolidation and control of the contaminated material should reduce the potential for the release of the material to the environment. In addition, the areas from which contamination will be removed will eventually be available for unrestricted use. During the proposed activities, the primary impact on the environment would be the release of airborne radioactivity during excavation and handling of contaminated materials. Using methods described in NUREG/ CR-1759, Vol. 3, \"Data Base for Radioactive Waste Management, Impact Analysis Methodology Report,\" November 1981, the staff estimated that the concentration of airborne radioactivity generated during excavation and handling of contaminated material should be on the order of 4E-14 uCi/ml. This airborne concentration is two percent of the unrestricted release limit for natural thorium listed in appendix B, table II to 10 CFR part 20 (i.e, 2E-12 uCi/ml). The limit for natural thorium is used since it is the most conservative limit applicable to the Cushing site.The estimated airborne radioactivity applies to the immediate area where the materials are being handled and does not account for the dust suppression measures Kerr-McGee has committed to employ to keep exposure to airborne radioactivity as low as Is reasonably achievable (ALARA). In addition, the concentration of airborne radioactivity should decrease as the material is dispersed in the atmosphere enroute to unrestricted areas or areas where members of the public reside. However, the staff conservatively estimated the dose to a member of the public from the proposed action to be 25 mrem, assuming that a member of the public is exposed to the full 4E-14 .uCi/ml of airborne radioactivity. The 4E-14 uCi/ ml estimated airborne concentration also applies to workers, and is 0.07 percent of the occupational maximum permissible concentration (MP) listed in appendix B, table I to 10 CFR part 20. The proposed action is not anticipated to result in the release of non-radiological hazardous material to the environment. However, thorium is known to exist in one of the five pits on the Cushing Site, i.e., Pit 4, that contains acidic, oily sludge that resulted from the refinery operation on the site. Kerr- McGee has entered into a consent Order with the State of Oklahoma, No. C-90- 91-H, to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study for the five oily sludge pits, including Pit 4. The proposed action does not authorize any activity involving the thorium contaminated acidic sludge in Pit 4. The staff expects Kerr-McGee to submit a license amendment request, at some time in the future, requesting approval to remediate the thorium contaminated sludge. The potential environmental impact of non-radiological material will require additional consideration at that time. The proposed action will entail transportation of low-level radioactive waste to a licensed disposal facility. Methods to assess the radiological impacts of transportation for routes of similar length and nature as may be used in the proposed action, are described in NUREG-0170, \"Final Environmental Statement on the Transportation of Radioactive Material by Air and Other Modes,\" December 1975. Using the methods and assumptions in NUREG-0170, the population dose resulting from the transportation of waste estimated to be generated during the proposed action is conservatively estimated as 1.04 person- rem, and the maximum individual dose, to a member of the public, is estimated to be less than .002 mrem16010 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices The proposed action would result in' the irreversible use of energy resources during excavation and handling of contaminated material and transporting of wastes to a licensed disposal facility. A small amount of land at the low-level waste facility would be irreversibly committed for waste disposal. There are no reasonable alternatives to these resource uses and there are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources. Agencies and Persons Consulted This environmental assessment (EA) was prepared entirely by NRC staff. No other sources were used beyond those referenced in this EA. Conclusions' The environmental impacts from the proposed action are expected to be insignificant. The primary effluent anticipated from the operation (i.e., airborne radioactivity) is conservatively predicted to be released, to unrestricted areas, in concentrations that are approximately 2 percent of unrestricted release limits in appendix B, table 2 of 10 CFR part 20. The impacts, from non- radiological materials, and the transportation and disposal of radioactive materials are expected to be minor. Finding of No Significant Impact The Commission has prepared an EA related to the issuance of SNM-1999. On the basis of the EA, the Commission has concluded this licensing action would not significantly affect the environment and does not warrant the preparation of an environmental impact statement. Accordingly, it has been determined that a Finding of No Significant Impact is appropriate. The above documents related to this proposed action are available for public inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Document Room in the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20037. Opportunity for a Hearing The Commission hereby provides notice that this is a proceeding on an application for a licensing action falling within the scope of subpart L, \"Informal Hearing Procedures for Adjudications in Materials Licensing Proceedings, of the Commission's Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings in 10 CFR part 2\" (54 FR 8269).

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Quantitative Designation Criteria An issuer applying for the designation of its securities in the Nasdaq NMS must comply with at least one of two sets of quantitative designation criteria (\"Alternative 1\" and \"Alternative 2\") contained in Section 2 to Part IN of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws (\"Schedule D\").1 The NASD also requires a Nasdaq NMS issuer to comply with the entry requirements to trade in the Nasdaq System 2 as a Nasdaq SmallCap security.3 The security of an issuer applying for designation in the Nasdaq SmallCap Market is expressly required to have a $3 minimum bid price per share. While Alternative 1 of the Nasdaq NMS entry requirements contains a $5 minimum bid price per share, Alternative 2 is silent on this point. Nonetheless, the NASD applies the entry requirements for the Nasdaq SmallCap Market to issuers seeking designation of their securities on the Nasdaq NMS under Alternative 2. The NASD, therefore, proposes to amend Section 2(b) of part III to Schedule D to require a $3 minimum bid price per share for designation in Nasdaq NMS to clarify the current NASD practice. Quantitative Maintenance Criteria Net Tangible Assets. Nasdaq NMS maintenance requirements do not require an issuer to comply with a minimum net tangible asset test unless the issuer has sustained certain losses in past years. Specifically, if the issuer has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years, it must maintain net tangible assets of at least $2 million. If the issuer has sustained losses from continuing operations and/ or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years, it must maintain net I See, Section 2(a) of Part III to Schedule D to the NASD Manual for the Alternative 1 set of designation criteria and Section 2(b) of Part IIl for the complete Alternative 2 set of designation criteria. 2The Nasdaq System is comprised of both the Nasdaq SmallCap Market (\"Nasdaq SmallCap\") and the Nasdaq NMS. Nasdaq SmallCap issuers must comply with entry and maintenance rquirmets contained in Part I1 of Schedule D. N NMS issuers must comply with both the Nasdaq SmallCap entry and maintenance requirements contained under Part II, and with the Nasdaq NMS entry and maintenance requirements contained in Part lII of Schedule D.3 NASD staff provide determinations regarding issuer compliance with Nasdaq NMS and Nasdaq SmallCap qualifications criteria, which determinations are subject to appeal pursuant to Article IX of the NASD's Code of Procedure.tangible assets of at least $4 million.4 Upon review, the NASD believes that a Nasdaq NMS issuer should maintain $1 million minimum net tangible assets in the current fiscal year independent of past earnings and losses. The NASD elieves such a requirement is appropriate to the status of an issuer of securities in the Nasdaq NMS. The proposed rule change also would eliminate the possibility for a Nasdaq NMS issuer to fall below the $1 million capital and surplus maintenance requirement for the Nasdaq SmallCap Market 5 but appear to be in compliance with Nasdaq NMS maintenance requirements.6 The NASD, therefore, proposes that Section 4(a) to Part III of Schedule D require Nasdaq NMS issuers to maintain at least $1 million in net tangible assets. Minimum Bid Price or the Alternative Public Float and Net Tangible Assets Criteria. Nasdaq NMS maintenance criteria do not require an issuer of Nasdaq NMS securities to maintain a minimum bid price per share or, in the alternative, to maintain a higher minimum public float or net tangible assets. In comparison, Nasdaq SmallCap maintenance criteria require an issuer of Nasdaq SmaltCap securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 or in the alternative, a $1 million public float and $2 million in capital and surplus.' The NASD believes Nasdaq NMS maintenance criteria should clarify that the NASD dose apply the Nasdaq SmallCap $1 minimum bid price as a maintenance requirement to a Nasdaq NMS security. The NASD also believes Nasdaq NMS maintenance criteria should provide for alternative public float and net tangible assets requirements that are similar to but higher than the levels required for Nasdaq SmallCap issuers. Upon review, the NASD has determined that if an Nasdaq NMS issuer fails to meet a $1 minimum bid price, it should be required to meet an alternative public float test of $3 million 8 and an alternative net tangible assets test of $4 million.e The NASD, therefore, proposes 4 See, Section 4(a)3 to Part II of Schedule D. 'See, sections 1(c)(3) and 2(eX3) of Pert H to Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws. 0 Net tangible assets equals capital and surplus minus goodwill. Therefore. even if goodwill were zero, a Nasdaq NMS issuer could not have $1 million net tangible assets if its capital and surplus were less than $1 million. ' See, Sections 1(cX4) to Part 11 of Schedule D. 'In comparison, as noted above, the Nasdaq SmallCap provides an alternative public float requirement of $I million for issuers that do not meet a $I minimum bid price. See Section (cX4) to Part II of Schedule D. eThe NASD notes that Alternative I of the Quantitative Designation Criteria for Nasdaq NMSthat Section 4 to Part III of Schedule D require a Nasdaq NMS issuer to maintain a $1 minimum bid price per share, or in the alternative, maintain a market value of public float of $3 million and $4 million of net tangible assets. The NASD is requesting that the proposed rule change be effective within 45 days of SEC approval. The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(6) of the Act which requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general to protect investors and the public interest. The proposed rule change amends the Alternative 2 Nasdaq NMS initial inclusion criteria to require a minimum price per share requirement of $3 or more. The proposed rule change amends the Nasdaq NMS quantitative maintenance criteria to require that the issuer maintain at least $1 million net tangible assets. The proposed rule change also amends the Nasdaq NMS quantitative maintenance criteria to require the issuer to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 or, in the alternative, a market value of public float of $3 million and $4 million of net tangible assets. The proposed rule change reflects the NASD's past and current initiatives to increase and clarify the initial and continued inclusion criteria of securities traded in the Nasdaq System and specifically, for purposes of this rule filing, the securities within the Nasdaq System that are traded on Nasdaq NMS. By amending the designation and maintenance criteria of the Nasdaq National Market System, the proposed rule change further perfects a mechanism ef a free and open market and a national market system, and in general, protects investors and the public interest. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not requires at least $4 million net tangible assets.

Miller, Senior Special Counsel, at (202) 272- 3018 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. The New Germany Fund, Inc. and the Future Germany Fund, Inc. (collectively, the \"Existing Funds\") are non-diversified, closed-end management investment companies registered under the Act. The investment objective of the Existing Funds is to seek long-term capital appreciation through investment in equity and equity-linked securities of companies domiciled in Germany. The New Germany Fund seeks to invest primarily in medium or small-sized German companies; however, up to 35% of its assets may be Invested in the 20 largest German companies. The FutureGermany Fund will invest in German companies of any size. It also may invest up to 25% of its total assets in debt securities denominated in German Deutsche Marks. 2. Applicants request that relief extend to funds that are registered investment companies for which DBCC, DBAM, Deutsche Bank or any of the other subsidiaries or affiliates of Deutsch Bank may in the future serve as investment adviser. 3. DBAM, a corporation organized under the laws of Germany, and DBCC, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York, both serve as investment advisers to the Existing Funds. Both are registered as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Pursuant to investment advisory agreements with the Existing Funds, DBAM makes recommendations to DBCC with respect to the Existing Funds' investments. Upon instructions from DBCC as to suitable securities for investment by the Existing Funds, DBAM transmits purchase and sale orders and selects brokers and dealers to execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the Existing Funds. Pursuant to a management agreement with each of the Existing Funds, DBCC acts as the corporate manager and administrator of the Existing Funds and, subject to the supervision of each of the Existing Fund's board of directors and pursuant to recommendations made by DBAM, determines the securities suitable for investment by the Existing Funds. 4. Deutsche Bank is a member of all eight of the German stock exchanges and frequently acts as lead manager or co-manager for underwritten public offerings in Germany of both debt and equity securities. DBAM and DBCC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank. Accordingly, DBAM and DBCC are affiliated persons with Deutsche Bank within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) fo the Act. Applicants' Legal Analysis 5. Section 10(f) of the Act provides, in part, that no registered investment company shall knowingly purchase or otherwise acquire, during the existence of any underwriting or selling syndicate, any security a principal underwriter of which is an investment adviser of such registered company, or is a person of which any such investment adviser is an affiliated person. Because applicants' investment advisers are affiliated with Deutsche Bank, applicants are prohibited from purchasing securities from an underwriting syndicate in which Deutsche Bank or any of its affiliates participate as a principal underwriter.6. Rule 10f-3 exempts a transaction from the provisions of section 10(f) if certain conditions are met. Subparagraph (a)(1) of rule lOf-3 requires that the securities purchased be part of an issue registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\"). Applicants intend to invest in equity securities of German companies that are not required to be registered under the Securities Act. Accordingly, applicants cannot meet the above condition; however, applicants represent that they will satisfy all other conditions of rule 10f-3 with regard to public offerings in Germany. In addition, applicants submit that all securities purchased in Germany under circumstances subject to section 10(f) will be purchased in public offerings conducted in accordance with the laws of Germany and the rules and regulations of the German stock exchanges, and all subject German issuers will have available to prospective purchasers financial statements, audited in accordance with the standards of Germany, for the two years prior to purchase. 7. Public offerings in Germany take the form of public subscription, in which the underwriters invite the public or their customers to make offers to subscribe to the new securities, or by outright sale, where the underwriters acquire and resell the securities allotted to and subscribed to by them. With respect to subsequent issuances of equity or equity-linked securities of German corporations, existing shareholders generally have statutory pre-emptive rights to these securities. Subscription rights that are not exercised by the existing shareholders are sold on the open market. 8. The public offering price of a security is fixed at the time of initial issuance and is published in the prospectus. However, applicants represent that, theoretically, securities may be offered to and purchased by affiliates of issuers and underwriters as part of a public offering on terms more favorable than those available to unaffiliated offerees and subscribers in the offering. Applicants contend that this is unlikely to happen in practice because it makes the new stock less attractive to potential investors. Applicants represent that the German Stock Exchange Admission Regulation (promulgated under the German Stock Exchange Act) and the Securities Sales Prospectuses Act require such a variance between the offering terms to affiliates and non-affiliates be disclosed in the offering prospectus. Consequently, applicants will not purchase securities in any offering16724 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices where the offering prospectus discloses that any portion of the securities being sold in the offering may be sold to any other investor at a price more favorable than the price available to applicants. 9. Applicants state that the number of subscribers participating in a public offering in Germany will vary significantly depending on the means of distribution selected in a particular offering and the nature of the existing trading market for an issuer's securities. Accordingly, securities that are admitted for trading on the official market of a German stock exchange may have a greater number of subscribers than securities admitted for trading on the regulated, unlisted market due to the comparatively greater size of the official market. Applicants assert that regardless of whether the securities are admitted for trading on the official market or the regulated, unlisted market, and regardless of whether the securities are purchased by public subscription or outright sale, a public offering is not limited to a few participants. Applicants will not participate in offerings in which the securities are not widely disseminated. Applicants state that securities purchased pursuant to the relief granted will be admitted for trading on the official market, the regulated unlisted market on one or more of the German stock exchanges, or have been approved for admission to the official or the regulated unlisted market but are not yet admitted or listed. 10. For a security to be officially listed on the German stock exchanges, the German Stock Exchange Law requires publication of a prospectus which contains all information considered material to an evaluation of the securities to be listed. Applicants applying for official listing on the exchanges must provide complete details of the issue including the latest annual financial statements with explanatory notes and disclosure of any liabilities not shown therein, and have available financial statements for the last three consecutive years. Applications for admission to trading in the regulated unlisted market must contain essentially similar information as that required for official listing, but in a condensed form that may be submitted as a memorandum. 11. Applicants represent that German public offerings may be conducted under three principal forms: the purchase contract, the commission agreement, and the agency contract. With respect to initial public offerings conducted on a \"purchase contract\" basis, the underwriting banks commit to purchase all of the securities at a fixed price and hold them either individuallyor as joint owners. With respect to subsequent issuances of securities of existing corporations, such offerings conducted on a purchase contract basis also will commit the underwriting bank to purchase all the securities issued, including those subject to preemptive rights, at a fixed price. Accordingly, the underwriting banks fully assume the risk of not finding sufficient third party purchasers for the securities subscribed under a purchase agreement. Under a\"commission agreement\" the banks are commission agents and sell the issue to investors in their name, but for the account of the issuer, whereas with an\"agency contract\" the banks sell the securities as representatives of the issuer in the name and for the account of the issuer. In either a \"commission agreement\" or an \"agency contract,\" the marketing risk generally remains with the issuer. Because clause (3) of paragraph (a) of rule 10f-3 requires the underwriters to purchase all the securities being offered (except those purchased by others pursuant to a rights offering), applicants undertake not to purchase securities in any offering where the offering prospectus discloses that the securities are subject to a\"commission agreement\" or \"agency contract\" rather than a \"purchase contract.\" 12. The only condition of rule lOf-3 that applicants cannot satisfy is that the securities will be registered under the Securities Act. Applicants assert that this registration requirement is largely a by-product of the requirement that the investment company purchase the securities at the public offering price (which ordinarily would iot exist absent registration). In addition, registration tends to indicate that the securities were issued more or less in the \"ordinary course\" of business. Applications note that the registration requirement appears in the same subparagraph as the requirements that a registered investment company purchase the securities in firm commitment underwriting, on the first day of the public offering, and for no more than the public offering price, indicating that registration is closely related to these requirements. Applicants believe that purchasing the securities at issue pursuant to a public offering conducted in accordance with German law, together with a requirement that audited financial statements for the previous two years be available to all prospective purchasers, provide an adequate substitute for the registration requirement. The availability of such financial statements, as well as other disclosure required ofissuers under German law, provide applicants' investment advisers with sufficient information to make informed investment decisions. Taken together with the requirement that securities subject to section 10(f) bepurchased in public offerings conductedin accordance with German law, investors can be assured that the securities are issued in the \"ordinary course of business.\" In light of these requirements, as well as the protection afforded by the other provisions of rule 10f-3, applicants believe that such purchases will not raise any of the concerns addressed by section 10(f) and that applicants' shareholders will be adequately protected. 13. In light of the foregoing, applicants request that an order be entered, pursuant to section 10(f), exempting applicants on the conditions set forth below to permit purchases of securities in public offerings in Germany in which Deutsche Bank or any of its affiliates participate as a principal underwriter. Applicants conclude that granting of this exemptive order is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes intended by the conditions set forth in rule lof- 3. Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. With the exception of paragraph (a)(1) of rule 10f-3, all other conditions set forth in rule 10f-3 be satisfied; 2. The foreign securities subject to section 10(f) will be purchased in a public offering conducted in accordance with the laws of Germany and the rules and regulations of the German stock exchanges; 3. All subject German issuers will have available to prospective purchasers financial statements, audited in accordance with the standards of Germany, for the two years prior to the purchase; and 4. The securities purchased are admitted for trading on the official market, the regulated unlisted market on one or more of the German stock exchanges, or have been approved for admission to the official or the regulated unlisted market but are not yet admitted or listed.

Hunold, Senior Attorney, on (202) 272-2676, or Wendell Faria, Deputy Chief, on (202) 272-2060, Office of Insurance Products (Division of Investment Management). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant, registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act, is a separate account of National Integrity Life Insurance Company (\"National\"). Applicant was organized under theprovisions of New York insurance law on December 23, 1987, for the purpose of issuing variable annuity contracts. 2. On December 30, 1987, Applicant filed a notification of registration as an investment company on Form N-8A under the 1940 Act. Also on that date, the Applicant filed a registration statement on Form N-4 (File No. 33- 19362) (\"December 1987 Form N-4\") under both the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933. The December 1987 Form N-4 registration statement, which never became effective, was withdrawn on September 1, 1989 by Order Consenting to the Withdrawal of the Registration Statement Under the Securities Act of 1933, as Amended. On January 19, 1990, Applicant filed another Registration Statement on Form N-4 (File No. 33-33119) (\"January 1990 Registration Statement\"), and filed a pre-effective amendment thereto on June 27, 1990, registering six classes of units of interest, each corresponding to one of Applicant's six investment divisions, under National's flexible payment variable annuity contracts (\"Contract\") funded through Applicant. The six divisions correspond to investment portfolios of the Shearson VIP Fund (\"VIP Fund\"), the underlying investment medium for the Contracts. The registration statement became effective on July 2, 1990, and the initial public offering of the Contracts and all classes of units thereunder commenced immediately. 3. Contract sales were significantly lower than originally anticipated. As of December 31, 1991, fifty-eight Contracts were outstanding. The minimal level of sales was primarily due to financial difficulties experienced by the manager for the VIP Fund and its subsidiary, First Capital Life Insurance Company (\"First Capital\"), which also issued variable annuity contracts for which the VIP Fund was the underlying investment medium. First Capital was placed in rehabilitation by California insurance authorities in mid-1991. Subsequently, Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., the exclusive distributor of the Contracts and an affiliate of First Capital, essentially ceased selling the Contracts. 4. National terminated the offering of the Contracts in February 1992 and supplemented the prospectus for the Contracts by \"Supplement Dated February 18, 1992 to Prospectus Dated May 1, 1991\" (the \"Supplement\"). The Supplement advised Contract holders that National would waive the contingent deferred withdrawal charge that otherwise would be applicable upon a surrender of an existing Contract.5. Applicant had no remaining assets as of October 1, 1992, and there were no Contracts outstanding. 6. Applicant's assets were liquidated by redemption of shares of the VIP Fund and payment to Contract owners of the surrender values under their Contracts, except that National waived any contingent deferred withdrawalcharges that would have been applicable upon surrender. 7. Due to the discontinuance of sales and the low number of Contracts outstanding, National and Applicant did not file a post-effective amendment to the January 1990 Registration Statement in 1992, in accordance with the Commission's position set forth in Great-West Life 8 Annuity Insurance Company (pub. avail. Oct. 23, 1990). 8. All expenses incurred in connection with Applicant's liquidation and deregistration under the federal securities laws, consisting primarily of administrative, legal, accounting, and telephone expenses, including waiver of the contingent deferred sales charge, have been or will be borne by National. 9. Applicant has no securityholders to whom distributions in complete liquidation of their interests have not been made. 10. Applicant intends to engage in no further business other than that necessary for the winding up of its affairs. 11. Applicant has not, during the last 18 months, transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries of which were or are security holders of the Applicant. 12. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceedings. 13. Applicant filed its final Rule 24f- 2 Notice on February 26, 1993, and its final report on Form N-SAR on March 1, 1993. Applicant's Legal Analysis 1. Applicant represents that it is not and has no plans for engaging In the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in, or holding securities, or of issuing face amount certificates of the installment type. Applicant is not making and does not propose to make a further public offering of security interests in the Contracts and currently has no assets.

Wible, Special Counsel, at (202) 272- 2060, Office of Insurance Products (Division of Investment Management). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Following is a summary of the application. The compete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicants Representations 1. The Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Western & Southern Life Insurance Company, is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Ohio. 2. The Company established the Variable Account under Ohio law on July 27, 1992. The Variable Account currently consists of ten subaccounts, each of which invests solely in the shares of a corresponding investment portfolio of The Managers Variable Insurance Trust, a Massachusetts business trust. On February 11, 1993, the Company filed a Form N-4 Registration Statement with the Commission to register the Variable Account under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust, and to register the Contracts under the Securities Act of 1933. 3. Interactive, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IFS Financial Services, Inc. (which, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), is the distributor of the Contracts. Interactive is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. 4. The Contracts may be purchased on a non-tax qualified basis (\"Non- Qualified Contracts\") or in connection with retirement plans or individual retirement accounts that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment (\"Qualified Contracts\"). The purchase of a Non-Qualified Contract requires a minimum initial purchase payment of $2000; the minimum initial purchase payment for a Qualified Contract is $1000. Initial payments of $50 ($600 annualized) are permitted if made pursuant to certain automatic or scheduled installment plans. Subsequent purchase payments under both Qualified and Non-Qualified Contracts must be at least $100 and may be made at any time. The maximum cumulative total of all purchase payments under any Contract may not exceed $500,000 without prior approval of the Company.5. Allocations of purchase payments will be according to the instruction given by the Contract owner. Purchase payments under the Contracts may be allocated exclusively to the Variable Account, exclusively to the Company's general account (the \"Fixed Account\"), or in part to both of those accounts. 6. While the Contract is in force, and prior to the date on which annuity payments begin (the \"Income Date\") or the death of the annuitant, a Contract owner may withdraw all or a portion of the Contract value. During the first seven years following the receipt of a purchase payment, such withdrawals generally will be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge. Certain tax penalties and restrictions may apply to full or partial surrenders. 7. Subject to certain conditions, a Contract owner may transfer all or part of the Contract value among the subaccounts and the Fixed Account. The Company currently imposes no charges for any such transfer, but reserves the right to modify availability of and the conditions for transfers, as well as the right to charge transfer fees. Any transfer charge assessed will not be designed to yield a profit to the Company. 8. If the annuitant dies before the Income Date, the Company will pay a death benefit to the beneficiary designated by the Contract owner. If the annuitant dies during the first seven Contract years and prior to the first day of the calendar month after the annuitant's eighteenth birthday, the death benefit will be the greater of: i) The total value of the Contract on the date satsifactory proof of death and death benefit payout instructions are received by the Company; I and (ii) the sum of all purchase payments made under a Contract less any amounts withdrawn (including any surrender charge thereon). If an annuitant dies on or after the seventh Contract anniversary and prior to the first day of the calendar month after the annuitant's eightieth birthday, the death benefit will equal the greatest of: (i) The Contract Value on the date satisfactory proof of death and death benefit payout instructions are received by the Company; (ii) the sum of all purchase.payments made under the Contract less any amounts withdrawn (including any surrender charge); and (iii) the Contract Value on the most recent septermial Contract anniversary, plus purchase payments made since such Contract anniversary, The total value of the Contract represents the sum of the combined values of amounts allocated to the Variable and Fixed Accounts (the \"Contract Value\").'16727 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices and less any amounts withdrawn since such Contract anniversary. If an annuitant dies on or after the first day of the calendar month after such annuitant's eightieth birthday, the death benefit will equal the Contract Value on the date satisfactory proof of death and death benefit payout instructions are received by the Company. 9. The Company will deduct from the Contract Value an annual maintenance charge of $35 per Contract, and from the assets of the Variable Account a Contract administration charge at an effective annual rate of .15 percent. The Company will not raise either of these charges for the duration of the Contracts. The Company expects that the total revenues from these charges will not exceed the expected costs of administering the Contracts. The Company will monitor the relationship of the annual maintenance charge and the Contract administration charge and the proceeds collected from those charges for compliance with Rule 26a- i under the 1940 Act. 10. No front-end sales charge will be imposed when purchase payments are applied under the Contracts. However, a contingent deferred sales charge (the \"Surrender Charge\") will be assessed against certain full or partial withdrawals. For the purpose of assessing a Surrender Charge, the following transactions will be considered withdrawals: Full withdrawal, partial withdrawal, and commencement of an annuity payment option within the first seven Contract years. 11. For purposes of computing the Surrender Charge, the earliest purchase payments will be deemed to be withdrawn first. The amount of the Surrender Charge, expressed as a percentage of each purchase payment amount withdrawn, is as follows: SurrenderYears since premium was paid change (percent) Fewer than 2 ..................... ..... 7 2 ......................................... .... .6 5 ......................................... .... .2 6 ................................................ 1 7 or m ore .................................. 0 12. No Surrender Charge shall be assessed: (i) At the death of an annuitant; (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law if, at the time of withdrawal, an annuitant has been confined to a long-term care facility or hospital for at least thirty days; or (iii) if at least two years after the date on which the Contract became effective,annuity payments begin under a payout plan which provides for payments which will be made for at least five years. The Company reserves the right to reduce or eliminate the Surrender Charge when Contracts are sold to a trustee, an employer, or a similar entity pursuant to a retirement plan, or to a group such that the Company saves sales expenses. 13. In any Contract year, the Contract owner may withdraw an amount equal to ten percent of all purchase payments that have not been withdrawn previously and have been credited to the Contract for a least one year without payinga Surrender Charge. 14. The Surrender Charge may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. If the Surrender Charge is insufficient to cover the distribution expenses, the deficiency may be met from amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expense risks (described below). 15. In those jurisdictions that assess a premium tax when annuity payments begin, the Company will deduct the applicable tax from the Contract value at the Income Date. In jurisdictions that assess a premium tax at the time purchase payments are made, the Company will deduct the applicable tax upon receipt of a purchase payment. The Company will not make a profit on deductions for premium taxes. 16. The Company will assess a daily change for bearing mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts. This charge is equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25 percent of the value of the assets of the. Variable Account. Of the 1.25 percent charge, 0.80 percent is charged for assuming the mortality risk and 0.45 percent is charged for assuming the expense risk. The Company guarantees that it will not raise the mortality and expense risk charge for the duration of the Contracts. 17. The mortality risk borne by the Company arises primarily from the Company's: (i) Contractual obligation to pay a death benefit upon death of the annuitant prior to the Income Date; and (ii) contractual obligation to continue to make annuity payments for the entire life of the annuitant under annuity payment options involving life contingencies. 18. The expense risk assumed by the Company is the risk that the Company's actual administrative costs will exceed the amounts recovered through the annual maintenance charge and the Contract administration charge. 19. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover the expenses and costs assumed, the loss will be borne by the Company.Conversely, if the amount deducted proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to the Company. The Company may earn a profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conclusions 1. Applicants request an exemption from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent any relief is necessary to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Variable Account which serves as the funding medium for the Contracts. 2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2), as herein pertinent, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services. 3. Applicants submit that the Company is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and expense risks. Applicants represent that the assessment to the Contracts of a 1.25 percent mortality and expense risk charge is consistent with the protection of investors because it is a reasonable and proper insurance charge. The mortality andexpense risk charge is a reasonable charge to compensate the Company for the risks that: (i) The Contract value will be less than the death benefit: (ii) annuitants under the Contracts will live longer as a group than has been anticipated In setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts; and (iii) administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the annual administrative charge and the Contract administration charge assessed by the Company. 4. Applicants represent that the level of the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable variable annuity contracts. The representation is based upon the Applicants' analysis of publicly available information regarding products of other companies, taking into consideration such factors as: Guaranteed minimum death benefits, guaranteed annuity purchase rates, minimum initial and subsequent purchase payments, other contract charges, the manner in which charges are imposed, investment options under16728 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices contracts, and availability to qualified and non-tax-qualified plans. The Company represents that it will maintain at its principal office, and make available to the Commission and its staff, a memorandum setting forth in detail the variable annuity products analyzed and the methodology and results of the Company's comparative review. 5. Applicants acknowledge that the Surrender Charge may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. Applicants also acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the Surrender Charge. In such circumstances, a portion of the mortality and expense risk charge might be viewed as providing for a portion of the costs relating to distribution of the Contracts. The Company concludes that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect to the Contracts will benefit the Variable Account and Contract owners. The Company represents that it will maintain at its principal office, and make available on request to the Commission and its staff, a memorandum setting forth the basis for such conclusion. 6. The Company represents that the Variable Account will invest only in underlying mutual funds that undertake, in the event such mutual funds adopt a plan under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors (or trustees)-the majority of whom are not interested persons of the Company-formulate and approve any such plan under Rule 12b-1. Conclusion Applicants assert that, for the reasons set forth above, the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts meet the standards in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Draft Convention on Sovereign Immunity Invitation for Public Comment The International Law Commission, an organ of the United Nations, has presented draft articles on the Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property to the General Assembly for possible adoption as a convention. The convention, a multilateral international agreement, would establish uniform rules concerning the extent to which a State may invoke sovereign immunity before the courts of another State. At the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, a working group of the Sixth Committee met between September 25 and November 6, 1992, to study the draft articles and the written comments of governments, in order to facilitate the16729 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices conclusion of a convention. The United States submitted written comments and also participated in the working group. The General Assembly decided to re- establish the working group in the Sixth Committee at its forty-eighth session in September, 1993. In its written and oral comments, the United States supported the efforts of the International Law Commission to reflect the \"restrictive theory\" of sovereign immunity, embodied in the United States Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, but expressed concerns about certain articles. The U.S. concerns related, inter alia, to: The definition of the term \"State\", especially with reference to \"political subdivisions\" and \"agencies or instrumentalities\" (Article 2, paragraphs 1(b) (iii) and (iv)); the subsidiary \"purpose\" test to determine whether a contract or transaction is \"commercial\" (Article 2, paragraph 2); the limitation on the ability of private parties, in exceptional circumstances, to obtain jurisdiction over a State that creates a separate State- controlled commercial entity (Article 10, paragraph 3); the operation of in rem proceedings and other limitations on immunity for ships and cargo (Article 16); limitations in the area of arbitration, including the absence of an exception to immunity for judicial enforcement of agreements to arbitrate and confirmation of arbitral awards (Article 17); the failure to provide adequately for immunity from pre-judgment attachments (Article 18); the requirement that State commercial property to be executed upon must be related to the underlying claim (Article 18). The text of the draft articles is reproduced below for public comment. Comment may be addressed to the Assistant Legal Adviser for Special Functional Problems, room 5420, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520. All public comments should be received on or before July 1, 1993, to ensure consideration. The written comments of the United States, as well as the report of the working group on its meeting in the fall of 1992, are available upon request from the office of the Assistant Legal Adviser for Special Functional Problems (202-647-1074).Dated: March 24, 1993.

ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for a proposed highway project in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and Burlington County, New Jersey. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Philibert A. Ouellet, District Engineer, FHWA, Pennsylvania Division Office, 228 Walnut Street, P.O. Box 1086, Harrisburg, PA 17108-1086. Telephone: (717) 782-4422. James B. Wilson, P.E. Associate Executive Director and Chief Engineer, Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, P.O. Box 8531, Harrisburg, PA 17105. Telephone: (717) 949-9551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC) will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to identify and evaluate alternatives for a direct linkage of 1-95 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike (1-276). This direct linkage would involve the redesignation of the portion of the Turnpike east of the proposed new interchange as \"1-95\". Such a redesignation would eliminate the16734 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, Match 30, 1993 / Notices current \"missing link\" thereby making 1-95 continuous through the mid- Atlantic region. The study limits includes 1-276 (PA Turnpike) from U.S. 1 (Exit 28 in Pennsylvania) to Route 130 (in New Jersey), and 1-95 from PA Route 413 to Business Route 1. A two-phased study approach will be used to identify and evaluate alternatives. The initial phase of this process is for scoping and alternative selection. The study will involve the development of potential alternatives through the study area. Each of the alternatives will be developed such that a means of comparison of each can be made along with the No Build Alternative. The following alternatives are under consideration: A new, direct interchange between 1-95 and 1-276 and 1-95 from four to six lanes, a new bridge across the Delaware River; a reconfiguration of the existing toll collection facilities, and a new location for toll collection facilities. Concurrent with the development of the alternatives, various types of data will be gathered which will describe the study area as it relates to the alternatives. The following environmental areas will be investigated for EIS preparation: Traffic, air quality, noise and vibration; surface land use; construction impacts; energy; municipal, industrial, and hazardous waste facilities, historic and archaeological structures and sites; Section 4(f) evaluation; and wild and scenic rivers. The above information will be utilized to refine the alternatives or eliminate a particular alternative from further considerations because of the potential for negative socioeconomic, environmental, or engineering impacts. The second phase will utilize the alternatives selected in the initial phase and perform a detailed analysis on each. These alternatives will be the basis for the detailed environmental and engineering studies and the Environmental Impact Statement. From this analysis a preferred alternative will be identified which meets the needs of traffic demand, and satisfies the environmental, socioeconomic, engineering and evaluations and public feedback. Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate federal, state and local agencies, and to provide organizations and citizens who express interest in theproject. Public meetings will be held in the area throughout the study process. Public notices of the time and place of these meetings and any required public hearings will be given. Public involvement and interagency coordination will be maintained through the development of the EIS. To insure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and that all significant issues are identified, comments or questions concerning this action and the EIS should be directed to FHWA or PTC at the addresses provided above.

IFR Dec. 93-7187 Filed 3-29-93; 8:45 am] BtIUNG Highway Safety Administration [Docket No. 93-22; Notice 1) General Motors; Receipt of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance General Motors (GM) of Warren, Michigan has determined that some of its vehicles fail to comply with 49 CFR 571.102, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 102, \"Transmission Shift Lever Sequence, Starter Interlock, and Transmission Braking Effect,\" and has filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573. GM has also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.) on the basis that noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This notice of receipt of a petition is published under section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgement concerning the merits of the petition. GM manufactured a total of 13,732 1992 Buick Skylarks which may not comply with the display requirements of Standard No. 102. On some of the subject vehicles (the precise number affected-is a function of production variability and, therefore, not determinable by GM) the electronicpark, reverse, neutral, drive, and low (PRNDL) display might not be illuminated when the ignition switch is in the rearmost portion of the \"Off\" position. Section S3.1.4.1 of Standard No. 102 requires that \"* * * if the transmission shift lever sequence includes a park position, identification of shift lever positions in relation to each other and the position selected [PRNDL display], shall be displayed in view of the driver whenever any of the following conditions exist: (a) The ignition is in a position where the transmission can be shifted. (b) The transmission is not in park.\" If the vehicle operator turns the ignition switch to the rearmost \"Off\" position without the transmission being placed in the \"Park\" position, the transmission shift interlock is activated The transmission shift interlock, required by Section S4.2 of Standard No. 114, prevents a vehicle's key from being removed from the ignition if the transmission is not in the \"Park\" position. In this situation on the noncompliant vehicles, the electronic PRNDL display would not be illuminated. Thus, the operator would not be aware that the key is locked in place due to the transmission being in a position other than \"Park.\" On these noncompliant vehicles, if the key is turned slightly forward, within the \"Off\" position, the electronic PRNDL display will be illuminated, thus informing the operator of the necessary information. GM supports its petition for - inconsequential noncompliance with the following: Two factors are key. First, GM has no record of any customer complaint or accident report that could be associated with or attributed to this condition. Second, all of the 13,732 vehicles comply with S3.1.4.1 of FMVSS 102 during normal ignition activation and vehicle operation. As NHTSA recognized in proposing the standard (49 FR 32409-32411 (August 25, 1988)), the purpose of the display requirement for PRNDL information is to \"provide the driver with transmission position information for the vehicle conditions where such information can reduce the likelihood of shifting errors.\" Thus, in all but the rarest circumstances, the primary function of the PRNDL display is to inform the driver of gear selection and relative position of the gears while the engine is running. All of the subject vehicles display PRNDL information whenever the ignition switch Is in the \"On\" or \"Run\" position. In fact, the only condition where PRNDL information would not be displayed as required by FMVSS 102 is when the ignition switch is in the rearmost portion to the \"Off\" position prior to the interlock. In order for this condition to be present, a vehicle would have to be affected with the [noncompliance] and then, a driver would have to shut the16735 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices vehicle's engine off without shifting the transmission to \"Park.\" In such a case, there are two possible outcomes: 1. The driver exits the vehicle (leaving the key in the ignition), or 2. The driver remains in the vehicle. Paralleling NHTSA's analysis in the Final Rule promugating the standard, the first outcome represents more of a theoretical possibility than an actual problem. Compared, for example, to drivers leaving their vehicles with their lights on, NHTSA recognized that the sort of driver behavior addressed here \"would be limited to the rare situation.\" (54 FR 29042, 29044 (July 11, 1989)). Indeed, as emphasized above, GM is aware of no complaint or claim that this rare situation has actually occurred with respect to the subject vehicles. Furthermore, as required by S4.5 of FMVSS 114, GM provides an audible warning to the driver that activates whenever the key has been left in the locking system and the driver's door is opened. In the second outcome, where a driver remains in the vehicle, his or her next action will be either an attempt to restart the vehicle's engine or an attempt to remove the key to exit the vehicle. If an attempt is made to restart the engine, S3.1.3 Starter Interlock of FMVSS 102 requires that the starter be inoperative whenever the vehicle's transmission is in gear. The driver rotating the ignition switch forward attempting to start the engine will definitely activate the PRNDL display. Therefore, the driver will have all the necessary information to conclude that the vehicle did not start because the transmission was not in \"Park\" or \"Neutral.\" With regard to the second potential action. GM's ignition locking system is designed so that upon key removal the transmission becomes locked in the \"Park\" position to meet S4.2 of FMVSS 114. Because both of these situations are covered by FMVSS requirements, a lack of PRNDL information in either of these cases may constitute a minor inconvenience, but will have no consequence to safety. GM recognizes that there may be isolated non-driving situations in which a person may desire to know gear selection or the relative position of the gears with the engine off, such as when placing the vehicle in tow. However, these cases occur infrequently and do not occur during a crisis or panic situation. If the noncompliant condition is present during these infrequent non-driving situations when PRNDL information may be desired, gear selection and relative positioning can easily be determined by rotating the ignition switch slightly forward to activate the electronic display without starting the vehicle's engine. Given the nature of these non-driving situations and since the information can be readily obtained with a slight key rotation, GM believes that the noncompliant condition will have no Influence on safety.

Notice 2] Subaru of America, Inc.; Grant of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance Subaru of America, Inc. (Subaru) of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, determined that some of its replacement seat belts fail to comply with 49 CFR 571.209, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 209, \"Seat Belt Assemblies,\" and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573. Subaru also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.) on the basis that the noncompliance was Inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This notice grants Subaru's petition. Notice of receipt of the petition was published on February 3, 1993, and an opportunity afforded for comment (58 FR 7033). Between October 1984 and November 1992, Subaru produced and sold approximately 25,000 sets of replacement seat belts which did not include installation instructions. Subaru sold approximately 1,000,000 vehicles to which these replacement seat belt assemblies are applicable and is unable to determine which of these vehicles contain the replacement belt assemblies. Paragraph S4.1(k) of Standard No. 209, requires that [al seat belt assembly or retractor shall be accompanied by an instruction sheet providing sufficient information for installing the assembly in a motor vehicle except for a seat belt assembly installed in a motor vehicle by an automobile manufacturer. Theinstallation instructions shall state whether the assembly is for universal installation or for installation only in specifically stated motor ,ehicles* * * In addition, paragraph S4.1[1] requires that [a] seat belt assembly or retractor shall be accompanied by written instructions for the proper use of the assembly, stressing particularly the importance of wearing the assembly snugly and properly located on the body, and on the maintenance of the assembly and periodic inspection of all components. The instructions shall show the proper manner of threading webbing in the hardware of seat belt assemblies in which the webbing is not permanently fastened. The instructions pertaining to threading and nonlocking retractors do not apply to Subaru's belt desies. Subaru supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following: I. Mismatch of Belt Assembly in Vehicle Seating Positioning Subaru replacement seat belts are offered as exclusive parts, unique to each model, vehicle configuration, and seating position. Those parts have specific part numbers identified in Subaru parts catalogs with illustrations. The item numbers shown in each illustration enable the ordering dealer to specify the replacement seat belt assembly (s)he is ordering by referring to the corresponding page which shows the applicable part number, specific vehicle model type, location applicable model year, etc. When ordering Subaru replacement parts, the dealer must refer to the Subaru parts catalog to identify the ordering part number with the information on the specific vehicle model type, location, and model year. Each replacement seat belt assembly is packaged individually with a specific part number label clearly attached on the package to ensure shipping the correct parts. Also, the dealer routinely checks to see that the part received matches the one ordered. There are a variety of significant hysical differences among Subaru seat elt assemblies, which include various mounting configuration and location differences, differences in buckle latch plate configuration and retractor locking device, webbing length and housing configuration differences, and differences in motorized seat belt guide track shapes. Given these variances in physical properties, [Subaru feels] it is not possible that a mechanic would install a replacement seat belt assembly in the wrong seating position. Thus, iSubaru believes] that the ordering and shipping procedures for Subaru replacement seat belts make it16736, Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices highly unlikely that a wrong seat belt assembly will be delivered to a dealer and, should the wrong seat belt be delivered, the above mentioned physical differences make it virtually impossible to install the seat belt in the wrong model vehicle or at an incorrect seating position. II. Improper Installation of Belt Assembly Subaru dealers install replacement seat belt assemblies in accordance with the instructions in Subaru service manuals for Subaru vehicles. Subaru service manuals are provided to every Subaru dealer and are widely available to the public and independent repair facilities. Therefore, (Subaru feels] improper installation of replacement seat belt assemblies is highly unlikely. In most cases of installation of a replacement seat belt, the installer will first remove the seat belt that needs to be replaced from the vehicle. After removal of the old seat belt, the installer will then reverse the steps of removal to properly locate and install the replacement belt. [Subaru feels that there] is no need to specify instructions for threading the webbing or finding locations for the drilling anchorage holes because replacement seat belt assemblies are furnished ready for installation in the vehicle's preexisting anchorage holes with a few simple steps. No comments were received on the petition. With respect to the failure to provide installation instructions, Subaru has argued that a mismatch of a replacement seat belt assembly in the wrong vehicle or seating position is highly unlikely, and therefore that it is unimportant to specify whether the assembly is for universal or specific application. Subaru's parts ordering and shipping procedures appear to ensure that the correct replacement parts are received by the dealer. Further, even if the wrong parts are purchased it will be obvious to the installer that the replacement is of a different shape than the belt being replaced, and the physical differences between the two belts make it virtually impossible for the wrong one to be installed. After reviewing these arguments, NHTSA concurs with them. With respect to the failure to provide usage and maintenance instructions, Subaru has argued that this information is contained in its operator manuals, and for this reason the noncompliance is inconsequential. NHTSA does not necessarily agree with this argument. Subaru assumes that the vehicle will retain its operator's manual throughoutit's life, or that the manual will be replaced by an operator if missing. Instead, the agency has a different approach. In its view, the most likely person to be affected by Subaru's failure to provide this information is the person who, for the first time, has brought a Subaru vehicle lacking its operator's manual, and who must replace its seat belt assemblies. The probability of this combination of events happening appears to be slight, justifying an inconsequentiality determination. NHTSA notes that it has recently granted the petition by Nissan Motor Company Ltd. covering the same types of noncompliances with Standard No. 209 (58 FR 8651). Accordingly, petitioner has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliances herein described are inconsequential as they relate to motor vehicle safety, and its petition is granted.

SUMMARY: The 1993 inflation adjustment factor and reference prices are used in determining the availability of the renewable electricity production credit under section 45(a) of the Code. DATES: The 1993 inflation adjustment factor and reference prices apply to calendar year 1993 sales of kilowatt hours of electricity produced in the United States or a possession thereof from qualified energy resources. INFLATION FACTOR: The inflation adjustment factor for calendar year 1993 is 1. PRICE: The reference prices for calendar year 1993 are 4.740 per kilowatt hour for facilities producing electricity from wind and 0\u20ac per kilowatt hour for facilities producing electricity from closed-loop biomass. The reference price for electricity generated from closed-loop biomass is based on a determination by the Internal Revenue Service under section 45(d)(2)(C) of the Code that in calendar year 1992 there were no sales of electricity under contracts entered into after December 31, 1989. The renewable electricity16737 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Notices production credit is available for a facility that originally is placed in service after December 31, 1992, in the case of a facility producing electricity from closed-loop biomass, and after December 31, 1993, in the case of a facility producing electricity from wind. Because the 1993 reference price for closed-loop biomass-produced electricity does not exceed 84 multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor, the phaseout of the credit provided in section 45(b)(1) of the Code does not occur for electricity sold during calendar year 1993. There is no 1993 phase-out calculation for wind- produced electricity because availability of the credit starts for sales of the electricity after 1993. CREDIT: The renewable electricity production credit for calendar year 1993 is 1.50 per kilowatt hour on the sale of electricity produced from closed-loop biomass. There is no renewable electricity production credit for calendar year 1993 on the sale of electricity produced from wind. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul F. Handleman.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines the coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica) to be a threatened species throughout its historic range in southern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Critical habitat is not being designated. This small, insectivorous songbird occurs almost exclusively in several distinctive subassociations of the coastal sage scrub plant community and is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation occurring in conjunction with urban and agricultural development. This rule implements Federal protection provided by the Act for the coastal California gnatcatcher. A proposed special rule that defines the conditions associated with certain land-use activities under which the incidental take of gnatcatchers would not be a violation of section 9 of the Act is published in this same Federal Register separate part. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective on March 25, 1993. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Carlsbad Field Office, 2730 Loker Avenue West, Carlsbad, California 92008. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jeffrey D. Opdycke, Field Supervisor, at the address listed above (telephone 619/431-9440). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica) is a small, long-tailed member of the thrush family Muscicapidae. Its plumage color is dark blue-gray above and grayish-white below. The tail is mostly black above and below. The male has a distinctive black cap that is absent during the winter. Both sexes have a distinctive white eye-ring. Vocalizations of thisspecies include a call consisting of a rising and falling series of three, kitten- like, mew notes (National Geographic Society 1983). The California gnatcatcher (Polioptila colifornica) was originally described as a distinct species by Brewster (1881) based on specimens collected by F. Stephens in 1878. However, based on the analysis of Grinnell (1926), P. californica was classified in 1926 as three subspecies of the black-tailed gnatcatcher (Polioptila melanura), which is widely distributed throughout the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts of the southwestern United States and Mexico (American Ornithologists' Union 1983, Atwood 1988). Subsequent scientific publications (American Ornithologists' Union 1931, Grinnell and Miller 1944, Friedmann 1957, American Ornithologists' Union 1957) adhered to the species limits as defined by Grinnell (1926). Atwood (1988) concluded that P. californica was specifically distinct from P. melanura, based on differences in ecology and behavior. This finding was subsequently adopted by the American Ornithologists' Union Committee on Classification and Nomenclature (American Ornithologists Union 1989). A comprehensive overview of the nomenclatural history of the California gnatcatcher is provided by Atwood (1988, 1990, 1991). Polioptila californica californica (hereafter referred to as the coastal California gnatcatcher) is one of three subspecies of the California gnatcatcher and is restricted to coastal southern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico, from Los Angeles County (formerly Ventura and San Bernardino Counties) south to El Rosario at about 300 north latitude (American Ornithologists' Union 1957, Atwood 1991, Phillips 1991, Banks and Gardner 1992). Two other subspecies of the California gnatcatcher (P. c. pontilis and P. c. margaritae) occur in the central and southern portions of the Baja peninsula, respectively (American Ornithologists' Union 1957, Atwood 1988). Atwood (1990, 1991) concluded that the subspecific nomenclature of California gnatcatchers south of 300 north latitude should \"* * * properly revert to that initially proppsed by Grinnell (1926), with P. c. margaritae being distributed in central Baja California from 300 N. south to 240 N., and P. c. abbreviata occurring in the Cape Region of Baja California south of 240 N. latitude.\" A general analysis of the historic range of the coastal California gnatcatcher indicates that about 41 percent of its latitudinal distribution iswithin the United States and 59 percent within Baja California, Mexico (Atwood 1990). A more detailed analysis, based on elevational limits associated with gnatcatcher locality records, reveals that 65 to 70 percent of the coastal California gnatcatcher's historic range was located in southern California rather than Baja California (Atwood 1992a). The coastal California gnatcatcher occurs almost exclusively in the coastal sage scrub plant community (occasionally, it is also found in chaparral). The southern limit of its range coincides with the distributional boundary of this distinctive vegetation type. Coastal sage scrub vegetation is composed of relatively low-growing, summer (dry-season) deciduous, and succulent plants. Characteristic plants of this community include coastal sagebrush (Artemisia californica), various of (Munz 1974, Kirkpatrick and Hutchinson 1977, Mooney 1988, O'Leary 1990). The coastal California gnatcatcher commonly occurs in coastal sage scrub vegetation dominated by coastal sagebrush (Atwood 1980, 1990; Mock and Jones 1990) although in some portions of its range (e.g., western Riverside County) other plant species may be more abundant. A comprehensive overview of the life history and ecology of the coastal California gnatcatcher is provided by Atwood (1990) and is the basis for much of the discussion presented below. The' coastal California gnatcatcher is non- migratory and defends breeding territories ranging in size from 2 to 14 acres (1 to 6 hectares (ha)). Home ranges vary in size from 13 to 39 acres (5 to 15 ha) (Mock and Jones 1990). The breeding season of the coastal California gnatcatcher extends from late February through July with the peak of nest initiations occurring from mid-March through mid-May. Nests are composed of grasses, bark strips, small leaves, spider webs, down, and other materials, and are often placed in coastal sagebrush about 3 feet (ft) (1 meter (m)) above the ground. Nests are constructed over a 2 to 10 day period. Clutch size averages four eggs. The incubation and nestling periods encompass about 14 and 16 days, respectively. Juveniles are dependent upon, or remain closely associated with, their parents for up to several months following departure from the nest, and may disperse up to 9 mi (14 kin) from their natal territory. Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Both sexes participate in all phases of the nesting cycle. Although the coastal California gnatcatcher may occasionally produce two broods in one nesting season, the frequency of this behavior is not known. Coastal California gnatcatchers were considered locally common in the mid- 1940's, although a decline in the extent of its habitat was noted (Grinnell and Miller 1944). By the 1960's, this species had apparently experienced a significant population decline in the United States that has been attributed to widespread destruction of its habitat. Pyle and Small (1961)-eported that \"the California subspecies is very rare, and lack of recent records of this race compared with older records may indicate a drastic reduction in population.\" McCaskie and Pugh (1964) commented that the coastal California gnatcatcher \"had been driven from most of its former range along the coast of the region.\" Atwood (1980) estimated that no more than 1,000 to 1,500 pairs remain in the United States. He also noted that remnant portions of its habitat were highly fragmented, and that most remaining patches are bordered on at least one side by rapidly expanding urban centers. Subsequent reviews of coastal California gnatcatcher status by Garrett and Dunn (1981) and Unitt (1984) paralleled the findings of Atwood (1980). Atwood (1990, 1992b) estimated that approximately 1,811 to 2,291 pairs of coastal California gnatcatchers remain in southern California. Of these, 24 to 30 pairs occur in Los Angeles County, 224 to 294 pairs in Orange County, 724 to 916 pairs in Riverside County, and 837 to 1,061 pairs in San Diego County. Michael Brandman Associates (1991) estimated that 1,645 to 1,880 pairs of California gnatcatchers occur in the United States (20 to 30 pairs in Los Angeles County, 325 to 350 pairs in Orange County, 300 to 400 pairs in Riverside County, and 1,000 to 1,100 pairs in San Diego County). Based on information received after the proposed rule was published, the Service estimates that about 2,562 pairs of coastal California gnatcatchers remain in the United States. Of these, 30 pairs occur in Los Angeles County, 757 pairs in Orange County, 261 pairs in Riverside County, and 1,514 pairs in San Diego County. Approximately 2,800 pairs of P. c. californica occur in the Mexican portion of its range U. Newman, Regional Environmental Consultants (RECON), pers. comm., 1992). Most populations of the coastal California gnatcatcher in the United States occur on private lands. About 21percent (81,992 of 393,655 acres) of coastal sage scrub in southern California (south of metropolitan Los Angeles) is publicly owned (California Department of Fish and Game 1992). Of that, about 52,500 acres or 64 percent occurs within military reservations. Major private landholdings containing known or suspected populations of the coastal California gnatcatcher include properties owned by: The Irvine Company, Rancho Santa Margarita Company, and Mission Viejo Company in Orange County; Baldwin Company, The Fieldstone Company, Home Capital, Los Montanas, McMillin Company, San Miguel Partners, and Southwest Diversified in San Diego County; and Domenigoni Brothers Ranch, Ranpac Engineering Corporation, and S.I.C. Corporation in Riverside County. Major public landowners or jurisdictions with gnatcatcher populations include the California Department of Parks and Recreation, Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, Fallbrook Naval Annex, Miramar Naval Air Station, the cities of San Diego and Lake Elsinore, the Metropolitan Water District (MWD) of Southern California, and the counties of Orange, Riverside, and San Diego. Previous Federal Action In 1982, the Service designated the coastal black-tailed gnatcatcher (Polioptila melanura californico) as a category 2 candidate for addition to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and solicited status information (47 FR 58454). In subsequent Federal Register Notices of Review, the coastal black-tailed gnatcatcher was retained in category 2 (50 FR 37958, 54 FR 554). This taxon is now recognized as a subspecies of Polioptila californica. Category 2 comprises taxa for which information in possession of the Service indicates that proposing to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat are not currently available to support a proposed rule. Essentially, no data were submitted in response to Service solicitations (published in' Federal Register Notices of Review in 1982 and 1985) for gnatcatcher status information. To resolve the issue of whether conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat exist, the Service conducted a status review (Salata 1991) of the coastal California gnatcatcher. On September,21, 1990, the Service received petitions from the Palomar Audubon Society and the San Diego Biodiversity Project to list the nominate subspecies of the California gnatcatcheras an endangered species. A third petition for the same action was received on December 17, 1990. This petition, submitted by the Manomet Bird Observatory and the Natural Resources Defense Council, also requested the Service to emergency list the coastal California gnatcatcher. On January 24, 1991, the Service found that substantial information had been presented indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted (56 FR 12146). The Service's status review indicated that proposing the coastal California gnatcatcher for listing under the normal procedures of section 4 was warranted. A proposed rule to list the gnatcatcher as endangered was published in the Federal Register on September 17, 1991 (56 FR 47053). A notice of extension and reopening of the comment period for 30 days to obtain additional information on gnatcatcher taxonomy was published in the Federal Register on September 22, 1992 (57 FR 43688). A second petition to emergency list the coastal California gnatcatcher was submitted by the Natural Resources Defense Council on February 3, 1993, and received by the Service on February 4, 1993. This petition was regarded as a fourth request for the same action and a separate finding was not made. On February 11, 1993, the Service published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the reopening of the public comment period on the proposed rule for 20 days and the availability of a report prepared by Service taxonomists on the taxonomic validity of P. c. californica (58 FR 8032). Summary of Conunents and Recommendations In the proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. On September 5, 1991, the Service announced its decision to propose the coastal California gnatcatcher for listing as an endangered species and held congressional briefings in Washington, DC, and Carlsbad, California. Twenty- eight members of Congress or their staff were invited to attend. Press notices describing this proposed action were also released on this date by the Service's Public Affairs Office in Washington, DC, and Portland, Oregon. Appropriate elected officials (including the Governor of California and 28 congressional representatives), 3 State agencies, 4 county and 50 city governments, 7 Federal agencies, and 50 landowners and other potentially affected or interested parties were ,contacted and requested to comment. A16743 16744 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations letter of notification and a copy of the proposed rule were also sent to the government of Mexico. The Service held two public hearings on the proposed rule. Notification of the hearings was published in the Federal Register on February 7, 1992 (57 FR 4747). A legal notice announcing the hearings and-inviting general public comment on the proposal was also published on February 7, 1992, in the Los Angeles Daily News, Los Angeles Times, Riverside Press-Enterprise, and Son Diego Union-Tribune. Public hearings were conducted in Anaheim, California, on February 25, 1992, and in San Diego, California, on February 27, 1992. About 400 people attended the hearings. An additional notification reopening the public comment period for 30 days and extending, by not more than 6 months, the deadline for a final decision on the proposal was published in the Federal Register on September 22,1992 (57 FR 43686). A legal notice announcing these actions and inviting general public comment on the proposal was published in the Riverside Press- Enterprise and the San Diego Union- Tribune on October 6, 1992. The Service published a-notice in the Federal Register announcing the reopening of the public comment period on the proposed rule for 20 days on February 11, 1993 (58 FR 8032). A total of 770 comments were received during the three comment periods, which encompassed almost 8 months. (Multiple comments, whether written or oral from the same party on the same date, are regarded as one comment.) That total includes 99 comments received between March 17 and September 22, 1992, when the public comment period was extended for an additional 30 days. Of these, 309 (40 percent) supported listing, 366 (48 percent) opposed listing; and 95 comments (12 percent) neither supported nor opposed listing. In addition, a petition containing 9,000 signatures supported listing on an emergency basis. A petition containing 6,000 signatures opposed the listing. A total of 312 comments were received prior to the September 17, 1991, publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register. Of these, 229 (73 percent) supported listing and 71 (23 percent) did not; 12 comments (4 percent) neither supported nor opposedlisting. One congressional representative, two elected local officials, over 30 conservation groups, 3 scientific organizations, and the government of Mexico supported listing. Several labor and building industry organizations,one congressional representative, and a number of landowners opposed listing. The Service has reviewed all of the written and oral comments described above including those that were received outside of the formal comment periods. Based on this review, 20 relevant issues have been Identified and are discussed below. These issues are representative of the comments questioning or opposing the proposed listing action. Issue 1: The Service should not carry out this listing action because the California gnatcatcher and its northern, nominate subspecies are not valid taxa. Many commenters questioned the legitimacy of the recent change in the taxonomy of the black-tailed gnatcatcher (Polioptila melanura) and the existence of a distinct subspecies in southwestern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico, north of 300 north latitude. Service Response: The Service and the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) have concluded that Polioptila californica californica is a valid taxon. Atwood (1988) re-examined the issue of species limits within the black-tailed gnatcatcher and concluded, based on differences in ecology and behavior (vocalizations), that the coastal southwestern California and northwestern, central, and southern Baja California, Mexico, populations constitute a separate species which he referred to as the California gnatcatcher, Polioptila californica, returning to Brewster's 1881 treatment. Atwood (1988) reported that in those few areas where California and black-tailed gnatcatchers co-occur, they do not interbreed, which is a fundamental isolating mechanism that separates species. The conclusion that California and black-tailed gnatcatchers are separate species was formally accepted by the AOU Committee on Classification and Nomenclature in 1989 (American Ornithologists' Union 1989). This committee and its publication, Check- list of North American Birds, are recognized as authorities on avian taxonomy in North America. No additional data or published information on this issue were submitted or otherwise available to the Service since publication of the proposed rule. Four letters from representatives of the AOU Committee on Classification and Nomenclature (including its chairman) were submitted during the public comment period that reiterated the AOU's formal acceptance of Atwood's conclusion that the California gnatcatcher is specifically distinct.The existence of a distinct subspecies of gnatcatcher in coastal southern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico, has been recognized by Grinnell (1926, 1928), van Rossem (1931), American Ornithologists: Union (1931), Friedmann (1957), American Ornithologists' Union (1957), Paynter (1964), Atwood (1991), and Phillips (1991). Although Atwood (1988) initially recommended merging P. c. californica and P. c. pontilis of central Baja California into one subspecies, he later retracted this position after re- examining intraspecifid variation within the California gnatcatcher using a more appropriate statistical treatment as suggested by two members of the AOU Committee on Classification and Nomenclature (Banks 1989, Johnson 1989). This revised analysis (Atwood 1991) has been peer-reviewed by several recognized taxonomists (including one member of the AOU Committee on Classification and Nomenclature) and published. It supports the long-accepted istribution of Polioptila melanura (=californica) californica that was first described by Grinnell (1926) over 60 years ago. In response to comments that questioned the taxonomic validity of the subspecies, Service taxonomists were directed to independently evaluate this issue and to prepare a report summarizing their findings. Their review concluded that the coastal California gnatcatcher is a valid subspecies whose range extends to about 300 north latitude in Baja California, Mexico (Banks and Gardner 1992). Issue 2: Several commenters questioned the validity of the statistical analysis used by Atwood (1991) to evaluate intraspecific morphological variation within the California gnatcatcher. They concluded that he pooled data into three broad groups along a latitudinal gradient prior to performing statistical tests that were used to define subspecies limits. One commenter also submitted that the method used by Atwood (1991) of initially pooling data into 9 sample areas may have biased the results of his statistical analysis and subsequent subspecies determinations. Service Response: Atwood's methods have been peer-reviewed and there has been no indication that he used inappropriate statistical methods. The 31 morphological characters examined by Atwood (1991) were initially segregated into 7 groups or clusters of characters that showed similar patterns of geographic variation. At this stage of the analysis, sample area data were not grouped or pooled. Next. univariate Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations multiple comparison tests were done on the non-pooled data from nine sample areas to identify where significant differences between groups may occur. The results of the two analyses described above indicated that an abrupt change or \"step\" occurs at 300 north latitude with respect to several morphological characters, \"especially those related to darkness of body plumage and the amount of white on rectrices 5 and 6\" (Atwood 1991). Two multivariate cluster analyses were then made based on different combinations of morphological variables. The first used nine variables that were selected based on a stepwise discriminant function analysis that identified those characters most effective in separating the nine sample areas. The second involved the same 22 morphological characters used by Atwood (1988) to analyze interspecific variation within the \"black-tailed\" gnatcatcher group. These cluster analyses did not involve grouping or pooling of data among the nine sample areas. The results of these two independent analyses were virtually identical and distinguished three geographic groups of California gnatcatchers. Atwood (1991) based his conclusions regarding subspecies limits on the abrupt changes in morphological variation revealed by these analyses. Finally, data from the nine sample areas were pooled into three groups based on the results of the cluster analyses described above and statistically analyzed by analysis of variance for differences between geographically adjacent groups. A number of statistically significant differences were found but these were not used to make determinations regarding subspecies limits. The method used by Atwood (1991) of initially defining nine sample areas is not considered unconventional with respect to ornithological taxtnomy. Banks and Gardner (1992), who independently reviewed this issue, reported that \"Atwood's (1991) procedures and methods are well within the norm for systematic/taxonomic reviews of geographic variation in birds. It appears that all readily available pertinent specimen material was used, population samples were assembled properly, all important variable morphological characters were examined, and statistical treatments were appropriate.\" Issue 3: Several commenters suomitted that the taxonomic conclusions reported by Atwood (1991) are not valid because they are based largely on variations in plumage-colorthat may be environmental and not genetic in origin. Service Response: Whether or not the abrupt changes in morphological variation reported by Atwood (1991) for the California gnatcatcher are genetically-based is not known at this time. The traditional scientific approach to defining avian subspecies has been based almost exclusively on the identification of morphological differences in body measurements and plumage characters between geographically distinct populations of a species irrespective of whether these differences have a demonstrated genetic origin, although environmental and dietary factors can affect plumage coloration in birds to varying degrees. The distributional limits of subspecies have been traditionally determined largely by the correlation between diagnostic morphological characters (including those associated with color) and the environment (May 1971). Atwood's conclusions are strengthened by congruent patterns in geographic -variation among several species at 300 north latitude, which represents the southern range limit of the coastal sage scrub community and an important transition zone for various birds, plants, terrestrial insects, land mammals, reptiles, and scorpions (Atwood 1991 and references cited therein). Issue 4: Many commenters expressed the position that the report entitled \"A Rangewide Assessment of the California Gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica)\" by Michael Brandman Associates (MBA), dated July 23, 1991, rebuts the Service's finding that listing of the coastal California gnatcatcher iswarranted. Service Response: The Service has considered the findings of the MBA report in determining to list the coastal California gnatcatcher. MBA (1991) reported that fewer than 2,000 pairs of coastal California gnatcatchers occur in the United States, two-thirds of coastal sage scrub vegetation inCalifornia has been destroyed, a 140mkm (87 mi) gap exists between the United States and Mexican populations due to urban and agricultural development, and. only 1 percent of the Mexican population of Polioptila californica occurs north of 300 north latitude, which represents the southern range limit of P. c. californica. These findings are consistent with published and unpublished reports on coastal California gnatcatcher status that were used by the Service in determining to propose and list this subspecies. MBA (1991) also reported that \"at least 100 square miles of coastal sage scrub habitat, much of which is suitable for the California gnatcatcher, isprotected or currently committed to be preserved in public and private open space in Orange and San Diego Counties alone.\" However, the MBA report does notcontain a discussion of the methods used to derive the 100 square mile value, and insufficient or incorrect data are presented to support this conclusion. No data are presented with respect to gnatcatcher distribution within \"protected open space areas.\" No distinction is made between \"dedicated\" and \"designated\" open space. The latter is subject to zoning changes for urban development, which is one of the reasons why the Service found that existing regulatory mechanisms do not adequately protect the gnatcatcher or its habitat. In some cases, even dedicated open space does not confer sufficient protection; two examples are discussed under factor \"D\" in the \"Summary of Factors Affecting the Species\" section of this rule. Atwood (1992a) reported that 94 percent of all gnatcatcher locality records (n=306) for Orange and San Diego Counties occur below 250 m (820 ft) in elevation (Atwood 1992a). Based on a much larger sample size (n=781) for the same geographic area, MBA (1991) reported that 91 percent of all gnatcatcher records occur at or below 250 m (820 ft) and 99 percent occur at or below 300 m (98 fi) in elevation. These data have important implications for gnatcatcher conservation. Although protection of coastal sage scrub above 250 m to 300 m (800 to 1000 ft) in Orange and San Diego Counties is important for other biological reasons, it may contribute little to the long-term maintenance of viable gnatcatcher populations (Atwood 1992a). Of approximately 19,000 acres of coastal sage scrub in Orange County found below 300 m in elevation, 36 percent (6,800 acres) is preserved, 21 percent (4,000 acres) is approved or proposed for development, and 43 percent (8,300 acres) is of uncertain status (Roberts 1992). Only 9 of 148 pairs of gnatcatchers, or 6 percent, presently occur in \"open space dedication areas\" in the Rancho Mission Viejo area of Orange County based on a map submitted to the Service by the Coalition for Habitat Conservation (1992). Of the 7,000 acres\"preserved in the Lomas Ridge/ Limestone/Whiting Ranch greenbelt\" (MBA 1991), only 1,400 acres are currently protected; the balance of the set-aside is contingent upon construction of housing and transportation facilities. Only 6 pairs of coastal California gnatcatchers occur in 2.800 acres of coastal sage scrub found16745 16746 Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday. March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations within the Whiting Ranch and Limestone Canyon areas of Orange County (unpublished data on file at the Carlsbad Field Office of the Fish and Wildlife Service). These data do not support the finding of MBA (1991) for Orange'County that \"in all, coastal sage scrub in existing or committed open space encompasses most existing populations of California gnatcatcher in the county.\" In addition, MBA (1991) reported that 168 acres of coastal sage scrub are preserved in Upper Newport Bay in Orange County. However, this area contains only about 35 acres of coastal sage scrub (F. Roberts, Fish and WildlifeService, pers. comm.). Furthermore the discussion of habitat fragmentation in the MBA report is entirely qualitative and fails to consider the effects of fragmentation on rates of hest predation and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater nest parasitism. Methods and data are not presented to support or allow independent verification of the stated conclusions. Issue 5: An assessment of the degree of coastal sage scrub loss and fragmentation should not be based on a comparison between older and recent vegetation maps because of differences in scale and mapping techniques. Several commenters questioned the validity of assessing the extent of coastal sage scrub loss and fragmentation based on.a comparison of vegetation maps by Kuchler (in Barbour and Major 1977). Oberbauer (1979), Kirkpatrick and Hutchinson (1980), San Diego Association of Governments (1986), RECON (1990a,b), Roberts (1990), and County of Orange (1991a). Service Response: The Service has attempted to use all available information in assessing the threats to the coastal California gnatcatcher and the ecosystem upon which it depends. The intent in citing the references listed above in the proposed rule was to provide supporting documentation for the finding that a widespread pattern exists with respect to the progressive loss and fragmentation of habitat in which this species occurs. The Service agrees that differences in scale and mapping techniques preclude a rigorous quantitative analysis of this issue and that Kuchler's published map is' hypothetical, in part, since no comprehensive empirical data are available from which to completely reconstruct the original extent of coastal sage scrub in southern California. However, based on the sources listed above, as well as maps presented by the U.S. Forest Service (1934), Minnich (1990). MBA (1991), and the County ofOrange (1992), the Service finds that although the historic distribution of coastal sage scrub and gnatcatcher habitat were undoubtedly patchy to some degree, this condition has been exacerbated by urban and agricultural development. The most conservative estimate of coastal sage scrub loss (relative to the pristine condition) within the existing range of the gnatcatcher in the United States. has been reported as 66 percent by MBA (1991). Additional supporting documentation is provided by Wieslander end Jensen (1946). They reported that in 1945 there .were 95,000 acres of \"coastal sagebrush\" in Orange County. 279,000 acres in Riverside County, and 381,000 acres in San Diego County. As of 1990, the Service estimates there were about 48,000 acres of \"coastal sagebrush\" in Orange County (Roberts 1990), 114,000 acres in Riverside County (based on- maps by Minnich 1990 and RECON 1990a), and 135,000 to 152,000 acres in San Diego County (Oberbauer and Vanderwier 1991, San Diego Association of Governments 1992). These data represent coastal sage scrub losses of 50, 59, and 60 to 65 percent for Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties, respectively, since 1945. Overall, 58 to 61 percent of the coastal sage scrub present within this geographic area in 1945 had been lost by 1990. Issue 6: A listing action is unnecessary because the Coastal Sage Scrub Natural Community Conservation Planning Program (NCCP). established by the California Resources Agency under the Natural Community Conservation Planning Act of 1991, adequately protects and provides for the conservation of the coastal California gnatcatcher. Service Response: The Coastal Sage Scrub NCCP is a voluntary, collaborative effort between landowners, local jurisdictions, and the State of California. The Service is cooperating with the California Department of Fish and Game (Department) in the development of this program and has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department that formalizes this commitment. Based on the findings presented below under Factor D in the section entitled. \"Summary of Factors Affecting the Species.\" the Service concludes that the NCCP Program does not currently provide adequate conservation of the coastal California gnatcatcher to the degree that a listing action is not warranted. However, the Service recognizes the potential benefits to thegnatcatcher that may occur from this program, and finds that the overall participation in the program has contributed to reducing some of the short-term threats to this species in portions of its range in the United States. Issue 7: Listing of the coastal California gnatcatcher as endangered is not warranted because there are 1.5 million pairs of this species In Baja California, Mexico. Service Response: Many commenters raised this Issue, which is based entirely on an unpublished, draft report entitled, \"Distribution and Population Estimates of the California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica) in Baja California, Mexico\" prepared for the Building Industry Association of Southern California by RECON 11991a). This draft report, dated June 26, 1991, was not formally submitted to the Service until October 20, 1992, by the Coalition for Habitat Conservation during the secondpublic comment period on the proposed rule. The technique used by RECON to census gnatcatchers was the variable- strip transect method (Emlen 1971), as modified by Franzreb (1981). Two hundred transects located at about 5- mile intervals adjacent to roads between Tijuana and Ciudad Insurgentes were censused for gnatcatchers using playback of taped gnatcatcher vocalizations and sampled for selective floristic data. Gnatcatcher densities were calculated for each of 13 vegetation types by multiplying observed densities by a coefficient of detectability (Emlen 1971) based on the total sample. Gnatcatcher population estimates for each vegetation type were calculated by multiplying the adjusted gnatcatcher densities by the extent of each vegetation type derived from a 1:1,000,000 scale vegetation map. A total of 396 California gnatcatchers were detected in the RECON study; 99 percent of which were found south of 300 north latitude, which represents the southern range limit of Polioptila californica californica. No gnatcatchers were observed north of Santo Tomas, which is about 140 km (87 mi) south of the international border, and 87 percent of all gnatcatcher detections occurred .below 300 m (984 ft) in elevation. A total of 26 gnatcatchers were detected north of 300 north latitude (J. Newman, pers. comm., 1992). California gnatcatchers occurred in coastal sage scrub habitat which \"* * * closely resembles that found in the United States in terms of structure and species composition * * *\" north of 300 north latitude (RECON 1991a). South of 300 north latitude, RECON reported that California gnatcatchers occur in open Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations desert habitats but ' * * were more often detected in the relatively densely vegetated areas along washes and drainages * * *\".although south of the Magdalena Plain and Vizcaino Desert they reported California gnatcatchers as \" * * widely distributed within suitable habitat, not being restricted to the vegetation found In drainages.\" The low number of California gnatcatchers found north of 300 north latitude is attributed by RECON to habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation. RECON also reported that the habitat connection between the United States and Mexico populations of the California gnatcatcher is \"tenuous.\" The accuracy of the variable-strip transect method is dependent on the degree to which a variety of assumptions are satisfied (Franzreb 1981). These assumptions include: (1) Birds are uniformly and randomly distributed; (2) birds do not move in response to the observer's presence prior to being detected; and (3) there are no measurement errors. The competence of the obsgrver is also a major factor influencing the accuracy of transect censusing methods (Franzreb 1981). In the RECON study, assumption I was violated by the finding that: (1) Gnatcatcher presence \" * * is strongly correlated with large shrub cover, tree cover, and shrub height\" and (2) south of 300 north latitude, California gnatcatchers occurred in open desert habitats but \" * * were more often detected in the relatively densely vegetated areas along washes and drainages * * \". Extrapolation of gnatcatcher density values based on these findings to all potential gnatcatcher habitat on the peninsula would result in highly inflated population estimates. Other field biologists who have surveyed sites repeatedly for California gnatcatchers, using taped vocalizations to increase their detectability, have found their distribution within coastal sage scrub habitats in northwestern Baja California, Mexico. to be patchy (D. Grout, Fish and Wildlife Service, pars. comm.). Similar results have been reported for the gnatcatcher in the United States (Atwood 1980, 1990). The use of tapes to increase gnatcatcher detectability significantly increases the probability that assumption 2 was violated. California gnatcatchers have been observed moving long distances toward an observer in response to taped vocalizations or \"pishing\" calls. Thus, taped vocalizations, or \"pishing\" calls may briefly result in increased local densities of California gnatcatchers. Extrapolating these densities to broaderareas would result in excessively high population estimates. With respect to assumption 3, the draft report by RECON acknowledges that measurement errors were made. Moreover, only one of six biologists affiliated with the RECON study had any previous experience with the variable-strip transect method and only one brief \"training\" session (in the Anza Borrego desert) was held prior to initiation of the study U. Newman, pers. comm., 1992). The effects of this potential source of bias on the density and population estimates are unknown. Contrary to the recommendation of Emlen (1971), no replicate censuses and no comparative surveys using other census techniques were done in the RECON study to calibrate the accuracy of the results because of funding constraints. This factor also influenced the decision to use taped vocalizations of gnatcatchers to increase their detectability and the decision against censusing gnatcatchers south of 250 north latitude (P. Fromer and J. Newman, RECON, pars. comm.). The extremely small scale (1:1,000,000) vegetation map used by RECON to derive estimates of available gnatcatcher habitat, coupled with the faulty assumption that California gnatcatchers are uniformly distributed within a given vegetation type and the acknowledgement by RECON (1991a) that \"The inability to clearly identify the extent of coastal sage scrub versus chaparral, and therefore, California gnatcatcher habitat, is problematic,\" further reduces the reliability of the results of the RECON study. The population estimates presented in the draft report by RECON are based on a coefficient of detectability (CD) value of 0.25, even though the CD values for the three arbitrarily defined regions of study (north, central, and south) varied by an order of magnitude (0.06, 0.15, and 0.56, respectively) U. Newman, pers. comm., 1992). Artificially low CD values would result in inflated density and population estimates. CD values are not necessary in order to calculate avian density (Franzreb 1981). Based on observed densities, RECON estimates that about 2,800 pairs of P. c. californica occur in Baja California, Mexico (J. Newman, pers. comm., 1992). RECON has emphasized in discussions with the Service that the population estimates presented in the draft report were meant to be interpreted in a relative manner, e.g., 99 percent of all California gnatcatchers in Baja California, Mexico, are south of 300 north latitude, and not as exact numbers (P. Fromer and J. Newman, pars. comm.). This interpretation is consistentwith that of Verner (1985). who concluded that bird census techniques such as the variable-strip transect method, can provide useful information on the relative abundance of bird species but that density estimates based on such methods are not as reliable as those derived from other techniques. In summary, no scientific basis exists for Cioncluding that 1.5 million pairs of California gnatcatchers occur in Baja California, Mexico. Furthermore, the Service's conclusion that a listing action is warranted is supported, in part, by the findings of RECON that: (1) 99 percent of California gnatcatchers in Mexico occur south of 300 north latitude; (2) the low number of Polioptila californica californica in Mexico is attributable to habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation; and (3) the habitat connection between United States and Mexico gnatcatcher populations is tenuous. The government of Mexico also formally supports a listing action (Garcia 1992). Issue 8: The results of Audubon Christmas Bird Counts in southern California indicate that the California gnatcatcher population is increasing. One commenter submitted a summary of Audubon Christmas Bird Count results from 1960 through 1989 for 20 localities in southern California. The data were presented in a tabular format as 10-year averages of annual count totals (with standard deviations and ranges) for the California gnatcatcher. These results are based on 9,814 observer-hours expended in the 1960- 69 period, 17,575 observer-hours expended in the 1970-79 period, and 21,723 observer-hours expended In the 1980-89 period. The commenter concluded, based, in part, on this analysis, that the California gnatcatcher population in the United States is increasing and should not be listed under the Endangered Species Act. Service Response: Although the Audubon Christmas Bird Count is considered to be the \"single, most popular, voluntary, early winter bird continental inventory in the world\" (Drennan 1981), its methods are\"weakly standardized\" (Bock and Root 1981) and of limited use in analyzing changes in bird population sizes. The results are subject to much bias associated with variation in observer experience, sampling effort, weather, and an emphasis on particular species. Christmas bird counts must be\"normalized\" to be meaningful indicators of winter bird population sizes (Bock and Root 1981 and papers cited therein). The analysis submitted as public comment that discusses gnatcatcher16747 16748 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations population changes within Christmas Bird Count areas did not involve normalized data or include inferential statistics that provide the degree of confidence in the accuracy of the measurements. For these reasons, the Service finds that the analysis of Christmas Bird Count results does not support the conclusion that the California gnatcatcher population increased between 1960 and 1989. The greater sampling effort in the 1980-89 period (2.2 times the effort expended in the 1960-69 period) coupled with a relatively greater emphasis on gnatcatcher status during this time especially in the latter half of the 1980's; which probably resulted in more effort being directed at locating gnatcatchers) probably accounts for the perceived population increases noted at 6 of the 20 sites examined. Issue 9: The estimate of an 81 percent loss of coastal sage scrub for Riverside Cunty between 1930 and 1990 is incorrect. One commenter submitted (without supporting documentation) that 304,000 acres of coastal sage scrub were present in Riverside County in 1930, rather than the 410,000 acres reported by the Service in the proposed rule. This commenter also pointed out that 74,000 acres of mixed European annual grassland/coastal sage scrub identified by Minnich (1990) was not taken into consideration in calculating the loss estimate stated above. The commenter concluded that using the correct figures, only a 50 percent loss has occurred since 1930. Other commenters questioned the estimate of coastal sage scrub loss for San Diego County. One commenter considered the 70 percent loss estimate for coastal sage scrub in San Diego County to be excessive and recommended that it be reexamined. Service Response: Mr. Paul Fromer of RECON provided the Service with unpublished data on coastal sage scrub status in Riverside County for the years 1930 and 1990. The 1930 figure was based on a geographic information system analysis of digitized data from a variety of sources (RECON 1990c). The 1990 estimate of the extent of coastal sage scrub in Riverside County was based on a comp'osite vegetation map of Riverside County prepared by RECON (1990a) from a large number of sources in conjunction with the Riverside County Multispecies Habitat Conservation Plan. The most recent information on the extent of coastal sage scrub in Riverside County was reported by RECON (1991b) based on Minnich (1990) after the proposed rule was published. RECON (1991b) reported that 74,988 acres ofcoastal sage scrub and 77,669 acres of mixed European annual grassland/ coastal sage scrub existed in Riverside County as of 1990. Although gnatcatchers occupy some annual grassland/coastal sage scrub areas, it is incorrect to assume that the entire grassland component should be considered coastal sage scrub. For example, at two sites encompassing about 1,200 and 2,000 acres, respectively, that were mapped by Minnich (1990) as mixed European annual grassland/coastal sage scrub, only 12 and 34 percent, respectively, of the plant cover at these sites consisted of coastal sage scrub as determined by planimetry of 1:21,000 scale color aerial photographs. A more refined vegetation map is needed to quantify the full extent of coastal sage scrub in this cover type. Assuming that as much as 50 percent of the area associated with mixed European annual grassland/coastal sage scrub is considered to be coastal sage scrub, then about 114,000 acres existed in Riverside County as of 1990. Assuming that 304,000 to 410,000 acres of coastal sage scrub existed in 1930, then a 63 to 71 percent loss had occurred by 1990. Wieslander and Jensen (1946) reported that 279,000 acres of \"coastal sagebrush\" existed in Riverside County in 1945. Assuming that 114,000 acres existed in 1990, this represents a loss of 59 percent since 1945. The Service considers this magnitude of loss over the last 45 to 60 years to be significant and consistent with its finding that habitat loss is a significant threat to the continued existence of the coastal California gnatcatcher. It should also be noted that Wieslander and Jensen (1946) defined coastal sagebrush as\" * * * such shrubs as California sagebrush, coyote brush, and wild buckwheats covering over 50 percent of the ground.\" The degree to which their estimate of coastal sagebrush acreage for Riverside County would increase, based on inclusion of mixed European annual grassland/ coastal sage scrub, is unknown, but may have increased it substantially. The Service estimate of coastal sage scrub loss for San Diego County is based on an analysis by Oberbauer (1979). A more recent loss estimate of 72 percent was reported by Oberbauer and Vanderwier (1991) after the proposed rule was published. Considering that an estimated 64 percent of the coastal sage scrub present in San Diego County in 1930 had been lost by 1991 (MBA 1991), and that\" * * * by 1930 many areas of the coastal lowlands had already been converted to farmland and pastureland * * * \"(MBA 1991), the Service believes the 70 percent loss estimate forcoastal sage scrub in San Diego County, relative to the pristine condition, to be reasonably accurate based on available information. There were 381,000 acres of \"coastal sagebrush\" in San Diego County in 1945 (Wieslander and Jensen 1946). Approximately 135,000 to 152,000 acres of coastal sage scrub currently exist in San Diego County (Oberbauer and Vandewier 1991, San Diego Association of Governments 1992). This represents a 60 to 65 percent loss of coastal sage scrub in San Diego County since 1945 alone. The Service considers this magnitude of loss to be significant and consistent with its finding that habitat loss is a significant threat to the continued existence of the coastal California gnatcatcher. Issue 10: The Service's finding that the California gnatcatcher once had an extensive range in Los Angeles County is speculative. Service Response: Relatively little information is available to reconstruct the distribution of the California gnatcatcher in Los Angeles Cotnty prior to the urbanization of this area. However, Atwood (1990) reported historic locality records for this species \"* * * from the San Fernando Valley east along the base of the San Gabriel Mountains to Clairemont, and at the lower elevations of the San Jose, Los Coyotes, and Palos Verdes Hills.\" The extremely isolated nature of the Palos Verdes Hills population and the low dispersal capability of gnatcatchers (to date, the maximum known dispersal distance is about 9 miles) strongly suggest that this population was historically contiguous with, or in close proximity to, other gnatcatcher populations in southern Los Angeles County. In addition, Atwood (1990) reported that \"over 96 percent of the total low elevation (less than 250 m) acreage in Los Angeles County that might historically have supported P. c. californica has been largely or entirely developed.\" Therefore, the Service concludes that the coastal California gnatcatcher once had an extensive range in Los Angeles County. Issue 11: The Service should explain how the estimate of 54,000 acres of coastal sage scrub currently occupied by the coastal California gnatcatcher within its range in the United States was derived. Service Response: This estimate was calculated by multiplying a gnatcatcher population size of 2,262 pairs (Atwood 1990) by a mean home range size of 23.8 acres/pair (Mock and Jones 1990). The actual estimate of 53,835 acres was rounded off to 54,000 acres. Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Based on new information on gnatcatcher population size that was not available at the time the proposed rule was published (e.g., Coalition for Habitat Conservation 1992) the Service estimates that about 2,562 pairs of California gnatcatchers remain in the United States. Assuming these pairs occupy, on average, home ranges of 34.6 acres (the largest mean home range reported to date) then as much as 89,000 acres of coastal sage scrub may be occupied by the coastal California gnatcatcher within the United States. The intent in calculating this estimate is to demonstrate that although the coastal California gnatcatcher is endemic to coastal sage scrub, it does not occur throughout this floristically and structurally variable community. Additional supporting documentation for this finding is provided by Ogden Environmental and Energy Services (1992), which has prepared a preliminary estimate of the California gnatcatcher population within the city of San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP) study area. Based on Ogden's analysis, about 21,500 acres (18 percent) of coastal sage scrub occurring within the MSCP study area is known to be occupied by the California gnatcatcher. Recent surveys have also confirmed the non-uniform distribution of this species. Only three California gnatcatcher (one pair and one individual) were found in a 2,400-acre patch of coastal sage scrub in the Marron Valley area of San Diego County based on multiple visits to this site during 1992 (P. Mock, Ogden Environmental and Energy Services, Pers. Comm.). No gnatcatchers were detected during multiple visits in 1992 to a 1,000-acre patch of coastal sage scrub near Dehesa, north of the Sweetwater River in San Diego County (P. Mock, pers. comm.). Issue 12: The Service should not list the gnatcatcher because the results of recent censuses show a significant increase in the population of California gnatcatchers within Orange and San Diego Counties relative to estimates by Atwood (1990). Service Response: The Service has made a concerted effort to obtain the best available scientific information on which to base a listing decision. especially with respect to data on gnatcatcher distnbution and abundance. Based on recent census information, the Service has revised the estimate for the United States gnatcatchr population from 2.262 pairs in the proposed rule to 2.562 pairs in the final rule. About 2,800 pairs of coastal California gnatcetchers are estimated to occur in Baia California.Mexico U. Newman, RECON, pers. comm., 1992). Although it is reasonable to assume that gnatcatcher populations may have been depressed during the recent drought conditions and are now increasing in response to normal or above normal rainfall that may have improved habitat conditions, there is no scientific basis for concluding that the population, as a whole, is increasing ased on a comparison between the results of recent censuses and the estimate by Atwood (1990). The population estimate by Atwood (1990) is an extrapolation based on gnatcatcher densities at two locations and the amount of undeveloped land below 500 m (1,640 ft), which was calculated from base maps prepared in 1983 (Atwood 1990). The recent censuses represent actual counts, although the results were not obtained using the same census methods. Scientifically credible data on which to base an analysis of population trends must be collected in a standardized manner over the entire range of the population under consideration and, ideally, over a long period of time. To date, a rangewide census of the California gnatcatcher using a standardized methodology has not occurred. Recent censuses of the California gnatcatcher in portions of Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties have used different methods especially with respect to sampling effort. An adequate population baseline established using a standardized census methodology is lacking for the coastal California gnatcatcher's range. The Service does not concur that a significant increase has occurred In the population of California gnatcatchers within Orange and San Diego Counties. It should also be recognized that the Service's decision to propose the gnatcatcher for listing was based on significant threats associated with habitat loss and fragmentation rather than low population size. This issue is discussed in the \"Summary of Factors Affecting the Species\" section of this rule. Issue 13: A number of commenters questioned the accuracy of the Service estimate that 250,000 to 375,000 acres of coastal sage scrub remain in California. One commenter submitted that about 576,000 acres of coastal sage scrub occur in southern California. Service Response: The estimate cited above is based on two sources of Information. Barbour and Major (1977) estimate that about 2.5 million acres of coastal sage scrub occurred historically in California. Westman (1981e.b) estimates that 85 to 90 percent has beenlost as a result of urban and agricultural development. The estimate of 250,000 to 375,000 acres represents 10 to 15 percent of 2.5 million acres. Based on new information, the Service estimates that about 48,000 acres of coastal sage scrub exist in Orange County (Roberts 1990), 75,000 to 114,000 acres in Riverside County (see discussion under Issue 9 above), and 135,000 to 152,000 acres in San Diego County (Oberbauer and Vanderwier 1991, San Diego Association of Governments 1992). The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy (1992) estimates that 85,000 to 130,000 acres of coastal sage scrub occur in northwestern Los Angeles County. The California Department of Fish and Game (1992) estimates that 393,655 acres of coastal sage scrub occur within the Natural Community Conservation Planning Program study area, which encompasses the same geographic area discussed above as well as southwestern San Bernardino County. The Service is not aware of any other recent estimates for the extent of coastal sage scrub elsewhere within the historic range of this plant community in California as defined by Barbour and Major (1977). Assuming the estimate for northwestern Los Angeles County cited above is accurate, then about 343,000 to 444,000 acres of coastal sage scrub remain in California within an area encompassing the majority of the historic range of this plant community. This revised estimate represents 14 to 18 percent of the estimated original extent of coastal sage scrub in California as reported by Barbour and Major (1977). Issue 14: Coastal sage scrub is plentiful in Baja California, Mexico. One commenter estimated that 1.3 million acres (520,000 ha) of coastal sage scrub and coastal succulent scrub exist in Baja California. based on satellite imagery analysis. The Service should take this factor into consideration in the listing decision-making process. Service Response: The Service did consider the availability of coastal sage scrub and the status of the coastal California gnatcatcher in Baja California, Mexico, in determining to list the gnatcatcher. Substantially more potential habitat for the coastal California gnatcatcher may remain in Baja California than in the United States. Using 1:20,000 and 1:40.000 scale aerial photographs. Minnich (unpublished manuscript 1993) estimates that about 1.4 million acres of coastal sage scrub and 765,250 acres of maritime desert scrub remain between the international border and 30 north latitude.16749 16750 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Notwithstanding the limitations of mapping vegetation accurately from satellite imagery (Lillesand and Keifer 1987, Franklin and Stow 1991), neither of the acreage estimates cited above consider gnatcatcher habitat. Furthermore, it is incorrect to assume that all coastal sage scrub or maritime desert scrub is coastal California gnatcatcher habitat. The gnatcatcher is not uniformly distributed within this structurally and floristically diverse community. Recent intensive surveys for California gnatcatchers in northwestern Baja California failed to detect any gnatcatchers at various localities containing potential habitat. Repeated visits and entire days were spent at some localities without detecting any gnatcatchers (D. Grout, Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm.). In addition, the acreage estimates cited above do not quantify the degree to which the areas mapped as coastal sage scrub are threatened by urban and agricultural development or the degree to which they have been degraded by grazing and fire. Widespread habitat degradation has occurred in Baja California (RECON 1991a, J. Newman, pers comm.). The habitat connection at the international border consists of very degraded coastal sage scrub that is being encroached upon by urban development. In the United States, the State of California has partially funded an approved off-road vehicle park development at the border that would directly affect about 21 pairs of gnatcatchers and 500 acres of coastal sage scrub. Lease negotiations between the landowner and the California Department of Parks and Recreation have recently been suspended for this park because of potential conflicts with the Natural Community Conservation Planning Act of 1991 and with the conservation of the gnatcatcher. , Sufficient threats to the continued existence of the coastal California gnatcatcher exist in Mexico to warrant the listing of this subspecies throughout its range in Baja California. The government of Mexico has formally endorsed this conclusion and supports this listing action (Garcia 1992). Issue 15: Periodic fires in gnatcatcher habitat will benefit the species. One commenter questioned the conclusion by the Service in the proposed rule that high fire frequencies and the lag period associated with recovery of the vegetation may significantly reduce the viability of affected gnatcatcher populations and may contribute to the loss, degradation, and fragmentation of coastal sage scrub. The commenter cited several instances where gnatcatcher populations increased following fires,although no data were submitted which would allow independent corroboration of this conclusion. Service Response: Fire is a natural component of some shrubland ecosystems, although the fire ecology of coastal sage scrub is not well understood. The timing, frequency, intensity, and magnitude of fire events, as well as suirounding land uses and weather patterns, influence the effects of fire on the gnatcatcher. In some cases, the outcome may benefit the gnatcatcher by ultimately causing more suitable habitat to develop and, in others, it may cause local extirpations and/or habitat degradation that reduces the number of gnatcatchers that can be supported on the affected site. Increased fire frequency is probably detrimental to coastal sage scrub and California gnatcatcher populations. For example, increased fire frequencies at Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base in San Diego County are contributing to the type conversion of shrubland vegetation types, including coastal sage scrub, to grasslands (D. Lawson, U.S. Marine Corps, pers. comm.). Fire frequencies increase in wildland areas bordered by urban and agricultural development (Radtke 1983). Issue 16: The Servtce misrepresented the magnitude of threat to the gnatcatcher from urban development. Several commenters questioned the validity of the Service's analysis of the threat to the gnatcatcher posed by urban development and submitted that it was overstated. Service Response: The Service's assessment of this issue is based on: (1) A review of environmental impact reports for proposed and approved developments within the gnatcatcher's current range in the United States; (2) the results of aerial reconnaissance within Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties: (3) the finding that 91 to 94 percent of gnatcatcher locality records for Orange and San Diego Counties occur below 250 m (820 ft) in elevation and 99 percent occur below 300 m (984 ft) in elevation (MBA 1991, Atwood 1992a); and (4) other available information such as an estimated 58 to 61 percent loss of coastal sage scrub in Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties since 1945 (see discussion under Issue 5 above) and an estimated 66 to 90 percent reduction in the original extent of coastal sage scrub in California, both reductions due primarily to urbanization (Westman 1981a,b; MBA 1991). A more detailed analysis of the loss of coastal sage scrub habitat due to urbanization is presented under Factor A in the section entitled, \"Summary of Factors Affecting theSpecies,\" and in the discussion of the NCCP program under Factor D. Issue 17: The Service violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act when it requested comments from the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) regarding the subspecies taxonomy of the California gnatcatcher. Service Response: The Service has made a concerted effort to obtain the best available scientific information regarding the coastal California gnatcatcher. Based on numerous comments regarding gnatcatcher taxonomy, the Service solicited the AOU Committee on Classification and Nomenclature, a recognized authority on the taxonomy of North American birds, for its position on this issue. The Service solicited comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, and any other interested party on all aspects of the proposed rule. The Service's request for comments from the AOU is consistent with its legal obligations under the Endangered Species Act to obtain the best available scientific information, and does not constitute a violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Issue 18: Insufficient public notice was given by the Service regarding this proposed action. Service Response: The Service's efforts to notify the public about the proposal to list the coastal California gnatcatcher were extensive, and are described at the beginning of this section entitled, \"Summary of Comments and Recommendations.\" In addition, this issue has received considerable media attention. Between September of 1991 and October of 1992, over 60 articles concerning the California gnatcatcher appeared in newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, Oceanside Blade-Citizen, Orange County Register, Riverside Press- Enterprise, San Diego Business Journal, Son Diego Union-Tribune, Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post. This issue and a petition to state-list the California gnatcatcher as endangered received considerable media attention during the spring and summer of 1991, as well. Over 50 articles about the gnatcatcher appeared in the Los Angeles Times, Orange County Register, Riverside Press-Enterprise, and the San Diego Union-Tribune. On the basis of the information presented above, the Service concludes that the public was adequately notified with respect to the proposed action. Issue 19: The Service should consider economic effects in determining whether to list the coastal California Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations gnatcatcher under the Endangered Species Act (Act). Service Response: In accordance with 16 U.S.C., paragraph 1533(b)(1)(A), 50 CFR 424.11(b), and section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act, listing decisions are made solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available. In adding the word \"solely\" to the statutory criteria for listing a species, Congress specifically addressed this issue in 1982 amendments to the Act. The legislative history of the 1982 amendments states: \"The addition of the word \"solely\" is intended to remove from the process of the listing or delisting of species any factor not related to the biological status of the species. The Committee strongly believes that economic considerations have no relevance to determinations regarding the status of species and iitends that the economic analysis requirements of Executive Order 12291, and such statutes as the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act, not apply * * -*. Applying economic criteria to the analysis of these alternatives and to any phase of the species listing process is applying economics to the determinations made under section 4 of the Act and is specifically rejected by the inclusion of the Word \"solely\" in this legislation.\" H.R. Rep. No. 567, part I, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 20 (1982). Issue 20: The Service should prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for this proposed action. Service Response: For the reasons cited in the NEPA section of this rule, the Service has determined that rules issued pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act do not require the preparation of an EIS. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species After a thorough review and consideration of all available information, the Service has determined that the coastal California gnatcatcher should be classified as a threatened species. Procedures found at section 4 of th Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determined to be. endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica colifornica) are as follows: A, The present or threatened destruction, modification, orcurtailment of its habitat or range. The habitat and range of the coastal California gnatcatcher have been significantly reduced. This coastal sage scrub endemic species historically occurred in six counties in southern California. It has been extirpated from two counties (Vgntura and San Bernardino) and is on the brink of extirpation from a third (Los Angeles). Atwood (1990, 1992b) reported that California gnatcatchers have been extirpated from at least 42 sites that were occupied prior to 1960. He also reported that of 56 sites that supported coastal sage scrub and California gnatcatchers in 1980, 18 (32 percent) had been destroyed and 15 (27 percent) were partially impacted by development in 1990. About 99 percent of the population in the United States presently occurs within Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties. MBA (1991) and Westman (1981 a,b) have reported an estimated 66 and 85 to 90 percent reduction, respectively, in the original extent of coastal sage scrub in California. In 1945, 95,000 acres of\"coastal sagebrush\" remained in Orange County, 279,000 acres were in Riverside County, and 381,000 acres existed in San Diego County (Wieslander and Jensen 1946). As of 1990, about 48,000 acres of \"coastal sagebrush\" remained in Orange County (Roberts 1990), 114,000 acres in Riverside County (based on Minnich 1990 and RECON 1990a), and 135,000 to 152,000 acres in San Diego County (Oberbauer and Vanderwier 1991, San Diego Association of Governments 1992). These data represent coastal sage scrub losses of 50, 59, and 60 to 65 percent for Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties, respectively, since 1945. Overall, 58 to 61 percent of the coastal sage scrub within these three counties in 1945 had been lost by 1990. All of the published literature on the status of coastal sage scrub vegetation in California supports the conclusion that this plant community is one of the most depleted habitat types in the United States (Kirkpatrick and Hutchinson 1977; Axelrod 1990). The coastal California gnatcatcher is not uniformly distributed within the structurally and floristically variable coastal sage scrub community (Kirkpatrickand Hutchinson 1977, Westman 1981b, Desimone and Burk 1992) which extends up to 600 m (1969 ft) in elevation (O'Leary 1990). It tends to occur most frequently within Artemisia californica-dominated stands of coastal sage scrub on mesas and lower slopes of the coast ranges thathave been extensively converted to urban and agricultural habitats throughout Los Angeles, Orange, western Riverside, and western San Diego Counties. Atwood (1992a) reported that 94 percent of all gnatcatcher locality records (n=306) for Orange and San Diego Counties occur below 250 m (820 ft) in elevation. Based on a much larger sample size (n=781) for the same geographic area, MBA (1991) reported.that 91 percent of all gnatcatcher records occur at or below 250 m and 99 percent occur at or below 300 m (984 ft) in elevation. Of about 19,000 acres of coastal sage scrub found below 300 m in elevation in Orange County, 36 percent (6,800 acres) is preserved, 21 percent (4,000 acres) is approved or proposed for development, and 43 percent (8,300 acres) is of uncertain status (Roberts 1992). Since 1989, over 3,600 acres of coastal sage scrub, located mostly below 300 m in elevation in Orange County, have been destroyed by urban and agricultural development. Between 1980 and 1990, the human population in San Diego County increased by more than 600,000. Most of this increase occurred on or near the coast at sites historically occupied, in part, by coastal sage scrub vegetation. In southwestern San Diego County, 8,461 acres of coastal sage scrub were lost between 1984 and 1991 (Keeler-Wolf 1991); overall, one-third of the coastal sage scrub present in 1984 within the study area was destroyed by urban development over the 7-year period. Almost 9,000 acres of coastal sage scrub (mostly below 300 m in elevation) in San Diego County have been permanently destroyed by development (about 2,400 acres) or temporarily destroyed and degraded by fire (over 6,500 acres) since September of 1990. Approved and proposed projects could destroy an additional 8,000 acres of coastalsage scrub within areas occupied by gnatcatchers primarily below 300 m in elevation. Several of these projects are located within core populations of the California gnatcatcher. In Riverside County, over 3,900 acres of coastal sage scrub have been destroyed by urban development and fire since 1989. Of 13 multiple species reserves proposed for acquisition within Riverside County, five contain the majority of California gnatcatchers known to occur in Riverside County. Four of these five 'proposed reserves are considered to be subject to an imminent development threat and are given a top priority foracquisition (Dangermond and Associates and RECON 1991). Moreover, the human population in all16751 16752 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations areas supporting the gnatcatcher are rapidly expanding. The western one- third of Riverside County currently contains 800,000 people. By 2010. this area will support 1.4 million. Housing and employment will increase proportionally, with 275,000 additional housing units projected to be constructed in western Riverside Cotnty by 2010 (Monroe et a]. 1992). RECON (1991a) reported that relatively few coastal California gnatcatchers occur in northern Baia, California, Mexico, and attributed its status there to habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation. The habitat connection between the United States and Mexican gnatcatcher populations is \"tenuous\" (RECON 1991a). Stands of coastal sage scrub vegetation in northern Baia. California are being grazed, burned to increase grass production, converted to agriculture, and graded for urban development (Bowler 1990. Rea and Weaver 1990). Extensive tracts of coastal sage scrub vegetation on the marine terraces between Colonet and San Quintin have boon converted to tomato fields (R. Minnich, Univ. of California, Riverside, Dept. of Earth Sciences, pers. comm.). The San Quintin kangaroo rat (Dipodomys gravipes), a coastal lowland-associated species endemic to Baja California from San Telmo to El Rosario, is nearly extinct as a result of this change in land use (Best 1983). Apparently (as of 1992). this species is now extinct (E. Mellinck, Centro do Investigacion Cientifica y Educacion Superior de comm.). The loss of coastal sage scrub vegetation has been associated with an increasing degree of habitat fragmentation, which reduces habitat quality and promotes increased levels of nest predation and brood parasitism, and ultimately, increased rates of local extinction (Wilcove 1985, Rolstad 1991. Saunders et al. 1991. Soule et al. 1988, 1992). Although the published literature on this subject is based on studies in forested landscapes, the ecological implications of these studies are applicable to other landscape types such- as coastal sage scrub. The Service is currently participating in a study of gnatcatcher ecology in western Riverside County that was initiated in the spring of 1992. This study involves intensive monitoring of three color-banded gnatcatcher subpopulations occupying three different landscape settings: (1) a relatively small, fragmented coastal sage scrub patch adjacent to urban and agricultural development: (2) a rvlatively large coastal sage scrub patch grazed tby cattle; and (3) a relativelylarge coastal sage scrub patch contiguous with other native plant communities in an area distant from urban and agricultural development. Preliminary results of nest monitoring activities in 1992 indicate that gnatcatchers occupying the small, fragmented patch experienced high levels of nest parasitism by cowbirds (7 of 15 nests or 47 percent) and only 1 of 15 nests (7 percent) fledged a total of 2 young. Gnatcatcher nests on the grazed patch were also heavily parasitized (15 of 25 nests or 60 percent), and only 2 of 25 nests (8 percent) fledged a total of 4 young. The gnatcatchers occupying the coastal sage scrub patch in a\"natural\" setting had only one case of cowbird parasitism (1 of 26 nests or 4 percent) and good reproductive success (11 of 26 nests or 42 percent fledged a total of 40 young) (Braden 1992). These findings strongly suggest that the adverse edge effects noted in fragmented forest habitats occur in shrubland communities as well. Although the historic distribution of coastal sage scrub was undoubtedly patchy to some dtgroo, this condition has been greatly exacerbated by urban and agricultural development. Based on maps presented by MBA (1991), the Service has calculated the magnitude of change in the degree of fragmentation of coastal sage scrub between 1931 and 1990 for Orange. Riverside, and San Diego Counties. In 1931, there were 27 distinct coastal sage scrub patches in Orange County, By 1990, there were 145 patches. Similar increases in fragmentation have also occurred in Riverside County, from 87 to 374 patches; and San Diego County. from 72 to 217 patches. Using different scale maps, Keeler-Wolf (1991) analyzed recent changes in the extent of coastal sage scrub in southwestern San Diego County. The number of coastal sage scrub patches within his study area increased from 286 in 1984 to 510 in 1991. The mean size of these patches decreased from 99 acres in 1984 to 53 acres in 1991. This pattern of increasing habitat fragmentation has isolated many populations of the coastal California gnatcatcher from each other, including those on the Palos Verdes Peninsula (Los Angeles County), in the San Joaquin Hills (Orange County), in four general areas of western San Diego County (Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Sweetwater River-Otay Mesa), and County (Lake Mathews-Gavilan Plateau; Domenigoni Valley-Vail Lake; theBadlands). The severing of diminishes the viability of the subspecies overall. Brussard and Murphy (1992). representing the Coastal Sage Scrub Scientific Review Panel (Panel) for the State of California's Natural Community Conservation Planning Program, cite the conclusion of Wilcox and Murphy (1985) in recognizing that \"habitat fragmentation is the most serious threat to biological diversity and is the primary cause of the present extinction crisis.\" O'Leary et a. (1992), also representing the Panel, characterized the status of the coastal sage scrub community as depleted, degraded, and fragmented. They concluded that, \"Clearly, coastal sage scrub vegetation and the animal species it supports are now seriously imperiled in southern California.\" B. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. Not known to be applicable. C. Disease or predation. Disease is not known to be a factor affecting this species at this time. However, several species have been reported as potential predators of coastal California gnatcatcher eggs or nestlings (Atwood 1990). Those include the scrub jay (Aphelocoma spp.), deer mouse (Peromyscus mouse (Mus musculus), and black rat (Rattus rattus). Soule et al. (1988, 1992) speculated that as coyotes (Canis latrans) disappear from small, isolated patches of chaparral (including coastal sage scrub) in urbanized areas, the absence of this large predator allows greater population levels of smaller \"bird predators\" such as foxes. opossums, or domestic cats. These authors suggested that increased predation pressures resulting from the absence of coyotes maysignificantly contribute to local extinctions of bird species, like the coastal California gnatcatcher, from small, fragmented patches of vegetation. D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. No regulatory mechanisms are currently In effect that adequately protect the coastal California gnatcatcher and its habitat. The coastal Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations California gnatcatcher is not listed under the California Endangered Species Act and most populations occur on private lands. Local and county zoning designations are subject to change and do not incorporate the principles of conservation biology in the establishment and configuration of open space areas. What few resource protection ordinances exist are subject to different interpretations, and in cases where findings of overriding social and economic considerations are made, compliance is not required. In many cases, land-use planning decisions are made on the basis of environmental review documents, prepaied in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act or the National Environmental Policy Act, that do not adequately address potential impacts to the coastal California gnatcatchmr and its habitat, if considered at all. In some cases, even dedicated open space does not confer sufficient protection. For example, the County of Orange recently proposed a zoning change to allow construction of a business park on a 70-acre parcel containing about 40 acres of gnatcatcher-occupied habitat that was dedicated as open space in conjunction with an approved housing development. In another case in Orange County, a landowner has agreed to place about 2,300 acres of coastal sage scrub occupied, in part, by coastal California gnatcatchers into conserved open space. However, the landowner has indicated that this designation could not be guaranteed for longer than 20 years (F. Roberts, pers. comm.). In addition, this open space designation is contingent upon construction of major housing and commercial developments that will adversely affect the gnatcatcher. This designation will also not preclude the construction of transportation or utility facilities that will remove as much as 85 acres of coastal sage scrub within designated open space and fragment what remains (F. Roberts, pers. comm.). Another indication of the lack of existing regulatory mechanisms to protect the gnatcatcher and its habitat is provided by a recent study in San Diego County. The city of San Diego (1990) evaluated the magnitude of impact associated with development to native plant communities within its jurisdiction for the period 1985 to 1990. This study revealed a 97 percent loss of coastal sage scrub (384 of 395 acres) in conjunction with 15 projects. This study also evaluated eight cases where no distinction was made between chaparral and coastal sage scrub vegetation. A 95 percent loss of chaparral/coastal sagescrub (1,308 of 1,371 acres) was documented for these projects. Keeler- Wolf (1991) reported a net loss of 8,461 acres of coastal sage scrub within the city of San Diego between 1984 and 1991. Since August 1991, over 4,600 acres of coastal sage scrub have been destroyed within the gnatcatcher's range in Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties. No mitigation to offset impacts to the gnatcatcher was associated with 33 of 39 projects known to affect this species. Approved (but not yet constructed) and proposed developments within these three counties could destroy over 10,000 acres of coastal sage scrub. Several of these projects will directly affect and further agment regionally significant core populations orthe coastal California gnatcatcher and may sever the tenuous habitat connection between the United States and Mexico. Another indication of the ineffectiveness of existing regulatory mechanisms to protect the coastal California gnatcatcher is provided by 11 cases involving the destruction of about 1,050 acres of coastal sage scrub vegetation occupied, in part, by gnatcatchers in Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties. These actions occurred prior to regulatory agency review or issuance of grading permits. In two of these cases, gnatcatcher habitat was destroyed shortly after the Service contacted or submitted a letter to a local regulatory agency advising the agency that a draft environmental review document for a proposed housing development failed to disclose the presence of gnatcatchers onsite. Overall, about 1,900 acres of land was cleared in conjunction with agricultural, weed abatement, and fire protection activities or to preclude nesting activities by migratory birds. Although existing grading ordinances regulate some or all of these activities, they have not proven to be effective deterrents to destruction of gnatcatcher habitat. In a related matter, about 450 acres of high quality coastal sage scrub vegetation occupied by the coastal California gnatcatcher were destroyed in February 1991 near Lake Elsinore in Riverside County (L. Hays, Fish and Wildlife Service, and S. Myers, Tierra Madre Consultants, pers. comm.). This activity was authorized under a grading permit issued by the city of Lake Elsinore in conjunction with an approved reclamation plan for a previously mined site bordering the stand of coastal sage scrub. The entire area lies within an approved but not yet constructed golf course-residential community. Some jurisdictions (e.g., thecities of Chula Vista and Poway in San Diego County) do not regulate grubbing of vegetation. Individuals or entities who grade property for agricultural purposes within the counties of Orange and Riverside are not required to obtain a grading permit or any other approval in order to grade. In adopting an ordinance imposing interim regulations for grading and clearing, the County of San Diego Board of Supervisors (1988) noted several characteristics associated with these types of activities that appear to apply throughout the range of the coastal California gnatcatcher in the United States: * * * Clearing and illegal grading have been used to destroy environmental resources prior to application for a land development permit, during the permit process, after project approval but prior to the application of protecting open space easements, and after dedication of open space * * * Grading violations, when reported, result in relatively minimal fines and, because of the difficulty in obtaining convictions, are not a serious deterrent to illegal grading. A fine often will not prevent a violation of this ordinance because a fine may be considered simply-as an additional development cost * * * Clearing for legitimate reasons (geotechnical exploration and access for percolation tests and wells, and clearing for fire protection) is frequently done well in excess of the minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose. In some recent cases, habitat restoration requirements have been imposed as a penalty for violation of grading ordinances. However, that may not resolve the problem in a biologically-meaningful way. The feasibility of artificially creating a viable coastal sage scrub plant community suitable for the coastal California gnatcatcher has yet to be demonstrated, especially on a large scale. Although the results of a recent effort by the California Department of Parks and Recreation to restore a small area of coastal sage scrub in Crystal Cove State Park (Orange County) are encouraging, they are not conclusive. The Service is not aware of any existing regulatory mechanisms in Baja, California, Mexico, that protect the gnatcatcher and its habitat. The government of Mexico has formally acknowledged the rapid loss of habitat in northwestern Baja, California and supports this listing action (Garcia 1992). Several land-use planning efforts have been initiated that are attempting to address the issue of conserving the coastal California gnatcatcher and the coastal sage scrub ecosystem upon which it depends. Foremost among these efforts is the Natural Community16753 6 754 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Conservation Planning Program (NCCP) sponsored by the California Resources Agency. This program represents an important opportunity to conserve the coastal California gnatcatcher. The Service has provided funds and technical assistance for the development of the Coastal Sage Scrub NCCP. The Coastal Sage Scrub NCCP may result in the development and implementation of specific plans and management programs for the long-term protection of the coastal sage scrub community in portions of five southern California counties by addressing the conservation needs of three \"target\" species including the coastal California gnatcatcher. The planning area for the Coastal Sage Scrub NCCP encompasses the current range of the gnatcatcher in the United States. Participation in this planning effort involves a formal enrollment process whereby voluntary agreements are established between the Department and two categories of participants: Landowners or land management agencies, and cities or counties. By enrolling, the landowners or land management agencies agree to not disturb the coastal sage scrub community during the planning period (May 1, 1992, to October 31, 1993). The cities or counties agree to monitor impacts to the coastal sage scrub community., impose additional in formation disclosure requirements during the environmental review process, strongly consider the mitigation recommendations of the Service and the Department for projects affecting the coastal sage scrub community, and be sensitive to the potential impacts of proposed activities on the coastal sage scrub community during the planning process. As of October 22, 1992, a total of 15 cities, I county, 35 landowners, and 3 land management agencies within the current range of the gnatcatcher in the United States had enrolled in the NCCP Program based on information provided by the Department. Several components of the Coastal Sage Scrub NCCP have been established. An advisory committee, consisting of representatives from the Service, the Department, local jurisdictions, environmental organizations, landowners, and developers regularly meets to provide planning for the NCCP. A Scientific Review Panel (Panel), comprised of five members with expertise in conservation biology or coastal sage scrub plant ecology, has defined the planning area, developed a standardized methodology for collection rf biological information on the coastal s ge scrub community, and has been malyzing available information with theintent of formulating planning guidelines for the conservation and management of the coastal sage scrub community. The Panel is scheduled to release draft conservation planning guidelines in the spring of 1993. The Department has prepared process guidelines that explain the roles of NCCP participants. A committee has been established to monitor and quantify the loss of coastal sage scrub vegetation during the planning period. The California State Senate defeated a $1.1 million funding bill for the NCCP program on August 17, 1992. Also during August, the Riverside County Board of Supervisors voted against enrolling county lands within the NCCP Program. The Service fully supports the goals of the NCCP Program. However, no substantive protection of the coastal California gnatcatcher is currently provided by city/county enrollments because habitat loss and fragmentation can occur prior to the development and implementation of adequate conservation plans. Therefore, the degree to which the NCCP Program removes threats to this species is based primarily on an analysis of landowner/ land management agency enrollments. However, jurisdictional enrollments contribute to recognition of the need for conserving the gnatcatcher and the coastal sage scrub ecosystem upon which it depends. At such time that city/county enrollments provide at least interim habitat protection or have resulted in the implementation of approved conservation plans for the gnatcatcher, the Service will reconsider the affects of these enrollments on the status of this species. Landowner and land management agency enrollments encompass about 22,577 of 48,000 acres (47 percent) of coastal sage scrub vegetation in Orange County; about 15,176 of 135,000 to 152,000 acres (10 to 11 percen!) of coastal sage scrub vegetation in San Diego County; and about 7,191 of 114,000 acres (6 percent) of coastal sage scrub vegetation in Riverside County. Overall, about 44,944 of 297,000 to 314,000 acres (14 to 15 percent) of coastal sage scrub vegetation within these 3 counties are subject to interim protection under the NCCP Program. The degree to which these lands will be permanently protected is not known at this time. From the perspective of the gnatcatcher, landowner/land management agency enrollments encompass about 447 of 757 pairs (59 percent) of California gnatcatchers in Orange County; 264 of 1,514 pairs (17 percent) in San Diego County; and 61 of261 pairs (23 percent) in Riverside County. Overall, 772 of 2,562 pairs (30 percent) of California gnatcatchers known to occur in the United States ae subject to interim protection under the NCCP Program. The degree to which these pairs will be permanently protected is not known at this time. The County of Riverside has funded the preparation of a draft multi-species habitat conservation plan that includes consideration of the gnatcatcher (Dangermond and Associates and RECON 1991). About 60 pairs of gnatcatchers are known to occur within 8 study areas under consideration for permanent preserve status for the Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensil, a species federally listed as endangered. Orange County, San Diego County, and the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) are using geographic information system computer technology to define, in part, the status of sensitive resources (including coastal sage scrub and the coastal California gnatcatcher) within their respective areas of jurisdiction in the context of regional open space planning. SANDAG has also established a technical advisory committee to guide the development of a regional (San Diego County) open space plan. In a related matter, the city of San Diego is funding the preparation of a multi- species conservation plan (MSCP) in conjunction with the Clean Water Program. The study area for this plan includes. about 120,000 acres of coastal sage scrub and the majority of coastal California gnatcatchers known to occur in San Diego County. A draft of the plan is scheduled to be completed in December 1993. The progressive and innovative efforts of the MSCP program have identified the known and potential habitat of the gnatcatcher within the entire study area. This program has made significant progress toward defining regional conservation priorities that may ultimately lead to habitat protection for the gnatcatcher and a variety of other sensitive species within the study area. The city of Carlsbad (San Diego County) is funding the preparation of a habitat management plan. The study area for this planning effort includes about 3,700 acres of coastal sage scrub and about 85 to 90 pairs of gnatcatchers. The biological resources and habitat analysis components of this plan were prepared in August 1992 (MBA 1992). In September 1991, a \"Focused California Gnatcatcher Resource Study for the City of Poway\" in San Diego County was completed by ERCE (1991) The objectives of this study were to (1) Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 59 I Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations conduct a detailed inventory and assessment of potential California gnatcatcher habitat within Poway and its adopted sphere of influence; (2) estimate the size of the gnatcatcher population within the study area; and 3) identify potential gnatcatcher preserve areas and evaluate the connectivity of these potential biological open space areas within and outside of the study area. ERCE (1991) reported that 8,397 acres of coastal sage scrub and an estimated 125 to 336 pairs of California gnatcatchers occur within Poway and its adopted sphere of influence. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is funding the preparation of a multi-species habitat conservation plan for southwestern Riverside County in cooperation with the Riverside County Habitat Conservation Agency. A revised draft of this plan, which includes the preservation of about 5,600 acres of coastal sage scrub and an estimated 150 pairs of gnatcatchers in the Domenigoni Valley-Lake Skinner area, was completed in October 1992 (Monroe at al. 1992). Almost $14 million in funding will be provided under this plan for initial research and management of preserve areas. A coalition of nine cities, the County of San Diego, the San Diego County Water Authority, SANDAG, the California Department of Fish and Game, the U.S. Marine Corps (Camp Pendleton), and the Service are coordinating habitat conservation planning activities in northern San Diego County. A Memorandum of Agreement formalizing this voluntary. cooperative effort was drafted in November 1991. Conservation plans that involve the California gnatcatcher have been completed or are under preparation for nine urban development or transportation project dreas in Los Angeles County (1 project), Orange County (5). Riverside County (1), and San Diego County (2). Participants in these planning efforts include Centex Homes, The Fieldstone Company, Home Capitol, Palos Verdes Land Holdings Company, Pardee Construction Company, Shell Western E and P Incorporated, San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency, and Zuckerman Building Company. Based on coordination with the Service, the J.M. Peters Company revised the Forrestal project on the Palos Verdes Peninsula (Los Angeles County) to avoid potential impacts to gnatcatcher-occupied habitat and has agreed to dedicate this habitat as naturalopen space although a nature trail will traverse the area. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was executed on April 16, 1992, between the Service and The Irvine Company. This MOU establishes the guidelines and procedures that will be ollowed by both parties in the preparation of an Advance Habitat Conservation Plan for the California gnatcatcher and other coastal sage scrub-associated species that are candidates for Federal listing. On August 7, 1992, The Irvine Company and The Nature Conservancy announced an agreement for The Nature Conservancy management of 17,000 acres of undeveloped property owned by The Irvine Company that includes large tracts of coastal sage scrub occupied, in part, by the coastal California gnatcatcher. The Irvine Company intends to dedicate these lands to the public over the next 20 to 25 years in conjunction with future development of commercial and residential projects elsewhere on the Irvine Ranch. Although planning agencies are giving greater consideration to the gnatcatcher and its habitat, none of these efforts are currently providing an adequate level of protection to the gnatcatcher. E. Other natural or man-made factors affecting its continued existence. Grazing and air pollution are also adversely affecting the coastal sage scrub plant community upon which the gnatcatcher depends (Westman 1987, O'Leary and Westman 1988). One of the effects of urbanization that is contributing to the loss, degradation, and fragmentation of coastal sage scrub vegetation is an increase in wildfires due to anthropogenic ignitions. For example, one of the largest areas of coastal sage scrub vegetation remaining within San Diego County occurs on Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base. During the last 3 years, over 15,000 acres of native vegetation, much of it coastal sage scrub, have burned in fires started incidental to military training activities. Two of these fires consumed over 6,500 acres of coastal sage scrub vegetation occupied, in part. by the coastal California gnatcatcher (D. Lawson, pers. comm.). High fire frequencies and the lag period associated with recovery of the vegetation may significantly reduce the viability of affected populations. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species In determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation, the Service finds that the coastal Californiagnatcatcher warrants protection under the Act on the basis of past habitat loss and fragmentation alone. Although the preferred action in the proposed rule was to list this species as endangered, the Service concludes (based on information received or developed after the proposed rule was published) that - the imminent threat of extinction is not as great as previously considered for the reasons outlined below. Therefore, the preferred action is to list the coastal California gnatcetcher as threatened. which is defined under the Act as a species likely to become in danger of extinction within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The Service considers this change in listing status to be warranted based on the following factors. Since the proposed rule was published, enrollment in the State of California's Coastal Sage Scrub Natural Community Conservation Planning Program (NCCP) now includes 15 cities, 1 county, 35 landowners, and 3 land management agencies within the current range of the K natcatcher in the United States, who ave formally committed to develop or to assist in the development of conservation plans that (based on process guidelines finalized by the California Resources Agency on September 1, 1992) meet the standards for allowing incidental take of a federally listed species under section 10 of the Act. The planning period for this program ends on November 1,1993. Landowner/land management agency enrollments (which preclude any habitat destruction before adequate plans are prepared and implementation agreements are executed) encompass about 45,000 acres of coastal sage scrub occupied, in part, by about 772 pairs of gfiatcatchers mostly in Orange County. Overall, according to the California Department of Fish and Game (1992), about 210,000 acres or 53 percent of the coastal sage scrub known to occur within the NCCP planning area (which encompasses the current range of the gnatcatcher in the United States) are subject to enrollment agreements. In two related matters, The Irvine Company and the Service entered into a Memorandum of Understanding for preparing an \"Advance Habitat Conservation Plan\" for the California gnatcatcher in April of 1992 (about 193 pairs of gnatcatchers occur on property owned by The Irvine Company), and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) has committed to preserve about 5,600 acres of coastal sage scrub occupied, in part, by the coastal California gnatcatcher in southwestern Riverside County. The16755 16756 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 59 / Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations MWD has also committed to provide almost $14 million in funding for research and management of this preserve. In August 1992, The Nature Conservancy and The Irvine Company announced an agreement for The Nature Conservancy management of 17,000 acres of undeveloped property owned by The Irvine Company in Orange County that includes large tracts of coastal sage scrub occupied,. in part, by the coastal California gnatcatcher. This management program will focus, in part, on the gnatcatcher and its habitat. Taking these actions into consideration, as well as the other recently initiated conservation planning efforts discussed under factor \"D\" in the \"Summary of Factors Affecting the Species\" section of this rule and the present and future threats faced by this species, the Service finds that the coastal California gnatcatcher is not in imminent danger of extinction but is likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range in the absence of protection afforded under the Act. Pursuant to the latitude afforded threatened species by section 4(d) of the Act and 50 CFR 17.31(c), the Service is proposing a special rule for the gnatcatcher in this same Federal Register part: Special rules are authorized under the Act to adjust the general protective measures available for threatened species and experimental populations. The proposed special rule defines the conditions under which \"take\" of gnatcatchers may be authorized for certain land-use activities associated with the State of California's NCCP Proram. As provided by 5 U.S.C. 553(d), the Service has determined that good cause exists to make the effective date of this rule immediate. Delay in implementation of the effective date would place the habitat of the species at risk. Critical habitat is not being designated at this time for the reasons discussed below. Critical Habitat Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires critical habitat to be designated to the maximum extent prudent and determinable at the time a species is listed as endangered or threatened. The Service has concluded that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for the coastal California gnatcatcher at this time. The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)) state that designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations exist:(1) The species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the degree of such threat to the species; or (2) Such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to the species. In the case of the California gnatcatcher, both criteria are met. As discussed under factor \"D\" in the \"Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,\" some landowners or project developers have brushed or graded sites occupied by gnatcatchers prior to regulatory agency review or the issuance of a grading permit. In some instances, gnatcatcher habitat was destroyed shortly after the Service notified a local regulatory agency that a draft environmental review document for a proposed housing development failed to disclose the presence of gnatcatchers on-site. On the basis of these kinds of activities, the Service finds that publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps would likely make the species more vulnerable to activities prohibited under section 9 of the Act. Most populations of the coastal California gnatcatcher in the United States are found on private lands where Federal involvement in land-use activities does not generally occur. Additional protection resulting from critical habitat designation is achieved through the section 7 consultation process. Since section 7 would not apply to the majority of land-use activities occurring within critical habitat, its designation would not appreciably benefit the species. Available Conservation Measures Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as en dangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if designated. Regulations implementing thisinteragency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. Federal agencies that may be involved through activities they authorize, fund, or carry out that may affect the coastal California gnatcatcher or its habitat include the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Housing Administration, and Department of the Navy (including Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, Fallbrook Naval Annex, and Miramar Naval Air Station). Section 4(d) of the Act provides that whenever a species is listed as a threatened species, such regulations deemed necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the species may be issued. The Secretary may, by regulation, prohibit any act prohibited for endangered species under section 9(a). These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or to attempt any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any-listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The term \"harm\" as it applies to the take prohibition is defined in 50 CFR 17.3 to include \"an act which actually kills or injures wildlife. Such act may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injuries wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding or sheltering.\" The implementing regulations for threatened wildlife (50 CFR 17.31) incorporate, for the most part, by reference the prohibitions for endangered wildlife (50 CFR 17.21) except when a special rule applies (50 Federal Register / VoL 58, No. 594 Tuesday, March 30, 1993 / Rules and Regulations CFR 17.31(c)). The Service finds that the prohibitions for endangered species generally are necessary and advisable for conservation of the coastal California gnatcatcher. However, pursuant to the latitude for threatened species afforded by section 4(d) of the Act and 50 CFR 17.31(c), the Service is proposing to issue a s ial rule (published in this same Federal Register) defining the conditions under which incidental take of the coastal California gnatcatcher resulting from certain state and local government-regulated activities would not violate the general prohibition against take of the species. The land-use activities covered by the proposed special rule would be associated with an approved Natural Community Conservation Plan prepared in consultation with the Service under the State of California Natural Community Conservation Planning Act of 1991. The approval process for a NCCP plan would involve review and formal concurrence by the Service that the standards set under section 10 of the Endangered Species Act have been met For these reasons, the Service finds that the proposed special rule would provide for habitat conservation and management essential to recovery of the gnatcatcher in a manner consistent with the purposes of the Act. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered and threatened wildlife species under certaincircumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22. 17.23. and 17.32. Such permits are available for scientific purposes. to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in- connection with otherwise lawful activities. For threatened species. permits may also be available for zoological exhibition, educational or other special purposes consistent with the provisions and intent of the Act.

National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section (4)(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.

ACTION: Proposed special rule. SUMMARY: The implementing regulations for threatened wildlife generally incorporate the section 9 prohibitions for endangered wildlife, except when a special rule applies. In the case of the coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica), the Fish'and Wildlife Service (Service) found that the prohibitions for endangered species were generally necessary and advisable for conservation of the species. This finding is published in this same Federal Register separate part. However, pursuant to section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), and the implementing regulations, the Service proposes to define the conditions associated with certain land-use activities under which take of the coastal California gnatcatcher would not be a violation of section 9. *The Service seeks comments from the public on this proposed special rule. DATES: Comments from all interested parties must be received by June 1, 1993. ADDRESSES: Comments and materials concerning this proposal should be sent to the Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Carlsbad Field Office, 2730 Loker Avenue West, Carlsbad, California 92008. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jeffrey D. Opdycke, Field Supervisor, at the address listed above (telephone 619/431-9440). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The final rule to list the coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica) as threatened, published in this same Federal Register part, presents discussions describing the current range and status of the gnatcatcher, previous Federal actions on this species, a summary of the comments and recommendationsreceived in response to the Service's proposal to list the gnatcatcher, detailed descriptions of the factors affecting its continued existence, the reasons why critical habitat is not being proposed, and the conservation measures available to federally listed species. Section 4(d) of the Act provides that whenever a species is listed as a threatened species, such regulations deemed necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the species may be issued. These regulations may prohibit any act prohibited for endangered species under section 9(a). These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or to attempt any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed wildlife species. It is also illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Serviceand State conservation agencies. The implementing regulations for threatened wildlife (50 CFR 17.31) incorporate, for the most part, the prohibitions for endangered wildlife (50 CFR 17.21), except when a special rule applies (50 CFR 17.31(c)). In the case of the coastal California gnatcatcher, the Service found that the prohibitions for endangered species were generally necessary andadvisable for conservation of the species. However, pursuant to section 4(d) of the Act, as amended, and 50\"CFR 17.31(c), the Service proposes to define the conditions under which take of the coastal California gnatcatcher resulting from specified land-use activities regulated by state and local government would not violate section 9 of the Act. The Service recognizes the significant efforts undertaken by the State of California through the Natural Community Conservation Planning Act of 1991 (NCCP), as well as such programs as the Multiple Species Conservation Program of San Diego County and the Multispecies Habitat Conservation Planning effort by Riverside County, to approach systematic evaluation and restoration of habitat for the benefit of healthy ecosystems, rather than a species-by- species approach. Such efforts encourage holistic management of listed species, like the coastal California gnatcatcher, and other sensitive species. As a result, the Service is proposing a special rule that would define the conditions under which take associatedwith certain land-use activities would be authorized. Under this special rule the Service would permit take of the coastal California gnatcatcher associated with land-use activities covered by an approved plan prepared under the NCCP, provided the Service determines that the approved plan meets the issuance criteria of an incidental take permit pursuant to 50 CFR 17.32(b)(2). Moreover, while the NCCP plans are being developed, the special rule would permit take of the gnatcotcher resulting from activities conducted in accordance with conservation guidelines developed by the Scientific Review Panel established under the NCCP process, provided the Service determines the guidelines meet the 50 CFR 17.32(b)(2) standards. The Service believes that this special rule will provide for habitat conservation and management essential to the recovery of the gnatcatcher in a manner consistent with the purposes of the Act. Finalization of this special rule is contingent upon adoption of the Scientific Review Panel's planning guidelines for the Coastal Sage Scrub NCCP program by the California Department of Fish and Game and the Service. National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) in implementing the provisions of the proposed special rule. Pursuant to the NCCP Process Guidelines adopted by the California Resources Agency and the California Department of Fish and Game, a joint State/Federal environmental document will be prepared for each NCCP plan. At the start of a NCCP planning effort, a planning agreement will establish the extent of Federal involvement and Service obligations under NEPA. As appropriate, the NCCP lead agency will provide documentation to assist the Service in NEPA compliance. Both State and Federal law provide for preparation of a joint State/Federal environmental document.

(3) During the period that a Natural Community Conservation Plan referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is being prepared, incidental take of the coastal California gnatcatcher is permitted if the take results from activities conducted pursuant to guidelines prepared by the Scientific Review Panel for this program and adopted by the California Department of Fish and Game pursuant to California Fish and Game Code section 2825, provided that: (i) The take occurs in an area within a local governmental jurisdiction that is enrolled in the natural community conservation planning process; (ii) The Fish and Wildlife Service has issued written concurrence that the guidelines meet the standards set forth in 50 CFR 17.32(b)(2). The Service shall issue its concurrence pursuant to the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding dated December 4, 1991, between the California Department of Fish and Game and the Service regarding coastal sage scrub natural community conservation planning in southern California; and(iii) The total loss of coastal sage scrub habitat resulting from activities covered by this paragraph does not exceed the restrictions defined by the Scientific Review Panel/California Department of Fish and Game guidelines. (4) If the Fish and Wildlife Service has concurred in the guidelines referred to in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Service shall review the guidelines every six months to determine whether they continue to meet the standards set forth in 50 CFR 17.32(b)(2). If the Service determines the guidelines no longer meet these standards, the Service shall consult with the California Department of Fish and Game pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding dated December 4, 1991, to seek appropriate modification of the guidelines, and shall revoke its concurrence under paragraph (b)(3) of this section if appropriate modification of the guidelines does not occur.
