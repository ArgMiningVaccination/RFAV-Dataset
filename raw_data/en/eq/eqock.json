Assessment of Occupational Safety & Health Program Activities and Events A. Federal Government -wide & Presidential Initiatives 1. Continuity of Operations Plans The Department of Energy's ( DOE ) Continuity of Operations (COOP) Plans are defined by DOE O rder (O) 150.1, Continuity Programs . This Order establishes requirements and responsibilities to ensure that the Department is ready to respond promptly, efficiently, and effectively to a continui ty event involving facilities, activities, or operations. These plans provide s for the safety and health of all DOE employees. Upon COOP activation, procedures are initiated which include accounting for the location and safety of all employees . Safety, health and facility specialists are an integral part of the continuity teams to ensure for the safety of all responding employees by providing guidance during an emergency. In addition, a ll DOE program offices and field sites 1 1 The Department of Energy uses the terminology \"program offices\" and \"field sites\" which are equivalent to OSHA's terminology \"subagencies.\" have c ontinuity programs that incorporate occupant emergency plans . These p lans include assistance for employees with special and medical conditions needs during evacuations ; and coordination with site safety offices , incident management , and other emergency officials. DOE program offices and f ield sites have pandemic plans that address response s to pandemic situation s that include preemptive measures such as social distancing, shutdown of non- essential operations, or the use of alter nate work locations. DOE 's Biologic Event Monitoring Team (BEMT) was established in response to the President's National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza; however, it may review other infectious diseases that can result in a biological emergency. The BEMT coordinates its response activities with the Dep artment's Office of Emergency Management and Policy . The BEMT is staffed by representatives from all DOE program offices as well as experts in public health and medicine, including infectious disease threats. The BEMT provides advice and coordinates communications to more than 15,000 Federal employees through DOE s ite m edical directors and providers . It is able to assist DOE sites i n access ing the National Strategic Stockpile to obtain vaccines for Federal employees and contractor workers who hold critical jobs in the nuclear weapons complex. DOE recognizes that it is faced with a significant challenge presented by the frequent travel of its employees and the hosting of international visitors during public health warnings. It does not have a written policy to specifically address these hazards. DOE employees are alerted of travel restrictions issued by the Center for Disease Contr ol (CDC) and the State Department. FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR DOE NARRATIVE OF SELF-EVALUATION 2 The following is a brief discussion of some of the challenges faced by DOE organizations in incorporating and implementing changes to DOE's COOP plan. a. One of the program offices at DOE Headquarters reported its most s ignificant challenge in implementing the COOP plan is accounting for its employees. The systems utilized by the Office of Emergency Management and Policy require a significant amount of manual labor to transcribe recorded messages left by employees record ing their whereabouts and safety during emergency events. b. The Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) reports that it is challenged with keeping emergency contacts information current . In addition, the COOP coordinator position has been vacant for an ext ended period, and this makes it difficult for those tasked with COOP coordination as a collateral duty to develop and maintain COOP plans. c. The Oak Ridge Office (ORO) experienced an event which triggered a plan for business continuity and identified import ant lessons for the D epartment. Asbestos containing material was found dislodged and l aying in the air plenum in the Federal building in Oak Ridge. A Notice of Unsafe or Unhealthy Conditions was posted and a major portion of the building was closed. Implementation challenges in maintaining continuity of operations during this event included: access to essential information (names, numbers, passwords, documents); loss of critical facility infrastructure and systems ( access to IT, electrical, communication, and transportation equipment ); and effectively communicating information to employees, the public , and the media. The Oak Ridge Office is working with the Office of Analysis within DOE's Office of Health, Safety and Security (HSS) to develop an Oper ational Experience Summary communicating the lessons learned throughout DOE. In addition, the Department implemented COOP for several localized natural disasters and found the plan to be effectively implemented. (See section I.4.) 2. Motor Vehicle Safety DOE has access to General Services Administration (GSA) vehicle accident information which covers 74 percent of DOE vehicle usage. Per GSA, the DOE Federal and contractor employees drove 110,348,378 total miles in fiscal year ( FY) 2011. Of the total DOE mil es driven, 81,250,590 miles were driven in GSA -leased vehicles. At the time of this DOE annual report, the GSA mileage numbers for FY 2012 have not yet been published. The DOE motor vehicle safety program is implemented independently at the DOE program offices and field sites . As part of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA) self-evaluation survey response, a total of 47 vehicle accidents were reported and investigated in FY 2012, including the following : a. ORO reported three vehicle accidents but no related injuries and a total of approximately $8,900.00 in damages. In addition to the normal vehicle safety campaigns, ORO plans to participate and/or sponsor a distracted driving seminar in FY 2013. FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR DOE NARRATIVE OF SELF-EVALUATION 3 b. National Nucl ear Security Administration ( NNSA ) reported one vehicle accident during working hours and on a military base. The outcome of the investigation included a reminder to Federal staff to follow all Air Force traffic laws while on base. c. Bonneville Power Admini stration ( BPA ) reported 38 accidents in FY 2012: 1) 14 were preventable; 2) 14 were non- preventable; and 3) 10 are still under investigation. d. WAPA reported only four vehicle accidents with no personal injuries. All those in the vehicles were wearing seatbelts. As noted in the FY 2011 Annual Report, it was determined that DOE does not currently have a comprehensive system for reporting motor vehicle accidents involving DOE - owned or commercially -leased vehicles. As a result , an FY 2012 goal wa s established and steps are being taken to enhance DOE's data collection statistics. ( See Appendix 5, Goal 2.) Executive Order (E .O.) 13043, Increasing Seat Belt Use in the United States , requires that Federal employees on the job use seat belts while in a moving vehicle whether they are drivers or passengers. DO E O 440.1B , Worker Protection Program for DOE (including the National Nuclear Security Administration) Federal Employees , requires each DOE organizati on to implement a motor vehicle safety program that addresses seat belt requirements and provisions of other safety devices. DOE continues to utilize its annual Federal Employee Occupational Safety and Health (FEOSH ) training to communicate the requireme nts of E.O. 13043 and E.O. 13513, Federal Leadership on Reducing Text Messaging While Driving. Past annual training has provided employees the opportunity to personally pledge to abstain from texting and driving. One DOE site reports that it requires all employees read and sign that they understand the requirements of the E.O.s. At Headquarters, all personnel were made aware of the Executive Orders via e -mail from the Chief Information Officer . Other examples of DOE efforts to improve motor vehicle saf ety include: a. ORO has an active motor vehicle safety program which includes Drive Safely Work Week , sponsored by the Network of Employers for Traffic Safety. The campaign theme this year was Focus 360\u00ba - Getting there safely is everyone's business , and campaign material developed by the National Safety Council (NSC) was posted throughout the workplace and on web sites. b. The Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO) Vehicle Safety Program (VSP) offers NSC 's Defensive Driving courses that are conducted at the workplace during normal working hours at no cost to employees. CBFO is part of the Southeastern New Mexico Roadway Safety Integrated Project Team (IPT). c. WAPA actively sponsors Alive at 2 5, a NSC program focused on the children of WAPA employees. Teen drivers are the highest risk group for both vehicle injuries and fatalities. FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR DOE NARRATIVE OF SELF-EVALUATION 4 Other sites provide information on seat belt use requirements, send periodic e -mail reminders about the requirements, or post notices on their intra -net sites. Security officers informally report that most drivers entering Headquarters ' properties wear seat belts. However, there have been no comprehensive D epartment surveys taken to determine if DOE employees are complyi ng with these requirements. E.O . 13043 required that all Federal agencies and its contractors provide data annually to the Department of Transportation regarding seat belt usage. 3. Protecting Our Workers and Ensuring Reemployment The Protecting Our Workers and Ensuring Reemployment (POWER) i nitiative is intended to set performance targets, encourag e the collection and analysis of data on the causes and consequences of injur ies and illness es, and prioritiz e safety and health management programs . DOE has met its POWER g oals. This includes goals on the reduction of total injury and illness case rates and reducing lost time injury and illness case rates . Additionally , DOE has met g oals regarding the filing of workers' compensation claims and reducing lost production day rates . One of the POWER g oals is not applicable for DOE in that DOE is not one of the 14 Federal agencies with statistically significant case volumes for which performance is tracked . 4. Telework Enhancement The Deputy Secretary of Energy iss ued a Flexiplace or Telework Policy for DOE on March 1, 2010. The purpose of this DOE policy is to improve the environment, to reduce energy consumption and to improve the quality of life and DOE's readiness for pandemic or COOP situations. The policy en courages employees to use Telework to the maximum extent possible. The DOE policy also establishes Department -wide participation goals for Federal employees covering all types of Flexiplace or Telework arrangements, i.e., regular, situational, and medical . The DOE policy assigns responsibility for the program to Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer ( HC) and directs that HC will update the DOE Handbook on DOE's Telework Program, in accordance with the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) announced Government -wide Telework initiative. DOE Notice 314.1, DOE -FLEX: DOE's Telework Program , approved June 5, 2011, establishes the requirements and responsibilities for the Department's telework program, and it is intended to supplement OPM's Guide to Tele work in the Federal Government . This DOE Notice expired on July 4, 2012; however , a replacement DOE O 314.1, DOE - FLEX: DOE's Telework Program , has been drafted and it is awaiting the Deputy Secretary's approval and signature. To further aid in implementation of this policy, DOE has developed the DOE Desk Reference on DOE -Flex. This desk reference follows the format and structure of the OPM guide with the exceptions that it: 1) describes an additional type of telework arrangement that applies in DOE ; 2) contains a frequently asked questions section as additional guidance for staff; 3) contains sample forms that may be used or modified by any Depa rtment element as needed; and 4) a self - certification checklist and risk assessment for dealing with the safety and health of FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR DOE NARRATIVE OF SELF-EVALUATION 5 teleworking employees. There have been no changes incorporated into the D epartment 's telework program during the reporting period of this report . NNSA sites reported that they have telework programs, though some are only exercised in limited ways such as for medical reasons. Examples of natural disasters that impacted , or had the potential to impact , the DOE telework program inclu ded: a. FY 2011 Virginia Based Earthquake - no teleworking was done in the National Capital Region as employees were initially released early and it was determined the facilities were safe to occupy ; b. FY 2011/12 Wildland Fires in Colorado - The Golden F ield O ffice and WAPA were not affected . However, DOE has many field operations that can be potentially affected by wildland fires; and c. Tropical Storm Isaac - Fossil Energy's (FE) Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) , located in Texas and Louisiana required all mission essential employees to telework from their authorized locations, while nonessential employees were placed on admin istrative leave. B. Fatalities & Catastrophic Events Total number of Fatalities: 1 Total number of Catastrophic Events: 0 On September 20, 2012, a BPA lineman lost his footing and fell from a transmission tower during routine tower maintenance. An Accident Investigation was conducted per the BPA Safety and Health Program Handbook, Accident Reporting and Investigation Process , dated March 23, 2009. As of November 1, 2012, the investigation is on- going. C. 29 C .F.R. 1960 Requirements 1. Field Federal Safety & Health Co uncils DOE program offices and field sites encourage involvement in Field Federal Safety and Health Councils ( FFSHC) and, in fact, DOE Federal employees are active participants in numerous councils . Examples include: a. DOE Headquarters personnel attend the Washington, DC F FSHC m eetings and participate on groups and activities sponsored by the council. b. WAPA serves on t he Denver Federal Safety and Health Council and a WAPA representative also serves as the recording secretary for the group and has hosted Council meeting s several times at its Lakewood, CO location. WAPA works closely with the OSHA Regional Office representative, produces the newsletter, maintains the e -mail group, and assists in providing information for the Council website which is hosted by the Denver Federal Executive Board (DFEB) . FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR DOE NARRATIVE OF SELF-EVALUATION 6 c. NNSA personnel are also involved in F FSHC meetings to varying degrees, largely depending on availability of the C ouncils in their geographic area. The NNSA FEOSH Program Manager and the Transportation Safety Manager participate in the bi-monthly meetings in Albuquerque. Staff members are encouraged to attend these off-site meetings. DOE recognizes the importance of involvement in F FSHCs. If the FY 201 3 goal III.b results in the establishment of a Certified Safety and Health Committee (CSHC ), the committee would take a leadership role to encourage particip ation in FFSHC activities. 2. Safety & Health Management System Response to the Inspection Process es DOE has not had an OSHA inspection of the Federal workplace during this reporting period. DOE program offices and field sites have policies and programs in place to respond to OSHA inspections and mitigate any hazards identified. The requirements in DOE O 440.1B ensure \" that unannounced worker protection inspections of Federal workplaces are conducted at least annually \" by DOE safety and health personnel. DOE program offices and field sites reported the following regarding responses to internal inspections: a. The DOE Headquarters Office of Administration within the Office of Management Administration (MA) conduc ts annual inspection s of the Headquarters ' workplace s. There is no formal tracking system to ensure that identified issues are addressed . b. CBFO reports it has recently completed inspections in accordance with the procedures identified in DOE/CBFO 94- 1051, CBFO FEOSH Program . These inspections resulted in numerous issues requiring abatement. CBFO is continuing to track found issues to closure. Upon completion, the CBFO Deputy Manager or designee will verify issue abatement and sign the issue abatement form. c. At ORO, a formal OSHA -type inspection was perform ed by the FEOSH Program Manager and an industrial hygienis t that resulted in survey findings . Abatement periods and appropriate OSHA standards were cited. Closure of the findings will be verified. ORO is working with the Office of Health, Safety and Security to incorporate the findings into the Department's Lessons Learned system. At DOE program offices and f ield sites , when an imminent danger situation is identified, corrective actions are taken immediately . Typically, these inspections do not result in the issuance of \"Notices of Unsafe or Unhealthy Working Conditions .\" However, as noted above in the Section I.A.1. COOP Plan, GSA issued a \" Notice of Unsafe or Unhealthy Working Conditions \" for the Oak Ridge Federal Building associated with potential h ealth hazards due to asbestos. Immediate actions were taken to evacuate and relocate the employees and on- going facility abatement will continue for several months. 3. Training of Overseas Federal Employees DOE has very few civilian employees who are officially assigned to work outside United States locations. NNSA has a few employees who spend time overseas to address FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR DOE NARRATIVE OF SELF-EVALUATION 7 mission objectives such as nonproliferation work. NNSA has a program for these employees that include training, immunizations, annual physic als, and medical kits. Employees traveling overseas have additional health and safety training available to them through the DOE Chief Medical Officer . When employees were deployed to provide assistance with the 2011 nuclear plant incident at Fukushima in Japan, they received special mission -specific guidance, and health and safety requirements, including briefings from the Department of State. 4. Whistleblower Protection Program Federal employees at DOE have the full protection of Section 11(c) of the Oc cupational Safety and Health Act. Additionally, the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978 specifically protects DOE Federal employees by prohibiting retaliation against a Federal employee for the act of disclosing a violation of any law, rule, or regula tion; gross mismanagement; a gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. The statutory provisions protecting whistleblowers in the CSRA are part of the Act's Prohibited Personnel Practices as set forth in 1978 and as amended in 1989 and again in 1994. The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 also cover s DOE Federal employees. In addition, DOE O 442.1A, Department of Energy Employee Concerns Program , ensures employee concerns related to the environment, safety, health, and management of DOE and NNSA programs and facilities are addressed promptly and prohibits reprisals against or intimidation of employees who have reported concerns. In addition, DOE has established a Differing Professional O pinion (DPO) process in DOE 442.2, Differing Professional Opinions for Technical Issues Involving Environment, Safety and Health, for employees to raise technical concerns related to environment, safety, and health (ES&H) which cannot be resolved using routine processes. This DPO process is intended to supplement, not replace, existing processes designed to address concerns. Employees must first seek to resolve concerns with their first line supervisors or use established concern or complaint resolution s ystems. If these systems have not dealt, or cannot deal effectively with an ES&H technical concern, the concern may be submitted as described in the DPO process. No DOE program, site or support organizations reported information or investigations regardin g employee allegations of reprisal related to Federal employees during this reporting period. D. Special 29 C .F.R. 1960 Reporting While DOE is not required to have a CSHC, DOE recognizes the importance of establishing a CSHC and has identified the importance of this through its FY 2013 goals. FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR DOE NARRATIVE OF SELF-EVALUATION 8 II. Safety & Health Management System Self -Evaluation Overall Assessment Based on the analyses of the information reported in the OSHA self -evaluations submitted by the DOE program offices a nd field sites, DOE performance is considered highly effective (3). Agency Safety & Health Management System - Overall Assessment Score 0 1 2 3 NA Summary of Self -Evaluation . DOE received self -evaluation summaries from program offices and field sites representing approximately two thirds of the Federal DOE population. An overall assessment rating of three (3) was derived by taking the individual subagency self -evaluation ratings, normalizing them to their number of employees, and summing the re sults of sc oring at the DOE agency level. Appendix 4 of this report contains DOE's summary of the subagency evaluation reports . Strengths I dentified . Administration and Supervision; Planning and Evaluation; and Management and Leadership as reflected thro ugh DOE Policy 450.4A, Integrated Safety Management Policy . Areas for Improvement . Effective surveillance of established hazard controls ; tracking hazard corrections ; supervisory training for safety and health responsibility and participation of employe es in the evaluation of safety and health performance . Accomplishments a. Improvement in the dissemination of complex -wide safety and health information. For example, DOE develop ed a user -friendl y, web -based injury and illness database , the Computerized Accident Incident Reporting System (CAIRS ), which allows segregation of Federal employees' information for analysis . b. Development of a FEOS H Self -Assessment Process. The FEOSH Self -Assessment Process is des igned for the use of DOE program offices and field sites in examining the effectiveness of their program 's implementation. This self -assessment tool will allow offices to: 1. Gauge the extent to which their FEOSH program is institutionalized, owned and embraced by both line management and employees ; and 2. Measure the degree of program functionality in terms of timely and proactive recognition and correction of existing and emerging saf ety and health issues, hazards and risks. FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR DOE NARRATIVE OF SELF-EVALUATION 9 c. Successful establish ment of an ergonomics technical panel to explor e cost-effective implementation of a proactive ergonomics program among the various DOE Headquarters ' program organizations. Action plans are being developed to resolve the areas for improvement. The goals outline d below address the identified areas for improvement based on the data collected from the DOE program offices and field sites. III. Goals Since the premise of any high reliability orga nization is to provide continuous improvement, DOE has established the following FY 2013 goals to improve the effectiveness of the agency's Safety and Health Management System : a. Conduct i mproved safety and health training to ensure that all employees unde rstand safety and health responsibilities, identification of hazards and the use of more effective communication tools . b. Explore the feasibility of developing a C ertified Safety and Health Committee that meets the requirements of OSHA . This would begin with internal and external benchmark ing with other key agencies . c. Enhance the FEOSH self -inspection and surveillance process by focusing on employee involvement , hazard control, and hazard correction. d. Review and update DOE's policy requiring surveillanc e of seat belt usage to comply with E.O. 13043.

FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR APPENDIX 3 - DOE CERTIFIED SAFETY & HEALTH COMMITTEE REPORT 3-1 Appendix 3. Certified Safety & Health Committee Part I: General Information 1. Does your agency have an Occupational Safety and Health Committee (OSHC) at the National level? Yes No The Department of Energy has established a n FY 2013 goal to explore the feasibility of developing a Certified Safety and Health Committee meeting OSHA's requirements. This would begin with internal and external benchmarking with other key agencies.FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR APPENDIX 4 - DOE SAFETY & HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SELF-EVALUATION 4-1 Appendix 4. Complex -wide Summary of the Safety & Health Management System Sel f- Evaluation I. Hazard Anticipation & Detection 1. Effective safety and health self -inspections are performed regularly. Based on data received from Department of Energy ( DOE ) program offices and field sites, s afety and health inspections are performed an d documented regularly . Responsibility for i nspections is assigned to the safety and health staff by the supervisors and managers. At some field sites, more frequent inspections are conducted covering all workspaces where there is an increased risk of accident, injury, or illness exists due to the nature of the work performed. The degree of employee participat ion in safety inspections varies depending on the worksite and the hazards posed. 0 1 2 3 NA 2. Effective surveillance of established hazard controls is conducted. For hazards identified in the workplace, abatement actions are prioritized. Hazards are managed and documented through to final abatement or control. In most field sites, i f hazards are identified, they are managed via the contractor 's hazard abatement program. ( Federal and DOE requirements for hazard abatement are found in 29 C.F.R. 1960.30, Abatement of Unsafe and Unhealthful Working Conditions and DOE Order (O ) 440.1B, Worker Protection Program for DOE (Including the National Nuclear Security Administration). 0 1 2 3 NA II. Hazard Prevention & Control 3. Effective safety and health rules, and work practices are in place. DOE Federal and contractor employees are responsible to observe all safety requirements. The DOE Integrated Safety Management System ( ISMS ) is institutionalized complex -wide. ISMS systematically integrates safety into management and work practices at all levels, so that missions are accomplished efficiently while protecting the workers, the public, and the environment. FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR APPENDIX 4 - DOE SAFETY & HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SELF-EVALUATION 4-2 0 1 2 3 NA 4. An effective procedure for tracking hazard correction is in place. Most field sites utilize the primary contractor's hazard tracking system to ensure abatement of identified hazards. A few p rogram offices in Headquarters have separate hazard tracking systems or have access to a contractor developed system. 0 1 2 3 NA III. Planning & Evaluation 5. An action plan designed to accomplish the organization' s safety and health objectives is in place. Many DOE sites have established safety and health goals and metrics specific to Federal employee safety and health. Where goals and objectives are in place they are monitor ed as to progress or outcome. 0 1 2 3 NA 6. A review of the overall safety and health management system is conducted at least annually. A periodic effectiveness review of the ISMS program s for eac h program office and field site is required per DOE O 450.2, Integrated Safety Management . These reviews may be conducted by comparing the results of self-assessments and analysis against established performance objectives, measures, and commitments, as well as through other feedback and performance mechanisms. 0 1 2 3 NA FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR APPENDIX 4 - DOE SAFETY & HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SELF-EVALUATION 4-3 IV. Administration & Supervision 7. Safety and health program tasks are each specifically assigned to a person or position for performance or coordination. The Department requires that l ine management and support organizations, with safety management responsibility, develop, issue, and maintain, separately or as part of the ISM S description document, an organizational Functions, Responsibilities, and Authorities (FRA) document . The FRA document is derived from various statutes and regulations and DOE safety policies, orders, notices and Secretarial Memoranda and assigns a person or position for performance and coordination. 0 1 2 3 NA 8. Individuals with assigned safety and health responsibilities have the necessary knowledge, skills, and timely information to perform their duties. DOE maintains sufficient technical capability and knowledge of activities to make informed decisions about hazards, risks, and resource allocation; provide direction to contractors; and evaluate contractor performance through annual Technical Qualification Program (TQP) and Individual Development Plans . DOE ensures through required training and other tools, that management and staff, who are responsible for safety and health aspects of contract oversight, are capable and knowledgeable of site and contractor activities and applicable regulations and requirements governing the contractor's scope of work. 0 1 2 3 NA 9. Organizational policies promote the performance of safety and health responsibilities. DOE l ine m anagement has the responsibility for safety . Further more , DOE's ISMS description document states that DOE line management is directly responsible and ac countable for the protection for each program office and field site employees, the public, and the environment. These r esponsibilities are appropriately shared with or delegated to staff through the individual 's performance standards. Although authority is delegated for implementation purposes , DOE line management retains full responsibility for the safe performance of al l work. 0 1 2 3 NA FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR APPENDIX 4 - DOE SAFETY & HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SELF-EVALUATION 4-4 V. Safety & Health Training 10. Employees receive appropriate safety and health training (including those overseas). Safety and health training is provided to ensure that DOE employees are able to work in a safe and healthful manner. Each employee is provided the necessary safety and health training. Training is tailored to the work performed and the hazards associated with the work location, and are re -evaluated when ever there is a change in the type of work performed, the work location or the potential hazards at the work location. Additional training or refresher training is provided as necessary. 0 1 2 3 NA 11. New employee orientation includes applicable safety and health information. Within the Department, s afety and health is part of new employee orientation for both program offices and field sites . Further, a FEOSH orientation training program covering the pertinent sections of 29 C .F.R. 1960, E.O. 12196 and the OSH Act exists on the Department's On- Line Training Center (OLC2) web site which is accessible by all DOE sites. In addition, DOE reinforces this training with mandatory annual training on current safety and health events. New employees also have access to employee handbooks or \"c ustomer s ervices \" handbooks at both program offices and field sites which contain safety and health information and links. Safety and health information provided during the orientation of new employees a lways contains location - specific safety and health information. 0 1 2 3 NA 12. Supervisors receive training that covers the supervisory aspects of their safety and health responsibilities. All supervisors receive training on the DOE ISMS as well as other DOE safety and health programs. In addition, supervisors receive safety and health training specific to their assigned responsibilities and locations. As an example, some s upervisors at DOE's defense nuclear facilities are required to be Senior Technical Safety Managers (STSM) , and must re -qualify as a STSM every five years per the requirements of DOE O 426.1, Federal Technical Capability . Local procedures delineate specific requirements for supervisors/managers and tra ining is tailored to that level. However, DOE identified some gaps in supervisor safety and health training. As a result, DOE's annual mandatory safety and health training has segments specifically targeted to supervisors. Last years' annual safety and health training contained a segment for supervisors on the Federal Worker's Compensation Program regulations and FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR APPENDIX 4 - DOE SAFETY & HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SELF-EVALUATION 4-5 responsibilities, and this years' training will have a segment on the responsibilities of supervisors under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 0 1 2 3 NA VI. Management Leadership 13. Top management provides competent safety and health staff support to line managers and supervisors . Through the establishment of the Office of Health, Safety and Security, DOE top management provides competent safety and health staff support for line management and supervisors . ISMS policies; FRA; and TQP ensure support is provided to line managers and supervisors . At each program office and field site, dedicated safety and health staff are provided to support first line managers and supervisors. 0 1 2 3 NA 14. Managers delegate the authority necessary for personnel to carry out their assigned safety and health responsibilities effectively. Formal delegations of authority flow down the chain of responsibility from the Secretary of Energy to the delegate. General guidance on this process is outlined in FRA document(s) established for each program office or field site. Performance requirement s, roles, and responsibilities contained in the FRA are correlated to individual position descriptions and performance standards. Specific instances of delegation are documented in a letter or memoranda . 0 1 2 3 NA 15. Managers allocate the resources needed to properly support the organization 's safety and health management system. The FRA states that DOE managers and organizations are responsible for the overall direction, program support, and oversight of work. The ISMS description document states that activities should be strategically planned and prioritized in order to ensure that DOE safety resources are most effectively applied. Further, it state s that each organizational element is responsible for FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR APPENDIX 4 - DOE SAFETY & HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SELF-EVALUATION 4-6 planning its activities, budge ting and allocating available resources to meet its objectives ; contributing to the development and implementation of requirements and objectives . 0 1 2 3 NA VII. Employee Participation 16. There is an effective process to involve employees in safety and health issues. The Department's ISMS process is the primary way in which DOE involves employees in safety and health issues identification and remediation. Through this process, DOE has established a culture that encourages all employees to establish and maintain high safety and health standards, identify and resolve problems, accept recommendations for improvement, and foster mutual respect and effective communication. In addition, t he DOE O 440.1B Chg . 1, Worker Protection Program for DOE (Including the National Nuclear Security Administration) Federal Employees establishes expectations regarding employee involvement. 0 1 2 3 NA 17. Employees participate in the evaluation of safety and health performance. DOE Federal employees are encouraged to provide feedback and make recommendations to improving the working environment . DOE's ISMS establishes guidelines and a process for worker involvement. The culture established under ISMS encourages all employees to be involved in evaluating safety and health performance. Employees have participated in climate surveys designed to assess their perception of the Department 's safety and health performance. 0 1 2 3 NA FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR APPENDIX 5 - DOE SAFETY AND HEALTH GOALS FOR FY 2012 5-1 Appendix 5. DOE Safety and Health Goals for FY 2012 In the Department of Energy ( DOE ) Annual Federal Employee Occupational Safety and Health (FEOSH ) Report for FY 2011, the Department established five new DOE safety and health goals: 1. Explore the development of a standardized ergonomic program for employees located in Headquarters facilities. 2. Evaluate data collection and retrieval systems for motor vehicle safety. 3. Develop a complex -wide FEOSH Awareness campaign. 4. Identify and evaluate system s needed to determine occupational safety and health ( OSH) staffing resources. 5. Establish a DOE -wide ergonomics program based on the recommendations of the ergonomics expert panel. These goals were circulated to the program offices within DOE to gather input and concurrence prior to including them in the final DOE Annual FEOSH Report for FY 2011. DOE Goal Numbers 1 and 5 - Ergonomics Two of the DOE goals in the FY 2011 DOE Annual Report on FEOSH addressed ergonomics. DOE goal number 1 committed DOE to explore the development of a standardized ergonomic program for employees located in H eadquarter s facilities. DOE goal number 5 committed DOE to establish a DO E-wide ergonomics program based on the recommendations of the ergonomics expert panel. DOE has integrated their approach to these two goals such that the process and procedures developed and tested under DOE goal number 1 will serve as the foundation for implementing a DOE -wide ergonomics program under DOE goal number 5. Status: An ergonomics technical panel was successfully established and is exploring cost -effective implementation of a proactive ergonomics program among the various DOE Headquarters ' program organizations. The panel consists of representatives from the Offices of Health, Safety, and Security (HSS), Science (SC), Management Administration (MA), the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Office of Chief Human Capital Officer (HC). The panel has begun development of core elements for a standardized ergonomic program at DOE Headquarters . The panel reached agreement on an outline for elements of a functional, successful stand ardized program that addresses management commitment of authority and resources, employee involvement, risk assessment, equipment procurement, education and training, identification of leading indicators, and reporting of ergonomic injuries. The panel has reviewed the ergonomics program developed by the U.S. Navy, and will use the program as a model for the development of a written DOE Headquarters ' Ergonomics Program. The ergonomic panel agrees that the development of a model program for Headquarters wil l be the initial step in addressing DOE goal 5. The Headquarters ergonomics program which is under development by the ergonomics panel will serve as the foundation for the complex -wide goal number 5. FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR APPENDIX 5 - DOE SAFETY AND HEALTH GOALS FOR FY 2012 5-2 Path Forward : In addition to developing a written program , the panel will provide assistance and expertise to the FEOSH points of contact and line management by providing ergonomic information to employees, coordinating training, evaluating workplace design, and providing recommendations for improvements and/or corrections of risk factors . The panel will continue to meet regularly. With these actions plans in place, goals 1 and 5 have been achieved. Ergonomics is an on- going process, not a one -time intervention. The DOE Headquarters ' ergonomic program evaluation, review, and investment will continue into FY 2013 and beyond. DOE Goal Number 2 - Motor Vehicle D ata C ollection /Retrieval In the DOE Annual FEOSH Report for 2011, DOE established a goal to \" evaluate data collection and retrieval systems for mo tor vehicle safety.\" In establishing this goal, DOE committed to explore methods for collecting this data within the existing reporting requirements of its Computerized Accident/Incident Reporting System (CAIRS) capability . Status: DOE reviewed the General Services Administration 's (GSA) Comprehensive, Repair, Accident, and Systems History (CRASH) database and found that this system contained comprehensive data on damage to GSA -leased vehicles only. T he data in the CRASH system represent ed only 74 percent of the total reported DOE mileage . It was determined that DOE lacks a comparable system for reporting motor vehicle accidents involving DOE -owned or commercially -leased vehicles. Further, while the DOE CAIRS database captures recordable injuries associated with motor vehicle accidents, it does not consistently collect vehicle accident report data associated with seat belt usage or if distracted driving was a contributing factor. Accordingly, the evaluat ion of data collection and retrieval systems shows that DOE has incomplete information on motor vehicle accidents involving DOE -owned or commercially - leased (non -GSA) vehicles utilized for DOE -related work. DOE recognizes that incomplete safety and health data reduces its ability to manage motor vehicle safety programs and proactively target s resources toward the contributing ca uses of motor vehicle accidents in DOE. Path Forward : DOE is committed to improving its data collection and reporting systems for motor vehicle safety . To correct the deficiencies , DOE will undertake a two pronged appr oach : 1) r evising two existing Department Orders, DOE O 231.1B, ES&H Reporting and DOE O 440.1B, Worker Protection Program to ensure motor vehicle safety data is collected and available for trending ; and 2) establishing an annual summary on motor vehicle s afety. With the evaluation of data collection and retrieval systems for motor vehicle safety completed, follow -up will continue into FY 2013. FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR APPENDIX 5 - DOE SAFETY AND HEALTH GOALS FOR FY 2012 5-3 DOE Goal Number 3 - FEOSH Awareness DOE established a goal for FY 2012 to \" develop a complex -wide FEOSH Awareness campaign.\" The proposed strategies for achieving this DOE goal included developing and issuing a FEOSH Self-Assessment tool for the use of sites and program offices, establishing an annual training workshop for Headquarters and site offices, e nhancing communications between site offices' points of contact (POCs); and developing best practices literature and information . Status : The FEOSH Awareness goal is a sustained effort which serves as the primary driver of other FEOSH goals and initiatives. The initiatives planned under this DOE goal will change focus or emphasis as needed, from year to year. During the past year, implementation of the FEOSH Awareness goal included the establishment of an ergonomics technical panel at DOE Headquarters, deve lopment of an outline for a Headquarters ergonomic plan, a recommendation to revise DOE Orders in order to provide a method of collecting data on motor vehicle safety, issuance of a communiqu\u00e9 by the Designated Agency Safety and Health Officer (DASHO) to t he DOE complex on DOE's FEOSH goals, revision of the DOE FEOSH Self -Assessment tool, and the development of DOE -wide annual FEOSH training. Path Forward : For FY 20 13, the FEOSH Awareness goal will: 1) establish a training course for Headquarters and site o ffice Federal staff on the use of the updated DOE FEOSH s elf-assessment document; 2) host a FEOSH workshop focused on enhancing communications within the Department, and between the Department and other Federal agencies; and 3) establish a routine safety communication f rom the DASHO to DOE Federal employees. DOE Goal Number 4 - OSH Staffing Resources The purpose of this DOE goal was to i dentify and evaluate whether there was a system or method in place to determine OSH staffing resources needs. T he traditional challenges of keeping multiple workplaces safe, supporting offsite workforces, developing policy and procedures , replacing a retiring technical workforce and maintaining technical capabilities led to the establishment of this goal. Status : It was determined through interviews with other Federal agencies and examination of DOE directives and systems that there is a variety of assessment tools available or readily adaptable to assist in these determinations. Safety System Oversight and Facility Representative staffing worksheets are examples of administrative tools that consider the facility hazard category, its size, operations complexity and programmatic importance to describe current personnel shortages and the site's plans to fill them. FY 2012 ANNUAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR APPENDIX 5 - DOE SAFETY AND HEALTH GOALS FOR FY 2012 5-4 Path Forward: The DASHO for DOE in coordination with HC and line management will establish and endorse a common set of criteria to define the OSH staffing necessary to protect Federal workers at DOE worksites. To that end, in FY 2013, HSS will explore the development of a s elf-assessment tool which assist s DOE program offices and field site s in consideration of OSH staffing "}
