Through a balance of classroom education and clinically supervised practicum and internship experiences, students develop a strong foundation for skilled clinical practice. The 90.0 quarter-credit curriculum includes specific art therapy coursework in areas such as assessment and treatment planning for children, adolescents, adults, older adults and families; trauma approaches; creativity, symbol and metaphor; digital media use; mindfulness, and addictions and recovery. Students also take classes in general mental health counseling topics including human development; psychopathology; social and cultural foundations; clinical appraisal and assessment, and group dynamics. Graduates are eligible for the ATR- Provisional, ATR, and ATR-BC credentials, as well as professional counseling licensure in Pennsylvania (upon completion of post-graduation requirements). Art therapy uses the creative process of making art to help improve a person's physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Counseling is a professional relationship that empowers diverse individuals, families, and groups to accomplish mental health, wellness, education, and career goals. Art therapy and counseling can help clients explore their behaviors, thoughts and feelings, reconcile conflicts, foster self- awareness, manage coping with addictions, develop social skills, reduce anxiety, and increase self-esteem to build on strengths. Upon graduation, students from Drexel's MA in Art Therapy and Counseling go on to work in a variety of settings, including but not limited to, medical and psychiatric hospitals, in-patient and out-patient behavioral health and recovery programs, community health and wellness centers, schools and after- school programs, trauma-informed settings, correctional facilities and halfway houses, elder care facilities, and private practices. Students also pioneer new frontiers in therapy application through their clinical work and research.

Creative Arts Therapies PhD Major: Creative Arts Therapies Degree Awarded: Doctor of Philosophy Calendar Type: Quarter Total Credit Hours: 45.0 Co-op Option : None Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code: 51.2399 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: 29-1129 About the Program The PhD in Creative Arts Therapies is a research degree program for art therapists, dance/movement therapists, and music therapists who are interested in pursuing advanced scholarship and assuming academic leadership in their discipline. The primary mission of the program is the cultivation of scholars and academic leaders in the creative arts therapies who can: Generate and disseminate relevant, robust rigorous research Contribute to theory evaluation and building Develop evidence-based best clinical practices Cultivate academic proficiency in educating the next generation of art therapists, dance/movement therapists, and music therapists The PhD program consists of four interactive learning modules plus a dissertation: Interdisciplinary- Delivered as seminars, these modules challenge students to study, explore, critically evaluate, and synthesize areas ofinterdisciplinary knowledge relative to creative arts therapies origins, philosophy, and theory. Research- Includes intensive study of multiple approaches to research. The purpose of the research module is to cultivate students' philosophical perspectives and develop research skills along a spectrum of traditional and innovative approaches. The research curriculum contributes to the generation and dissemination of robust and relevant research in the students' respective fields. Self/Other Artistic Knowledge- Introduces a laboratory-based pedagogical model in which students explore the intrinsic arts therapies, intersubjective processes, and transformative mechanisms that emerge through artistic inquiry and which parallels the actual arts therapies experience. Practicum- Emphasizes the transformation of theoretical knowledge to practical application and specialization. All students are required to complete a teaching practicum for one term. Beyond that, students select and complete two terms of a practicum of their choice in: academia/teaching; research; or applied clinical practice. The practicum helps students position themselves as they prepare for graduation. Dissertation- An original robust research project that directly relates to the development of and contribution to the theory and practice of the students' creative arts therapy specialization. The dissertation is the culmination and representation of the students' doctoral work that not only advances knowledge in their field, but also positions them for career opportunities in academia and research. Research The professions of art therapy, dance/movement therapy, and music therapy have grown and become increasingly integrated as interventions in healthcare, education, and human services. Implicit in the emergent growth and integration of these professions is our responsibility to evaluate existing and develop new evidence-based theories and clinical practices. The mission of the PhD in Creative Arts Therapies is to generate, critically evaluate, and disseminate research to address this need and ultimately to advance the knowledge and evidence bases for these professions. Consequently, we have identified the following core values central to our research agenda. Stewardship and scholarship in the Creative Arts Therapies includes: Critical evaluation of the philosophical assumptions inherent in and essential to the understanding, preservation, and advancement of theory and practice of the CATs Critical evaluation of the research approaches and methods best suited for the investigation of theories, processes, mechanisms, and outcomes in the creative arts therapies Generation of knowledge that contributes to the construction, evaluation, and credibility of evidence-based theory and clinical practices Translation, dissemination, and application of rigorous research that contributes to the preservation and advancement of our fields and the health of society.

About the Program The Culinary Arts and Science (CAS) program investigates the modern system of food production and consumption by combining critical, systems-thinking based scholarship and experiential, hands-on culinary learning. Faculty in the CAS program come from a mix of disciplinary backgrounds and contribute a range of perspectives and approaches that all converge in the object of study: food and the system in which it is produced. The CAS program focuses on three core pillars of study: culinary arts, food and culinary science, and food systems. Drexel University's CAS program is unique, as it is the only program in which students can combine rigorous, academic studies with culinary-arts training. While all students will take courses in all three pillars, each individual will be able to focus his or her program through electives on the particular area of CAS that they wish to engage with. Students will work individually with faculty or staff advisors to develop an individual plan of study. Students who will fit well within the CAS program are independent, rigorous thinkers who are first and foremost interested in effecting change within the food system. Students come from a variety of academic and professional backgrounds, but share a deep commitment to understanding and responding to the world's food-related challenges. The CAS program at Drexel offers more than just critique and theory- development; classes emphasize the development of practical, real-Drexel University - (GR) College of Nursing and Health Professions 15 world fixes to food-system problems. Students will have the opportunity to engage further with a required practicum course and the option for a research-based thesis project. Students who are considering the CAS program see this degree as a dual opportunity: to gain the skills necessary to respond to the dilemmas facing the world's food system and to advance their careers within the culinary world, food industry, and non-profits who share their goals. The program appreciates and welcomes a diversity of backgrounds, including students from the liberal arts and professional studies, the hard sciences, and professionals who are seeking to orient their career towards food- related work. Admission Requirements Applicants to the program must meet the general requirements for admission to graduate studies at Drexel University. Prospective students must also submit a 500-word essay explaining why they want to enter the program and some of the issues related to food, cooking, and society that they would like to study.

Dance/Movement Therapy and Counseling Major: Dance/Movement Therapy and Counseling Degree Awarded: Master of Arts (MA) Calendar Type: QuarterTotal Credit Hours: 90.0 Co-op Option : None Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code: 51.2302 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: 29-1129 About the Program The Master of Arts program in Dance/Movement Therapy and Counseling educates students for creative, responsive and effective therapy practice, in which dance and movement are the essential modes of transformation. Through a balance of experiential and reflective learning, theory and skill-based education, and supervised practicum and internship experiences, students develop a strong base for effective clinical practice. The 90.0 quarter-credit curriculum includes specific dance/movement therapy coursework in areas such as Laban Movement Analysis (LMA); movement observation and assessment; child and adult theories and skills, and developmental movement, as well as general mental health counseling coursework in human development; psychopathology; social and cultural foundations; clinical appraisal and assessment, and group dynamics. Program graduates are eligible for the Registered Dance/Movement Therapist (R-DMT) credential, as well as professional counseling licensure in Pennsylvania (upon completion of post-graduation requirements). The American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) defines dance/ movement therapy as the psychotherapeutic use of movement in a process that furthers the emotional, cognitive, social, and physical integration of the individual. The profession is positioned to meet an increasing interest in mind-body approaches to mental and physical health that have emerged in health profession circles and in the general public. Upon graduation, students go on to work in a variety of settings, including but not limited to, medical and psychiatric hospitals; inpatient and outpatient behavioral health programs; community health and wellness centers; schools and afterschool programs; trauma-informed settings; correctional facilities and halfway houses; elder care facilities, and private practices.

All courses, except for the residency, will be conducted online through Drexel University Online (http://online.drexel.edu/online-degrees/nursing- degrees/mha/ ). The residency, based at Drexel University's Center City campus, is designed to provide students with a full master's level collaborative experience with on-campus and/or community activities, and the experience of working directly with health care or public health service organizations to improve the planning, delivery and evaluation of these services. Students will learn the extent of health disparities in urban areas based on current health indices, such as infant mortality rates, life expectancy andviolence, and the policy, systems management, and epidemiological tools for addressing these. The curriculum includes community orientation, financial skills, analytical thinking, and strategic orientation. The community orientation is expressed in the public health approach in courses such as the Introduction to Descriptive Epidemiology and Biostatistics, which is based in the tradition of social epidemiology. Students collaborate to produce an Applied Management Project which will be assigned in groups as a culminating project for the program. In this project, students will apply management tools and/or research tools to address particular administrative challenges, assuring that students think at an organizational level and use particular strategies to respond to change. In addition to the content of the workforce course, self-confidence and self-development are integrated in the management courses and the on-campus portion of the program, which encourages self-reflection, application of theoretical perspectives, and synthesis of data and management tools. In the online portion of the course, students engage in threaded discussions with classmates about their completed projects. This curriculum is designed to help you to achieve your goals on a timeline that fits your lifestyle and allows a student to graduate in two or three academic years. Students also have the option to enter during the Fall or Spring term.

Human Nutrition Major: Human Nutrition Degree Awarded: Master of Science (MS) Calendar Type: Quarter Total Credit Hours: 45.0 Co-op Option : None Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code: 30.1901 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: 29-1031 About the Program The Human Nutrition major is designed to provide the didactic coursework necessary to prepare students to address the nutrition needs of individuals or groups through prevention or management of illness or chronic disease. This major also encompasses nutrition science, the application of the principles of biochemistry, physiology, and biology to human nutritional needs. The major includes two tracks: the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) track leading to becoming a Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist (RDN), and the Nutrition Sciences track leading to application in research or industry. Students who enter the MS in Human Nutrition will need to complete a separate accredited dietetic internship before taking the exam to become an RDN. Alternatively, students who are interested in becoming an RDN can apply to the MS in Nutrition and Dietetics, which combines classroom and experiential training and does not require a separate internship. Applicants to the program should indicate to which track they are applying. Current research in human nutrition includes the prevention of obesity and diabetes across the lifespan; community engagement to improve healthful food access, availability, and exposure in school and clinic-based settings ; diet and cancer survivorship; and dietary intake of participants of home- delivered therapeutic meals . Current research in nutrition science includes dopamine-mediated mechanisms of food intake regulation in humans and its impact on metabolic homeostasis, especially as it applies to obesity, eating disorders, and aging; identifying potential unique food safety risks for minority racial/ethnic and low income populations; and understanding26 Human Nutrition whether novel dietary interventions can influence bone-regulating hormones, bone mineral density, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and energy metabolism. Graduate study in Human Nutrition is offered on both a full-time and part-time basis; s tudents are admitted only in the fall term. NOTE: The Drexel DPD program is scheduled to close in September 2023; part-time students will not be admitted into the program after September 2020. Students in the DPD track are required to complete a comprehensive exam at the end of the first year of study and have the option to complete a research thesis. Students in the Nutrition Sciences track are required to complete a research thesis. In addition to the core curriculum, students select specialty courses relating to their major as well as electives. Mission, Goals, and Outcome Measures Drexel University's Department of Nutrition Sciences, Nutrition and Dietetics program integrates a foundation in the nutrition sciences with courses in the social sciences to provide the knowledge, skills, and professional values needed for successful entry into dietetic internships, graduate school, or dietetics employment. The learning environment is structured to allow students and interns to use current technology, to participate in conducting research, and to engage in experiential learning, including co-operative education for undergraduates.

Dietetics is the practical application of nutrition in the prevention and treatment of disease. Dietetics is an exciting and challenging profession because there are many diseases that are related to nutrition, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and obesity. The Drexel University Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) provides classroom training for students who want to become Registered Dietitians/ Nutritionists (RD/RDN). Our Didactic Program in Dietetics is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics 120 South Riverside Plaza Suite 2000 Chicago, IL 60606 800-877-1600 x5400 www.eatright.org Dietetics (https://www.cdrnet.org/ ) is the nation's largest organization of food and nutrition professionals, most of whom are Registered Dietitians (RD) or Registered Dietitians/Nutritionists (RDN). Note that the \"RD\" and \"RDN\" credential are the same credential. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics included the \"RDN\" to reflect that \"all registered dietitians are nutritionists, but not all nutritionists are registered dietitians.\" In addition, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics states that adding the word to \"nutritionist\" to the RD credential allows for a broader notion of wellness . To become an RD/RDN, students must complete a: Minimum of a bachelor's degree with coursework approved by ACEND. Coursework typically includes food and nutrition sciences, chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, community nutrition, nutrition counseling, basic and quantity food preparation, foodservice systems management, and medical nutrition therapy. NOTE: As of January 1, 2024, the minimum of a master's degree will be required to be able to take the RDN exam. An accredited, supervised practice program, also called a dietetic internship (DI), at health-care facilities, community agencies, and in foodservice operations. The internship must provide a minimum of 1200 hours of hands-on training. Pass a national examination administered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration. Students who already have a bachelor's degree and want to become an RD/RDN may complete coursework approved by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) at the master's degree level. Drexel University was one of the first universities in the country to offer the DPD program on the graduate level.

The College of Nursing and Health Professions (CNHP) offers a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, a research-based program, which aims to prepare nurse researchers to design, conduct and lead research studies as nurse scientists. The objective of the Joint MSN/PhD in Nursing is to prepare nurse scientists early in their professional career to ensure they have a longer trajectory upon which to make substantive and sustained contributions to the body of knowledge for the discipline of nursing and thereby improve health services for those who receive nursing care. Students are expected to plan and launch an independent program of research, seek needed support for initial phases of the research program, and begin to involve others (i.e., students, clinicians, and other researchers) in their activities. The full-time on campus program of study prepares the nurse generalist for a dual degree: the MSN in one of the advanced role tracks (current examples include: Clinical Nurse Leader, Clinical Trials Research, Nursing Innovation Concentration, Nursing Leadership in Health Systems Management) and the PhD. In addition to structured coursework, students work closely with their faculty advisor to develop an individualized program of study that allows for an in-depth exploration of a clinical specialty related to their research interests. The program of study builds upon a research mentorship model which recognizes that research skills are learned most effectively by working with a faculty advisor, who provides opportunities to use the tools to conduct research and design, and execute original research within a focused program of study. Innovation, leadership, and interdisciplinary collaboration are strong educational values which are reflected in the Drexel University strategic plan. The PhD in nursing program represents leadership in the fields, with interdisciplinary collaboration as core administrative and curricular values basic to its philosophy and epistemology. Innovation is also central to this doctoral program as evidenced in its curriculum and research philosophy. The College of Nursing and Health Professions (CNHP), Graduate Nursing Division in which the Doctoral Nursing Program is housed, is regarded as a forward thinking, progressive, and interdisciplinary healthcare school within the university as well as in the larger context of advanced healthcare education.34 Nursing: MSN-PhD Joint Degree Program Additional Information For more information, contact: Anna Pohuly College of Nursing and Health Professions 1601 Cherry Street, Mail Stop 10501 10th Floor, Room 1011 Philadelphia, PA 19102 Phone: 267-359-5872 ap469@drexel.edu Admission Requirements Criteria for admission include: GPA of 3.5.

The CNL oversees care coordination of a distinct group of patients, is a resource for clinical decision-making, and serves as lateral integrator of care. This clinical leader puts evidence- based practice into action to ensure that patients benefit from the latest innovations in care delivery. The CNL collects and evaluates patient outcomes, assesses cohort risk, and has the decision-making authority to change care plans when necessary. This clinician functions as part of an interdisciplinary team by communicating, planning, and implementing care directly with other healthcare professionals, including physicians, pharmacists, social workers, therapists, clinical nurse specialists, and nurse practitioners. The CNL is a leader in the healthcare delivery system across all settings in which healthcare is delivered. The program emphasizes the development of competencies related to the use of technology, evidence-based practice, customization of care, health team and interdisciplinary leadership, and outcome and risk assessment. This online master's program prepares nurses to function effectively in a quickly changing, increasingly complex clinical care environment. Students have the opportunity to develop advanced competencies and depth of knowledge as clinical nurse leaders. The program emphasizes evidence-based approaches to solve clinical problems, assessment and evaluation of nursing and healthcare outcomes, clinical decision-making, lateral care integration, clinically based leadership, and the design of nursing care for clinical populations at the clinical unit or similar small system level. Students meet on campus for mandatory On Campus Intensive (OCI) learning experiences, simulation, and evaluation. This OCI occurs once in the Fall Quarter that the student will begin their practicum. During the OCIs, students engage in simulated clinical learning experiences conducted in the College of Nursing and Health Professions' state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary patient simulation lab. These visits provide direct guidance and mentoring from faculty, as well as the opportunity to collaborate with peers. Clinical practicum experiences include development and management of a data-driven project which provides opportunities for students to deepen evidenced-base practice competencies in the management of clients' healthcare needs at the point-of-care. Precepted clinical experiences will include activities such as modeling of care, assessment and evaluation of aggregate patient outcomes, case management and service integration, and unit and interdisciplinary team leadership, as well as teaching and mentoring of staff.Drexel University - (GR) College of Nursing and Health Professions 39 The program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.

With the elderly population in the U.S. expected to double\u2014if not triple\u2014by 2030, it is imperative that there is an educated workforce of health professionals able to deliver high-quality and appropriate care to the adult and older-adult population. In response to this need, Drexel University has developed an Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (AGPC) program. The AGPC cares for individuals (aged 13 years and above) across the lifespan to promote maximal health, reduce risks, and manage acute, chronic, and complex health conditions. The AGPC is specifically trained to focus on health and wellness, disease prevention, and quality of life in the aging population. The purpose of our AGPC program is to educate and prepare competentand compassionate AGPC graduates to provide comprehensive, quality, and cost effective care founded in evidence-based practice to adults across the lifespan on the continuum of health and illnesses. All graduates will be eligible to sit for the certification exam as an Adult- Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner through the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) and/or American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC).

Doctor of Physical Therapy Major: Physical Therapy Degree Awarded: Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) Calendar Type: QuarterTotal Credit Hours: 128.0 Co-op Option : None Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code: 51.2308 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: 29-1123 About the Program The Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) curriculum produces broadly educated physical therapists, while being sensitive to the needs of the health care community and the students' interests. The program strives to foster both intellectual and professional growth in students and is reflective of contemporary practice to prepare graduates for the ongoing changes in health care delivery. The Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program prepares students for autonomous practice in physical therapy. As a science, physical therapy examines human motion at the tissue, organ, and systems levels. In the clinical environment, physical therapists (PTs) examine and evaluate patients/clients and implement procedural interventions that restore physical function for all people across the life span. As essential practitioners in the health care delivery system, PTs assume roles in rehabilitation services, prevention and health maintenance programs, and professional and community programs. As professional members of the health care team, PTs supervise support personnel, serve as consultants to other health care personnel, serve as consultants to families and caregivers, participate in administrative services, and conduct clinical research. PTs also serve as advocates for health policy and standards of care that help ensure optimum care for their patients/clients. Graduates of the Doctor of Physical Therapy program are prepared to fulfill their professional obligations, provide leadership to the profession, and use their knowledge and skills to contribute to the health care of society. The program is just under 3 years in length and spans eleven academic quarters. The curriculum consists of integrated didactic and clinical study with an emphasis on adult learning methodology. Foundational courses are emphasized during the first year, with subsequent quarters sequenced to progress through the hierarchy of educational objectives from simple to complex. All didactic material is organized for synthesis and application to professional practice.

The clinical education for the DPT program is integrated into the didactic portions of the curriculum so that knowledge obtained in the classroom is readily put into practice. The DPT program has contracts with hundreds of clinical sites across the nation, representing all facets of professional practice. Students build confidence by participating in part-time integrated clinical experiences (ICEs) during the first year of the program and 32-33 weeks of full-time clinical experiences that offer various levels of acuity in different clinical environments. Students may select from clinical sites that offer experiences with all ages across the life span and in a variety of environments including, but not limited to acute care, pediatrics, adult rehabilitation, geriatrics, orthopedics, sports medicine, and industrial and occupational rehabilitation.

Facilities Teaching Facilities Most classes are held in lecture halls, classrooms, or laboratories on the Center City (Health Sciences) Campus of Drexel University. The entire campus has wireless capability for easy internet access. The Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Sciences has two state-of-the-art dedicated laboratories where the clinical components of the professional curriculum are taught. In these laboratories equipment reflects current physical therapy practice and is part of a multi-disciplinary clinical learning and resource center. Included as part of the resource center is a standardized patient lab that utilizes paid actors to simulate various clinical situations while students' interactions with those \"patients\" are monitored by supervising faculty. This center provides a rich environment for student learning. The department also utilizes an anatomy lab where dissection of human cadavers occurs during the first two terms of the program. The anatomy course work focuses on the areas most relevant to physical therapy making connections to clinical practice. Our teaching resources also include supported distance learning technology. Instructional materials are provided through text, graphics, audio and video formats and are available online through a course management system 24 hours a day. Our online courses are highly interactive through the use of web discussion boards and audio chat tools.Drexel University - (GR) College of Nursing and Health Professions 61 Additionally, the Professional DPT program uses its own faculty-staffed clinical sites as well as various clinical sites in the area to enhance the educational experience of the student. The department operates outpatient physical therapy sites in the Drexel Recreation Center on the University City campus, a multidisciplinary Parkway Health and Wellness Center on the Center City campus and a pro-bono practice in the 11th Street Family Health Center. Students rotate through these facilities getting individualized mentoring while connecting classroom content with clinical practice. These experiences are in addition to the 32-33 weeks of full-time clinical education the student will experience throughout the curriculum. Research Facilities The Department conducts hypothesis-driven research in human movement, biomechanics, motor control, community-based practice and family-centered care. Some of this research is conducted in a 23,000 square foot multidisciplinary center on the Center City Campus. The center has a gait and motion analysis lab containing a video-based motion analysis system with in-floor force plates, and neuromuscular performance labs equipped with custom-built force measuring systems, l6-channel EMG system and electromagnetic tracking systems. Other research is conducted via partnerships with organizations locally, nationally, and internationally. Other departments involved in the research center include Nutrition Sciences and Nursing which provides fertile ground for collaboration.

About the Program This program will prepare health professionals with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required to provide comprehensive and sensitive sexual health care to their patients and their partners. Students who complete the certificate program will be able to discuss a wide range of patient sexual health issues, promote sexual wellness, and provide patient education on various sexual health topics. This post-baccalaureate certificate should allow graduate students from various health-related programs of study to obtain a deeper knowledge base and improved skillset related to human sexuality. Not only can many sexual problems and dysfunctions be clinically managed to improve patient quality of life, but patient education, health promotion, and risk reduction counseling can reduce negative and unintended consequences of sex while enhancing overall patient health and sexual wellness. Issues such as unwanted pregnancy, HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, sexual assault and abuse, and lack of access to family planning, along with increased incidences of breast, gynecological and prostate cancers, challenge health professionals across disciplines to increase their knowledge and skills to appropriately address the sexual health needs of their patients. In addition, greater social acceptance and legal protection for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals has increased the need for health professionals to combat health disparities and discrimination within these populations and better serve these clients. The intended audience of this post-baccalaureate certificate program is health professionals\u2014both clinical and non-clinical who seek to specialize in sexual health and medicine. This program is designed to enhance the graduate education of physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses in inpatient, outpatient, or school settings, social workers, health educators, behavioral health counselors, and other health professionals.

About the Program The Certificate of Advanced Study in Women's Integrative Health provides healthcare professionals with a mind-body-spirit approach to care. Studies have shown that women desire a broader, integrative approach to their healthcare and share a philosophical congruence with Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) core values. In this program, s tudents learn to integrate evidence-based complementary and integrative health therapies such as phytomedicine, nutrition, mind/body, and energy therapy modalities within the framework of conventional healthcare practice. Integrative healthcare reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, and utilizes all appropriate therapeutic approaches, as well as both conventional biomedicine and CIH practices, to achieve optimal health and healing. Women's Integrative Health provides a model of care that is most compatible and reflective of women's emotional and psychological needs in the healthcare relationship and prepares students to incorporate an innovative, caring, and holistic spectrum of treatment. Students learn to explore the fullness of women's lives, taking into account a woman's beliefs, intuitions, and preferences for care which allows them to form a healing partnership while providing their patients with the finest possible healthcare.
