Morning Drinks To Lower Bad Cholesterol Levels Green Tea According to [BMC Nutrition](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-020-00557-5), drinking green tea lowers Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as 'bad' cholesterol in your body. It contains catechins, which are antioxidants that can help reduce LDL cholesterol in the blood. So, start your morning with a cup of [green tea](https://www.onlymyhealth.com/benefits-of-drinking-green-tea-for-oral-health-1674475267) to enjoy its heart-healthy properties while benefiting from its calming effect on the mind.
