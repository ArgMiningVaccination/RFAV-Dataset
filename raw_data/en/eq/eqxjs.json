With spiraling costs and uncertainty in the health insurance marketplace, consumers have every right to be concerned about whether the healthcare system will be there for them when they need it. We, however, have chosen to offer our patients more \u2014 not less. With a generous gift from Orange County philanthropists Susan and Henry Samueli, we will seek to make integrative health the centerpiece of a new model of health and wellness, one that revolutionizes the education, training and collaboration of healthcare professionals, advances research rooted in a systems approach to medicine and delivers on the promise of truly personalized healthcare. The emphasis on integrative health does not mean we reject the conventional practice of medicine. Indeed, we pride ourselves on being at the leading edge of advances in evidence-based medicine. We are often among the first in the country to provide the latest medical and surgical therapies. But we also recognize there is far more to an individual's well-being than medications and operations. Study after study shows that many other factors \u2014 including an individual's genetics, lifestyle and socioeconomic status \u2014 greatly influence health and well-being. Our quest to \"integrate\" reflects our recognition of the shortcomings of modern medicine, which too often treats patients as a collection of symptoms and organs rather than as a whole person. In coming years, we will add to our faculty some of the nation's top researchers who are working to clarify which integrative approaches truly help and which are ineffective. We want to know, for example, whether physical activity makes a measurable difference in the onset of dementia or whether music therapy can shorten a hospital stay. In time, we will have data to confidently counsel patients on everything they can do \u2014 whether in the doctor's office or at home \u2014 to recover from illness and, better yet, prevent serious disease. We hope you will follow our progress as we embark on this exciting journey into a truly innovative model of 21 st-century medicine. n Sincerely, Dr. Howard Federoff Vice Chancellor, Health Affairs CEO, UCI HealthNOTES A GIFT THAT WILL CHANGE LIVES VICE CHANCELLOR, HEALTH AFFAIRS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, UCI HEALTH Howard Federoff, MD, PhD CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICERTeresa Conk ASSISTANT MARKETING DIRECTORDaphne Tam PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER John Murray MANAGING EDITOR Kristina Lindgren DESIGN, EDITORIAL & CONTRIBUTORS Moon Tide Media ART DIRECTOR Angela Akers EDITOR Shari Roan DESIGNER Kelsey Elliott BRAND PUBLISHER Hannah Lee If you have comments or questions, please contact: UCI Health Marketing & Communications 333 City Blvd. West, Suite 1250 Orange, CA 92868 714-456-5496 The information contained in this magazine is not meant to replace the advice of your physician.

HUCIRVINEHEALTH.ORG 3 A gift from Susan and Henry Samueli will boost a health sciences college that examines all aspects of a patient's well-being. WRITTEN BY SHARI PersonLIVE WELL4 Nayan Patel was worried. The 46-year-old chiropractor from Fullerton knew he was a candidate for heart disease. His uncle died of a heart attack at age 57; his father recently underwent cardiac bypass surgery and stent placement. Patel's primary care doctor had prescribed a medication to lower his cholesterol, but the drug caused side effects. Patel had a sinking feeling that what he was doing simply wasn't enough to prevent the disease. His wife, Sheela, a cardiac care nurse at UC Irvine Medical Center, suggested that he consult with Dr. Shaista Malik, a UCI Health cardiologist. Malik ran extensive tests and put Patel on a different medication to lower his cholesterol. \"I knew her research focused on the potential to prevent heart disease,\" Sheela Patel says. But Malik's advice didn't stop at medication. At her urging, the Patels switched to a plant-based, vegan diet. Malik also prescribed herbal supplements that are proven to support heart health. Within six months, Patel's cardiac tests showed vast improvements, and he no longer needs cholesterol medication. \"I feel very different now,\" he says. \"I feel a lot of energy and mental clarity. I feel like I'm contributing to my health. A disease should not control you. You have to control your health. To be empowered this way is amazing.\" Patel is typical of patients who adopt a broader range of regimens and treatments to successfully improve their health and well-being. Now, propelled by a $200-million gift by a generous Orange County family, the University of California, Irvine, is embarking on a major expansion of its science-based approach to integrative health research, education and patient services. While aspects of this approach for patients like Patel may not reflect traditional Western medicine, some are more innovative and use leading-edge technologies, Malik says. \"Mr. Patel's care is integrative health 2.0,\" Malik says. \"We did a complete medical assessment and high-tech diagnostics, which included looking at his genetics. Then we looked at everything we could do to help him. Integrative health is synergistic. It makes conventional medicine work better.\" Improving health outcomes as well as patients' experiences is the goal of the realigned health sciences college at UCI. The gift by Broadcom co-founder Henry Samueli and his wife, Susan, is the largest in UCI's history and will lead to ambitious extensions of medical research, education and services. It will include construction of the new Susan and Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences building on the UCI campus and also will support the creation of 15 Samueli research chairs in integrative health. Across the UCI Health landscape, physicians, researchers, nurses, pharmacists, therapists and students will seek to \"Integrative health is synergistic. It makes conventional medicine work better.\" Dr. Shaista MalikUCIRVINEHEALTH.ORG 5 understand how scientifically validated integrative health modalities can help treat and prevent disease, as well as make patients' lives better. Weaving integrative health into conventional healthcare reflects the belief that everything about a person \u2014 genetics, lifestyle, socioeconomic status as well as cultural and religious beliefs \u2014 impacts health. This approach is sometimes referred to as \"systems biology,\" says Dr. Michael J. Stamos, dean of the UCI School of Medicine. \"The systems approach means that all aspects of a patient's care are brought together and considered,\" he says. \"It's a changing paradigm where we treat the whole person.\" Susan Samueli says she and her husband are motivated by a desire to improve people's lives. \"Despite our technological advances, too many people still suffer from debilitating conditions such as heart disease and diabetes,\" she says. \"Preventive medicine is the best way to end this spiral.\" Moreover, helping people improve their diets, exercise more and reduce stress through simple, cost-effective strategies has the potential to alter public health in the decades to come, says Dr. Howard J. Federoff, vice chancellor of health affairs and chief executive officer of UCI Health. \"We can improve population health to levels never before seen,\" he says.THE RIGHT TIME AND PLACE UCI Health is uniquely positioned to emerge as a national leader in integrative health. UCI is already home to the Susan Samueli Center for Integrative Medicine, where many non-traditional services are offered, Malik notes. The center will grow and become the Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute located within the new College of Health Sciences building. But integrative health research also will be incorporated across the entire allied health sciences fields \u2014 including nursing, public health and pharmaceutical sciences. And other disciplines, such as social sciences and engineering, will be brought into the research efforts, Stamos says. \"We've been talking for quite a while about the importance of interdisciplinary research and interdisciplinary clinical care,\" he says. \"Our transdisciplinary work will make this gift much more impactful.\" Integrative health may sound like an \"extra\" service. In reality, several nonconventional health modalities have long been embraced at UCI Health with impressive results. Malik and others have championed diet, exercise, stress reduction and other proven integrative therapies for certain cardiac patients for many years, often tapping into programs offered at the Susan Samueli Center. \"I would see patients with heart disease and would talk to them about the need for them to change their lifestyles,\" says Malik, who became the center's director in 2015. \"But I'd see them later, and they hadn't changed. I felt I needed more tools to help them change their behavior and manage stress.\" Integrative health therapies are being adopted by many UCI Health clinicians. Malik has done so in her Preventive Cardiology Program. At the Center for Pain and Wellness, patients often use biofeedback and acupuncture to avoid or reduce their reliance on highly addictive opioid pain medications. Neurosurgeon Dr. Sumeet Vadera also recommends pet therapy, acupuncture, Reiki and other nontraditional therapies to help reduce the pain of cranial and spinal surgery patients and decrease the length of their hospitalization stays. \"UCI has been a pioneer in integrative health with the original Samueli gift that created the Susan Samueli Center,\" Malik explains. \"We were among the very first academic medical centers to embark on this mission of looking at the whole person and integrating mind, body, spirit and emotional well- being, and addressing all the determinants of health. We have a history with this, and it's a field that's ready to expand.\" SCIENTIFIC PROOF Folding integrative health therapies into medical care isn't a repudiation of traditional Western care. In fact, UCI Health is home to some of the most advanced, technologically driven medicine in the nation. Across the campus, surgeons wield lasers and other next-generation tools to remove tumors through tiny incisions, use 3-D imaging devices to create vivid, real-time images inside a patient's body and employ sophisticated monitoring devices to study brain function. Adding proven integrative health practices will enhance a patient's well-being and experience, Stamos says. Photo: Steve Communications Susan and Henry SamueliLIVE WELL6 \"Integrative health is not an abandonment of the well- established Western medicine treatments we utilize daily,\" he says. \"But I would say that traditional Western medicine has lapsed in terms of addressing a patient's health beyond what we can measure and quantify. That has led to a weakening of the patient experience. We're not always talking about what really matters to patients. We also need to focus on other aspects of patients' health that are currently not being addressed very effectively or very regularly.\" For example, as a colorectal cancer surgeon, Stamos uses leading-edge technology to remove tumors. But removing a tumor and sending a patient to chemotherapy and then home to recover is not enough, he says. \"We've known for almost a decade that what a patient does in terms of lifestyle after colon cancer surgery matters to their outcomes,\" he says. \"Patients who adopt a healthy lifestyle, a Mediterranean diet and who exercise regularly have an improvement in survival. But those things are not espoused by many Western physicians. We are not saying a patient shouldn't receive chemotherapy. We're saying that, in addition to chemotherapy, these are things you can do to increase your chances of survival. That is incredibly empowering to patients.\" While Western medicine has been slow to adopt outside-the- box methods, patients have long been hungry for information and activities to improve their health. Almost 20 years ago \u2014 in part due to patient demand \u2014 the National Institutes of Health opened the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health to lead research on diverse medical and healthcare practices. Indeed, many integrative therapies have been practiced for thousands of years or are considered \"conventional\" in other parts of the world. \"Integrative health has been patient-driven,\" Malik notes. \"There is a very high demand for these services. The reason is that patients see a huge change when they add some of these therapies, when they start eating better, adding physical activity or addressing certain nutritional deficiencies. People get results.\" ELEVATING HEALTHCARE A major drawback to some nontraditional medical therapies, however, is that many have not been validated by high-quality, scientific research to prove their effectiveness. Studying integrative therapies to learn which work and which don't is a key component of the UCI Health program. \"With this gift we'll have the opportunity to do some pilot work that could get funded for a more comprehensive look at the mechanisms that underlie some of these modalities,\" Malik says. \"That will help us understand which patient and condition a particular therapy works best for.\" Nayan and Sheela PatelUCIRVINEHEALTH.ORG 7 To learn more about clinical services, visit ucirvinehealth.org/samueliThese integrative health studies will not be conducted in isolation, Federoff notes. A key to improving patient health is to understand the potential for synergy \u2014 how integrative and conventional medicine work together. \"For instance, you may have the gene for a certain kind of cancer,\" he says. \"But depending on your behavior and your exposure to stress and environmental factors like pollution, you could turn that gene off.\" The research will also explore the potential to curb spiraling healthcare costs, Stamos says. \"We recognize the unsustainability of our current healthcare spending in this country,\" he says. \"But what people are starting to realize is we have abandoned the recognition that we all have some individual responsibility for healthcare. We have not put an emphasis on lifestyle, meditation and things we can do ourselves to lead to better health. We hope the emphasis we have on integrative health will raise awareness and provide data to show that these things do affect disease prevention.\" The time is right to push the boundaries of healthcare and employ new strategies, Malik says. Integrative modalities may be just the answer to what ails traditional medicine. \"We're starting to see the tipping point where conventional medicine is looking for other answers to solve the healthcare crisis we see around us.\" n\"You may have the gene for a certain kind of cancer, but \u2014 depending on your behavior and your exposure to stress and environmental factors like pollution \u2014 you could turn that gene off.\"The Susan and Henry Samueli Gift \u2014 What It Means AMOUNT PLEDGED \u2014 $200 million DONORS \u2014 Susan and Henry Samueli, whose previous contributions to the university total more than $70 million SPENDING PROGRAM$50 million toward construction of the Susan and Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences, which will encompass: The School o f Medicine The Sue & Bill Gr oss School of Nursing The f uture School of Pharmacy (now the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences) The f uture School of Population Health (now the Program in Public Health) The f uture Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute (now the Susan Samueli Centerfor Integrative Medicine) $5 million to equip the institute with state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment $145 million for an endowment to fund: 15 Samueli r esearch chairs in integrative health T wo dozen scholarships and fellowships for undergraduate and graduate students whoare planning careers in integrative health Pr ogramming and administrative leadership costs for the instituteLIVE WELL8 HEALTH FILES EYE MOBILE FOR CHILDREN - CORRECTION An article in the Fall 2017 issue of Live Well about the Eye Mobile for Children incorrectly identified the organization that funded the program as First 5 California.

OCMA is a voluntary physician organization that promotes the art and science of medicine, the protection of public health and the betterment of the medical profession. The announcement, which appeared in the January 2018 edition of Orange Coast magazine, lists about 475 Orange County physicians in 65 specialties. To be eligible for OCMA recognition, physicians are required to be certified by a member board of the American Board of Medical Specialties, a member board of the American Board of Osteopathic Medical Specialties or an equivalent board recognized by the Medical Board of California or Osteopathic Medical Board of California; be in good standing with the Medical Board of California or Osteopathic Medical Board of California; maintain a primary practice in Orange County for the last five years; and have been in practice within his/her specialty for the last five years. Additionally, physicians were required to meet at least two of the following criteria: physician leadership; teaching/mentoring; medical research/scientific advances; and humanitarian service. UCI Health doctors practice at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange and Gottschalk Medical Plaza at the UC Irvine campus in Irvine. UCI Health also has primary and specialty care offices in Tustin, Orange, Costa Mesa, Newport Beach, Yorba Linda, Placentia, Corona and Chino Hills. GAINING WISDOM ABOUT BREAST CANCER SCREENING UCI Health is part of an important new study that aims to improve breast cancer screening recommendations. The Wisdom Study, a collaboration among all the University of California (UC) medical centers, will include 100,000 women; UCI Health will recruit and track 10,000 of those participants. Breast cancer screening recommendations are now somewhat vague. A typical recommendation calls for annual mammograms for all women over a certain age. Doctors believe screening guidelines would be more effective if they also included information on a women's personal risk of breast cancer, including breast density, family history and genetics. \"Our main aim is to determine how safe risk-based screening is compared with annual screening,\" says Hannah Lui Park, PhD, an assistant professor of epidemiology and UCI site director for the study. \"While we want to minimize the number of false-positives, we still need to be able to detect breast cancers early enough so that patients can be treated effectively, with no increase in morbidity or mortality.\" Study participation is open to all women between ages 40 to 74 who have never had breast cancer and who get their healthcare in California. They do not need to be patients at UC medical centers. The participants also can choose to be randomly assigned to receive either annual screening or risk-based screening. While random assignment is preferred by the researchers, women who prefer to participate in one group or the other have that option as well. Those in the risk-based group will receive a risk assessment, which includes genetic analysis of a saliva sample, and their screening schedule will be based on that assessment. The study is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and private donations.

Soon she learned a family secret her parents hoped to keep. \"When the doctor asked my mom about our family history, she said my dad has Crohn's disease,\" says Schwartz, now 28. It wasn't just her dad. At age 7, he had watched his own father die after multiple surgeries for Crohn's disease. Schwartz also had an aunt who died of Crohn's complications. \"Looking back now, it's clear something had been wrong since I was a baby,\" she says. \"I was always complaining of stomachaches.\" Crohn's disease is one of two types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) \u2014 the other is ulcerative colitis (UC). \"Crohn's disease can occur in the esophagus, colon or small intestine, but ulcerative colitis affects only the colon,\" explains Dr. Nimisha Parekh, director of the UCI Health Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, the region's only comprehensive program devoted to treating patients with these conditions. The program's team includes IBD-trained gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, nurse navigators, pathologists, radiologists and clinical social workers who work together to help people with Crohn's and UC to live a normal life. Both Crohn's and UC cause chronic inflammation in the digestive system that can lead to debilitating stomach pains, diarrhea and the need to frequently use a bathroom. IBD is most often diagnosed in early adolescence, when symptoms can be especially disruptive for teens attending school, dating and living active social lives. \" After I was diagnosed, treatment got me into remission, but my normal was still very different than my friends' normal,\" Schwartz says. \"I had a lot of anxiety around going to the bathroom, and I had to plan my life around that. Traveling anywhere was hard, and I would never go to sleepovers at my friends' houses.\" The exact causes of IBD are not well understood. \"We think it's partly a dysfunction in the immune system combined with a genetic predisposition,\" Parekh says. When an Illness and Lifestyle Collide WRITTEN BY TRAVIS MARSHALL PHOTOGRAPHED BY KREMER JOHNSONTreatment for inflammatory bowel disease requires comprehensive and sensitive care. Michelle and Travis SchwartzUCIRVINEHEALTH.ORG 11 Quality of Life Issues for Young IBD Patients Symptoms of IBD often arise in adolescence, which can be particularly difficult because people with IBD often need to use the bathroom dozens of times a day. Many teenagers naturally feel self-conscious, but those with IBD may be even more reticent, choosing to withdraw from social activities to avoid embarrassment. \"Studies show that 30 to 60 percent of IBD patients experience anxiety or depression in their lifetimes,\" Dr. Nimisha Parekh says. \"There's also a strong con- nection between the mind and the gut. The stress of anxiety can actually cause or increase their flare-ups. \" Treating the psychological and social impacts of IBD helps patients manage flare-ups by learning ways to reduce stress and anxiety. The UCI Health Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program team excels in this. \"We have a social worker who helps IBD patients find resources to manage their disease,\" says UCI Health gastroenterologist Dr. Sandra Sunhee Park. This complex condition also is affected by diet, stress and other factors. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach as well as an individualized care plan for each patient, which can include a mix of medications, surgical procedures and lifestyle changes. UCI Health, as the only academic medical center in Orange County, also gives patients access to the latest therapies, clinical trials and research studies on the causes and best approaches to treating IBD. \"Given the current research advances in IBD care and the advent of new therapies, it's an exciting time to be involved in caring for IBD patients,\" says Dr. Sandra Sunhee Park, an IBD-trained gastroenterologist with the program. Schwartz knows well how stress can affect her condition. Soon after she graduated from college in Thousand Oaks, she wound up hospitalized. \"I could feel that my medication wasn't working anymore, so I started on more frequent, higher doses, then on a different medication ... But nothing really worked.\" After months of pain, significant weight loss and a multitude of tests, a new doctor finally discovered that Schwartz had developed a fistula in her intestine and two abscesses, including one that sat on her bladder, that had to be surgically removed along with a foot of her intestine. For the next few years, her condition remained relatively stable. But as she neared the completion of graduate school in 2013, she suffered an outbreak of ulcers in her colon. \"I had just gotten a job in Orange County, so I decided to try UCI Health,\" she says. \"From my first appointment with Dr. Parekh, I realized they provide a level of care I hadn't experienced before.\" That year wound up being one of the hardest of Schwartz's life. It included hospitalizations for liver inflammation, intestinal infections and other complications. \"My boyfriend had been planning to propose, but I could barely get off the couch,\" Schwartz says. \"He put it off until I got better, and we got married in October 2016.\" In the summer of 2015, Parekh and Schwartz finally found a medication that worked. She was even able to travel for her honeymoon the following year. \"We went to Costa Rica and didn't compromise on the wedding, even though traveling with Crohn's can be really challenging,\" she says. \"I've been good ever since.\" n To learn more about IBD, visit ucirvinehealth.org/ibdtreatment \" AFTER I WAS DIAGNOSED, TREATMENT GOT ME INTO REMISSION, BUT MY NORMAL WAS STILL VERY DIFFERENT THAN MY FRIENDS' NORMAL.\"LIVE WELL12 Q & A UCI Health offers more clinical trials than any other healthcare organization in Orange County. At any given time, about 180 clinical trials are underway at UC Irvine Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer to help get innovative drugs and technologies quickly to patients. The cancer center conducts research as a significant part of its mission as a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. Live Well spoke with Dr. Susan O'Brien, one of the nation's foremost leukemia experts and medical director of the cancer center's Sue and Ralph Stern Center for Clinical Trials and Research, about the facts and myths of clinical trials. What are clinical trials? Clinical trials are research projects involving patients to investigate new drugs, devices, treatments and diagnostics, or to compare approved drugs, devices or treatments. Trials are designed to assess their safety, efficacy, benefits, costs, adverse reactions and outcomes. Some trials look at how certain drugs or substances can help prevent disease, such as examining whether a vitamin could help reduce lung cancer. Others might test the effectiveness of drugs, surgical techniques, radiation schedules or devices \u2014 such as robot-assisted surgery \u2014 in treating a disease. Is it true that many medical advances emerge from clinical trials? Yes. Before drugs, medical devices and many other treatments can be made available to patients, their effectiveness and safety must be proved in a clinical trial. How do clinical trials benefit patients? Participating in a clinical trial may offer hope for patients with diseases that haven't responded to treatments that are the current standard of care. If an investigational treatment turns out to be effective, trial participants will have benefited from the therapy long before it is available to patients HOPE, ALTRUISM AND, SOMETIMES, BREAKTHROUGHS WRITTEN BY NANCY BRANDS WARD PHOTOGRAPHED BY MICHAEL DER Dr. Susan O'Brien stands outside her offices at the UC Irvine Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.UCIRVINEHEALTH.ORG 13 Q & A View our cancer clinical trials at cancer.uci.edu/clinicaltrialsPATIENT PROTECTIONS IN CLINICAL TRIALS Many regulations exist to protect clinical trial participants from harm, says Dr. Susan O'Brien. For example, manufacturers of new drugs must file applications with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration detailing what's in the drug and how it's manufactured. Before a drug can be used in clinical trials, the FDA requires companies to test it in animals \u2014 not just mice, but in mammals \u2014 to understand a drug's toxicity and how it is metabolized. When it comes time for a clinical trial, the design must be submitted to the FDA for review, revision (if warranted) and approval. Reports to the FDA are required. The FDA also monitors clinical trials in progress. everywhere. Patients enrolled in clinical trials also receive close monitoring by experts who specialize in their particular medical problems. Aren't clinical trials just a last resort for patients? Sometimes clinical trials are a last resort for people whose disease has not responded to standard treatments. But often they can involve an adjustment to a standard treatment, such as a revised radiation schedule or an addition to the treatment plan \u2014 like a combination of drugs \u2014 to evaluate improvements in treatment plans. Don't some participants get placebos (sugar pills) in clinical trials? This is another common misconception about clinical trials. Placebos are rarely used in cancer trials. Sometimes patients receive a different drug or a combination of drugs in addition to the standard of care. Some clinical trials that are designed to assess the preventive value of drugs or vitamins may employ placebos for a control group of participants. Is it true that you can't quit a clinical trial once you sign on? No. You're free to stop participating at any time and to return to the standard of care. Does health insurance cover clinical trials? Most insurance, including Medicare, pays for patients to receive the standard of care. Costs for anything more required for the study, such as extra office visits, lab tests or scans, would be paid by the company of the drug or device being tested. In drug tests, most of the drugs are free of cost to the patient. This is really important in the case of oral cancer drugs, which can cost about $10,000 a month \u2014 with a copay. I have heard of copays of $1,000 per month for standard care. What is the UC Cancer Center Consortium? Five University of California (UC) health systems have created a consortium to pool cancer patients for clinical trials. This lets us complete an entire clinical trial within our own UC, and we're able to communicate patient information via our common electronic health records systems. Also, once a trial is approved at one UC campus, it is automatically approved for the others in the consortium. And we are able to propose our own clinical trials. All of this helps our patients because we now have the ability to speed up the initiation of clinical trials and to streamline their completion. How do patients typically feel after enrolling in a clinical trial? Naturally, participants hope that their outcomes will be better than the standard of care for their condition or disease. But there is also a level of altruism involved. Many people appreciate that their participation will lead to knowledge gained \u2014 even if the innovation tested doesn't help them directly. nLIVE WELL14 Cancer center director Dr. Rick Van Etten, Sheryl Crow and pharmaceutical sciences professor Mahtab Jafari, PhDHEALTH HAPPENINGS ANTI-CANCER CHALLENGE CONCERT WITH SHERYL CROW All we did was have some fun!

First, she worked in the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center; later, she became an associate clinical professor of geriatric medicine. Retirement came unexpectedly in May 2016 when Berkson, 60, was diagnosed with glioblastoma brain cancer. She turned to her colleagues for surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and, eventually, she enrolled in a clinical trial of a new cancer drug combination, designed by Celgene, that has stabilized her tumor. Berkson chose well. A recent study in the Journal of Clinical Neuroscience found that glioblastoma patients treated in academic medical centers have higher survival rates and more favorable outcomes. The UCI Health clinical trial arm is directed by Dr. Daniela Bota, medical director of the Comprehensive Brain Tumor Program at the cancer center. Looking back, I now realize something was wrong. I had become irritable \u2014 well, more irritable than usual! Everyone was starting to notice it. I wasn't making sense all the time. I wrote garbled text messages on my phone, but I sent them anyway. Then one day I went to pick something up, and I couldn't get up. I thought, 'Maybe I'm tired or stressed.' But a CAT scan showed a big mass in the frontal lobe of my brain. That's where your executive decision-making takes place. Dr. Simin Torabzadeh \u2014 with whom I worked in geriatrics at UCI's Gottschalk Plaza \u2014 basically saved my life. I was being transferred from one Orange County hospital to another hospital. She told my husband, 'You have to go see Dr. Frank Hsu at UCI Health,' the neurosurgeon who performed my surgery. It's the kind of surgery where a cut of even one millimeter in the wrong place can mean loss of function. I was given a bad prognosis. I also talked to my brother, who is a hematologist-oncologist, and he asked me where I was going to go for my treatment after surgery. I said, 'UCI!' I was very impressed with Dr. [Daniela] Bota, her team and the clinical trial protocol I'm enrolled in. She is a researcher in neuro-oncology, which is a highly specialized field. The most amazing part of this is that years ago, I was the nurse practitioner with the UCI brain tumor cooperative group and we were studying one of the drugs that I'm now taking as part of the Celgene clinical trial. Of course, being a nurse, I ask way too many questions. Dr. Bota told me: 'You're going to have to be the patient.' That's very hard for me. The reason I've been a nurse practitioner is because I think things through, and I anticipate what can go wrong. You've got to be on your game when you're taking care of patients. This experience has taught me to be very humble and appreciative. I'm still a little demanding. But patients should be a little demanding. You're not well; you're feeling very vulnerable. Anticipating side effects is what makes me anxious; that's hard for me. When I'm cared for by the nurses at UCI, though, they know I'm one of them, and they take good care of me. I'm a patient, but I'm part of the team. nIT TAKES A TEAM ON MY MIND To learn more about brain cancer research, visit ucirvinehealth.org/braintumorresearch\u2014 Pam Berkson PHOTOGRAPHED BY MICHAEL DER PThe UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge is leading the charge against cancer and you can help!
