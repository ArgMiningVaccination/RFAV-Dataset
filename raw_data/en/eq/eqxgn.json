The CCDF program also provides funding to enhance the quality of child care for all children. On November 19, 2014 , the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014 was signed into law (Pub. L. 113-186). The law reauthorizes and significantly revises the purposes of the CCDF program and requirements for state and territory grantees. In September 2016, th e final rule was released. The final rule makes regulatory changes to the CCDF program based on the CCDBG Act of 2014. These changes strengthen requirements to protect the health and safety of children in child care; help parents make informed consumer cho ices and access information to support child development; provide equal access to stable, child care for low-income children; and enhance the quality of child care and the early childhood workforce. The Plan is the primary mechanism that the Administratio n for Children and Families (ACF) uses to determine state and territory compliance with the requirements of the law and rule. The Preprint provides a tool for states and territories to describe to ACF their progress on the following sections: 1. Define CCDF Leadership and Coordination With Relevant Systems 2. Promote Family Engagement Through Outreach and Consumer Education 3. Provide Stable Child Care Financial Assistance to Families 4. Ensure Equal Access to Child Care for Low -Income Families 5. Establish Standards and Monitoring Processes To Ensure the Health and Safety of Child Care Settings 6. Recruit and Retain a Qualified and Effective Child Care Workforce 7. Support Continuous Quality Improvement 8. Ensure Grantee Accountability These organizational categories reflect key functions of an integrated system of child care for low -income working families. Although the Plan is divided into sections for reporting and accountability purposes, ACF encourages Lead Agencies to approach the Plan in a cross -cutting, integrated manner. The intention is that grantees and the federal government will be able to use this information to track and assess progress, determine the need for technical assistance (TA), and determine compliance with specific requirements and deadlines. CCDF Plan Sub mission States and territories will submit their Plans electronically through the ACF -118 electronic submission site. The ACF -118 site will include all language and questions included in the final CCDF Plan Preprint template approved by the Office of Manag ement and Budget. Please note that the format of the questions on the ACF -118 site could be modified from the Word version of the document to ensure compliance with Section 508 policies DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 5 regarding accessibility to electronic and information technology for i ndividuals with disabilities. (See http://www.section508.gov/ for more information.) In responding to questions, states and territories are asked to provide brief, specific summaries and/or bullet points only w ith specific language that responds to the question. Do not use tables or copy and paste charts, add attachments, or paste manuals into the Plan. All information and materials developed to support CCDF implementation and information reported in the CCDF Pl an are subject to review by ACF as part of ongoing oversight and monitoring efforts.

Describe: 1.5 Optional Use of Combined Funds, CCDF Matching and Maintenance -of-Effort Funds Optional Use of Combined Funds: States and territories have the option to combine funding for CCDF child care services with funding for any of the required programs liste d in 1.4.1. These programs include those operating at the federal, state, and local levels for children in preschool programs, tribal early childhood programs, and other early childhood programs, including those serving infants and toddlers with disabiliti es, homeless children, and children in foster care (658E(c)(2)(O)(ii)). Combining funds could include blending multiple funding streams, pooling funds, or layering funds together from multiple funding streams to expand and/or enhance services for children and families to allow for the delivery of DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 20 comprehensive quality care that meets the needs of children and families. For example, state/territory agencies may use multiple funding sources to offer grants or contracts to programs to deliver services; a state /territory may allow a county/local government to use coordinated funding streams; or policies may be in place that allow local programs to layer CCDF funds with additional funding sources to pay for full -day, full -year child care that meets Early Head Sta rt/Head Start or state/territory prekindergarten requirements in addition to state/territory child care licensing requirements. As a reminder, CCDF funds may be used in collaborative efforts with Head Start programs to provide comprehensive child care and development services for children who are eligible for both programs. In fact, the coordination and collaboration between the Head Start and CCDF is strongly encouraged by sections 640(g)(1)(D) and (E); 640(h); 641(d)(2)(H)(v); and 642(e)(3) of the Head S tart Act in the provision of full working day, full calendar year comprehensive services. To implement such collaborative programs, which share, for example, space, equipment, or materials, grantees may layer several funding streams so that seamless servic es are provided (Policy and Program Guidance for the Early Head Start - Child Care Partnerships: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/occ/acf_im_ohs_15_03.pdf ). 1.5.1 Does the Lead Agency choose to combine funding for CCDF services for any required early childhood program (98.14(a)(3))? No. Yes. If yes, describe at a minimum: a) How you define \"combine\" OSSE layers CCDF funding with local pre -k enhancement dollars to ensu re children that are eligible receive a full day of care. The pre -k enhancement supplements, not supplants, the CCDF funds. b) Which funds you will combine CCDF funds and locally appropriated District funds, c) Your purpose and expected outcomes for combining funds, such as extending the day or year of services available (i.e., full -day, full -year programming for working families ), smoothing transitions for children, enhancing and aligning quality of services, linking comprehensive services to children in child care or developing the supply of child care for vulnerable populations Pre-K enhancement funds cover 6.5 hours of the day , and CCDF funds are layered to ensure a full day of care. d) How you will be combining multiple sets of funding, such as at the State/Territory level, local level, program level? CCDF and locally appropriated pre-k enhancement funds are layered to ensure a full day of care. e) How are the funds tracked and method of oversight Funds are tracked using the District 's accounting system of record for CCDF funds, as well as the Lead Agency's Enterprise Grant Management System for allocated pre -k enhancement funds. Use of PreK for Maintenance of Effort : The CCDF final ru le clarifies that public preK funds may also serve as maintenance -of-effort funds as long as the state/territory can describe how it will coordinate preK and child care services to expand the availability of child care while using public preK funds as no m ore than 20 percent of the state's or territory's maintenance of effort or 30 percent of its matching funds in a single fiscal year (FY) DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 21 (98.55(h)). If expenditures for preK services are used to meet the maintenance -of-effort requirement, the state/territo ry must certify that it has not reduced its level of effort in full-day/full -year child care services (98.55(h)(1); 98.15(a)(6)). Use of Private Funds for Match or Maintenance of Effort : Donated funds do not need to be under the administrative control of t he Lead Agency to qualify as an expenditure for federal match. However, Lead Agencies do need to identify and designate in the state/territory Plan the donated funds given to public or private entities to implement the child care program (98.55(f)). 1.5.2 Which of the following funds does the Lead Agency intend to use to meet the CCDF matching and MOE requirements described in 98.55(e) and 98.55(h)? Check all that apply. Note: The Lead Agency must check at least public and/or private funds as matching, even if preK funds also will be used. N/A\u2014The territory is not required to meet CCDF matching and MOE requirements Public funds are used to meet the CCDF matching fund requirement. Public funds may include any general revenue funds, county or other local public fund s, state/territory -specific funds (tobacco tax, lottery), or any other public funds. If checked, identify the source of funds: Locally appropriated District funds If known, identify the estimated amount of public funds that the Lead Agency will receiv e: $ The FY18 locally appropriated child care subsidy budget is $55,849,629, which is sufficient to meet CCDF matching and MOE requirements. OSSE does not anticipate any reductions to the locally appropriated budget in future years. Private donated funds are used to meet the CCDF matching funds requirement. Only private funds received by the designated entities or by the Lead Agency may be counted for match purposes (98.53(f)). If checked, are those funds: donated directly to the State? donated to a separ ate entity(ies) designated to receive private donated funds? If checked, identify the name, address, contact, and type of entities designated to receive private donated funds: If known, identify the estimated amount of private donated funds that the Lead Agency will receive: $ State expenditures for pre -K programs are used to meet the CCDF matching funds requirement. If checked, provide the estimated percentage of t he matching fund requirement that will be met with preK expenditures (not to exceed 30 percent): DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 22 If the percentage is more than 10 percent of the matching fund requirement, describe how the State will coordinate its preK and child care services: If known, identify the estimated amount of preK funds that the Lead Agency will receive for the matching funds requirement: $ Describe the Lead Agency efforts to ensure that preK programs meet the needs of working parents: State expenditures for preK programs are used to meet the CCDF maintenance -of- effort requirements. If checked, The Lead Agency assures that its level of effort in full -day/full -year child care services has not been reduced, pursuant to 98.55(h)(1) and 98.15(6). No Yes Describe the Lead Agency efforts to ensure that pre -K programs meet the needs of working parents: The pre -k program administered by the Lead Agency includes before and after school programming for working families. Additionally, the Lead Agency works with LEAs and community based organizations to support them in accessing subsidized child care funding to support before and after school programming. Estimated percentage of the MOE Fund requirement that will be met with preK expenditures (not to exceed 20 per cent): If the percentage is more than 10 percent of the MOE requirement, describe how the State will coordinate its preK and child care services to expand the availability of child care: If known, identify the estimated amount of preK funds tha t the Lead Agency will receive for the MOE Fund requirement: $ 1.6 Public -Private Partnerships Lead Agencies are required to describe how they encourage public -private partnerships among other public agencies, tribal organizations, private entities, fait h-based organizations, businesses or organizations that promote business involvement, and/or community -based organizations to leverage existing service delivery (i.e., cooperative agreement among providers to pool resources to pay for shared fixed costs an d operation) (658E(c)(2)(P)). ACF expects these types of partnerships to leverage public and private resources to further the goals of the CCDBG Act. Lead Agencies are required to demonstrate how they encourage public -private partnerships to leverage exist ing child care and early education service -delivery systems and to increase the supply and quality of child care services for children younger than age 13, for example, by implementing voluntary shared service alliance models (98.14(a)(4)). 1.6.1 Identify and de scribe the entities with which and the levels at which the state/territory is partnering (level \u2014state/territory, county/local, and/or programs), the goals of the partnerships, the ways that partnerships are expected to leverage existing service -delivery systems, the method of partnering, and examples of activities that have resulted from DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT these partnerships (98.16(d)(2)). OSSE is partnering with the Bainum Family Foundation to improve outcomes for our state's most vulnerable children and their families. Our partnership focuses on improving the quality of child development facilities, authentically engaging families, enhancing the availability and use of data to inform policy and planning and increasing the supply of infant and toddler care across the District . OSSE and Bainum have been in partnership since 2015. Through this partnership we have launched a shared services web -based platform for all licensed child development providers, conducted a child care supply and demand study, expanded and evaluated the Q uality Improvement Network, provided in -depth and targeted technical assistance and training for providers and OSSE grantee partners and deepened our capacity for analyzing, using and visualizing data to inform policies and planning. To date the Foundation has invested nearly $20 million in birth to three improvements in the District of Columbia. Through the Early Head Start Child Care Partnership grant, OSSE established the Quality Improvement Network (QIN), a public private partnership with three neighbor hood based \"hubs\" that provide quality services and supports to a network of child development centers and homes. This model uses Early Head Start Program Performance Standards to increase the supply of high -quality infant and toddler care in the District. To achieve the goal of enhancing young children's school readiness, the QIN sites provide comprehensive services to promote the overall health, development, and well -being of infants and toddlers and their families. OSSE is leveraging resources from Distr ict agencies to improve efficiencies and system coordination. To this end, OSSE established the QIN Interagency Steering Committee comprised of the following city agencies: DC Health, Department of Behavioral Health, Department of Health Care Financing, Ch ild and Family Services Agency, and the Department of Human Services. The Interagency Steering Committee meets monthly with our hub agency partners to discuss specific areas of coordination and supports for the child care partners and the families and chil dren they serve. This Committee helps leverage and identify resources to improve the quality of child development facilities. Interagency partners also assist in providing professional development and technical assistance in areas such as employment traini ng, economic self -sufficiency, mental health, and substance abuse treatment. OSSE is also an active member of the Regional Early Care and Education Workforce Implementation Network which is funded by the Early Care and Education Funders Collaborative and supported through the Washington Area Women's Foundation. This Network was formed in 2016 as part of the National Academies Implementation Network. The partners include representatives from the District of Columbia, Prince Georges County, MD, Montgomery Co unty, MD and counties in Northern Virginia who are working together to map competency -based career pathways that are linked to quality and compensation DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 24 and can be used across the region. This work has two primary deliverables 1) develop a career pathways d ocument that is based on existing early care and education (ECE) professional credential/knowledge/competency frameworks in the region that establish a practical and common set of quality standards for competencies at different levels, including suggested compensation levels, that are linked to identified competencies and 2) develop a blueprint for an implementation mechanism that assesses and verifies competencies among the region's ECE professionals according to the competency levels defined in the career pathways document and that establishes suggested compensation levels that correspond to the certification/credential. 1.7 Coordination With Local or Regional Child Care Resource and Referral Systems Lead Agencies may use CCDF funds to establish or support a system of local or regional child care resource and referral (CCR&R) organizations that is coordinated, to the extent determined by the state/territory, by a statewide public or private non -profit, community - based or regionally based, lead child care resou rce and referral organization (such as a statewide CCR&R network) (658E(c)(3)(B)(iii); 98.52). If Lead Agencies use CCDF funds for local CCR&R organizations, the local or regional CCR&R organizations supported by those funds must, at the direction of the Lead Agency, provide parents in the State with consumer education information concerning the full range of child care options (including faith -based and community -based child care providers), analyzed by provider, including child care provided during non - traditional hours and through emergency child care centers, in their area. To the extent practicable, work directly with families who receive assistance to offer the families support and assistance to make an informed decision about which child care provide rs they will use to ensure that the families are enrolling their children in the most appropriate child care setting that suits their needs and one that is of high quality (as determined by the Lead Agency). Collect data and provide information on the coo rdination of services and supports, including services under Section 619 and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; Collect data and provide information on the supply of and demand for child care services in areas of the state and subm it the information to the State; Work to establish partnerships with public agencies and private entities, including faith - based and community -based child care providers, to increase the supply and quality of child care services in the state and, as appr opriate, coordinate their activities with the activities of the state Lead Agency and local agencies that administer funds made available through CCDF (98.52(b)). Nothing in the statute or rule prohibits States from using CCR&R agencies to conduct or prov ide additional services beyond those required by statute or rule. Note: Use section 7.6 to address how quality set -aside funds, if applicable, are used to support a statewide CCR&R system. DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 25 1.7.1 Does the Lead Agency fund a system of local or regional CCR&R orga nizations? No. The state/territory does not fund a CCR&R system and has no plans to establish one. Yes. The state/territory funds a CCR&R system. If yes, describe the following: a) What services are provided through the CCR&R system? The Office of the Sta te Superintendent of Education (OSSE), Division of Early Learning, contracts with a local organization to provide Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) services. DC Child Care Connections, the local CCR&R, helps families identify and select child care, understand child development, provide information about the quality of licensed early childhood programs, develops resources to help families understand program quality, provides valuable resources, such as, a lending library and supports providers by prov iding professional development and technical assistance. The CCR&R regularly attends community events to provide information and resources to parents, families and child care providers throughout the District. The CCR&R supports families who need child car e resources via telephone, in -person and through an online searchable database. The CCR&R also coordinates with the Teacher Education and Compensation Helps (T.E.A.C.H.) grant program to support ECE educators seeking higher education degrees. DC Child Care Connections continues to build a network of public and private agencies that work collaboratively to deliver high -quality services and supports to families seeking child care, including parent education and outreach and resources and supports for child de velopment providers including scholarship funding, professional development and technical assistance. Additionally, OSSE develops grants, MOUs and contracts with public and private agencies that provide scholarships for Child Development Associates (CDAs) and T.E.A.C.H. scholarships to support professionals that work in DC child development centers and homes in obtaining early childhood degrees. OSSE's Part C program provides consultation and technical assistance as needed to child development facilities. b) How the CCR&R system is operated, including how many agencies and if there is a statewide network and how the system is coordinated. DC Child Care Connections serves the entire geographic area of the state. The grantee was selected through a competitive grant process in which a panel of experts reviewed applications and selected the application that best fit the needs and context of DC. The CCR&R has two walk -in service centers in easily accessible locations in the District. Through their accessibility to the public, the CCR&R works to connect with organizations, DC public agencies, other grantees and the community with the services they need. The CCR&R attends various stakeholder meetings and participates in providing feedback based on their knowledge and experience of DC and the needs of the community. Through their network, CCR&R offers one -on-one technical assistance to both providers and families in order to meet their needs. Additionally, CCR&R attends and participates in various meetings, including a monthly grantee meeting with DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 26 other OSSE grantees to share resources and information across programs and initiatives. 1.8 Disaster Preparedness and Response Plan Lead Agencies are required to establish a Statewide Child Care Disaster Plan (658E(c)(2)(U)).

Staf ford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5122) \u2014 through a Statewide Disaster Plan that, for a State, is developed in collaboration with the State human services agency, the State emergency management agency, the State licensing agency, t he State health department or public health department, local and State child care resource and referral agencies, and the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care (designated or established pursuant to section 642B(b)(I)(A)(i) of the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9837b(b)(1)(A)(i))) or similar coordinating body (98.16(aa)). 1.8.1 Describe how the Statewide Child Care Disaster Plan was developed in collaboration with the State human services agency, the State emergency management agency, the State licensing agency, the State health department or public health department, local and State child care resource and referral agencies, and the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care or similar coordinating body: The Child Care Disast er Plan (CCDP) is coordinated with agencies and contractors utilizing the District of Columbia's Joint All Hazards Operations Center (JAHOC) and Emergency Operations Center managed by HSEMA under the direction of the Mayor. Coordination with the agencies a nd contractors is also outlined in section XI Coordination with Agencies and Contractors of OSSE's CCDP which clearly defines the \"Role of Partner Agencies , Role of Contractors and Community -Based Organizations\", and recovery efforts. For example, reques t for Family Reunification will be managed at the level of the JAHOC and EOC where agencies such as DOH manage and activate coordinated by priority for multiple agencies as needed. 1.8.2 Describe how the Statewide Disaster Plan includes the Lead Agency's guideli nes for the continuation of child care subsidies and child care services, which may include the provision of emergency and temporary child care services during a disaster and temporary operating standards for child care after a disaster: The CCDP has comp rehensive guidelines for the continuation of child care services that can be found in section X. Impact Assessment and Response Coordination, XI. Coordination with Agencies and Contractors, and XII Recovery and Recertification of the plan. These sections illustrate clearly the pre - disaster or post disaster process as well as requirements of providers in any stage of a disaster event. For example, post disaster child care providers are mandated to complete a post disaster assessment as part of the recover y efforts to properly classify the status of their facility and operations before resuming normal operations; should normal operations never be achieved this trigger a review of temporary placement and/or provisions based on how impaired the operations are . DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 27 1.8.3 Describe Lead Agency procedures for the coordination of post -disaster recovery of child care services: Recovery procedures are found in section XII Recovery and Recertification. Here the focus is ensuring that impacted families maintain their child c are, monitoring of contingency sites, and tracking operational status of impacted providers. 1.8.4 Describe how the Lead Agency ensures that providers who receive CCDF funds have the following procedures in place \u2014evacuation; relocation; shelter -in-place; loc kdown; communications with and reunification of families; continuity of operations; and accommodations for infants and toddlers, children with disabilities, and children with chronic medical conditions: As part of the overall licensing process all provide rs (CCDF and Non -CCDF) are mandated to have ERP's and COOP plans in place that's annually reviewed and approved by our partner agencies like the DC Fire Prevention Division, Office of Risk Management, and/or HSEMA COOP division. Each provider's plan addre sses the need to provide assistance to children whether impacted with a disability or just to young to understand emergency evacuation procedures such as children 2 \u00bd years old and younger. 1.8.5 Describe how the Lead Agency ensures that providers who receive CCDF funds have the following procedures in place for child care staff and volunteers \u2014emergency preparedness training and practice drills as required in 98.41(a)(1)(vii): As part of the ov erall licensing process all providers (CCDF and Non -CCDF) are mandated to have ERP's and COOP plans in place that are annually reviewed and approved by our partner agencies like the DC Fire Prevention Division, Office of Risk Management, and/or HSEMA COOP division. Each providers plan addresses the need to provide assistance to children whether impacted with a disability or just too young to understand emergency evacuation procedures such as children 2 \u00bd years old and younger. Emergency preparedness traini ng is provided using a combination of resources such as HSEMA training tracker, DC Fire Prevention Division, and their providers complementing their own functionality exercises submitted for review to the Lead Agency on an annual basis. 1.8.6 Provide the link to the website where the statewide child care disaster plan is available: The District ACF Amendment/Revision2, approved on April 3, 2018 includes an approved waiver for Section 1.8 Disaster Preparedness and Response Plan, with a targeted implementation/comp letion date of September 30, 2018. DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 28 2 Promote Family Engagement Through Outreach and Consumer Education Lead Agencies are required to support the role of parents as child care consumers who need information to make informed choices regarding the services that best suit their needs. A key purpose of the CCDBG Act is to \"promote involvement by parents and family members in the development of their children in child care settings\" (658A(b)). Lead Agencies have the opportunity to consider how information can be provided to parents through the child care assistance system, partner agencies, and child care consumer education websites. The target audience for the consumer education information includes three groups: parents receiving CCDF assistance, the general public, and when appropriate, child care providers. In this section, Lead Agencies will address how information is made available to families to assist them in accessing high -quality child care and how information is shared on other financial assistance pr ograms or supports for which a family might be eligible. In addition, Lead Agencies will certify that information on developmental screenings is provided and will describe how research and best practices concerning children's development, including their s ocial -emotional development, is shared. In this section, Lead Agencies will delineate the consumer and provider education information related to child care, as well as other services, including developmental screenings, that is made available to parents, p roviders, and the general public and the ways that it is made available. This section also covers the parental complaint process and the consumer education website that has been developed by the Lead Agency and the manner in which it links to the national website and hotline. Finally, this section addresses the consumer statement that is provided to parents supported with CCDF funds. 2.1 Outreach to Families With Limited English Proficiency and Persons With Disabilities The Lead Agency is required to describe how it provides outreach and services to eligible families with limited English proficiency and persons with disabilities and to facilitate the participation of child care providers with limited English proficiency and disabilities in the CCDF program (98. 16(dd)). Lead Agencies are required to develop policies and procedures to clearly communicate program information, such as requirements, consumer education information, and eligibility information, to families and child care providers of all backgrounds (8 1 FR 67456). 2.1.1 Describe how the Lead Agency or partners provide outreach and services to eligible families for whom English is not their first language: OSSE staff and grantees are required and trained to use the Language Access line to respond to the calls/ needs of the families for whom English is not their first language.

Lead Agencies must also include a description of how a family or child care provider can use these resources and services to obtain developmental screenings for children who receive subsidies and who might be at risk of cognitive or other developmental delays, which can include social, emotional, physical, or linguistic delays (658E(c)(2)(E)(ii)). Lead Agencies are required to provide this information to eligible families during CCDF intake and to child care pr oviders through training and education (98.33(c)). 2.6.1 Certify by describing: a) How the Lead Agency collects and disseminates information on existing resources and services available for conducting developmental screenings to CCDF parents, the general public, a nd where applicable, child care providers (98.15(b)(3)). The DC Department of Health Care Finance is the state agency responsible for the administration of the Medicaid program. The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 44 and Treatment (EPSDT) services be nefit constitutes the child health component of the Medicaid program. The benefit includes all necessary health care services covered under federal Medicaid law to identify, and then correct or ameliorate, any defects or chronic conditions found in benefic iaries under the age of 21. Families are provided information regarding developmental screenings at various intake sites across the District and on the district websites. The District of Columbia's Early Intervention Program (DC EIP), administered through OSSE, is the single point of entry for infants and toddlers whose families or others have concerns about their development. OSSE's DC EIP provides services through program staff and approved contractors. b) The procedures for providing information on and refe rring families and child care providers to the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment program under the Medicaid program \u2014carried out under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) \u2014and developmental screening services av ailable under Section 619 and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1419, 1431 et seq.). DC Early Intervention Process (DC EIP) (children under 2 years, 10.5 months) Step 1: Referral \u00b7 Parent or other referral source suspects child may have developmental delay or disability; \u00b7 The DC EIP program contacts parent, provides infor mation and assigns a Service Coordinator (SC); \u00b7 SC provides information about DC EIP, informs family of their rights and refers family to an evaluation site; and \u00b7 Parental consent is obtained to share referral with the managed care organi zation (MCO). Step 2: Determine eligibility \u00b7 Determine eligibility using the Battelle Developmental Inventory, the Bayley Developmental Inventory, or the Developmental Assessment of Young Children -Second Edition; \u00b7 Eligibility: 25 percent delay in two (2) or more areas, 50 percent delay in one (1) or more areas or diagnosed condition; and \u00b7 Conduct optional family assessment plan, and gather information for Individualized Family Services Plan (IFSP). Step 3: Planning Meeting \u00b7 If child is eligible, family identifies desired outcomes, IFSP team specifies early intervention services and develops written plan; \u00b7 If child is ineligible: Family receives a thorough explanation of the evaluation results and reasons for ineli gibility and provide family with strategies and access to other therapy through their insurer or other community resources. DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 45 Step 4: Implement Services \u00b7 The IFSP will identify the services that best support families to be able help their child par ticipate in everyday routines. Services might include: o Assistive technology devices and services o Audiology o Vision services o Family training, counseling, home visits and parent support groups o Medical services only for diagnostic or evalua tion purpose o Nursing services o Health services o Occupational therapy o Physical therapy o Psychological services o Service coordination o Social work services o Special instruction o Speech -language pathology o Transportation and re lated cost For children three (3) to five (5) years old, all the information on how to submit a referral for a child not currently enrolled in school is available at http://www.earlystagesdc.org/ . Once a written referral has been received, the family is contacted for an appointment to bring the child in for an evaluation and eligibility determination. If the child is found eligible for services, an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is developed and the child receives an appropriate placement in a DC Public School (DCPS). If the child is enrolled in a DCPS or public charter school, a referral is made to the special education coordinator, who arranges for the child to receive an evaluation and eligibility determination. In addition to the information provided at the specific sites above, the following brochure describing Part C and Part B services is available on OSSE's website: http://osse.dc .gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/publication/attachments/Comprehensi v e%20Child%20Find%20Brochure.pdf c) How the Lead Agency gives information on developmental screenings to parents receiving a subsidy as part of the intake proc ess. Include the information provided, ways it is provided, and any partners in this work.

Also, DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 48 procedures for the enrollment of homeless children and children in foster care, if served, pending the completion of documentation, are required. Note: Lead Agencies are not prohibited from establishing policies that extend eligibility beyond 12 months to align program requirements. For example, Lead Agencies can allow children enrolled in Head Start, Early Head Start, state or local prekindergarten, and other collaborative programs to finish the program year. This type pf po licy promotes continuity for families receiving services through multiple benefit programs. In this section, Lead Agencies will identify how they define eligible children and families and how the Lead Agency improves access for vulnerable children and fami lies. This section also addresses the policies that protect working families and determine a family's contribution to the child care payment. 3.1 Eligible Children and Families At the time when eligibility is determined, children must (1) be younger than age 1 3; (2) reside with a family whose income does not exceed 85 percent of the State's median income for a family of the same size and whose family assets do not exceed $1,000,000 (as certified by a member of said family); and (3)(a) reside with a parent or pa rents who are working or attending a job training or educational program or (b) receives, or needs to receive, protective services and resides with a parent or parents not described in (3)(a.)

Please provide the Lead Agency's definition of \"protective services\": Protective services refe rs to children involved in the DC child welfare system, including children in the care of foster parents (including kinship families), children placed in protective supervision with their birth parents, and children of teen parents who are in foster care. All of the aforementioned individuals involved in the lives of children in the child welfare system share the need for quality child care to secure the necessary care and support for the child while they are working and/or pursuing job training or further education and to promote the child's overall positive development (The District does not use CCDF funds for respite care for children in protective services). Note: Federal requirements allow other vulnerable children identified by the Lead Agency not for mally in child protection to be included in the Lead Agency's definition of protective services for CCDF purposes. A Lead Agency may elect to provide CCDF -funded child care to children in foster care when foster care parents are not working or are not in education/training activities, but this provision should be included in the protective services definition above. ii. Are children in foster care considered to be in protective services for the purposes of eligibility at determination? No Yes iii.

Fill in the chart based on the most populous area of the state (the area serving the highest number of CCDF ch ildren). c) If the income eligibility limits are not statewide, describe how many jurisdictions set their own income eligibility limits and provide the income limit ranges across the jurisdictions (e.g. range from [lowest limit] to [highest limit])( 98.16(i) (3)). (a) ($/Month) 85% ($/Month) Maximum \"Entry\" Income Level if Lower Than 85% of Current SMI (IF APPLICABLE) (% of SMI) [Divide (c) by (a), multiply by 100] Income Level if Lower Than 85% of limits must be established an d reported in terms of current SMI based on the most recent data published by the Bureau of the Census (98.20(a)(2)(i)) even if the federal poverty level is used in implementing the program. SMI guidelines are available at: : https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/resource/liheap -im2017 source and year LIHEAP SMI Estimates FY2018 e) What was the date that these eligibility limits in column (c) became effective? 10-1-17 f) Provide th e citation or link, if available, for the income eligibility limits. https://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Common/DCMR/RuleList.aspx?ChapterNum=5 -A2 The District of Columbia Munici pal Regulations 5, Chapter 5A2 (5 5A2 DCMR \u00a7204) 3.1.4 Lead Agencies are required to ensure that children receiving CCDF funds do not have family assets that exceed $1,000,000, as certified by a family member (98.20(a)(2)(ii)). DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 52 a) Describe how the family member certifies that family assets do not exceed $1,000,000 (e.g., a checkoff on the CCDF application). The individual has to certify on the CCDF application that the family assets do not exceed $1,000,000. b) Does the Lead Agency waive the asset lim it on a case -by-case basis for families defined as receiving, or in need of, protective services? No. Yes. If yes, please identify the policy or procedure: 3.1.5 Describe any additional eligibility conditions or priority rules applied by the Lead Agency during eligibility determination or redetermination (98.20(b)). Priority groups have been established for purposes of continuing to enroll children if a wait ing list is in effect and for giving first opportunity for placement if there are more applicants than available funds. The implementing regulations of the CCDBG Act, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 98.46, require that the District of Columbia shall give priority for subsidiz ed child care services to: (1) Children of families with very low family income; (2) Children with special needs, including vulnerable children; and (3) Children experiencing homelessness. 3.1.6 Lead Agencies are required to take into consideration children's d evelopment and promote continuity of care when authorizing child care services (98.21(f); 98.16(h)(6)). Examples include partnering with Head Start, prekindergarten, or other high -quality programs to create a package of arrangements that accommodates paren t's work schedules; providing more intensive case management for families with children with multiple risk factors; and including in the eligibility determination process a question about whether a child has an Individualized Education Program or Individua l Family Service Plan. Describe the Lead Agency's policies and procedures that take into consideration children's development and learning and that promote continuity of care when authorizing child care services. - Child with Special Needs eligibility ca tegory -This group of applicants includes families with a child under the age of 19 who has a condition or characteristics that reflect a need for particular care, services or treatment, most commonly physical and/or mental disabilities and/or delays and i s evidence by an IFSP or IEP. - OSSE layers pre -k enhancement dollars with subsidy funds to provide a full day of care for eligible children enrolled in high quality pre -k programs - OSSE uses locally appropriated child care subsidy funds to support Early Head Start child care partners who are part of the Quality Improvement Network. These child care partners receive an increased daily reimbursement rate to provide continuous, comprehensive and intensive high quality care that meets Head Start State Performanc e Standards. 3.1.7 Graduated phase -out of assistance. DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 53 Lead Agencies are required to provide for a graduated phase -out of assistance for families whose income has increased above the state's initial income threshold at the time of redetermination but remains below the feder al threshold of 85 percent of the state median income. Providing a graduated phase -out promotes continuity by allowing for wage growth, allows for a tapered transition out of the child care subsidy program as income increases, and supports long -term self -sufficiency for families. Lead Agencies that establish initial family income eligibility below 85 percent of SMI must provide a graduated phase -out by implementing a two -tiered eligibility threshold, with the second tier of eligibility (used at the time of eligibility redetermination) to be set at: i. 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size ii. An amount lower than 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size but above the Lead Agency's initial eligibility threshold that: (A) Takes into account the typi cal household budget of a low -income family (B) Provides justification that the second eligibility threshold is: (1) Sufficient to accommodate increases in family income over time that are typical for low -income workers and that promote and support famil y economic stability (2) Reasonably allows a family to continue accessing child care services without unnecessary disruption. At redetermination, a child shall be considered eligible if his or her parents are working or attending a job training or educat ional program even if their income exceeds the Lead Agency's income limit to initially qualify for assistance as long as their income does not exceed the second tier of eligibility (98.21(a); 98.21(b)(1)). A family eligible for services via the graduated p hase -out of assistance is considered eligible under the same conditions as other eligible families with the exception of the copayment restrictions, which do not apply to a graduated phase -out. To help families transition off of child care assistance, Lead Agencies may gradually adjust copay amounts for families whose children are determined eligible under a graduated phase -out and may require additional reporting on changes in family income. However, Lead Agencies must still ensure that any additional repo rting requirements do not constitute an undue burden on families. a) Check and describe the option that best identifies the Lead Agency's policies and procedures regarding the graduated phase -out of assistance. N/A\u2014The Lead Agency sets its initial eligibilit y level at 85 percent of SMI and, therefore, is not required to provide a graduated phase -out period. The Lead Agency sets the second eligibility threshold at 85 percent of SMI. Describe the policies and procedures. The family remains eligible for 12 months. Exit Level: The exit level is set at the point where income equals 85 percent of the state median income (SMI) as constrained by 300% of the federal poverty level.

In addition to income and the size of the family, the Lead Agency may use other factors when determining family contributions/co -payments. Lead Agencies, however, may NOT use cost of care or amount of subsidy payment in determining copayments (98.45(k)(2)). Note: To help families transition off of child care assistance, Lead Agencies may gradually adjust co -pay amounts for families determined to be eligible under a graduated phase -out.

Describe: Other. Describe: 4 Ensure Equal Access to Child Care for Low -Income Children A core purpose of CCDF is to promote parental choice and to empower working pare nts to make their own decisions regarding the child care services that best suit their family's needs. Parents have the option to choose from center -based care, family child care or care provided in the child's own home. In supporting parental choice, the Lead Agencies must ensure that families receiving CCDF funding have the opportunity to choose from the full range of eligible child care settings and must provide families with equal access to child care that is comparable to that of non -CCDF families. Lea d Agencies must employ strategies to increase the supply and to improve the quality of child care services, especially in underserved areas. This section addresses strategies that the Lead Agency uses to promote parental choice, ensure equal access, and in crease the supply of child care. 4.1 Parental Choice in Relation to Certificates, Grants, or Contracts The parent(s) of each eligible child who receive(s) or is offered financial assistance for child care services has the option of either receiving a child car e certificate or, if available, enrolling his or her child with a provider that has a grant or contract for providing child care services (658E(c)(2)(A); 98.30(a)). Even if a parent chooses to enroll his or her child with a provider who has a grant or cont ract, the parent will select the provider, to the extent practicable. If a parent chooses to use a certificate, the Lead Agency shall provide information to the parent on the range of provider options, including care by sectarian providers and relatives. L ead Agencies must require providers chosen by families to meet DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 70 health and safety standards and has the option to require higher standards of quality. Lead agencies are reminded that any policies and procedures should not restrict parental access to any ty pe of care or provider (e.g. center care, home care, in -home care, for -profit provider, non -profit provider or faith -based provider, etc.) (98.15 (a)(5)). 4.1.1 Describe the child care certificate, including when it is issued to parents (before or after the pare nt has selected a provider) and what information is included on the certificate (98.16 (q)). The child care admission form is issued to a family after they have selected a provider. When a family has been determined to meet all eligibility criteria and pla cement has been made, the eligibility staff issue an admission form to the parent(s) or guardian(s) with instructions to have it completed by the selected provider. The provider then returns the admission form to the Department of Human Services (DHS), Chi ld Care Services Division (CCSD) to confirm the child has been accepted and payment for child care services will be authorized. The provider must enter the date the child started at the facility and sign and date the form. The provider returns the admissio n form via email to the Intake and Continuing Services Unit, DHS CCSD within 24 hours after the child is enrolled at the facility. The admission form includes the following information - Type of Care (Traditional or Non -traditional - Child's Name - Parent/Guard ian - Beginning Date - Child Care Provider - Payment (Provider/Parent - Type of Placement - Eligibility Worker's contact information - Customer's Signature 4.1.2 Describe how the parent is informed that the child certificate allows the option to choose from a variety of child care categories, such as private, not -for-profit, faith -based providers; centers; FCC homes; or in -home providers (658E(c)(2)(A)(i); 658P(2); 658Q).

Describe: Restricted to in -home providers that meet additional health and safety requirements beyond those required by CCDF. Describe: In home provider must complete health and safety training. Other. Describe: 4.2 Assessing Market Rates and Child Care Costs Lead Agencies have the option to conduct a statistically valid and reliable (1) market rate survey (MRS) reflecting variations in the price to parents of child care services by geographic area, type of provider, and age of child and/or (2) an alternative met hodology, such as a cost estimation model (658E(c)(4)(B)). A cost estimation model estimates the cost of care by incorporating both data and assumptions to model what expected costs would be incurred by child care providers and parents under different cost scenarios. Another approach would be a cost study that collects cost data at the facility or program level to measure the costs (or inputs used) to deliver child care services. The MRS or alternative methodology must be developed and conducted no earlier than 2 years before the date of submission of the Plan. Note - Any Lead Agency considering using an alternative methodology, instead of a market rate survey, is required to submit a description of its proposed approach to its ACF Regional Child Care Progra m Office for pre -approval in advance of the Plan submittal (see https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/resource/ccdf -acf-pi-2016 -08). Advance approval is not required if the Lead Agency plan s to implement both a market rate survey and an alternative methodology. In its request for ACF pre -approval, a Lead Agency must: Provide an overview of the Lead Agency's proposed approach (e.g., cost estimation model, cost study/survey, etc.), including a description of data sources. Describe how the Lead Agency will consult with the State's Early Childhood Advisory Council or similar coordinating body, local child care program administrators, local child care resource and referral agencies, organizations representing child care caregivers, teachers and directors, and other appropriate entities prior to conducting the identified alternative methodology. DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 73 Describe how the alternative methodology will use methods that are statistically valid and reliable and w ill yield accurate results. For example, if using a survey, describe how the Lead Agency will ensure a representative sample and promote an adequate response rate. If using a cost estimation model, describe how the Lead Agency will validate the assumption s in the model. If the proposed alternative methodology includes an analysis of costs (e.g., cost estimation model or cost study/survey), describe how the alternative methodology will account for key factors that impact the cost of providing care \u2014such as: staff salaries and benefits, training and professional development, curricula and supplies, group size and ratios, enrollment levels, licensing requirements, quality level, facility size, and other factors. Describe how the alternative methodology will pro vide complete information that captures the universe of providers in the child care market. Describe how the alternative methodology will reflect variations by provider type, age of children, geographic location and quality. Describe how the alternative me thodology will use current, up -to-date data. Describe the estimated reporting burden and cost to conduct the approach. 4.2.1 Please identify the methodology(ies) used below to assess child care prices and costs. MRS Alternative methodology. Describe: OSSE is up dating its 2015 Cost Estimation Model that was developed in consultation with nationally recognized early childhood finance experts. The model included the cost of delivering services at each level of the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System QR IS) in center and home -based settings that serve children of varying ages and needs. Capital Quality, DC's re -designed Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) will include four levels of quality: developing, progressing, quality and high quality. The goals of the alternative methodology are: 1) identify the fiscal impact of the DC licensing and QRIS standards; 2) identify key cost drivers that cut across all QRIS levels; 3) carefully explore differential costs between programs that serve primarily (or exclusively) infants and toddlers and those that serve primarily (or exclusively) three - and four -year old children; and 4) use this information to test a range of alternative rate -setting and policy recommendations with a clear understanding of the fiscal impact of these decisions. Both. Describe: 4.2.2 Prior to developing and conducting the MRS or alternative methodology, the Lead Agency is required to consult with the (1) State Advisory Council or other state - or state -designated cross -agency body if t here is no SAC, local child care program administrators, local child care resource and referral agencies, and other appropriate entities and (2) organizations representing caregivers, teachers, and directors prior to developing and conducting the MRS or al ternative methodology. Describe how the Lead Agency consulted with the: DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 74 a) State Advisory Council or other state -designated cross -agency body: On April 5, 2018, prior to requesting ACF approval of an alternative methodology, OSSE DEL consulted with and receiv ed support to submit this request by the District of Columbia State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council (\"SECDCC\"), established by D.C. Official Code \u00a7 38 -271.07. b) Local child care program administrators: c) Local child care resource and referral agencies: The child care resource and referral agency is a member of the SECDCC d) Organizations representing caregivers, teachers, and directors: OSSE consulted with more than 100 child development programs at the Child Care Leaders' Summit and Networking Event on April 28, 2018 and will also consult with the local DC Association for the Education of Young Children and the DC Family Child Care Association. e) Other. Describe: 4.2.3 Describe how the market rate survey is statistically valid and reliable. To be considered valid and reliable, the MRS must represent the child care market, provide complete and current data, use rigorous data collection procedures, reflect geographic variations, and analyze data in a manner that captures other rel evant differences. For example, market rate surveys can use administrative data, such as child care resource and referral data, if they are representative of the market. If an alternative methodology, such as cost modeling, is used, demonstrate that the me thodology used reliable methods. The District used a cost modeling approach in 2015 that was developed and tested by national experts Anne Mitchell of the Alliance for Early Childhood Finance and Andrew Brodsky of Brodsky Research, and Augenblick, Palaich and Associates (APA), a leader in education finance. These leaders worked collaboratively with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Child Care through the support of the National Center on C hild Care Quality Improvement and the Child Care State Systems Specialist Network to build the Provider Cost of Quality Calculator (PCQC), a dynamic, web - based tool that calculates the cost of quality child care based on site -level provider data. For the 2 018 cost estimation model, OSSE DEL will carefully review the data used to inform cost assumptions in the 2015 model to ensure it accurately reflects the providers' current experience. For example, OSSE DEL overhauled the regulations governing the licensin g of facilities in Dec. 2016, so those assumptions must be updated (i.e. group sizes or ratios) in the 2018 cost estimation model. Additionally, in 2015, the interactive model used the Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS), the District's three tier ed-rate reimbursement framework, to estimate the cost of quality in both child development centers and homes. However, with the migration to Capital Quality, DC's redesigned QRIS, beginning Oct. 1, 2018, the 2018 cost estimation model must reflect Capital Quality's four tier levels: (1) High -Quality, (2) Quality, (3) Progressing, and (4) Developing. Finally, the 2018 cost estimation model would need to account for recently promulgated subsidy payment rate increases. DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 75 4.2.4 Describe how the market rate survey or a lternative methodology reflects variations in the price or cost of child care services by: a) Geographic area (e.g., statewide or local markets). Describe: N/A - the District of Columbia has only one geographic area b) Type of provider. Describe: The 2015 cos t estimation model demonstrated there is a gap between the cost of producing quality of a given level, and the revenue sources available to support a particular type of provider. Knowing the size of the gap at different quality levels, and for various prov ider types, informed the subsidy reimbursement rates, design of financial incentive packages, and supportive policies to encourage financial sustainability. For the 2018 cost estimation model, OSSE DEL will carefully review the data used to inform cost ass umptions in the model to ensure it accurately reflects the providers' current experience. For example, OSSE DEL overhauled the regulations governing the licensing of facilities in Dec. 2016, so those assumptions must be updated (i.e. group sizes or ratios) in the 2018 cost estimation model c) Age of child. Describe: As with the approved 2015 cost estimation model, the 2018 cost estimation model will continue to provide complete information that captures the universe of providers in the child care market and reflect variations in the cost structure along relevant dimensions, including provider type, age of children, provider quality, income mix of enrolled children and needs of the children served. d) Describe any other key variations examined by the market rate survey or alternative methodology, such as quality level. In 2015, the interactive model used the Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS), the District's three tiered -rate reimbursement framework, to estimate the cost of quality in both child d evelopment centers and homes. However, with the migration to Capital Quality, DC's redesigned QRIS, beginning Oct. 1, 2018, the 2018 cost estimation model will reflect Capital Quality's four tier levels: (1) High -Quality, (2) Quality, (3) Progressing, and (4) Developing. Finally, the 2018 cost estimation model would need to account for recently promulgated tiered subsidy payment rate increases. 4.2.5 After conducting the market rate survey or alternative methodology, the Lead Agency must prepare a detailed report containing the results of the MRS or alternative methodology. The detailed report must also include the estimated cost of care (including any relevant variation by geographic location, category of provider, or age of child) necessary to support (1) child care providers' implementation of the health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements and (2) higher quality care, as defined by the Lea d Agency using a quality rating and improvement system or other system of quality indicators, at each level of quality. The Lead Agency must make the report with these results widely available no later than 30 days after completion of the report, including posting the results on the Lead Agency website. The Lead Agency must describe in the detailed report how the Lead Agency took into consideration the views and comments of the public. DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 76 Describe how the Lead Agency made the results of the market rate survey or alternative methodology report widely available to the public (98.45(f)(1)). The Final Report will be disseminated through the Division of Early Learning Bulletin with over 2,000 subscribers and placed on the Lead Agency's website 30 days after it is published. a) Date of completion of the market rate survey or alternative methodo logy (must be no earlier than July 1, 2016, and no later than July 1, 2018). June 15, 2018 b) Date the report containing results was made widely available \u2014no later than 30 days after the completion of the report. July 15, 2018 c) Describe how the Lead Agency made the detailed report containing results widely available and provide the link where the report is posted. d) Describe how the Lead Agency considered stakeholder views and comments in the detailed report. 4.3 Setting Payment Rates The Lead A gency must set CCDF subsidy payment rates, in accordance with the results of the current MRS or alternative methodology, at a level to ensure equal access for eligible families to child care services that are comparable with those provided to families not receiving CCDF funds. The Lead Agency must re -evaluate its payment rates at least every 3 years. 4.3.1 Provide the base payment rates and percentiles (based on the most recent MRS) for the following categories below. If the Lead Agency conducted an MRS (only or in combination with an alternative methodology), also report the percentiles based on the most recent MRS. The ages and types of care listed below are meant to provide a snapshot of the categories on which rates can be based and are not intended to be comp rehensive of all categories that might exist or to reflect the terms used by the Lead Agency for particular ages.

Part-time care is defined as less than 6 hours per day, and full -time care is defined as 6 -11 hours per day. j) Provide th e effective date of the current payment rates (i.e., date of last update based on most recent MRS). October 1, 2017 k) Provide the citation or link, if available, to the payment rates. http://dcrules. elaws.us/dcmr/5 -a203 l) If the payment rates are not set by the Lead Agency for the entire state/territory, describe how many jurisdictions set their own payment rates (98.16(i)(3)). N/A 4.3.2 Lead Agencies can choose to establish tiered rates, differentia l rates, or add -ons on top of their base rates as a way to increase payment rates for targeted needs (i.e., a higher rate for special needs children as both an incentive for providers to serve children with special needs and as a way to cover the higher co sts to the provider to provide care for special needs children). Check and describe the types of tiered reimbursement or differential rates, if any, the Lead Agency has chosen to implement. In the description of any tiered rates or add -ons, at a minimum, i ndicate the process and basis used for determining the tiered rates, including if DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 78 the rates were based on the MRS and/or an alternative methodology, and the amount of the rate. Check all that apply. Differential rate for non-traditional hours . Describe: The base rate for full -time non - traditional care for an infant is $60.83 per day. This differential rate was informed by OSSE's 2012 market rate survey and its 2016 cost estimation model. Differential rate for children with special needs , as defined by the state/territory. Describe: The base rate for children with special needs (infant and toddler) is $77.78 per day. This differential rate was informed by OSSE's 2016 cost estimation model. Differential rate for infants and toddlers . Describe: OSSE employs a tiered rating structure for infants and toddlers based on the quality of the child care facility, facility type (center or home), and service type (full -time, part -time, non -traditional, extended day). Differential rate for school -age progr ams. Describe: OSSE employs a tiered rating structure for school age programs based on the quality of the child care facility, facility type (center or home), and service type (full -time, part -time, non -traditional, extended day). Differential rate f or higher quality , as defined by the state/territory. Describe: Child care providers who meet NAE YC accreditation standards receive gold tier reimbursement rates. Infant and toddler gold rate for full -time traditional care at a child development center i s $65.07. Additionally, child care providers (home and centers) who participate in the Quality Improvement Network receive a QIN rate for the provision of high -quality care that meets Early Head Start standards. The rate for a QIN eligible child enrolled in a center is $83.75 per day for infants and toddlers and the home QIN rate is $65.07 per day for enrolled infants and toddlers. With the migration to Capital Quality, DC's redesigned QRIS, beginning Oct. 1, 2018, the tiered reimbursement will reflect Capital Quality's four tier levels: (1) High -Quality, (2) Quality, (3) Progressing, and (4) Developing. Other differential rates or tiered rates. Describe: Besides full -time traditional, part - time traditional, and non -traditional, OSSE employs tiered reimbursement rates for extended day full -time (base rate for infant and toddler care is $53.55 per day) and extended day part -time ( base rate for infant and toddler care is $34.07 per day). Tiered or differential rates are not implemented. 4.4 Summary of Facts Used To Determine That Payment Rates Are Sufficient To Ensure Equal Access 4.4.1 Lead Agencies must certify that CCDF payment rates a re sufficient to ensure equal access for eligible families to child care services comparable to those provided by families not receiving CCDF assistance (98.16(a)). Certify that payment rates reported in 4.3.1 are sufficient to ensure equal access by provi ding the following summary of facts (98.45(b)): a) Describe how a choice of the full range of providers pursuant to 98.30(e)(1) is made available; the extent to which child care providers participate in the CCDF system; and any barriers to participation, incl uding barriers related to payment rates and practices The Lead Agency has a full range of for -profit, non -profit and faith -based licensed providers that accept the child care subsidy vouchers. Additionally, over half of our DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 79 licensed child development faci lities (centers and homes) participate in the subsidized child care program. b) Describe how payment rates are adequate and have been established based on the most recent MRS or alternative methodology Based on the results of the cost estimation model an d increased local funding: \u00b7 In FY17, OSSE raised the toddler rate to align with the current licensing group size and ratios for toddlers because the cost estimation model revealed infants and toddlers were the most expensive children to serve; \u00b7 In FY17, OSSE added a rate for the Quality Improvement Network (\"QIN\"), which utilizes a shared -services framework that supports comprehensive services, coaching, and professional development for a network of centers and homes, to better align with the Head Start Program Performance Standards the QIN facilities are required to meet; \u00b7 In FY18, OSSE increased the infant and toddler rate for centers across each tier by four percent and for homes across each tier by approximately 10 percent. T he cost estimation model found that infants and toddlers were the most expensive children to serve, in both homes and centers due to lower adult to child ratio requirements, but the homes saw a greater increase because the cost estimation model revealed th at homes experience more difficulty in maintaining financial sustainability; \u00b7 In FY18, OSSE increased the infant and toddler special needs rate for bronze, silver, and gold centers by 10 percent because the cost estimation model revealed that even with a higher subsidy reimbursement rate for children with special needs, child development centers that specialize in care for children with special needs incur significant losses. Specifically, the cost model estimation showed that the revenue gap betwe en a gold center and a gold center serving children with special needs was significant, because the higher level of care requires more support and additional resources, such as the need for additional teaching staff and support staff with specialized crede ntials; and \u00b7 In FY18, OSSE added a Shared Services Reimbursement rate because the cost estimation model found that larger centers could be more financially stable by increasing the number of children that a center served as the administrative cost s would be spread across many classrooms. Accordingly, the cost modeling suggested that linking a network of homes or centers by a shared administration, or a shared -services framework, could provide similar financial stability. c) Describe how base payment rates enable providers to meet health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements under CCDF The District 's Cost Estimation model accounts for staffing requirements, professional development, and health and safety requirements d) Describe how the Lead Agency took the cost of higher quality into account, including how payment rates for higher -quality care, as defined by the Lead Agency using a QRIS or other system of quality indicators, relate to the estimated cost of care at each level of quality The Lead Agency increased rates twice in the past two years, using information from the Cost Esti mation Model. THe CEM estimated the cost of care at each QRIS tier level, for homes and centers, using a variety of scenarios (facility size, existence of pre -k classrooms, caregiver salaries) and rates were increased based on this information within avail able resources. e) How co -payments based on a sliding fee scale reported in 3.4.1 are affordable (response provided in 3.4.6) A new sliding fee scale was implemented effective October DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 80 1, 2017. This new scale was based on 2016 Federal Poverty Guidelines (an update from 2009). There is no co -pay assessed for families that fall at or below 100 percent of the FPL, and copays start at two percent of a family's income and the highest copay is eight percent of income. Co -pays are assessed on the two youngest children. f) Describe h ow Lead Agencies' payment practices described in 4.5 support equal access to a range of providers Providers are paid based on a child 's monthly attendance, including 5 unexcused absences per month. Children are also allowed fifteen excused absences per month, with supporting documentation. The Lead Agency is exploring alternative payment practices that may be more provider -friendly, such as paying based on enrollment rather than attendance, or contracting for subsidized slots. g) Describe how and on what factors the Lead Agency differentiates payment rates. Check all that apply. Geographic area. De scribe: N/A Type of provider. Describe: Child care provider payment rates are differentiated by home or center and licensed, relative and in -home care Age of child. Describe: Child care provider payment rates are differentiated by the age of the child: infant and toddler (6 weeks to 2 years 11 months), pre - school (ages 3 and 4), and school age (age 5 through 12 years 11 months) Quality level. Describe: Child care provider payment rates are differentiated by the quality tier rating assigned i n the QRIS program. Other. h) Describe any additional facts that the Lead Agency considered in determining its payment rates to ensure equal access: Payment rates are set at the 75th percentile or higher of the most recent survey. Describe: Feedbac k from parents, including parent surveys or parental complaints. Describe: Other. Describe: 4.5 Payment Practices and the Timeliness of Payments Lead Agencies are required to demonstrate that they have established payment practices applicable to all CC DF child care providers that include ensuring the timeliness of payments by either (1) paying prospectively prior to the delivery of services or (2) paying within no more than 21 calendar days of the receipt of a complete invoice for services. To the exten t practicable, the Lead Agency must also support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences by (1) paying based on a child's enrollment rather than attendance, (2) providing full payme nt if a child attends at least 85 percent of the authorized time, (3) providing full payment if a child is absent for 5 or fewer days in a month, or (4) using an alternative approach for which the Lead Agency provides a justification in its Plan (658E(c)(2 )(S)(ii); 98.45(l)(2)). Lead Agencies are required to use CCDF payment practices that reflect generally accepted payment practices of child care providers who serve children who do not receive CCDF - funded assistance. Unless a Lead Agency is able to demonst rate that the following policies are not generally accepted in its particular state, territory, or service area or among DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 81 particular categories or types of providers, Lead Agencies must (1) pay providers based on established part -time or full -time rates rat her than paying for hours of service or smaller increments of time and (2) pay for reasonable, mandatory registration fees that the provider charges to private -paying parents (658E(c)(2)(S); 98.45(l)(3)). In addition, there are certain other generally acce pted payment practices that are required. Lead Agencies are required to ensure that child care providers receive payment for any services in accordance with a payment agreement or an authorization for services, ensure that child care providers receive prom pt notice of changes to a family's eligibility status that could impact payment, and establish timely appeal and resolution processes for any payment inaccuracies and disputes (98.45(l)(4) through (6); 658E(c)(2)(S)(ii); 98.45(l)(4); 98.45(l)(5); 98.45(l)( 6)). 4.5.1 Certify by describing the payment practices that the Lead Agency has implemented for all CCDF child care providers, a) Ensure the timeliness of payments by either (Lead Agency to implement at least one of the following): Paying prospectively prior to the delivery of services. If implemented describe the policy or procedure. Paying within no more than 21 calendar days of the receipt of a complete invoice for services. If implemented describe the policy or procedure. Invoices are due by the fifth business day of the month for services rendered the previous month and pay ments are issued the last week of the month. b) To the extent practicable, support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences by: Paying based on a child's enrollment rather than attenda nce. If implemented describe the policy or procedure. Providing full payment if a child attends at least 85 percent of the authorized time. If implemented describe the policy or procedure. Providing full payment if a child is absent for 5 or fe wer days in a month. If implemented describe the policy or procedure. Per OSSE policy, providers are paid for five unexcused absences and 15 excused absences each month. No documentation is required to support the unexcused absences. Excused absences mus t be accompanied by a doctor's note submitted with the monthly invoice Use an alternative approach for which the Lead Agency provides a justification in its Plan. If chosen, please describe the policy or procedure and the Lead Agency's justification f or this approach. c) Reflect generally accepted payment practices of child care providers who serve children who do not receive CCDF subsidies, which must include the following two practices unless the Lead Agency provides evidence that such practices a re not generally accepted in its state (658E(c)(2)(S); 98.45(l)(3)). DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 82 Paying on a part -time or full -time basis (rather than paying for hours of service or smaller increments of time). Describe the policy or procedure and include a definition of the ti me increments (e.g., part time, full -time). Children are assigned to full -time or part -time traditional, extended day, or non -traditional services, depending on need for care. Hours are as follows: Full Time Traditional: between 6 and 11 hours of care Part Time Traditional: less than 6 hours of care Extended Day Full Time Extended Day Part Time Non -Traditional Full Time Non -Traditional Part Time Paying for reasonable mandatory registration fees that the provider charges to private -paying parents. Describe the policy or procedure. Child care providers are only able to charge parents the co -payment established by the lead agency and any late fe es incurred by parents/guardians who do not pick their children up on time. The provider is not allowed to collect any other fees from the parent/guardian, and collection of fees will result in the termination of the subsidized child care agreement. OSSE w ill explore the feasibility of including mandatory registration fees and field trip fees in its payment policies and practices for providers. d) The Lead Agency ensures that providers are paid in accordance with a written payment agreement or an authorization for services that includes, at a minimum, information regarding provider payment policies, including rates, schedules, any fees charged to providers, and the dispute -resolution process. Describe: All child care providers who participate in the subsidized child care program sign an annual agreement. The agreement details the following: General requirements for the provision of care and fina ncial management requirements Attendance reporting and payment policies Reimbursement rates Sliding Fee Scale for parent co -payments Payment reconciliation and error reporting process for incorrect payments received QRIS requirements e) The Lead Agency prov ides prompt notice to providers regarding any changes to the family's eligibility status that could impact payments, and such a notice is sent no later than the day that the Lead Agency becomes aware that such a change will occur. Describe: f) The Lead Agency has a timely appeal and resolution process for payment inaccuracies and disputes. Describe: The Agreement for Subsidized Child Care details the policies and procedures for dispute resolution and appeals. If informal dispute resolution attempts ar e unsuccessful, providers are able to submit a written statement and the DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 83 Assistant Superintendent of Early Learning will render a decision within 30 days. The provider may appeal the decision within 15 days. The Superintendent has 30 days to reconsider an d render a new decision. 4.5.2 Do payment practices vary across regions, counties, and/or geographic areas? No, the practices do not vary across areas. Yes, the practices vary across areas. Describe: 4.6 Supply -Building Strategies To Meet the Needs of Certain Populations Lead Agencies are required to develop and implement strategies to increase the supply of and to improve the quality of child care services for children in underserved areas; infants and toddlers; children with disabilities, as defined by the Lead Agency; and children who receive care during non -traditional hours (658 E(c)(2)(M); 98.16 (x)). 4.6.1 For each of the following types of providers, identify any shortages in the supply of quality child care providers, the data sources used to identify shortages, and the method of tracking progress to support equal access and parental choice. a) Children in underserved areas: OSSE will use its community needs assessment to track progress. b) Infants and toddlers: A Child Care Supply and Demand Study, funded by a private foundation, will be published in May 2018. Preliminary results indicated a significant shortage of infant and toddler slots throughout the District. This study will be used to prioritize facility expansion funding through OSSE's Access to Quality Child Care Expansion grant. c) Children with disabilities (include the Lead Agency definition in the description): Children with disabilities have special needs that are defined as c onditions or characteristics of a child under the age of 19 that reflect a need for particular care, services or treatment, most commonly physical and/or mental disabilities and/or delays and is evidenced by Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) or Individ ualized Education Program (IEP). OSSE 's community needs assessment will be used to determine if there is a shortage of supply. The child care resource and referral agency will support the lead agency in tracking progress. d) Children who received care during non -traditional hours: The Lead Agency has contracted with a national organization to conduct an analysis of the supply and demand for non -traditional hour care. The report will be available in July 2018 and will be used to inform our strategy. e) Other.

N/A b) Describe how the Lead Agency prioritizes increasing access to high -quality child care and development services for children of families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and that do not have high -quality programs. OSSE has set a goa l of increasing by 1,000 the number of quality slots available for infant and toddler care across the District. Through the Lead Agency's public private partnership with the Bainum Foundation, the QIN expanded in March 2018 to three additional centers serv ing 94 children in wards 7 and 8, our wards with the highest concentration of poverty and unemployment. In 2017 the Bainum Foundation established a $4.5 million Early Learning Quality Fund to ensure the development of 750 high quality infant and toddler sl ots in wards 7 and 8. Furthermore, the grantee managing OSSE's Access to Quality Child Care Expansion grant, will increase the supply of quality infant and toddler supply in the city by 1,000 by September 2020 with at least 50 percent of sub -granted amoun ts to improve supply for infants and toddlers eligible for subsidy. 5 Establish Standards and Monitoring Processes To Ensure the Health and Safety of Child Care Settings Lead Agencies are required to ce rtify that there are in effect licensing requirements applicable to child care services in the state/territory. States and territories may allow licensing exemptions, but they must describe how such exemptions do not endanger the health, safety, and develo pment of CCDF children in license -exempt care. Lead Agencies also must certify that there are in effect health and safety requirements applicable to providers serving CCDF children. These health and safety requirements must be appropriate to the provider s etting and age of the children served, must include specific topics and training on those topics, and are subject to monitoring and enforcement procedures to ensure that providers are complying with the health and safety requirements. This section covers licensing requirements, health and safety requirements and training, and monitoring and enforcement procedures to ensure that child care providers comply with licensing and health and safety requirements (98.16(n)) as well as exemptions (98.16(l)). This se ction also addresses group size limits; child -staff ratios; and required qualifications for caregivers, teachers, and directors (98.16(m)). Criminal background check requirements are included in this section (98.16(o)). 5.1 Licensing Requirements DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 86 Each state/t erritory must certify it has in effect licensing requirements applicable to all child care services provided within the state/territory (not restricted to providers receiving CCDF funds) and provide a detailed description of these requirements and how the requirements are effectively enforced (658E(c)(2)(F)). If any types of CCDF providers are exempt from licensing requirements, the state/territory must describe those exemptions and describe how these exemptions do not endanger the health, safety, or develo pment of children. The descriptions must also include any exemptions based on provider category, type, or setting; length of day; and providers not subject to licensing because the number of children served falls below a Lead Agency -defined threshold and a ny other exemption to licensing requirements (658E(c)(2)(F); 98.16(u); 98.409(a)(2)(iv)). 5.1.1 To certify, describe the licensing requirements applicable to child care services provided within the state/territory and note if providers are exempted from licensin g requirements and how such exemptions do not endanger the health, safety, and development of children (658E (c)(2)(F); 98.40(a)(2)). \"A licensed Child Development Facility\" is any person or persons, or entity or organization, whether organized formally o r informally that provides care, education, and other services, supervision, and guidance for more than two (2) infants, toddlers, and children that are not related, on a regular basis. \"Child Development Facility\" or \"Facility\" Development Facility\" does not include a public or private elementary or secondary school engaged in legally required educational and rel ated functions or a pre -kindergarten education program licensed pursuant to the Pre -k Act \"Child Development Center\" or \"Center\" means a Child Development Facility located in premises other than a dwelling occupied by the operator of the Facility that ser ves more than twelve (12) children.

Describe: 6.3 Early Learning and Developmental Guidelines 6.3.1 States and territories are required to develop, maintain, or implemen t early learning and developmental guidelines that are appropriate for children in a forward progression from birth to kindergarten entry (i.e., birth -to-three, three -to-five, birth -to-five), describing what children should know and be able to do and cover ing the essential domains of early childhood development. These early learning and developmental guidelines are to be used statewide and territory -wide by child care providers and in the development and implementation of training and professional developme nt (658E(c)(2)(T)). The required essential domains for these guidelines are cognition, including language arts and mathematics; social, emotional, and physical development; and approaches toward learning (98.15(a)(9)). At the option of the state/territory, early learning and developmental guidelines for out -of-school time may be developed. Note: States and territories may use the quality set -aside, discussed in section 7, to improve on the development or implementation of early learning and developmental gu idelines. a) Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines are research -based, developmentally appropriate, culturally and linguistically appropriate, and aligned with kindergarten entry. The current edition of the District of Columbia (DC) Common Core Early Learning Standards is a response to the evolution of the standards movement in early childhood education throughout the country. The DC Early Learning Standards show the continuum of learning and development expected of all young children, from birth through kindergarten exit. They include alignment with the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics (2010). They are also aligned with The Head Start Child Development and Early Learning Framework (2 010), thus ensuring that all children will receive the same standards - based instruction regardless of program auspices. DC is currently in the process of enhancing the current standards to reflect the updated Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework (2 015). These updated standards will also incorporate Next Generation Science Standards, integrated arts and will address dual language learners. b) Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines are appropriate for all children from birth to kindergarten entry. The DC Common Core Early Learning Standards are research -based and intentionally broken down by age - levels appropriate for the growth and development continuum. Those age levels include infants, toddlers, twos, preschoole rs, pre -K exit expectations and K exit expectations to ensure developmentally appropriate practice (DAP) and standards by DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 182 subject. \"Developmentally Appropriate Practice is an approach to teaching grounded in the research on how young children develop and l earn and in what is known about effective early education.

Check all that apply. Cognition, including language arts and mathematics Social development Emotional development Physical development Approaches toward learning Other. Describe: Social studies, scientific inquiry and the arts. d) Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines are implemented in consultation with the educational agency and the State Advisory Council or other state or state -designated cro ss-agency body if there is no SAC. a) DC is currently in the process of reviewing its early learning standards and will engage the State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC) for input prior to submitting recommendations to the Sta te Board of Education for the board's consideration. These guidelines are implemented by ensuring that providers utilize curricula aligned with the DC Common Core Early Learning Standards. Additionally, professional development is offered to ensure that pr oviders are comfortable with utilizing their curriculum to implement the standards. The primary purpose of the Early Learning Standards is to ensure that children in the District of Columbia have the kinds of rich and robust early experiences that prepare them for success in school and for lifelong learning, as well as catering to the diverse needs of various populations. To achieve this goal, the Early Learning Standards should be used as a resource for guiding the selection and implementation of the curri culum; a focus for discussion by families, community members, and legislators around the education of young children; a guide for selecting assessment tools appropriate for children from a variety of backgrounds with differing abilities; a guide for planni ng experiences and instruction that enable children to make progress in meeting the standards; and a framework for planning professional development opportunities. e) Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines are updated a nd include the date first issued and/or the frequency of updates. a) The DC Common Core Early Learning Standards were originally adopted in 2012. In May 2017, a process to review the standards was launched with a goal of considering additions in key a reas to better align with the Head Start Early Learning Framework, Next Generation Science Standards, arts integration and to address the needs of dual language learners. Several stakeholders, including individuals from local education agencies, national a gencies, federal agencies, child care providers and experts working with the WestEd Mid Atlantic Comprehensive Center. Once the enhanced standards are drafted, they will be shared with the SECDCC and the State Board of Education for their consideration and for the Board's review. The Division of Early Learning will DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 183 continue to review and revise the standards based on best practices and research in the field. f) Provide the Web link to the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines. https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/publication/attachments/DC%20E arly%20Learning%202015.pdf 6.3.2 CCDF funds cannot be us ed to develop or implement an assessment for children that: Will be the primary or sole basis to determine a child care provider ineligible to participate in the CCDF, Will be used as the primary or sole basis to provide a reward or sanction for an indivi dual provider, Will be used as the primary or sole method for assessing program effectiveness, Will be used to deny children eligibility to participate in the CCDF (658E(c)(2)(T)(ii)(I); 98.15(a)(2)). Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines are used. . These guidelines are implemented by ensuring that providers utilize curricula aligned with the DC Common Core Early Learning Standards. Additionally, professional development is offered to ensure that providers are comf ortable with utilizing their curriculum to implement the standards. The primary purpose of the Early Learning Standards is to ensure that children in the District of Columbia have the kinds of rich and robust early experiences that prepare them for success in school and for lifelong learning. To achieve this goal, the Early Learning Standards should be used as a resource for guiding the selection and implementation of the curriculum; a focus for discussion by families, community members and legislators arou nd the education of young children; a guide for selecting assessment tools appropriate for children from a variety of backgrounds with differing abilities; a guide for planning experiences and instruction that enable children to make progress in meeting the standards; and a framework for planning professional development opportunities. 6.3.3 If quality funds are used to develop, maintain, or implement early learning guidelines, describe the measureable indicators that will be used to evaluate the state/territory' s progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services and the data on the extent to which the state/territory has met these measures (98.53(f)(3)). The District of Columbia uses the Early Development Instrument (EDI), a population based m easure of school readiness that is completed by pre -K 4 teachers in the second half of the school year. The tool measures children's ability to meet age -appropriate developmental expectations in five general domains: physical health and wellbeing; social c ompetence; emotional maturity; language and cognitive development; and communication skills and general knowledge. The data is mapped to where children live and is shared broadly with the community through a partnership with Raise DC http://www.raisedc.org/ourchildren . Due to the breadth of information this assessment provides, OSSE is able to use this to inform broader system changes and provide sup port where it is needed the most. This tool was used for the first time in 2016 and will be administered every three years to examine risk factors and areas of support needed to ensure children meet developmental goals. In addition to the EDI, the Classro om Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) for Pre -K is used to assess pre -K classrooms and the Environment Rating Scales (ERS) are used to assess the DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 184 quality of infant and toddler classrooms, as well as family child care homes and expanded homes. The CLASS Pre -K and ERS assessments are used to assess program quality. 7 Support Continuous Quality Improvement Lead Agencies are required to reserve and use a portion of their Child Care and Development Fund program expenditures for activities designed to improve the q uality of child care services and to increase parental options for and access to high -quality child care (98.53). The quality activities should be aligned with a statewide or territory -wide assessment of the state's or territory's need to carry out such se rvices and care. States and territories are required to report on these quality improvement investments through CCDF in three ways: 1. In the Plan, states and territories will describe the types of activities supported by quality investments over the 3 -year period (658G(b); 98.16(j)). 2. ACF will collect annual data on how much CCDF funding is spent on quality activities using the expenditure report (ACF -696). This report will be used to determine compliance with the required quality and infant and toddler spen ding requirements (658G(d)(1); 98.53(f)). 3. For each year of the Plan period, states and territories will submit a separate annual Quality Progress Report that will include a description of activities to be funded by quality expenditures and the measures use d by the state/territory to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory (658G(d); 98.53(f)). States and territories must fund efforts in at least one of the following 10 activities: Supporti ng the training and professional development of the child care workforce Improving on the development or implementation of early learning and developmental guidelines Developing, implementing, or enhancing a tiered quality rating and improvement system f or child care providers and services Improving the supply and quality of child care programs and services for infants and toddlers Establishing or expanding a statewide system of child care resource and referral services Supporting compliance with state/t erritory requirements for licensing, inspection, monitoring, training, and health and safety (as described in section 5) Evaluating the quality of child care programs in the state/territory, including evaluating how programs positively impact children Supp orting providers in the voluntary pursuit of accreditation Supporting the development or adoption of high -quality program standards related to health, mental health, nutrition, physical activity, and physical development Performing other activities to impr ove the quality of child care services, as long as outcome measures relating to improved provider preparedness, child safety, child well-being, or kindergarten entry are possible. DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 185 Throughout this Plan, states and territories will describe the types of qual ity improvement activities where CCDF investments are being made, including but not limited to, quality set - aside funds and will describe the measurable indicators of progress used to evaluate state/territory progress in improving the quality of child care services for each expenditure (98.53(f)). This section covers the quality activities needs assessment and quality improvement activities and indicators of progress for each of the activities undertaken in the state or territory. 7.1 Quality Activities Needs Assessment for Child Care Services 7.1.1 Lead Agencies must invest in quality activities based on an assessment of the state/territory's needs to carry out those activities. Lead Agencies have the flexibility to design an assessment of their quality activities that best meet their needs, including how often they do the assessment. Describe your state/territory assessment process, including the frequency of assessment (658G(a)(1); 98.53(a)). OSSE has redesigned the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS), named Capital Quality, which also serves as a tiered rate reimbursement system. The redesigned QRIS, Capital Quality, provides a common measure of quality that will inform consumers and help target investments and planning in early childhood educa tion and care. This common measure of quality means that there is alignment across child development homes, child development centers and DC Public Schools and is focused on positive outcomes for children. The redesigned QRIS assesses quality based on the following assessments: Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale -Revised (ITERS -R); Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale -Revised (FCCERS -R); Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) Pre -K; and Attendance of pre -K (three - and/or four -year -old) childr en. These assessments are conducted annually, and two years of data is collected before early childhood development facilities are rated under Capital Quality. The first ratings under Capital Quality will occur in fall/winter 2018. Once baseline data is a ssessed, OSSE will review quality activities and supports that best meet the needs of early childhood development centers and homes in the District. In addition to the formal classroom assessments, monthly feedback is collected in reference to the monthly community of practice meetings and the support received from the quality facilitator. This information also informs the supports that Capital Quality providers receive. 7.1.2 Describe the findings of the assessment and if any overarching goals for quality impr ovement were identified. OSSE, as the lead agency is using these results to inform our strategies, investments and the support we provide to the providers in terms of training, professional development and supplies/resources. OSSE has collected CLASS Pre -K data 2013. Most recently, the results indicated the following: DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 186 The vast majority of DC's pre -K classrooms exceeded the threshold for quality in Emotional Support and Classroom Organization domains and show opportunities for growth and improvem ent in Instructional Support. CBOs with at least one classroom receiving Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion funding received higher Instructional Support scores than CBOs that are not in the Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion program. CBO teach ers with bachelor's or a master's degree in early childhood education, had better Emotional Support scores than CBO teachers without a degree, and CBO teachers with any degree (i.e., associate, bachelor's, master's or higher) had better Instructional Suppo rt scores than CBO teachers without a degree. DCPS teachers with a bachelor's degree in early childhood education had better Instructional Support scores than DCPS teachers without a degree in early childhood education. Pre-K programs across the District have generally experienced a trend of stable classroom quality over the past three years. Findings of the CLASS Pre -K and the Environment Rating Scales assessments will be evaluated upon the first ratings under the redesigned QRIS in fall/winter 2018. Once baseline data is examined, f loors and targets will be set and four tiers of quality will be assigned. Thus far, OSSE has learned that there are low instructional support scores across the board. This helps us target training and professional development specifically related to the DC Common Core Early Learning Standards and our newly implemented school readiness goals. Additionally, this assessment information provided insight into the current DC Common Core Early Learning Standards and the need to review and update them to ensure tha t they are aligned with national research, as well as the K -12 system. In addition to updating the DC Common Core Early Learning Standards and implementing the school readiness goals, these scores allow providers and Capital Quality, quality facilitators, to target individual provider needs. The program updates their continuous quality improvement plan and targeted technical assistance and support is provided. 7.2 Use of Quality Funds 7.2.1 Check the quality improvement activities in which the state/territory is inve sting.

Early post -award meetings cover the specific work to be done as well as provide a review of all of OSSE's financial and programmatic policies and procedures and relevant local and federal regulatio ns. Ongoing trainings and meetings are used to troubleshoot new issues as well as provide updates and / or reminders of information provided in the early post -award meetings. Tracking systems to ensure reasonable and allowable costs. Describe: OSSE has implemented the Enterprise Grants Management System (EGMS) for the fiscal management of grants. The system was designed to improve the management and administration of federal and local grants managed by OSSE. EGMS provides users with information on the sta tus of grant applications, awarded amounts, expenditures to date and payment status of pending reimbursements. EGMS offers sub-grantees more convenience with a centralized location to manage the following: Identification of and application to OSSE grants, submission of programmatic and / or fiscal amendments to the original application, and submission of electronic reimbursement requests with required supporting documentation. The system has enhanced operational efficiencies, security architecture, centr al data storage and warehousing, increased transparency, workflow automation and performance accountability. OSSE's grants management and program staff review monthly reimbursement requests in EGMS to determine that all expenses are aligned with the grant ees' scope of work and approved budget. Reimbursement requests are reviewed by two DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 12 -8-2017 DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 207 internal OSSE staff members to ensure costs are: being expended against the approved budget, and are allowable, reasonable, and allocable. These requests, alongside progra mmatic reports and onsite monitoring, provide a thorough review of the grantee's compliance with OSSE's approved programmatic application, work plan, and budget. Other. Describe: OSSE conducts annual onsite monitoring visits and program evaluations to sub -recipients. Each program maintains records on file fo r a minimum period of three years. These records must be accessible at all times for review upon request by officials from the District of Columbia Government or the Federal Government. On -site visits support efforts to maintain quality and ensure complian ce with OSSE grant and contractual agreements, inclusive of OSSE's internal policies and procedures, and relevant DC and Federal regulations. 8.1.3 Check and describe the processes that the Lead Agency will use to identify risk in their CCDF program.

The sub - grantee then submits requests for reimbursement, indicating the linkage to the budget and providing supporting documentation to substantiate that costs are allowable, reasonable and allocable. Two internal OSSE reviewers conduct a desk review of the reimbursement requests to confirm adherence to the budget and applicable federal cost principles, as previously outlined before approving them for payme nt. All rounds of submission and OSSE responses are recorded in the EGMS system. CCDF -funded contracts are managed in the electronic PASS system, which enables. Use supervisory reviews to ensure accuracy in eligibility determination. Describe: Eligibility determinations are conducted by the DC Department of Human Services (DHS) Child Care Services Division (CCSD) and designated child care providers (referred to as Level 2 providers). Eligibility determinations are reviewed and approved by the DHS CCSD su pervisor for new employees until the employee demonstrates proficiency in the determination process.
