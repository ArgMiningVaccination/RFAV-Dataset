Over the last 20 years, the Institute has received over $30 million in research funding from the National Institutes of Health along with private foundations. This research has primarily focused on cardiovascular health, cancer, and aging in underserved high-risk populations. Our Research Institute studies employ the most rigorous available research methods (especially randomized, controlled, and blinded clinical trials) for efficacy and mechanisms of effect. Our latest research findings have demonstrated: - The feasibility and efficacy of the Transcendental Meditation\u00ae Program in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors - Reductions in hypertension over short-term and long-term follow-up periods - Reduced need for antihypertensive medications Ongoing Collaborative Clinical Trials Ongoing trials include the effects of the TM\u00ae program on: - Physiological mechanisms of hypertension - Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality - Primary prevention of hypertension - Regression of atherosclerosis (coronary artery disease) - Pathophysiological mechanisms of coronary heart disease - Comparisons with other behavioral modalities in cardiovascular disease - Quality of life and survival rates in breast cancer patients - Neurophysiology, cognitive development and health in college students Our Media Coverage The results of this groundbreaking research have been published in more than 100 articles in authoritative medical journals and proceedings, and featured in more than 1,000 television, radio, magazine, and newspaper reports, including: - ABC's 20/20 - CNN Headline News - Fox News - New York Times - Washington Post - Newsweek - Wall Street Journal - Time magazine. Our People Robert H. Schneider, MD, F.A.C.C., is a physician, scientist, educator, and one of the world's leading authorities on scientific, natural approaches for heart disease, high blood pressure, stress and other cardiovascular risk factors. Over the past twenty years, he has directed nearly $20 million in research grants from the National Institutes of Health for his pioneering research on natural approaches to heart disease. Policy Statement Issued by the American Heart Association According to the American Heart Association, the Transcendental Meditation technique is the only meditation practice that has been shown to lower blood pressure. According to the AHA,* \"Because of many negative studies or mixed results and a paucity of available trials, all other meditation techniques [including Mindfulness] received a 'Class III, no benefit, Level of Evidence C' recommendation. Thus, other meditation techniques are not recommended in clinical practice to lower BP at this time.\" [More about the statement from the "}
