McDOWELL III (Mr. M CINTYRE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute.) Mr. M CINTYRE. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I recognizethe gentleman who is today's guestchaplain, the Reverend C.F. McDowell,III, who just offered our prayer. A native of Greensboro, North Caro- lina, Reverend McDowell currentlyserves as executive vice president ofSpecial Ministries for the Baptist Chil-dren's Homes of North Carolina. He is immensely involved in commu- nity, civic and church-related activi-ties, and he has served the citizens ofNorth Carolina through his decision,dedication, and determination. He is a man of decision who has pro- vided support and guidance to many,including myself, and many others inmany communities throughout NorthCarolina. He is a man of dedication who has provided a positive example for all tofollow and whose hope he shares withmany, especially young people andchildren, now in his current position. Finally, he is a man of determination who understands that we face chal-lenges every day, not only as families,but also as a Nation, challenges thatwill define our future. Reverend McDowell is one of those special folks that provides advice andguidance to those seeking answers tolife's most difficult questions and prob-lems. Mr. Speaker, Reverend McDowell has spent his entire life serving people. Soit was very appropriate today that hecame from North Carolina to join ushere in the people's House to provide uswith keen insight, a man of decisionCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7006 July 26, 2000 and dedication and determination who is, indeed, I am sure my colleagues willagree, his words in his prayer offeredup to God have blessed us and will blessus in this day of decision and dedica-tion and determination for all of us andfor America. f ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will receive 15 one-minutespeeches on each side. f TAX RELIEF WILL HELP THE AMERICAN FAMILY (Mr. GIBBONS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, today is just another typical Wednesday for theaverage hard-working American familybecause, Mr. Speaker, millions of hard-working people will punch a time cardat work in order just to put food on thetable and clothes on the back of theirchildren. Yet, every day, the IRS takes far more than its fair share out of the av-erage American's paycheck. The continual greed of a bloated and inefficient Washington bureaucracy isbeing financed on the back of hard-working Americans. Mr. Speaker, by providing meaning- ful tax relief, parents will not have tospend their extra time at a second jobto make ends meet. Instead, thesehard-working parents will have moretime to spend with their kids or to lendtime to their elderly family members. Tax relief can bring about a family renewal. I am proud to be a part of a Repub- lican Congress dedicated to helpingAmerican families by keeping Wash-ington in check, balancing the budget,paying off the national debt, protectingSocial Security, strengthening Medi-care, and reducing taxes on every hard-working American. Thank you and Iyield back. f PALESTINIANS NEVER MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MISS AN OP-PORTUNITY (Mr. LANTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, as has happened so often before, the Palestin-ians never miss an opportunity to missan opportunity. The President and the Secretary of State may be constrained by diplo-matic protocol, but those of us in thisHouse who follow these events are not.This summit collapsed because YasirArafat refused to budge. I pay hightribute to the President and his team.I pay high tribute to Prime MinisterBarak, who has gone way beyond any-thing that anybody could rationally expect in terms of compromise and giv-ing. I deplore that Egypt and Saudi Ara- bia again encourage the most intran-sigent position possible on Arafat. Today, I am introducing legislation that would terminate all aid to thePalestinian Authority if a unilateraldeclaration of independence should beforthcoming. Such a declaration wouldmean new violence, and we cannot beparty to it. I encourage all of my col-leagues to join me. f BORN ALIVE INFANTS PROTECTION ACT (Mr. PITTS asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, ever since Roe v. Wade, Americans have debatedthe question, When does life begin?Some of us believe it starts at concep-tion, others at viability, and others,amazingly, not until birth. But once a baby has been born, ev- eryone agrees life has begun, and thisbaby is a new human being with all hisor her God-given rights. Well, what was once obvious seems to have been called into question lately.The Supreme Court shocked Americarecently by ruling that States may notban partial birth abortions. Now we arehearing stories of children being bornalive in abortion clinics and then leftto die. H.R. 4292, the Born Alive Infants Pro- tection Act, codifies in law that, once ababy is born, it is legally alive. Unbe-lievably, the National Abortion RightsAction League and their allies call thisa renewed assault on Roe. What theyreally mean to say is that, when a doc-tor botches an abortion and the child isborn alive, the doctor should still havethe right to kill it. How far we havefallen, Mr. Speaker? f INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION (Mr. LAMPSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute.) Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, this weekend I brought together inter-national leaders at a luncheon in Lon-don to discuss the problem of inter-national parental child abduction. Thisis an issue that touches families every-where and an issue, to be solved, needsto be addressed everywhere. The lunch-eon was very productive, and I hopethat it will lead to action by my for-eign counterparts. National boundariesare no barrier to the transportationand victimization of children. Today, there is no enforceable global system to attack and address this prob-lem. Despite legal, law enforcement,and diplomatic mechanisms, manycases are not identified. Many childrenare not recovered. Many children whoare located are not returned to theircountry of origin due to legal and pro- cedural problems. This situation causesanger, outrage, and pain for searchingparents around the world. Unless urgent and rapid action is taken, more and more children will bedenied their most basic right, that ofhaving access to both parents. Thechallenge is now to find commitmentat both national and international lev-els to implement these actions. Familydisputes and divorce will never goaway. Parental child abduction, how-ever, must be eradicated. f OPPOSITION TO H.R. 4892, SCOUTING FOR ALL ACT (Mr. BUYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, the Su- preme Court has ruled that the BoyScouts of America, as a private organi-zation, has the right to set its ownstandards for membership and leader-ship. This allows the Scouts to con-tinue developing young men of strongmoral character without imposing themores on them that they find abhor-rent. Would my colleagues like a view of extremist liberal Democrats who seekto control this House? They have fileda bill to revoke the Boy Scouts Federalcharter, a blatant attempt to under-mine the Supreme Court's ruling andpunish the Boy Scouts for their belief. This bill promotes intolerance. The Boy Scouts respect other people's rightto hold differing opinions than theirown and ask others to respect their be-lief. Extremist Democrats believe justthe opposite. They believe that if onedoes not subscribe to their beliefs andtheir view of the world, then one is in-tolerant and must be chastised. These liberal Democrats are in error. Tolerance does not require a moralequivalency. Rather, it implies a will-ingness to recognize and respect the be-liefs of others. The Boy Scouts are a model of inclu- siveness. Today, boys of every ethnic,religious, and economic background,including those with disabilities andspecial needs, participate in Scoutingprograms across America. I urge my colleagues to vote against this extremist measure promoted byliberal Democrats. f ACCIDENTAL HOSPITAL DEATHS ARE HIGHER THAN ACCIDENTALGUN DEATHS (Mr. TRAFICANT asked and was given permission to address the Housefor 1 minute and to revise and extendhis remarks.) Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, acci- dental deaths caused by doctors andhospitals in America reached 120,000per year. Meanwhile, gun deaths havedropped 35 percent. In fact, accidentalgun deaths dropped to 1,500 last year. Think about it. We have got hos- pitals slicing and dicing American peo-ple like Freddie Kruger, and CongressCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7007 July 26, 2000 is passing more gun laws. Beam me up. There is something wrong in Americawhen one is 80 times more likely to be killed by a doctor than Smith &Wesson. Think about it, 80 to 1. Maybewe need a gun in surgery. I yield back the fact that the second amendment was not written to coverjust duck hunters. f GORE SENIOR TAX POLICY (Mr. STEARNS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute.) Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, the Aus- trian philosopher Karl Krauss oncewrote, ``When the end comes, I want tobe living in retirement.'' Many Americans in this country feel that way. They put in countless hoursanticipating the day when they will re-tire. Unfortunately, the Clinton-Goreadministration sees these benefits as aprime opportunity to grab more moneyfor the Federal Government. In 1993, the Clinton-Gore administra- tion decided to tax up to 85 percent ofthe Social Security benefits receivedby single seniors whose incomes were$34,000, and married taxpayers, seniors,with incomes exceeding $44,000. Worse yet, Mr. Speaker, because these incomes were not indexed for in-flation, the tax effects were more dra-matic every year for our seniors. This week the House will vote to end this burdensome tax and give seniors awell-deserved tax break. Seniors havepaid their fair share of taxes. It is timewe repeal the Clinton-Gore seniors'tax. f VETERANS RIGHT TO KNOW ACT (Mr. PASCRELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to commend this body forpassing two pieces of legislation yes-terday that enhance the benefits of ourveterans, H.R. 4850 and H.R. 4864. Itdoes not matter how many benefits weprovide our veterans if they do notknow what they are entitled to. Throughout our Nation's history, millions of men and women haveserved in our Armed Forces duringtimes of peace and times of war. Theyhave defended the very freedoms ourcountry was founded upon. Too often our Nation's heroes are not adequately informed about what theirbenefits are and what they are entitledto. This is simply unacceptable. We have introduced H.R. 3256, the Veterans Right to Know Act; and ifanyone has a right to know, our vet-erans have a right to know. The Vet-erans Right to Know Act requires theSecretary of VA to prepare an annualoutreach plan that will include effortsto identify veterans who are not other-wise enrolled or registered with the De-partment for benefits or services. It enjoys the bipartisan support of 72 House members. Veterans have servedthis country. We are accountable to our veterans, and we are going to de-liver. f MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY RELIEF DESERVES SUPPORT (Mr. WELLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. WELLER. Mr. Speaker, have you heard Bill Clinton and A LGORE's latest definition of rich? Bill Clinton and A L GORE say that, if one is married and one is a homeowner or if one is marriedand one gives money to church andcharity and one suffers the marriagetax penalty, one is rich. Bill Clinton and A LGORE say now that they want to veto the MarriageTax Elimination Act, legislation whichwipes out the marriage tax penalty for25 million married working coupleswho, on average, pay $1,400 more inhigher taxes. They say that there arepeople that are homeowners, there arepeople that give money to church andcharity, and there are people thatitemize their taxes, and because ofthat, they are rich, and they do not de-serve marriage tax relief, and theyshould be discriminated against andshould continue to receive and sufferfrom the marriage tax penalty. I was so proud when this House passed just this past week legislationwiping out the marriage tax penaltyfor 25 million married working couples,on average, $1,400. We made sure, if onesuffers the marriage tax penalty,whether one is a homeowner or not,one receives relief. It deserves bipar-tisan support. I hope the President willchange his mind. f b1015 GOP ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland asked and was given permission to addressthe House for 1 minute and to reviseand extend his remarks.) Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, nothing we do in Congress canbe accomplished alone. Today I want tothank my colleagues on both sides ofthe aisle who have worked to make the106th Congress' record one of accom-plishments and not of partisan grid-lock. This Congress has passed some of the most solid education reform everbrought before this body, measuresthat will give parents and teachersmore flexibility to meet students'unique needs. But that is not all. Wehave also worked tirelessly to pay offour public debt portion of our nationaldebt which is saddling children bornthis year with a $13,300 debt burden.Our debt relief measures will save theaverage household an estimated $4,000in interest payments over the next 10years. Think of what American fami-lies can do with $4,000 in additional in-come.The 106th Congress has an agenda for success, and I am proud to be a part ofit. f BIG BROTHER IS READING OUR E- MAIL (Ms. M CKINNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute.) Ms. M CKINNEY. Mr. Speaker, al- though it is 16 years after the titleddate of 1984 in George Orwell's novel ofthe same name, Big Brother is reallyhere and now he is reading our e-mail.Our constitutional rights to privacyare currently being trampled by gov-ernment-sanctioned invasions cur-rently over at the FBI. These privacyinvasions use today's latest technologythrough the FBI's Carnivore systemwhich monitors and captures our e-mail without our consent or our knowl-edge. What business is it of the U.S. Gov- ernment what I say in an e-mail to myfamily and to my friends? We mustnever knowingly allow any governmentagency to use our e-mail to do to ustoday what they did with other tech-nologies to Malcolm X and Martin Lu-ther King yesterday. f SPACE STATION TEACHES COSTLY LESSON (Mr. DUNCAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, yester- day's lead front page story in theChristian Science Monitor newspaperwas headlined, ``Late, Costly Milestonefor Space Base.'' It was about theSpace Station and U.S. costs now ap-proaching $100 billion. When thisproject was first started in 1984, costprojections were only 6 to $8 billion.This is the old Washington con game:Drastically low ball the cost estimatesat the beginning, then spread theproject around to as many congres-sional districts as possible and it willnever end. As the well-respected Monitor point- ed out yesterday, ``The $96 billion sta-tion is 2 1\u00a42years behind schedule and costs are burgeoning,'' meaning stillgoing up. U.S. taxpayers have even hadto pay out an extra 3 to $5 billion tohelp the Russians participate. This Space Station will go down in history as the biggest boondoggle thisNation has ever produced. Mr. Speaker,it just goes to show once again that theFederal Government cannot do any-thing in an economical, cost-effectivemanner. f RECOGNIZING EL PASO VET CENTER (Mr. REYES asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1minute.) Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an outstanding institution inCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7008 July 26, 2000 my district, the Department of Vet- erans Affairs El Paso Vet Center whichhas served the veterans of west Texasand southern New Mexico for the last21 years. The center provides qualitycare to improve the lives of men andwomen who fought and defended ourNation's security and freedom. Theseservices are provided with incrediblecompassion and understanding.Through counseling, guidance and re-habilitation programs, the center is aninvaluable link between our veteransand the Department of Veterans Af-fairs. By reaching out to more than100,000 veterans in the El Paso area, thecenter makes an incredible differencein our community. It is veterans programs like this that deserve the full support and apprecia-tion of this institution. Abraham Lin-coln once said, ``Let us strive on to fin-ish the work we are in, to bind up theNation's wounds, to care for him whoshall have borne the battle and for hiswidow and his orphan.'' Wars indeed have left behind men and women who need our assistance. As wecelebrate the 25th anniversary of theend of the Vietnam War, I am proud torecognize the El Paso Vet Center, aninstitution that has continuously pro-vided assistance to our Nation's vet-erans in El Paso. f THE FLEECING OF UTAH PROPERTY OWNERS (Mr. HANSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. HANSEN. Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Constitution says that if the Govern-ment takes private property, the ownerof the property shall receive just com-pensation. In Washington County,Utah, the desert tortoise was put onthe endangered species list. Therefore,the U.S. Government required hun-dreds of acres of tracts for that habi-tat. About 30 taxpayers were involved.They did not want to give up theirground. They wanted to keep it. Butno, the Federal Government says,``We've got to take that ground for thishabitat.'' And they said, ``It's not tak-ing your ground.'' And then you ask, ``What is it tak- ing?'' ``Well,'' they say, ``you can keep your property but you can't put yourfoot onit. You can pay taxes on your property,but you can't use it. t we're not takingyour property.'' So the Federal Government offered about one-fourth of the value of theground. Now, is that fair? Is that just?Is that just compensation? I do notthink it is. Tom Brokaw of NBC does a program called The Fleecing of America. Heused this land issue saying these poortaxpayers fleeced the American Gov-ernment when they got it for thatprice. Well, he got it wrong, as thepress normally does. I am just amazedthat the media misses one so far. Whoreally got fleeced on this, Mr. Speaker? The people who got fleeced were thosepeople that gave up their ground forone-fourth of the value. f REPUBLICAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to addressthe House for 1 minute and to reviseand extend his remarks.) Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Democrats are runningscared. Their message of fear, classwarfare and big government has failedagain. Even their own focus groups andpolls tell them Americans want the Re-publican agenda of less taxes, less gov-ernment and local control. And who can blame them? Just listen to what the Republicans have accom-plished: we have created the longesteconomic expansion in America's his-tory, balanced the budget, paid downthe national debt, saved Medicare,locked away 100 percent of the SocialSecurity surplus, eliminated the SocialSecurity earnings penalty, and elimi-nated the marriage penalty and deathtax. That is just to name a few. The Democrats have attacked these accomplishments as risky. But I do notthink it is risky to give somethingback to the very Americans who madethis country great, the people. f ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. OSE).

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the previous order of the House, Icall up the joint resolution (H.J. Res.99) disapproving the extension of thewaiver authority contained in section402(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 with re-spect to Vietnam, and ask for its im-mediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The text of House Joint Resolution 99 is as follows: H.J. R ES. 99 Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America inCongress assembled, That Congress does notCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7010 July 26, 2000 approve the extension of the authority con- tained in section 402(c) of the Trade Act of1974 recommended by the President to Con-gress on June 2, 2000, with respect to Viet-nam.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Illinois? There was no objection. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan- imous consent that all Members mayhave 5 legislative days in which to re-vise and extend their remarks and toinclude extraneous material on H.J.Res. 99. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Illinois? There was no objection. b1100 Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 99 and in support of Viet-nam's Jackson-Vanik waiver. Over thepast decade, the United States hastaken gradual steps to normalize ourbilateral relations with Vietnam. Thisprocess has borne tangible results onthe full range of issues on our bilateralagenda including increased accountingof our missing in action, MIAs; sub-stantial progress on remaining immi-gration cases; and increased trade andinvestment opportunities for U.S. firmsand workers. The paramount issue in our bilateral relationship with Vietnam remains thefullest possible accounting of MIAs.Since 1993, 288 sets of remains of U.S.servicemen have been repatriated andfate has been determined for all but 41of 196 persons associated with lastknown-alive cases. Future progress in terms of the abil- ity of U.S. personnel to conduct exca-vations, interview eye witnesses andexamine archival items is dependentupon continued cooperation by the Vi-etnamese. On immigration, the central issue to the Jackson-Vanik waiver, more than500,000 Vietnamese citizens have en-tered the United States under the or-derly departure program in the past 10 to 15 years. As a result of steps takenby Vietnam to streamline its immigra-tion process, more than 98 percent ofcases in the resettlement opportunityfor Vietnamese returnees have beencleared for interview. Currently, Vietnam has agreed to help us reinstate a refugee program forformer U.S. Government employees. Earlier this month, the administra- tion concluded a bilateral trade agree-ment with Vietnam that will serve asthe basis for a reciprocal extension ofnormal trade relations once it is trans- mitted and approved by Congress. Thetrade agreement contains provisions onmarket access in goods, trade in serv-ices, intellectual property protectionand investment which are necessary forU.S. firms to compete in the Viet-namese market, the 13th most popu-lous in the world. Because Congress hasnot yet approved a bilateral agree-ment, the effect of the Jackson-Vanikwaiver at this time is quite limited, en-abling U.S. exporters doing business inVietnam to have access to U.S. tradefinancing programs, provided thatVietnam meets the relevant programcriteria. At this time, I would insert into the R ECORD a letter I received from over 40 trade associations supporting Viet-nam's Jackson-Vanik waiver as an im-portant step in the ability of the U.S.business community to compete in theVietnamese market. July 19, 2000. Hon. P HILIP CRANE , U.S. Congress,Washington, DC. D EARREPRESENTATIVE CRANE : As members of the American business and agriculturalcommunity, we strongly support action tonormalize trade relations with Vietnam. Re-newal of the Jackson-Vanik waiver is a keystep in this process. We oppose H.J. Resolu-tion 99, which would overturn the waiver,and urge you to vote against the resolutionwhen it comes to the floor Wednesday, July26, 2000. Renewal of the Jackson-Vanik waiv-er will ensure that U.S. companies and farm-ers exporting to Vietnam will maintain ac-cess to critical U.S. export promotion pro-grams, such as those of the U.S. Export-Im-port Bank, the Overseas Private InvestmentCorporation, and agricultural and maritimecredit programs. Ultimately, the Jackson-Vanik waiver, plus the bilateral trade agree-ment, will lead the way for normal trade re-lations, enabling American companies andproducts to compete effectively with Euro-pean and Asian companies and products inthe Vietnamese market. Important progress in the bilateral rela- tionship has been made this year. The agree-ment on trade relations between the U.S.and Vietnam has just been successfully con-cluded, paving the way to full normalizationof trade relations. The bilateral trade agree-ment, which addresses issues relating totrade in goods and farm products, trade inservices, intellectual property rights and for-eign investment, creates more open marketaccess, greater transparency and lower tar-iffs for U.S. exporters and investors in Viet-nam. Also this year, the Ex-Im Bank framework agreements, which allow Ex-Im to open oper-ations in Vietnam, were concluded and OPICmade its first loan to a U.S. company inVietnam. In March Secretary of Defense Wil-liam Cohen became the first U.S. Defense Secretary to visit Vietnam in 25 years. The American business and agricultural community believes that a policy of eco-nomic normalization with Vietnam is in ournational interest. Last year, the House de-feated the resolution of disapproval on Jack-son-Vanik by a vote of 297 to 130. We urgeyou to support the renewal of the Jackson-Vanik waiver this July as an important stepin the normalization process. We stand ready to work with Congress to- wards renewal of the Jackson-Vanik waiverfor Vietnam, which will help American busi-nesses and farmers reach this importantmarket.

Although the practical effect of Viet- nam's Jackson-Vanik waiver is smallat this time, its significance is that itpermits us to stay engaged with Viet-nam and to pursue further reforms onthe full range of issues on the bilateralagenda. Terminating Vietnam's waiver will give Vietnam an excuse to halt furtherreforms. I ask my colleagues not totake away our ability to pressure theVietnamese for progress on issues ofimportance to the United States and Iurge a no vote on H.J. Res. 99. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McNULTY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that half of mytime be yielded to the gentleman fromCalifornia (Mr. R OHRABACHER ) and that he be permitted to allocate that timeas he sees fit. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. O SE). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7011 July 26, 2000 Mr. M CNULTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of joint resolution 99, which disapproves thePresident's determination to waive theJackson-Vanik freedom of informationrequirement for Vietnam. Others willpoint out that this debate is not aboutextension of normal trade relationswith Vietnam but rather about themore limited issue of whether Vietnamshould be eligible to participate in U.S.credit and credit-guaranteed programs. Technically, Mr. Speaker, that is cor- rect. However, I think we all know thatthis debate is about something muchmore important. As I said last year,Mr. Speaker, I do not oppose the even-tual normalization of relations withVietnam, but I do oppose declaringbusiness as usual while the remains ofAmerican servicemen are still being re-covered. According to the Department of De- fense, we are receiving newly discov-ered remains on a fairly frequent basis.As recently as June 3, last month, Mr.Speaker, the possible remains of threeAmerican military personnel were re-covered. Can we not wait until thisprocess is completed? Mr. Speaker, on August 9, 1970 my brother, HM3 William F. McNulty waskilled in Vietnam. He was a Navy med-ical corpsman transferred to the Ma-rines. He spent his time patching uphis buddies, and one day he stepped ona land mine and lost his life. That wasa tremendous loss for our family, and Ican tell my colleagues from personalexperience that while the pain maysubside it never goes away. There is a difference between what the McNulty family went through andwhat an MIA family goes through. Be-cause Bill's body was returned to us,we had a wake and a funeral and a bur-ial. What we had, Mr. Speaker, was clo-sure. I can only imagine what the fam-ily of an MIA has gone through overthese past several decades. Mr. Speaker, until there is a more complete accounting of those missingin action, this waiver should not begranted. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan- imous consent that the gentlemanfrom Louisiana (Mr. J EFFERSON ) be al- lowed to yield further time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Michigan? There was no objection.Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 99. I support the President'sdecision to waive the Jackson-Vanikprohibitions with respect to Vietnamfor an additional year. This action takes place against a backdrop of bitter relationships in thepast with Vietnam. Memories of thoseyears remain, and appropriately so. Over the past 5 years, the U.S. has gradually been reengaging with Viet-nam. In 1994, we lifted the comprehen- sive embargo that had been in placesince 1975. In 1995, we reopened theAmerican Embassy in Hanoi. In 1998,the President decided to waive theJackson-Vanik prohibitions. This bodysupported that decision with decisivemargins. Each of these steps was a longtime in evolving. Each responded topositive developments in Vietnam. No-tably, the government of Vietnam hasimproved cooperation in the locationof U.S. servicemen and women missingin Vietnam, and there has been im-provement in the administration ofprograms to facilitate the resettlementof Vietnamese wishing to immigrate. We must be clear concerning what to- day's vote is about, and what it is notabout. Today we simply vote on whether to approve or disapprove the Jackson-Vanik waiver for Vietnam for an addi-tional year. Approving the waiver willcontinue the availability of export-re-lated financing from OPIC, Ex-ImBank, and the Department of Agri-culture. Disapproving the waiver willcut off those sources of financing withan impact on U.S. exports, ourbusinesspeople and our workers. Ap-proving the waiver will not extendmost favored nation status to goodsand services from Vietnam. Importsfrom Vietnam will remain subject torestrictive tariffs until the Congressapproves a bilateral trade agreement. Two weeks ago, our country did, in fact, sign a trade agreement with Viet-nam, negotiated over a period of 4years. However, that agreement is notbefore the House today. When thePresident eventually submits it for ap-proval, we will have to give carefulconsideration to a number of issues, in-cluding the extent of Vietnam's com-mitments, the extent to which it is im-plementing its commitments, our abil-ity to monitor and enforce those com-mitments and Vietnam's compliancewith international standards in areasincluding labor and the environment. Fully normalizing relations with Vietnam is a long-term task. It re-quires us to work with Vietnam, in-cluding through the provision of tech-nical assistance. For now, we must pre-serve the forward momentum that hasdeveloped over the past 6 years. To cutoff programs now would be to pull outthe rug from under U.S. producers ofgoods and services. In short, let us keep intact the groundwork upon which a meaningfuland enduring relationship hopefullycould be built. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 99. The American peopleand our colleagues should listen care-fully to this debate. What is it about?It is about trade subsidies. It is abouta subsidy by the American people, thetaxpayers of American businessmenthat want to invest in Vietnam. Invest- ing in Vietnam? That does not meanselling American products in Vietnam.That means setting up manufacturingunits in Vietnam to take advantage ofthe fact that that country is a brutaldictatorship that does not permitunions, that does not permit strikes,and thus there is virtual slave laborthere at a cheap price. Do we really want to give taxpayer subsidies and encourage Americanbusinessmen to close factories in theUnited States and open them up totake advantage of that type of market?That is immoral. It is immoral againstthe people of Vietnam and it is againstthe well-being of our own people. Weare sinning against our own people byproviding subsidies for our business-men to close up operations here andopen up there in a dictatorship. It has been 2 years, Mr. Speaker, since President Clinton issued the firstJackson-Vanik waiver for Vietnam.Each year we have been assured by thisadministration and by our ambassadorto Hanoi that this action would lead togreater political openness and pros-perity for the Vietnamese people and abetter economic climate for Americaninvestors so they would not need thosesubsidies. Unfortunately, the exact op-posite has happened. As The Washington Post stated on May 3, Vietnam remains a one-partystate, rampant with corruption that re-tards foreign investment, and the Com-munist party fears more openness tothe outside world could bring in morepolitical heterodoxy for which theparty shows zero tolerance, end ofquote. In a recent Human Rights Watch, re- ports link the ongoing persecution ofdissidents and religious believers inVietnam to the pervasive economic andpolitical corruption in that country.There is no free press in Vietnam. Allinformation is controlled by the state.Radio Free Asia broadcasts are jammedroutinely. The repeated promises by Hanoi of economic reform have been no morecredible than their pledges in 1973 atthe Paris Peace Agreement that theCommunist violence against the peopleof South Vietnam would end and thatthere would be peaceful elections rath-er than bombs in resolving that war. There is still not even the slightest hint of a free and fair election or oppo-sition parties in Vietnam. In that repressive government, it is hardly surprising that foreign inves-tors and businessmen are bailing out.They are bailing out, but let us comeby and save them. Let us use taxpayersubsidies and give them an encourage-ment to stay there in that corrupt andsupport that corrupt and undemocraticsociety, that tyrannical regime. b1115 As this panel is aware, the Jackson- Vanik provision primarily addressesthe issue of freedom of immigrationand migration for people who fear orCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7012 July 26, 2000 who have had the experience of perse- cution. The Vietnam Exit Permit sys-tem for immigration, including thelongtime reeducation camp survivors,Amer-Asians, Americans, Montagnardsand other people who have an interestin the United States of America, thatstate remains ripe for corruption.Many Vietnamese on the U.S. migra-tion list have not been able to come tothe United States because they couldnot afford to pay the bribes. Contrary to the claims that we have just heard here today, there has beenno progress in the MIA/POW issue.Hanoi has not even released therecords. This Member has repeatedly,and last year, I might add, I made thesame demand, but I have made thisover and over again: if you want toprove good faith to us, simply releasethe records that you have of the pris-ons that you held Americans in duringthe war. Just give us those records.How about giving us the records of thefacility that held our American ambas-sador, Pete Peterson. Just give usthose records so we can examine it tosee how many prisoners you really had.They have not given us those recordsafter repeated demands. That is a signof bad faith, and it is bad faith in thewhole MIA/POW effort. Mr. Speaker, my joint resolution dis- approving the President's waiver forthe corrupt Vietnamese dictatorshipdoes not intend to isolate Vietnam orto stop U.S. companies from doingbusiness there. It simply prevents theCommunist Vietnam regime from en-joying a trade status that enablesAmerican businessmen, now listen tothis, to make increasingly risky in-vestments with loan guarantees andsubsidies provided by the Americantaxpayer. Why are we giving this perverse in- centive for American companies toshut down their operations here oreven refrain from opening up oper-ations in countries that are strugglingto be democratic and instead, to investin dictatorships like Vietnam andChina. If private banks and insurancecompanies will not back up these pri-vate ventures, why should the Amer-ican taxpayer do that? American tax-payers should not be asked to do this. Rampant corruption and mismanage- ment, as well as the abuse of the mi-gration program, the lack of free tradeunions, the suppression of freedom ofexpression, and the persecution of dis-sidents and religious believers, theseare valid reasons to oppose the Jack-son-Vanik waiver, and also it is not inour interests to make sure the Amer-ican people are shortchanged by sub-sidizing investments in dictatorships. Mr. Speaker, we do no favors for the Vietnamese people or American inves-tors by again reflexively supportingthe President's bogus Jackson-Vanikwaiver. I propose that we get the Com-munists to give the Communist dic-tators in Vietnam to give a strong mes-sage from the United States Congressthat corruption, mismanagement andtyranny will no longer be tolerated, much less subsidized. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Our colleagues should have received a letter yesterday, in fact, and it wasinitiated by our distinguished col-league on the minority side, the gen-tleman from California (Mr. M ATSUI ), and the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.B EREUTER ) on ours; and in it it explains something, and there is one paragraphI would like to read to my colleagues:``At this time, Vietnam's waiver onlyallows that country to be reviewed forpossible coverage by U.S. trade financ-ing programs, such as those adminis-tered by the Overseas Private Invest-ment Corporation, OPIC; the Export-Import Bank, Exim; and the U.S. De-partment of Agriculture, USDA. Viet-nam is not automatically covered bythese programs as a result of its Jack-son-Vanik waiver.'' Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs.B IGGERT ). Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.C RANE ), chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade, for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution dis-approving the President's extension ofthe Jackson-Vanik waiver for Vietnam.Rejecting this resolution is especiallyimportant now that the United Statesand Vietnam have signed a bilateraltrade agreement which will allow Viet-nam in the future to gain NormalTrade Relations status renewable on anannual basis. But before that bilateralagreement is approved by Congress, wemust continue the process of normal-izing trade relations with Vietnamthat began when we ended our tradeembargo 6 years ago. Over these few years, good progress has been made. From its accounting ofU.S. POWs and MIAs, to its movementto open trade with the world, to itsprogress on human rights, Vietnam hastaken the right steps. Vietnam is notthere yet, but Vietnam is moving inthe right direction. Mr. Speaker, House Joint Resolution 99 is the wrong direction for us to taketoday. Who is hurt if we pass this reso-lution? We are. It is the wrong direc-tion for U.S. farmers and manufactur-ers who do not have a level playingfield when they compete with their Eu-ropean or Japanese counterparts inVietnam. It is the wrong direction forour joint efforts with the Vietnameseto account for the last remains of oursoldiers and to answer, finally, thequestions of their loved ones here. It isthe wrong direction for our efforts toinfluence the Vietnamese people, 65percent who were not even born whenthe war was being waged. Let us not turn back the clock on Vietnam. Let us continue to work withthem and, in doing so, teach the youth-ful Vietnamese the values of democ-racy, the principles of capitalism, and the merits of a free and open society. Mr. M CNULTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio(Ms. K APTUR ). Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me thistime, and I support the McNulty reso-lution to disapprove the extension oftrade waiver authority with Vietnam. Mr. Speaker, last year I supported the exact opposite position, in hopesthat there would be signs in Vietnamthat, in fact, that government wouldmove toward a more open society.There are no signs of that, and polit-ical repression continues. Talk to peo-ple who live here in the United Stateswho have relatives in Vietnam; manylive in the Washington area. What was even more troubling to me and the reason for this change in myown position, and I am not going to usethe person's name, but one of the twomost important Americans in charge ofshaping U.S. policy toward Vietnamwas speaking with me the other day;and I said, what are you going to doabout the treatment of workers inVietnam under this trade authority togive them dignity, whether they areworking for a U.S.-based company orsome other multinational working overthere? And this American said to me,oh, that is not a trade issue, that isprobably more cultural. That offendedme so much. Mr. Speaker, I think our government is on the wrong song sheet here. Weought to be for developing a civil soci-ety in Vietnam, beginning with human-itarian linkages, as our community istrying to do by helping build schoolsand clinics. We ought to be having edu-cational exchanges to teach peoplesomething about democracy-building.We ought to have family reunification.We ought to have arts and cultural ex-changes; but by golly, when top-rank-ing people from our own governmentfail to see that the basis of Jackson-Vanik is that political repression iswrong and this Nation ought to standup for liberty at every cost, we oughtto bring back those who are missing inaction and call the government of Viet- nam to task on that. But we need to support the McNulty resolution and deny the additional ex-tension, because it is in freedom's in-terests here and abroad. Mr. JEFFERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge support of the Jackson-Vanik waiver by voting noon H.J. Res. 99, to encourage progressby Vietnam on a host of issues impor-tant to the United States. It is undeniable that we have had a very troubled history with Vietnam,and we still have difficult issues. Thescars of the past, as we have seen evi-denced today, and this discussion runvery deep; and we could never forgetthose who sacrificed their lives in theservice of that country there. But isolating Vietnam will not heal these scars. Perhaps no one can speakCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7013 July 26, 2000 more authoritatively on that issue than one of our former colleagues, PetePeterson, who is here with us today.Pete Peterson was shot down flying his67th mission during the Vietnam Warand spent 6 1\u00a42years as a prisoner of war. After serving 6 years with us inthe U.S. House as a member of myclass in 1991, Pete Peterson returned toVietnam, this time as the first ambas-sador since the Communist takeover. It is Ambassador Peterson's remark- able optimism about the changes goingon in Vietnam, I believe, that sheds thegreatest light on what our policy to-ward Vietnam should be. So while seri-ous issues remain in our relationshipwith Vietnam, the dialogue with theVietnamese on a full range of issues isthe foundation on which those issuescan be resolved. For this reason, support for the Jack- son-Vanik waiver for Vietnam and a novote on this resolution is in our bestinterests, I believe. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, we have heard here that this really is not about taxpayer sub-sidy, because what we are doing todayonly makes possible that we will givetaxpayer subsidies to American busi-nessmen for closing factories here andopening up in this dictatorship inSoutheast Asia, Vietnam. The fact is, that is what this debate is all about, whether or not it shouldbe permitted for American companiesto receive these subsidies from theAmerican taxpayer that are not in theinterest of the American people so thatthey can go over and manufacturethings in Vietnam and then to exportthem back to the United States. Thatis what this is about, the same way itis about this in China in our China de-bate, and what the gentleman from Illi- nois (Mr. C RANE ) read confirms that. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21\u00a42minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.R OYCE ). Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I risetoday in support of the Rohrabacherresolution. Mr. Speaker, let me say that we have heard about the terrible human rightssituation in Vietnam; and sadly, let mesay it, in fact, is true. If we look at therights abolished by the socialist repub-lic of Vietnam, political freedoms aregone, all religious freedom is gone, eco-nomic freedom has been systematicallyabolished for the people there. Now, the State Department tells us that the Vietnamese governmentquote, ``maintains an autocratic one-party state that tolerates no opposi-tion.'' Earlier this year, I visited Viet-nam and I saw firsthand the Com-munist Party's harassment of those Vi-etnamese citizens who decide to peace-fully set forth dissenting political andreligious views. I visited several whowere under house arrest. Now, we can argue whether or not en- gagement best advocates freedom inVietnam. In fact, I believe engagement does. If done right, a two-track policyof engaging Vietnam on economic re-form, while pressuring it on its polit-ical and religious repression withRadio Free Asia and other means,promises to promote the freedom theVietnamese people have long sought. Trade in investment terms with Viet- nam, though, is not what this par-ticular piece of legislation addresses.Denying this waiver would not makeU.S. businesses any more or less free todo business in Vietnam. Approving thisresolution would simply disallow tax-payer dollars from being used to con-tinue subsidizing U.S. companies to dobusiness in Vietnam. The reforms theVietnamese government promises tomake in its trade agreement with theU.S. generally are comprehensive.They are comprehensive because thebusiness climate in Vietnam right nowis so bad. The Communist Party runsthe economy, making Vietnam ab-jectly poor, despite the talents anddrive of the Vietnamese people. Theeconomy is riddled with corruption, redtape, and cronyism. Mr. Speaker, the State Department says, U.S. businesses find the Viet-namese market is a tough place to op-erate. That is an understatement.American and European companies,which eagerly entered Vietnam a few years ago, are in retreat. If they wishto stay the course, that is their deci-sion; but we should not ask for a U.S.Government subsidy to do that. Mr. Speaker, we all hope that free- dom comes to Vietnam. Today we aredebating whether the U.S. Governmentsubsidies for American business is aconstructive way to promote this free-dom. I do not think that that case hasbeen made for Vietnam, or from anyother places, for that matter. I ask mycolleagues to support this resolution. Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I would re- mind our colleagues that OPIC and Ex-Im Bank help businesses in a majorityof countries around the globe; it is notconfined to Vietnam. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.G ILCHREST ). b1130 Mr. GILCHREST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding methis time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution from the gentlemanfrom California (Mr. R OHRABACHER ) and support the Jackson-Vanik waiver. In the 1870s, France colonized Viet- nam. From 1940 to 1945, the Japaneseand the French collaborated to oppressand colonize Vietnam. In 1945, Presi-dent Roosevelt sent an agent,Archemedis Patti of the OSS, the fore-runner of the CIA, to see what wasgoing on in Vietnam and what shouldhappen after World War II, which wasfought for self-determination aroundthe world. Archemedis Patti suggested that Ho Chi Minh was fighting for independenceagainst the French and the Japanese.Roosevelt died. Archemedis Patti persisted with President Truman.Throughout the 1950s, the OSS, whichturned into the CIA, recommended thatthe United States not become involvedin the Vietnam conflict because it wasa matter of a civil war and a matter ofa fight for independence. Now, I know the decisions were tough back then. In the 1940s and 1950s it wasCommunist expansion, China fell to theCommunist, there was a Korean Warand so on. But the United States gotinvolved in the conflict. I served inVietnam. I lost close friends in Viet-nam. I knew men who are still to thisday MIAs. I was proud to fight for thedemocratic process in the 1950s in Viet-nam. It is now 25 years later. The war vir- tually ended in 1975. The United Statesdoes have business interests around theglobe and in Vietnam. The UnitedStates does have humanitarian interestaround the world and in Vietnam. Wewill not lose sight of those humani-tarian interests regardless of what any-body says about cultural interests. So I highly recommend to my col- leagues that we vote against the gen-tleman from California (Mr. R OHR- ABACHER ), we stand firm in favor of the Jackson-Vanik waiver; and while we dothat, we salute Pete Peterson, the Am-bassador to Vietnam from the UnitedStates. Mr. M CNULTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas(Mr. G REEN ). (Mr. GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extendhis remarks.) Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 99 and op-pose the granting of the waiver forVietnam. Mr. Speaker, I do not believe Viet- nam has made significant improve-ments in allowing political express orreligious freedom. I intend to support today's resolution opposing the waiver of the Jackson-Vanik provisions of the 1974 Trade Act.The Communist government in Hanoistill clings to the belief that any formof individualism is a threat to theirgrip on power. Every year the House is asked to make exceptions to the countries whoconsistently oppress political dissentand religious freedom. When is theUnited States going to say enough isenough? I understand that we are here today because of the tremendous economicopportunities that are available inVietnam. I understand that. Vietnamhas the cheap labor and lax environ-mental regulations that we seem tofavor to produce our clothes and ourshoes. What would we get in return for waiving the Jackson-Vanik provisionsof the 1947 Trade Act? Are we going toget more help in locating our missingservicemen? The legacy of the VietnamWar will remain open and festeringwithout a higher level cooperationfrom the government in Hanoi.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7014 July 26, 2000 I hope that next year, if we repeat this process, the United States is notrunning a huge trade deficit with Viet-nam. Injecting large amounts of for-eign investment in Vietnam to bringabout social change is a flawed theory.We have been doing that with China foryears, and it still suppresses religiousexpression, and it still sells weapons tosome of the most unstable nations inthe world. It is interesting that the companies and businesses who are successful inour country because of the freedom ofindividualism and initiative want totake advantage of a society that sup-presses it to the point, and that is thevery reason that our society and ourgovernment is successful because, indi-vidually, we have the right to succeed. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. Mr. JEFFERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguishedgentleman from California (Mr.G EORGE MILLER ). (Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California asked and was given permission to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to thisresolution and in support of the con-tinuation of the Jackson-Vanik waiverfor Vietnam. Last year, 297 Members of the House voted against a disapproval waiver.Since that time, major steps have beentaken in many areas of greatest con-cern to the Congress and the Americanpeople with respect to issues betweenthe United States and Vietnam. The number of Vietnamese who have been able to leave the country to reset-tle in the United States has reachedmerely 16,000 in the first 6 months ofthis year compared to 3,800 2 years ago. Ambassador Pete Peterson, our former colleague, has declared that``Vietnam's cooperation on emigrationpolicy, the test issue for the Jackson-Vanik waiver, is exemplary.'' Close co-operation between our governments isalso continuing in the location, identi-fication, and the return of remains, andin resolving the remaining MIA ques-tions has been considerable. I had an opportunity to visit with our teams in the country that are seekingthese remains and going through thisintensive, arduous process. They willtell us the cooperation that they aregetting from the government now thatthey did not get before. The program isworking, not as fast as we would like,but the cooperation is in fact there. In reaching an accord with the United States on a comprehensivetrade agreement, which is not an issuebefore this Congress today, the govern-ment of Vietnam has also dem-onstrated that it is prepared to movein the direction of transparency, fairtrade, and a more open economy thatwill ultimately serve the people of thatnation well. Our continued waiver of Jackson- Vanik, which is strongly supported bya number of veterans organizations,has encouraged Vietnam to implement reforms that are needed to establishthe basic labor and political rights webelieve are critical. There is still muchroom for improvement, to be sure, onall of these fronts, on freedom of ex-pression, on religious freedom, on laborrights, on political rights; but the factof the matter is progress is being madebecause of this engagement. We should continue to encourage these reforms in Vietnam through ex-panded trade, labor, and educationalexchanges, again which are takingplace already; cooperation, environ-mental and scientific initiatives which,again, are already taking place. But weneed more of them. We need these ef-forts to build a stronger relationshipbetween the two countries to promotethe kind of open and democratic soci-eties we believe they have a right toenjoy. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, will the Chair please let me know whatthe time is remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. O SE). The gentleman from California (Mr. R OHRABACHER ) has 6 minutes re- maining. The gentleman from Lou-isiana (Mr. J EFFERSON ) has 8 minutes remaining. The gentleman from NewYork (Mr. M CNULTY ) has 81\u00a42minutes remaining. The gentleman from Illi-nois (Mr. C RANE ) has 7 minutes remain- ing. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, let us look again at the central issue. Nomatter how much people are trying todeny it, the central issue is whether ornot the American taxpayer should besubsidizing the investment by Amer-ican businesses, not to sell Americanproducts in Vietnam but to set up fac-tories in Vietnam, to take advantage oftheir, basically, slave labor, people whohave no right to form a union, peoplewho have no legal protections. Shouldwe subsidize with our taxpayers' dol-lars American businessmen that wantto go over there and exploit that mar-ket, closing factories in the UnitedStates, and then exporting theirproduce that they produced with thisslave labor back to the United States,again, competing with our own goodsmade by our own people? That is im-moral. Let us just say, yes, I agree with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. C RANE ). OPIC and Exim Bank, these are the ve-hicles that we use taxpayers' dollars tosubsidize this investment overseas.They do it with a lot of countries. Butwe should put our foot down here todayand say dictatorships should not re-ceive this kind of subsidy, especiallythe dictatorship in Vietnam that hasnot cooperated in finding our missingin action and POWS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, our distinguished col- league, Ambassador Pete Peterson, washere a moment ago. He is over here on the floor. I would like to recognizehim. He spent 6 years with us here inthe House. He spent 6 1\u00a42years in the Hanoi Hilton, and he is doing an out-standing job as our Ambassador inVietnam. He assures me that he hasthe records from the prison in which hewas held for 6 1\u00a42years. These records are now publicly available. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Arizona(Mr. K OLBE ). Mr. KOLBE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this House Joint Resolution 99. As aVietnam veteran, I empathize withmany of the arguments that I haveheard by some of the opponents to thiswaiver. I am concerned about the issueof emigration of Vietnamese from thatcountry. I also, of course, want a fullaccounting of our MIAs and POWs, andour ambassador has been working veryhard on achieving that. Of course I am concerned about reli- gious freedom and its state in a coun-try like Vietnam. But I disagree withthe proposed solutions that the otherside suggested as denying the Jackson-Vanik waiver for Vietnam does nothingto further the progress in any of theseareas. In fact, I believe it has just theopposite effect. Let us put this vote today in its his- torical perspective. It was 1991 thatPresident Bush proposed a road mapfor improving our relations with Viet-nam. To follow the road map, Vietnamhad to take steps to help us account forour missing servicemen. In return forthis cooperation, the United Statesagreed to move towards normalizingrelations in an incremental fashion. Progress has been made through the years in that. In 1994, a second step wastaken when President Clinton liftedthe trade embargo against Vietnam. In1995, in response to further reforms bythe Vietnamese, formal diplomatic re-lations were established between theUnited States and Vietnam. In 1998,President Clinton issued the first waiv-er for Vietnam under the Jackson-Vanik procedures. This waiver, whichwas approved by this House by a verysubstantial margin, made Americanproducts eligible for trade investmentprograms such as Ex-Im and OPIC. This year, an even more historic step was reached when the United Statesand Vietnam signed a bilateral tradeagreement which contained significantconcessions for the U.S. industry inVietnam. Now, this vote today is not going to provide us with all the benefits of theagreement, nor will it mean that wewill have normal trade relations withVietnam. That will require an addi-tional vote by Congress. But today'svote does send a message that Congresssupports the policy of continued en-gagement with Vietnam. I believe thathas helped us. I urge a no vote on this resolution.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7015 July 26, 2000 ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair wishes to remind all Membersthat references to the presence on thefloor of non-Members during debate isnot appropriate. Mr. M CNULTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. S ANCHEZ ). Ms. SANCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.M CNULTY ) for yielding me this time. As the Congresswoman who rep- resents the largest Vietnamese-Amer-ican population in the United States inOrange County, California, this Jack-son-Vanik is about the immigrationissue and the reunification of the fami-lies, the Vietnamese-American familiesthat we have here in our country. We have gone through the process. Our State Department has allowed thatthese members of families come to theUnited States, and then they run into aproblem. The problem is that the cor-rupt government of Vietnam chargesbribes of about $2,000 to try to get anexit for each person who is trying tocome here to the United States to bewith their family members. Well, when one considers that the household income in Vietnam is $300 ayear, $2,000 is not an easy amount toget one's hands on to get one's exitvisa so that one can come here and bewith one's family after our State De-partment says, in fact, one should andcan be here in the United States. So on the issue of immigration, the government of Vietnam has not held upits end. But in addition to that, whyshould we, the United States, help agovernment that is so against humanrights? The government continues to repress basic political and religious freedomsand does not tolerate most types ofpublic dissent. This is what the UnitedStates State Department reported inits 1999 review of the human rights sit-uation in Vietnam. What they are doing now in Vietnam is that, instead of holding prisoners inprisons, they put them in house arrestso that the rest of the nations will notcriticize them internationally. In fact,the last time I was in Vietnam, while Iwas talking to a dissident under housearrest in his home, the government fig-ured out I was there. They sent theirpolice knocking on the door trying toget through. I do not know, if I had nothad a couple of Marines there with me,what would have happened. b1145 But the situation is that dissidents do not have an ability to speak theirmind under this government. So I askagain, why should we reward that gov-ernment with a Jackson-Vanik waiver? It was just 2 months ago when the Vi- etnamese police placed Ha Si Phuunder house arrest and threatened tocharge him with treason. The Viet-namese authorities apparently believethat Mr. Ha is connected to an open ap-peal for democracy issued by intellec-tual dissidents. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Sadly, this is not the first time that Ha Si Phu has been harassed by au-thorities for peacefully expressing hisviews. In recent years, he has becomewell known at home and abroad for hispolitical discourses and for focusinginternational attention on Vietnam'sterrible human rights record. For hisefforts, he was imprisoned in December1995 for a year; and he continues to beunder House arrest, like the rest of thepeople who speak up in Vietnam andsay that what they are doing is wrong. How do we reward this country when it punishes its citizens for exercisingbasic human rights; a country where acitizen is punished for speaking outagainst what he or she believes iswrong? Unfortunately, Mr. Ha's situation is not the only example of what we seeover and over and over in this country.Our ambassador, Mr. Pete Peterson,says that human rights conditions aregetting better. They are not. We haveonly to ask the relatives who live herein the United States. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution. Mr. JEFFERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman fromIllinois (Mr. E VANS ). Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, this vote today is a vote on whether we are trulydedicated to the hard work of gettingfull accounting of our missing from theVietnam War. As the Veterans of Foreign Wars have stated, passing this resolution ofdisapproval will only hurt our effortsat a time in which we are receiving theaccess and cooperation we need fromthe Vietnamese to determine the fateof our POW-MIAs. There is no more au-thoritative force and voice on thisissue than our former colleague andnow ambassador to Vietnam, Mr. PetePeterson, who supports this waiver. Asa prisoner of war who underwent yearsof imprisonment in the notoriousHanoi Hilton, he should have every rea-son to be skeptical and harbor bitter-ness against the Vietnamese. Yet hebelieves the best course is to developbetter relations between our two na-tions. We have achieved progress on this POW-MIA issue because of our evolvingrelationship with the Vietnamese, notdespite it. Without access to the jun-gles and the rice paddies, to the infor-mation and documents, and to the wit-nesses of these tragic incidents, itwould be impossible to give the fami-lies of the missing the answers ourcountry owes them. We are making progress and pro- viding these answers. Much of this isdue to the Joint Task Force\u00d0Full Ac-counting, our military presence inVietnam tasked with looking for ourmissing. I have visited with theseyoung men and women, and they areamong the most brave and motivatedtroops I have ever met. Every day,from the searches of jungle battle sitesto the excavation of crash sites on pre- carious mountain summits, they putthemselves in harm's way to perform amission they truly believe in. It is moving to see these young men and women, some who were not evenborn when our presence was so involvedin Vietnam. They have told me timeand time again one thing; allow us toremain on this job. The resolution before us today puts this at risk. I urge my colleagues toplease vote against this resolution. Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 1\u00a42 minutes to the gentleman from Ne- braska (Mr. B EREUTER ). (Mr. BEREUTER asked and was given permission to revise and extendhis remarks.) Mr. BEREUTER. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Asiaand the Pacific, this Member rises inopposition to the resolution. It is important for us, I think, to rec- ognize what the Jackson-Vanik waiverdoes and what it does not do. By law,the underlying issue here is about im-migration. Based on Vietnam's recordof progress on immigration and its con-tinued cooperation on U.S. refugee pro-grams over the past year, renewal ofthe Jackson-Vanik waiver will con-tinue to promote freedom of immigra-tion. Disapproval would undoubtedlyresult in the opposite. The Jackson-Vanik waiver also sym- bolizes our interest in further devel-oping relations with Vietnam. Havinglifted the trade embargo and estab-lished diplomatic relations 5 years ago,the United States has tried to workwith Vietnam to normalize incremen-tally our bilateral, political, economic,and consular relationships. This is inAmerica's own short-term and long-term national interests. It builds onVietnam's own policy of political andeconomic reintegration into the world. This will be a lengthy and chal- lenging process. However, now is notthe time to reverse course on Vietnam.Vietnam continues to cooperate fullywith our priority efforts to achieve thefullest possible accounting of AmericanPOW\u00b1MIAs. The Jackson-Vanik waiversupports this process. The Jackson-Vanik waiver certainly does not constitute an endorsement ofthe Communist regime in Hanoi. Wecannot approve of a regime that placesrestrictions on basic freedoms, includ-ing the right to organize political par-ties, freedom of speech, and freedom ofreligion. On May 4, however, this bodypassed a resolution condemning justsuch violations of human rights. The Jackson-Vanik waiver does not provide Vietnam with new trade bene-fits, including Normal Trade Relations,NTR, status. With the Jackson-Vanikwaiver, the United States has been ableto successfully negotiate and sign anew bilateral commercial trades agree-ment with Vietnam. Congress will havean opportunity in the future whetherto approve it or not, and whether toCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7016 July 26, 2000 grant NTR or not, but that is a sepa- rate process. The renewal of the Jack-son-Vanik waiver only keeps this proc-ess going, nothing more. Renewal of the Jackson-Vanik waiv- er does not automatically make Amer-ican exports to Vietnam eligible forpossible coverage by U.S. trade financ-ing programs. The waiver only allowsAmerican exports to Vietnam to be eli-gible for such coverage. Mr. Speaker, the war with Vietnam is over, and we have embarked upon anew, although cautious, expanded rela-tionship with Vietnam. Now is not thetime to reverse this constructivecourse. Accordingly, this Member urgesa ``no'' vote on the resolution. Having summarized the key reasons to op- pose the resolution, this Member would like toexpand on a few of these points. First, theissue of emigration, which indeed, is what theJackson-Vanik provision is all about. SinceMarch of 1998, the United States has grantedVietnam a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik emi-gration provisions of the Trade Act of 1974. Asthis is only an annual waiver, the Presidentdecided on June 2, 2000, the renew this ex-tension because he determined that doing sowould substantially promote greater freedomof emigration from that country in the future.This determination was based on Vietnam'srecord of progress on emigration and on Viet-nam's continued cooperation on U.S. refugeeprograms over the past year. As a result, weare approaching the completion of many ref-ugee admissions categories under the OrderlyDeparture Program (ODP), including the Re-settlement Opportunity Detainees,``McCain Amendment'' sub-programs andMontagnards. The Vietnamese Governmenthas also agreed to help implement our deci-sion to resume the ODP program for formerU.S. Government employees, which was sus-pended in 1996. The renewal of the Jackson-Vanik waiver is an acknowledgment of thatprogress. Disapproval of the waiver would, un-doubtedly, result in Vietnam's immediate ces-sation of cooperation. Second, the Jackson-Vanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developingrelations with Vietnam. Having lifted the tradeembargo and established diplomatic relationsfive years ago, the United States has tried towork with Vietnam to normalize incrementallyour bilateral political, economic and consularrelationship. This policy is in America's ownshort- and long-term national interest. It buildson Vietnam's own policy of political and eco-nomic reintegration into the world. In the judg-ment of this Member, this will be a lengthyand challenging process. However, he sug-gests that now is not the time to reversecourse on Vietnam. Third, over the past five years, Vietnam has increasingly cooperated on a wide range ofissues. The most important of these is theprogress and cooperation in obtaining the full-est possible accounting of Americans missingfrom the Vietnam War. Those members whoattended the briefing by the distinguished Am-bassador to Vietnam, a former Prisoner ofWar and former Member of this body, theHonorable ``Pete'' Peterson, learned of the sig-nificant efforts to which Vietnam is now ex-tending to address our concerns regarding thePOW/MIA issue, including their participation inremains recovery efforts which are physically very dangerous. Fourth, the Jackson-Vanik waiver does not constitute an endorsement of the Communistregime in Hanoi. We cannot approve of a re-gime that places restrictions on basic free-doms, including the right to organize politicalparties, freedom of speech, and freedom of re-ligion. However, our experience has been thatisolation and disengagement does not pro-mote progress on human rights. New sanc-tions, including the symbolic disapproval of theJackson-Vanik waiver, only strengthens theposition of the Communist hard-liners at theexpense of those in Vietnam's leadership whoare inclined to support more openness. En-gagement with Vietnam has resulted in someimprovements in Vietnam's human rights prac-tices, though we still remain disappointed atthe very limited pace and scope of such re-forms. As this Member mentioned, on May 4,2000, this body adopted a resolution con-demning Vietnam's human rights record.Given the strong reaction to our resolution byHanoi, it is evident that our actions and con-cerns did not go unnoticed. Fifth, the Jackson-Vanik waiver does not provide Vietnam with any new trade benefits,including Normal Trade Relations (NTR) sta-tus. However, with the Jackson-Vanik waiver,the United States has been able to success-fully negotiate a new bilateral commercialtrade agreement with Vietnam. This agree-ment was signed two weeks ago in Wash-ington. In the opinion of this Member, thisagreement is in our own short and long termnational interest. Vietnam remains a very dif-ficult place for American firms to do business.Vietnam needs to undertake additional funda-mental economic reforms. This new bilateraltrade agreement will require Vietnam to makethese reforms and will result in increasedAmerican exports supporting jobs here athome. In a separate process with a separate vote Congress will have to decide whether to ap-prove or reject this new trade agreement andto grant NTR status to Vietnam. Given that theagreement has yet to even be transmitted toCongress and there are only a limited numberof legislative days before the body's scheduledadjournment, this Member believes that thesedecisions will not be made until the 107thCongress meets next year. Thus, the Jackson-Vanik waiver simply ensures that the modesttrade opportunities currently available to Amer-ican businesses will continue until Congressconsiders the agreement. Sixth, contrary to the claims of some oppo- nents of the Jackson-Vanik waiver, renewal ofthe Jackson-Vanik waiver does not automati-cally make American investment in and ex-ports to Vietnam eligible for coverage by U.S.trade financing programs such as those ad-ministered by the Overseas Private InvestmentCorporation, the Export-Import Bank, and theU.S. Department of Agriculture. The waiveronly allows American exports and investmentsto be eligible for such coverage. Each muststill face separate individual reviews againsteach program's relevant criteria. Mr. Speaker, Americans must conclusively recognize that the war with Vietnam is over.With the restoration of diplomatic relations in1995, the United States and Vietnam em-barked on a new relationship for the future. Itwill not be an easy or quick process. Vietnamtoday remains a Communist country with verylimited freedoms for its citizens. Significant re- forms must occur before relations can be trulynormal. The emotional scars of the Vietnamwar remain with many Americans. In the mid-1960's, this Member was an infantry officerand intelligence officer with the First InfantryDivision. Within a month of completing myservice, members of my tight-knit detachmentof that division were in Vietnam and takingcasualties the first night after arrival. Likeother Vietnam-era veterans, this Member hasemotional baggage. A great many Americanshave emotional baggage about Vietnam, butthis Member would suggest that it is time toget on with our bilateral relationship and notreverse course on Vietnam. Passing this resolution of disapproval of the Jackson-Vanik waiver would represent yet an-other reflection of animosities of the past at atime when Vietnam is finally looking aheadand making changes towards its integrationinto the international community. A retrench-ment on our part by this disapproval resolutionis not in America's short and long term na-tional interests. Accordingly, this Memberstrongly urges the rejection of House JointResolution 99. Mr. M CNULTY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the Chair about theprocedure for closing statements? It is my understanding that the order would be the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. R OHRABACHER ), followed by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.J EFFERSON ), followed by myself, and then followed by the gentleman fromIllinois (Mr. C RANE ); is that correct? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. OSE). The gentleman's understanding is correct. Mr. M CNULTY. Mr. Speaker, I re- serve the balance of my time. Mr. JEFFERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman fromOregon (Mr. B LUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana(Mr. J EFFERSON ) for yielding me this time, and I strongly associate myselfwith the comments of my colleague,the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. B E- REUTER ). I too rise in opposition to this resolu- tion and support President Clinton'sdecision to waive Jackson-Vanik re-quirements for the next year. Thiswould absolutely be the worst thing wecould do at this point, undercuttingthe outstanding work that AmbassadorPeterson and our team has done interms of continued progress in immi-gration, in terms of continued account-ing and cooperation in dealing withprisoners of war and missing in action.It would also undercut the progressthat has been represented by the suc-cessful conclusion of the bilateraltrade agreement, a critical, criticalmilepost. This debate is absolutely not about some hypothetical huge potential tradedeficit with Vietnam. The amount oftrade involved is minuscule at thispoint and is not going to be, under thewildest circumstances, anything sig-nificant in the foreseeable future. It is absolutely not about closing United States' factories and shippingCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7017 July 26, 2000 this process overseas. The goods that have been identified here as the pri-mary products for Vietnam are notthings that the United States is spe-cializing in right now. Most of thoseproducts are already manufacturedoverseas and simply shifting suppliers. And it is categorically not about slave labor. That is absolute nonsenseand referenced by someone who clearlyhas never seen the activity that isgoing on now in Vietnam factories. Iam informed by our embassy in Viet-nam that there have been dozens ofstrikes already this year. And if wetalk to the men and women who havedone work in Vietnam, we see thateven in this area progress is beingachieved. Mr. Speaker, this House is poised to make some very significant accom-plishments in foreign policy; a historicrealignment of our policy with China.Last week's vote sent signals aboutbeing real about our relationship withCuba and reversing some absolutely in-effectual activities in the past. We arenow on the verge of doing the samewith Vietnam. I strongly urge rejectionof this resolution and keeping us mov-ing in this direction. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 1\u00a42minutes. Mr. Speaker, again, we should take a look at what is being said here todayand what the central issues are. Wehave heard that if we vote today forthis resolution that these subsidies forbusinessmen who go over there, whoclose factories in the United States andopen up factories to produce goods withthe slave labor in Vietnam and exportthem to the United States, will not``automatically'' be granted; will not``automatically'' have these subsidiesavailable. We keep getting these words that should make it very clear that is whatthis debate is about. The debate isabout whether or not U.S. taxpayersare going to subsidize American com-panies to close their doors in theUnited States, go over there and takeadvantage of, yes, slave labor. I am not impressed when I hear that there have been strikes in Vietnam.The question is what happened to thestrikers after the strike. The questionis whether those strikers had a right toform a union and to try to peacefullyadvocate their own position, which isthe right of every person in a free soci-ety. There has been no progress reported in labor relations in Vietnam. There isno progress in terms of a free press, noprogress in terms of religious freedom,no progress in terms of an oppositionparty. So where is this progress? Weare rewarding the Communist govern-ment of Vietnam for continuing its re-pression. As far as Mr. Peterson's report, this is the first time any of us have everheard of a report that there are recordsfrom a prison available. Let me notethis, and I have just spoken to the gen-tleman from Nebraska (Mr. B EREUTER ),chairman of the committee, that it has never been reported to him; it hasnever been reported to me, a seniormember of the Committee on Inter-national Relations and the Sub-committee on Asia and the Pacific,that those records are available. Now, how limited are they? How long have they been available? We are beingtold this right now, during this debate,that records that have been denied usfor 10 years of our demanding are nowavailable to us. Let me just say if thatis the case, and those records have beenavailable and it has not been reportedto the oversight committee of theUnited States Congress, there is some-thing wrong with our State Depart-ment or something wrong with theprocess. And I would put on the record today that I expect to see those prisonrecords. I would put this on the recordfor our ambassador to Vietnam that Iexpect to see those prison recordsforthwith and immediately so thatthey can be examined in relationshipto the MIA-POW issue. Those recordshave not been made available to us. Wehave not had a good faith effort, and itis wrong to spring this in the middle ofa debate on the floor on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JEFFERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman fromTexas (Mr. R EYES ). Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time,and I rise this morning in support ofmaintaining the President's waiver ofJackson-Vanik for Vietnam and in op-position of this resolution. Our policy of engagement with Viet- nam is our most effective tool for in-fluencing Vietnamese society andachieving positive relationships withthat country. With engagement, we areable to insert American ideals of free-dom and liberty to the Vietnamese peo-ple. Furthermore, as a global leader ineconomic enterprise, American compa-nies are poised to develop even broadercommercial ties and influential rela-tionships throughout Vietnam. I can tell my colleagues that our presence in Vietnam impacts their so-ciety in all areas, from commercial re-lations to worker rights. b1200 Moreover, as a Vietnam veteran, I be- lieve that the coordination and co-operation of the Vietnamese govern-ment in the recovery of remains of ourservicemen is essential and has beenextremely successful and possiblethrough our policy of engagement. Clearly, additional progress must be made in Vietnam on a whole range ofissues including trade, human rights,religious freedom, and freedom of ex-pression. However, we can only do thatthrough a policy of engagement. We allagree that there must be greater polit-ical and democratic reforms as well asmore open access to Vietnamese mar-kets in order to address the large andgrowing trade imbalance.In my view, the most effective way to bring about improvements in trade,human rights, and political and reli- gious freedoms and to maintain otherprogress in successful joint searches forveterans' remains is through continuedengagement with the Vietnamese gov-ernment and increased contacts withthe Vietnamese people so that they canlearn and appreciate the values of de-mocracy and the values of freedom. If we do not support the President's waiver of Jackson-Vanik for Vietnam,the result will be that it will cause usto disengage and withdraw. This willharm and not improve our situationwith Vietnam. Removal of Vietnam's status would likely result in the withdrawal ofAmerican goods and, therefore, Amer-ican values. I strongly urge everyone in this House to support the waiver of Jack-son-Vanik for a status for Vietnam andvote against this resolution. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M CNULTY. Mr. Speaker, I re- serve the balance of my time. Mr. JEFFERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewomanfrom Missouri (Ms. M CCARTHY ). (Ms. M CCARTHY of Missouri asked and was given permission to revise andextend her remarks.) Ms. M CCARTHY of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition tothe resolution and thank my friend andcolleague, the gentleman from Lou-isiana (Mr. J EFFERSON ), for giving me this opportunity to speak. There is no question that the Vietnam War strained the very fiber of our nation, however,the time has come to reconcile the discord ofthe past. Including trade in our new diplomaticrelationship with Vietnam will allow us to cre-ate a positive partnership for the future. In January, I traveled to Vietnam and was struck by the evolution of their economy andthe progress which has occurred to provideopportunities for both our countries. Mr. Speaker, in our increasingly global economy, shutting Vietnam outwould be detrimental not only for thepeople of Vietnam and southeast Asiabut for American citizens and busi-nesses, as well. In the shadow of the historic market- opening agreement made only thismonth thanks to the efforts of U.S.Ambassador Pete Peterson, it would bea disaster for Congress to approve leg-islation to deny Vietnam eligibility forU.S. trade credits. Opening the Vietnamese markets will not only provide an economic boon forboth Vietnam and the U.S. but will im-prove trade between the two countries,and that will go a long way towardhealing the wounds both nations havebeen nursing for decades. I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution. I rise in strong opposition to the resolution and thank my friend and colleague from Lou-isiana Mr. J EFFERSON , for giving me the oppor- tunity to speak.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7018 July 26, 2000 The Vietnam war is the war of my genera- tion and I will always have strong feelings re-garding the longest war in our country's his-tory and the conflict which strained the fiber ofour nation. In January, I traveled to Vietnam and was struck by the evolution of their economy andthe progress which has occurred to provideopportunities for both our countries. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, could I get the time that is left for allof us and what sequence that we will bemaking our closing arguments. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. O SE). The order of close shall be the gentleman from California (Mr. R OHR- ABACHER ) first, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. J EFFERSON ) second, the gentleman from New York (Mr.M CNULTY ) third, and finally the gen- tleman from Illinois (Mr. C RANE ) will have the final word. The amount of time remaining for the gentleman from California (Mr.R OHRABACHER ) is 21\u00a42minutes, for the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. J EF- FERSON ) 1 minute, for the gentleman from New York (Mr. M CNULTY ) 41\u00a42min- utes, and the gentleman from Illinois(Mr. C RANE ) 2 minutes. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.Mr. Speaker, I would ask my col-leagues to support this resolution. Letus today make a stand for principle.Let us send the message to the worldand to the American people about whatAmerica stands for. Today we are really a government that simply can be manipulated bylarge financial interests, billionaireswho want to invest in various parts ofthe world under a guise of globalism. Is that what we are all about? No. We have Mr. Lafayette who watches ustoday. We have George Washingtonwho watches us today. Is that theAmerica that they fought for? Is thatthe globalism they had in mind? The globalism our forefathers had in mind were universal rights where theconcept of the United States stands asa hope of liberty and justice for theworld, not just that we are a placewhere people can come and do businesstogether. Yes, we believe in that andthat our businessmen have a right todo businesses overseas. Yes, they havea right do that. But there is some high-er value involved with our country. We can reaffirm that today, and not only reaffirming that principle thathuman rights and democracy meanssomething, but at the same time,watch out for the interests of theAmerican people. We see this American flag behind us. What does that flag stand for? It standsfor, number one, we believe in libertyand justice and independence and free-dom. We believe in those things ourFounding Fathers talked about 225years ago. But, number two, it alsostands for that we are going to rep-resent the interests of those Americanpeople who have come here to thiscountry and become citizens of our country. It is not in their interest, and it is not in the interest of human freedomthat we subsidize American businessesto go over and do business in dictator-ships, dictatorships where they throwthe leaders of strikes in jail 2 daysafter the strike is over, dictatorshipswhere they do not allow any oppositionparties or freedom of religion. There has been no progress in terms of human rights in Vietnam. And nowwe are thinking about offering a per-verse incentive again today. That iswhat this debate is about, to our busi-nessmen to close their doors here, notwatching out for the interests of theAmerican people, but instead makingsure that these business men can goover and use that slave labor. Those people in Vietnam have a $300 a year per capita income, and they aregoing to be exploited by Americanbusinessmen. Let us vote for this resolution. Let us not give them this waiver. Let us putthem on notice that they have a yearto clean up their act, and then we cangrant them some concessions if theyhave progressed in those areas. I ask for support of the resolution.Mr. JEFFERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to keep in mind what this legislation isall about. It is not to cure all these dif-ficulties that exist between the UnitedStates and Vietnam, nor between thedebate over democracy versus com-munism. It is strictly about providinggreater access for immigration and ourreview of whether or not that is takingplace in that country in sufficient ca-pacity to permit us to continue withthe waiver. Since the 1980s, over 500,000 Viet- namese people have emigrated as refu-gees of that country to the UnitedStates. Ambassador Peterson reportsthat while there are bribes and corrup-tion, these are isolated incidents andthis is not a form of government policyin Vietnam. And so Vietnam is meeting the re- quirement for us to continue the waiv-er, and that is all that is importanthere. While incident to this there willbe permission of OPEC and Ex-Im Bankto engage and support U.S. businessthere, that is not the overriding pur-pose of what we are doing here. And soVietnam has met its obligation. It is time for our country to step up and meet its obligation as well and topermit the Jackson-Vanik waiver tocontinue and to permit people to con-tinue to enjoy free immigration to thiscountry. Mr. M CNULTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ron Cima and Chuck Henley of the Office of the Sec-retary of Defense for the briefing thatthey gave me last week on the searchfor our MIAs. I am grateful to them, toPete Peterson, and to all of those whoare working to bring our MIAs home.As I grow older, Mr. Speaker, I try to keep my priorities in proper order. Iam not always successful at that, but Iwork at it. That is why when I get upin the morning the first two things I doare to thank God for my life and vet-erans for my way of life. Had it not been for my brother Bill and all of those who gave their lives inservice to this country through theyears, had it not been for people likethe gentleman from Texas (Mr. S AM JOHNSON ) and Pete Peterson and J OHN MCCAIN, who endured torture as pris- oners of war, had it not been for peoplelike Pete Dalessandro, a World War IICongressional Medal of Honor winnerfrom my district who was just laid torest last year in our new veterans'cemetery in Saratoga, had it not beenfor them and all of the men and womenwho wore the uniform of the UnitedStates military through the years andput their lives on the line for us, wewould not have the privilege of goingaround bragging about how we live inthe freest and most open democracy onEarth. Freedom is not free. We paid a tre- mendous price for it. And we should al-ways remember those who paid theprice. So today, Mr. Speaker, based upon the comments that I made earlier onbehalf of all 2,014 Americans who arestill missing in southeast Asia, on be-half of their families, I ask my col-leagues to join with me, the AmericanLegion, the National League of POW/MIA Families, the National Alliance ofPOW/MIA Families, the National Viet-nam Veterans Coalition, the Veteransof the Vietnam War, and the DisabledAmerican Veterans in supporting thisresolution of disapproval. Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self the balance of the time. Mr. Speaker, I want to just make one brief concluding remark, and it has todo with the events in Vietnam that allof us have recollections of. My two kid brothers served over there. I know that we all had a concernnot just for the welfare of our friends,neighbors and relatives, but we had aconcern about the Vietnamese people,too. I think it is important for us to rec- ognize that since the Vietnam Warended that there is a whole new Viet-nam that has come into existence.Sixty-five percent of the people inVietnam were not alive at the end ofthe Vietnam War. As this new popu-lation has taken over the country, Ithink it is important for us to lend ourefforts in advancing the Vietnamesecountry and people toward those civ-ilized values that we cherish. For that reason, I think the Jackson- Vanik waiver is a very tiny but incre-mental and important step in that di-rection. And for that reason, with alldue respect to my colleagues who aresupporting H.J. Res. 99, I would urgemy colleagues to vote no on H.J. Res.99 and keep us moving in the right di-rection.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7019 July 26, 2000 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I am surprised to hear for the first time today thatthe Vietnamese communists have made avail-able the records of one of the prisons whereAmbassador Peterson was held. In response,I just asked Ambassador Peterson whichrecords he was referring to. Unfortunately, therecords he is speaking of are not from theprisons in which he was held early during hiscaptivity, for which I am most concerned thatsome Americans may not have returned from.I do not doubt that Ambassador Peterson isbeing honest that commanders from thoseprisons told him that they do not know wherethe records are after so many years. However,they as individuals were not the record keep-ers. The Vietnamese communist governmentkept many overlapping records on prisonersthey held in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia ortransferred from Indochina to other communistcountries. It is those meticulous records that Iam concerned about and to which my requestto communist officials in Hanoi has not beenaddressed. Former American POWs such as Mike Benge and Colonel Ted Guy have told mystaff and I how they were repeatedly inter-viewed and had written records made by over-lapping Vietnamese communist intelligenceand military organizations while they weretransferred between Laos and a number ofprison camps in Vietnam. U.S. officials have tothis day, not had those records made avail-able to them by the Vietnamese regime. In addition, there are some 400 Americans who U.S. intelligence agencies have identifiedas having been alive or who perished underVietnamese communist control. The Viet-namese regime could easily account for thesemen, but to this day, refuse to do so. Finally,the CIA and DIA have verified the validity ofthe testimony before Congress by a Viet-namese mortician who testified to processinghundreds of deceased American prisoners' re-mains in Hanoi during the war. He testifiedthat the organization he worked for kept metic-ulous records of the deceased Americans,processed the remains for storage, and care-fully packaged and labeled personal belong-ings of the deceased Americans. To this day,none of the records of that organization\u00d0which could resolve the fates of scores ofmissing American servicemen\u00d0have beenmade available by the Vietnamese regime. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution and urge mycolleagues to uphold the current Jackson-Vanik waiver. The Jackson-Vanik provision of the 1974 Trade Act was intended to encourage com-munist countries to relax their restrictive emi-gration policies. At the time, the Soviet Unionwas prohibiting Soviet Jewry from emigratingto the United States and Israel. The Jackson-Vanik waiver specifically grant- ed the President the power to waive the re-strictions on U.S. government credits or in-vestment guarantees to communist countries ifthe waiver would help promote significantprogress toward relaxing emigration controls. To avoid confusion among some of my col- leagues, this waiver does not provide Vietnamwith normal trade relations. Ironically, the eco-nomic incentives provided in the Jackson-Vanik are all one-sided favoring U.S. firmsdoing business in Vietnam. Mr. Chairman, Senator Scoop Jackson was a staunch anti-communist. Yet, he was willingto consider to incentives to encourage the So- viet Union to relax its emigration policy. In 1998, Charles Vanik, former Member and co-author of the Jackson-Vanik provision, sentme a letter expressing his strong opposition tothe motion to disapprove trade credits for Viet-nam and upholding the current waiver. Vietnam is experiencing a new era, driving by a population where 65 percent of its citi-zens were born after the war. Vietnam todaywelcomes U.S. trade and economic invest-ment. The Vietnamese Government has made sig- nificant progress in meeting the emigration cri-teria in the Jackson-Vanik amendment.Through a policy of engagement and U.S.business investment, Vietnam has improvedits emigration policies, cooperated on U.S. ref-ugee programs, and worked with the UnitedStates on achieving the fullest possible ac-counting of POW/MIAs from the Vietnam War. Despite problems of corruption and govern- ment repression, there is reason to believethat our presence in Vietnam can improve thesituation and encourage its government to be-come more open, respect human rights andfollow the rule of law. U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam, Pete Peter- son, our esteemed former colleague andformer POW, has been one of our nation'sstrongest advocates for expanding trade withVietnam. Renewing the Jackson-Vanik waiverwill increase market access for U.S. goodsand services in the 12th most populous coun-try in the world. Disapproval of this waiver will only discour- age U.S. businesses from operating in Viet-nam, arm Soviet-style hardliners with the pre-text to clamp down on what economic and so-cial freedoms the Vietnamese people now ex-perience, and eliminate what opportunity wehave to influence Vietnam in the future. Mr. Speaker, last year we debated and soundly rejected a similar disapproval resolu-tion. I urge my colleagues to do the sametoday and uphold the presidential waiver ofthe Jackson-Vanik requirements. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup- port of H.J. Res. 99. I represent San Jose California, a commu- nity greatly enhanced by the presence of im-migrants. Many years ago, as a Supervisor onthe Santa Clara County Board of SupervisorsI worked with refugees escaping a brutal andoppressive political regime. As an immigration lawyer, I did my best to help these courageous individuals adjust totheir new life. During that time, I met familiestorn apart by a government that would not letthem leave unless they escaped. All of thesefamilies sacrificed\u00d0so that some of themcould see freedom. Over the past two decades these brave people have become my friends and myneighbors. I have learned lessons about free-dom and liberty from them. These same peo-ple tell me that we must not waive the Jack-son-Vanik amendment. I am a strong supporter of fair trade. I be- lieve that an economic search for open mar-kets often results in a more open society. I be-lieve that an economic dialogue often resultsin an enhanced political one. I also believethat a trusted economic partner can evolveinto a trusted political ally. However, not every nation travels the same path to a more open society. In the case ofVietnam, I believe we can achieve more bymaking Vietnam live up to the free emigration requirements of the Jackson-Vanik amend-ment to the Trade Act of 1974. Why? Because Vietnam is so eager for a trade relationship with America that they wouldimprove their human rights policies in order toget it\u00d0but only if we insist. One cornerstone of our trade policy with nonmarket economies has been the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. This amendment requiresthat a country make progress in allowing freeemigration in order to achieve normal tradestatus. More than two decades after the endof the Vietnam War, my congressional staff inSan Jose continues to receive letters from Vi-etnamese American families seeking reunifica-tion with a brother or sister, a mother or a fa-ther, a son or a daughter. Think of what this resolution says to them. More than two decades after the end of theVietnam War, they are still waiting for a lovedone. And in the face of their wait, we are ex-ploring the extension of normal trade relationsto a nation that still holds those captive whowould leave if only they could. I understand my colleagues when they say Vietnam has changed. It has changed, but notenough. In a 1999 review of Vietnam's humanrights record, the State Department reachedthe conclusion that Vietnam's overall humanrights record remained poor. The report point-ed out that ``the government continued to re-press basic political and some religious free-doms and to commit numerous abuses.'' Thereport pointed out that the government was``not tolerating most types of public dissent.'' Additionally, reports from human rights orga- nizations indicate that he Vietnamese govern-ment has tried to clamp down on political andreligious dissidents through isolation and in-timidation. Dissidents are confined throughhouse arrest and subject to constant surveil-lance. During her trip to Vietnam SecretaryAlbright said that the bilateral relationship be-tween Vietnam and the United States ``cannever be totally normal until we feel that thehuman rights situation has been dealt with.'' Iagree. The essence of this debate is freedom\u00d0 how we can best achieve greater freedom forthe Vietnamese people and how we as a na-tion can more greatly influence the govern-ment to create a more open society. I believethat course is to pass this resolution. After all,leverage is no longer leverage once it is givenaway. I urge my colleagues to support H.J.Res. 99. Mr. DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 99, Disapprovingthe Extension of Emigration Waiver Authorityto Vietnam. While the United States and Vietnam signed a trade agreement last week which requiresVietnam to overhaul its economy, by reducingtariffs on a range of goods and allowing for-eign firms to participate in businesses in Viet-nam; the resolution on the House floor todayis whether Vietnam allows free and open emi-gration for its citizens. In 1999, President Clin-ton granted Vietnam a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment's on this condition. Unfortu-nately, not much improvement can be citednor documented. Boat People, SOS an organi- zation in my district, informed me that there issignificant corruption in Vietnam and the Viet-namese government continues to excludethousands of former political prisoners andCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7020 July 26, 2000 former U.S. government employees from par- ticipating in U.S. refugee programs. On aver-age, an applicant must pay $1,000 in bribes togain access to these programs. In a countrywhere the average Vietnamese's annual sal-ary is $250\u00d0impoverished former politicalprisoners and former U.S. government em-ployees simply cannot afford these outrageousbribes to apply for these programs. Corruption exists not only in the Vietnamese government but also undermines U.S. ex-change programs as well. Our programs offeroutstanding Vietnamese students the oppor-tunity to study in the U.S. However, the Viet-namese government excludes those studentswhose parents are not members of the Com-munist cadre. Thus, many qualified Viet-namese students are denied the opportunity tostudy in U.S. exchange programs simply be-cause their parents are not card-carryingmembers of the Communist party. This dis-crepancy is only one example of the apartheidsystem that the Vietnamese government hasimplemented to punish those who do notagree with their ideology. On the issue of human rights, while Vietnam has released some political prisoners, manymore remain imprisoned while the Communistgovernment continues to arrest others forspeaking out against the government. Whilethe Vietnamese government may claim tomake strides, I would like to share with you 2prominent cases: Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, aprominent prisoner of conscience who was re-leased in late 1998, remains under house ar-rest in Saigon; while Professor Doan VietHoat, a former prisoner of conscience whohad been imprisoned for over 20 years forpromoting democratic ideals, was forced toleave Vietnam as a condition of his release.The government of Vietnam does not tolerateliberties, such as the right to free speech, theright to freely practice one's religion, and theright to peacefully assemble. Reports revealthat the Vietnamese police have forced manyreligious groups to renounce their beliefs orface the threat of imprisonment. Furthermore,when I visited Vietnam in 1998, a Catholicpriest told me that the Communist governmentdid not allow him to wear vestments in public. Even more egregious is the persecution of the Hmong, approximately 10,000 of themhave had to flee their ancestral lands in thenorth, traveling 800 miles to the south centralhighlands in Dak Lak Province. Many havebeen arrested as ``illegal migrants'' or oncharges of ``illegal religion'' as part of a gov-ernment crackdown on Hmong Christians. Mr. Speaker, in light of these offenses, I be- lieve H.J. Res. 99 is an important bill that de-serves the support of every Member, and Iurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisleto vote in favor of this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to the order of the House of Monday, July 24, 2000, the joint resolu-tion is considered read for amendmentand the previous question is ordered. The question is on engrossment and third reading of the joint resolution. The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, andwas read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, by direc- tion of the Committee on Rules, I callup House Resolution 563 and ask for itsimmediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol- lows: H. R ES. 563 Resolved, That at any time after the adop- tion of this resolution the Speaker may, pur-suant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare theHouse resolved into the Committee of theWhole House on the state of the Union forconsideration of the bill (H.R. 4942) makingappropriations for the government of theDistrict of Columbia and other activitieschargeable in whole or in part against therevenues of said District for the fiscal yearending September 30, 2001, and for other pur-poses. The first reading of the bill shall bedispensed with. All points of order againstconsideration of the bill are waived. Generaldebate shall be confined to the bill and shallnot exceed one hour equally divided and con-trolled by the chairman and ranking minor-ity member of the Committee on Appropria-tions. After general debate the bill shall beconsidered for amendment under the five-minute rule. Points of order against provi-sions in the bill for failure to comply withclause 2 of rule XXI are waived exceptagainst section 153. No amendment to thebill shall be in order except those printed inthe portion of the Congressional Record des-ignated for that purpose in clause 8 of ruleXVIII, pro forma amendments for the pur-pose of debate, and the amendments printedin the report of the Committee on Rules ac-companying this resolution. Each amend-ment printed in the Record may be offeredonly by the Member who caused it to beprinted or his designee and shall be consid-ered as read. Each amendment printed in thereport may be offered only by a Member des-ignated in the report and only at the appro-priate point in the reading of the bill, shallbe considered as read, shall be debatable forthe time specified in the report equally di-vided and controlled by the proponent and anopponent, shall not be subject to amend-ment, and shall not be subject to a demandfor division of the question in the House orin the Committee of the Whole. All points oforder against the amendments printed in thereport are waived. The Chairman of the Com-mittee of the Whole may: (1) postpone untila time during further consideration in theCommittee of the Whole a request for a re-corded vote on any amendment; and (2) re-duce to five minutes the minimum time forelectronic voting on any postponed questionthat follows another electronic vote withoutintervening business, provided that the min-imum time for electronic voting on the firstin any series of questions shall be 15 min-utes. At the conclusion of consideration ofthe bill for amendment the Committee shallrise and report the bill to the House withsuch amendments as may have been adopted.The previous question shall be considered asordered on the bill and amendments theretoto final passage without intervening motionexcept one motion to recommit with or with-out instructions. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. PEASE ). The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. L INDER ) is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-tomary 30 minutes to the gentlemanfrom Texas (Mr. F ROST ), pending whichI yield myself such time as I may con- sume. During consideration of this res-olution, all time yielded is for the pur-pose of debate only. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 563 is a modified open rule providing for con-sideration of H.R. 4942, the District ofColumbia Appropriations Bill for fiscalyear 2001. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill andprovides for 1 hour of general debate di-vided equally between the chairmanand the ranking minority member onthe Committee on Appropriations. The rule waives clause 2 of rule XXI, prohibiting unauthorized appropria-tions, legislative provisions or reappro-priations in an appropriations bill,against provisions in the bill except asnoted in the rule. The rule makes in order only those amendments that have been preprintedin the C ONGRESSIONAL RECORD and those amendments printed in the Com-mittee on Rules report. All points oforder are waived against the amend-ments printed in the Committee onRules report. These amendments shall be offered by the Member designated in the reportand only at the appropriate point inthe reading of the bill. The amend-ments in the report shall be decreed asread and shall be debatable for thetime specified in the report to beequally divided between a proponentand an opponent. Finally, the amend-ments printed in the report shall notbe subject to amendment and shall notbe subject to a demand for a division ofthe question in the House or in theCommittee of the Whole. The rule permits the chairman of the Committee of the Whole to postponevotes during consideration of the bill,and to reduce voting time to 5 minuteson a postponed question if the vote fol-lows a 15-minute vote. Finally, the ruleprovides a motion to recommit, with orwithout instructions, which is theright of the minority. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 563 is a modified open rule, similar to thoseconsidered for other general appropria-tions bills. Any Member who wishes tooffer an amendment to the District ofColumbia appropriations bill and has preprinted the amendment in theR ECORD will have an opportunity to do so. In order to better manage the debate, the Committee on Rules has structuredthe debate on four specific amend-ments. An amendment offered by thegentleman from Oklahoma (ChairmanI STOOK ) would reprogram funds from a survey of the District's tax policies tohelp fund Metrorail construction. Another amendment, to be offered by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.T IAHRT ), would prevent needle ex- change programs from operating with-in 1,000 feet of schools, day care cen-ters, playgrounds, public housing orother places where children play andspend time during the day. The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. S OUDER ) plans to offer an amendmentto prohibit the use of funds to finance needle exchange programs in the Dis-trict. This language mirrors a provi-sion in the D.C. appropriations billthat passed the House last year. Finally, an amendment by the gen- tleman from California (Mr. B ILBRAY ) would prohibit individuals under theage of 18 from possessing tobacco in theDistrict. The amendment imposes thesame restrictions on tobacco use byminors that are in force in mostStates, including Maryland and Vir-ginia. Under this rule, the House will have the opportunity to exercise its respon-sibility to address these important so-cial issues facing the District. Ratherthan avoiding controversial issues likeneedle exchanges and tobacco use byminors, Members of this House will beaccountable to their constituents andthe people of the District. I am pleasedthat this open rule will bring thesehonest policy disputes out into theopen so that Americans will knowwhere their Representatives stand onthese issues that affect them right intheir towns and neighborhoods. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4942 appropriates a total of $414 million in Federal fundingsupport for the District. I applaud thegentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.I STOOK ), the chairman of the sub- committee, and the gentleman fromVirginia (Mr. M ORAN ), the ranking Member, for their hard work toproduce this solid legislation. This is aresponsible bill that makes the FederalGovernment a partner in D.C. govern-ment and helps our Nation's Capitalmove closer to the success and inde-pendence that its residents deserve. On a separate note, this is the last of 13 appropriations bills that must beconsidered each year. The Committeeon Appropriations has once again per-formed admirably, working within theresponsible budget limits while man-aging the available resources to bestserve the American people. Congress ison track to have all spending bills com-plete before the end of the fiscal year,having again preserved the Social Se-curity surplus, provided tax relief forworking Americans, and maintain im-portant funding priorities that millionsof Americans depend on. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4942 was favorably reported out of the Committee on Ap- propriations, as was this fair rule bythe Committee on Rules. I urge my col-leagues to support the rule so we canproceed with general debate and con-sideration of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the District of Colum- bia finds itself last, but certainly notleast, in the appropriations lineup forfiscal year 2001. This is the last of 13appropriations bills, but it is the billwhich accords the least amount of re-spect to the residents of this city. b1245 Year after year, the Republican ma- jority has gone out of its way to turnCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7022 July 26, 2000 what should be an easy task into an unnecessarily difficult one. This year isno different; and for that reason, Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to thisrule and in opposition to the bill. Mr. Speaker, last year the D.C. ap- propriations was considered six timesbefore finally becoming the engine thatdrove the omnibus appropriations bill.I must ask, is there a good reason theRepublican majority seems to want torepeat that exercise again this year? The bill is loaded with the usual so- cial riders the Republican majorityseems willing to impose on the resi-dents of the District, but not on theirown constituents. Again the bill con-tains veto bait such as barring the Dis-trict from using its own local funds toprovide abortion services to low-in-come residents, or implementing itsown domestic partnership law. But to add insult to injury, this rule makes in order two amendments thatthe delegate from the District of Co-lumbia specifically asked the Com-mittee on Rules to deny. These twoamendments, one relating to the issueof needle exchange and one relating tothe sale of tobacco to minors, are pe-rennial Republican favorites on thisbill. But, Mr. Speaker, these are theamendments the elected government ofthe District of Columbia, as well as thegentlewoman from the District of Co-lumbia (Ms. N ORTON ), oppose. Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the Committee on Rules has pointedlythrough the consideration of 12 appro-priation bills denied Members the rightto offer amendments that required awaiver of clause 2 of Rule XXI; butwhen it comes to the District, thechairman and the Republican majorityof the committee send out an engravedinvitation to any Member who has aparticular legislative ax to grind. Mr. Speaker, is it any wonder the District Government has proposed li-cense plates for its residents that pro-claim ``Taxation Without Representa-tion''? Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule for the simple reason that the Republicanmajority has again set up this appro-priation for an unnecessary protractedlegislative debate. I urge my colleaguesto vote no on this rule and on the bill.Let us put some common sense andsome respect into this process. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume totake a moment to point out to my col-league from Texas that no Democratsubmitted a request for a waiver onamendment. The ones that were deniedwere only Republican amendments. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he might consume to the gentleman fromCalifornia (Mr. C UNNINGHAM ). Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to thank theranking minority Member, the gen-tleman from Virginia (Mr. M ORAN ). He and I have become very close friends inthis body. It does not mean like twoIrishmen we do not disagree on occa- sion passionately, but I want to thankhim. We disagree on some issues in thisparticular bill. I do not agree with ev- erything in the bill; but like every-thing that comes forward in thisHouse, it is a good bill overall. The Constitution of the United States of America, and we were allsworn and held up our hand to supportthe Constitution, which says that alllegislation, all legislation, for the D.C.area, is from this body. We were allsworn to uphold that. If we uphold theConstitution of the United States, wewill support this bill because we arelegislating in the best interests. I would say to my friends on the other side that for 30 years you con-trolled this House, and if you take alook what happened to Washington,D.C., in those 30 years of neglect, lookat the systems that are typical of theUnited States, you look at education.Members of Congress, the President,the Vice President, all send their chil-dren to private schools. Why? Becausethe D.C. system has been so terrible. But I want to tell you, I have been in some of those schools; and I have seensome wonderful dedicated teachers andschools. But where you have roofs thatare caving in, that the fire departmenthas to shut down those schools, that wedo not have the support over that 30years for education systems, somethingis wrong. We came in and appointed boards. Another bright light is Mayor Wil-liams. He has got a monumental taskat hand to get through that bureauc-racy that he has; but if you look ateducation and what we have done, wefully funded charter schools. When myown party in the last Congress wantedto reduce the amount of funds for thepublic schools, we fought, the gen-tleman from Virginia (Mr. M ORAN ) and I, and said we reward schools for goingin the right direction. We do not penal-ize them. Together we were able tocome up with full funding for the pub-lic school systems and charter schools.I think that is a positive, and that is inthis bill as well. I look at the economy. When you have month-to-month leases becauseyou have got some members in this bu-reaucracy taking money under thetable on a month-to-month lease, wefought together to have those leasesextended so we could get business toinvest in Washington, D.C. We can make this waterfront the best waterfront in the whole country, likeSan Diego or San Francisco or the oth-ers. But you cannot when you have gotdrugs going down there; and we haveworked together, not only there but toclean up the Anacostia River, theworst river in the United States forpollution. The fecal count is the high-est in any river in the United States.We are working together on a bipar-tisan fashion with the Mayor and onboth sides to fix that. These are verypositive things that we are working on. But I would say to my friend that there are things in this bill that I dis-agree with, and that my colleagues dis- agree with; but overall it is a good bill,and it moves not only the legislationforward, but in the long run it is thebest for the D.C. residents. I would askfor full support of this. I thank the gentleman from Okla- homa (Chairman I STOOK ) for his work with the ranking minority Member. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 8 minutes to the gentlewoman from theDistrict of Columbia (Ms. N ORTON ). Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. I want to begin as we embark upon the D.C. appropriation by thanking thegentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.I STOOK ) for his hard work on this bill. The gentleman and I have had dis-agreements on this bill, but I appre-ciate his efforts to work out some ofthose disagreements with me. I want tothank the gentleman from Virginia(Mr. M ORAN ) for his strong advocacy and work for the District as well. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose a rule shot through with financial, oper-ational, and social intrusions thatshould concern no one unless you hap-pen to be a resident of the District ofColumbia. D.C. is once again bringingup the rear of the appropriations. Hereis hoping that the number 13 in the ap-propriations cycle has nothing to dowith bad luck. This should be the easiest of the 13 appropriation bills. Few Members haveor should bother to acquire familiaritywith the complicated, necessarily paro-chial operations of a big American citythat is not their own. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule be- cause the bill before us is full of avoid-able problems any city would have tofind objectionable. First, movement of available funds from D.C. priorities to others chosenby the subcommittee without any con-sultation with the District. Second, movement of riders, and not only social riders, but riders that areso old that they are laughably out ofdate or redundant because the provi-sions are already in the D.C. code orFederal law. Anyone scrutinizing theD.C. appropriation would find attach-ments so dated or irrelevant as to castdoubt on the committee's work prod-uct. With a lot of hard work and sac- rifices, the District has emerged frominsolvency, but the city has no Stateto fall back on and has urgent needs itcannot possibly fund. City officials re-quested funding from the President forsome urgent priorities. The WhiteHouse chose to fund just a few of them. The city understands, of course, that the subcommittee's 302(b) allocationwas cut, and, therefore, all the Dis-trict's priorities could not be fullyfunded. The city fully understands thatthe shortfall was beyond the sub-committee's control. Those fundsmust, in our judgment, be restored.However, at the very least, the Districtcannot be expected to endorse transferof whatever funds are left over afterCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7023 July 26, 2000 the cuts to items not in the first tier of the city's own urgent priorities. The White House funded the state functions that are now Federal respon-sibilities and added $66.2 million forpriorities negotiated and ratified bycity officials. A cut of $31 million fromthe 302(b) allocation left only $34.8 mil-lion. Instead of redistributing the scarce remaining funds to the District's stat-ed priorities, $13.85 million for newmatters was actually added to the D.C.appropriation. How can items be addedto an appropriation that has been cut?The only way to do this, of course, is tocut funding for the priorities the cityhas stated it must have. Yet, newitems were added, for example, fundingfor the Arboretum, a Federal facilityfunded by the Agriculture Departmentthat never before has appeared in aD.C. appropriation. Adding new itemsguaranteed that the District's prior-ities would be downgraded anddefunded. What was left after a combination of cuts and new additions was predictable:$7 million instead of $25 million forD.C.'s top economic priority, a NewYork Avenue subway station, now ingreat jeopardy; $14 million instead of$17 million for the D.C. College AccessAct, despite a letter from Mayor Wil-liams requesting funding for juniorsand seniors previously excluded onlybecause it was erroneously thoughtthere would be insufficient funding.The subcommittee says to the District,pay for critical items like the NewYork Avenue Metro station, not fromFederal funds, but from interest onD.C. funds held by the Control Board. This requirement remains in the bill, despite a letter from the Control BoardChair, Alice Rivlin, that says that suchfunds no longer exist, but, to quote herwords, ``have already been included bythe District as a source of funds to sup-port governmental operations.'' The requirement to pay for the sub- way from interest remains in the bill,despite the fact that D.C. could neverpay for the great majority of a subwaystation's cost itself and was able tomake a commitment to use its ownfunds for a station only because theOMB and the private sector had eachcommitted to pick up one-third of thecost. Mayor Williams wrote to Chairman I STOOK : ``In the case of the New York Avenue Metro, the reduction in Federalfunds has sent a chilling message tothe business community who have ex-pressed interested in bringing businessto the District. The $22 million cutgreatly imperils the District's abilityto secure the private funds that wereto be leveraged by the public alloca-tion. Local businesses have made in-vestments in the city based on thisproject. Without full funding, the suc-cess of this effort is jeopardized. I urgeyou to restore full funding.'' It is one thing for the subcommittee to make cuts; it is quite another forthe subcommittee to nullify the Dis-trict's carefully thought-out priorities. Adding funding controversy to the at-tachments disputes that always sur-round this appropriation has nothelped this bill, for we also will wastea lot of time discussing riders today. Itis wasted time because, in the end, theriders have caused a veto of the bill;and to get the bill signed at all, theyare removed or substantially changed. The chairman indicated these riders simply reflected those transmitted bythe President from prior years. OMBhas worked with the District to removeriders from prior years that are out-dated, no longer relevant or are al-ready included in D.C. or Federal law;and the city has moved to make otherriders permanent that should be per-manent a part of D.C. law. The Chairmust prefer long and wasteful debates,because he has reinserted into the billnot only the very few that were socialriders, but all the redundant, outdated,and irrelevant riders as well. What is the point, if we ever were striving to get a bill that could besigned? When even steps to remove pat-ently irrelevant material provokes dis-agreement, we seem well on our way toa veto of the D.C. bill. I had hoped for better this year. Please oppose this rule. Mr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he might consume to thegentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.I STOOK ), the chairman of the sub- committee. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity tospeak. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule, which enables us to go forwardwith this bill which, in addition to theDistrict of Columbia's own tax rev-enue, and budget allocates $414 millionfrom the taxpayers in the rest of theUnited States of America to the Dis-trict of Columbia. b1300 Now one might have thought, from listening to people, that we are notdoing anything for the District of Co-lumbia, and here is $414 million, Fed-eral money from the rest of the coun-try, not going to New York City, notgoing to Chicago or Los Angeles orOklahoma City, we do not make directappropriations to those communitiesor to any others, only the District ofColumbia. This is in addition to itsown tax revenues and budget, in addi-tion to qualifying for Federal grantsfrom all sorts of other sources. In addi-tion to those, the District of Columbiagets $414 million directly from the Fed-eral Government. We do it year afteryear. Why? Because the District of Co-lumbia is not just another city. It isthe Nation's capital, so designated inthe United States Constitution. As the Nation's Capital, it has a very different relationship. Now, I heard the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. N ORTON ) in this House say, and I think thesewere the words, that what happens hereshould not concern anyone not a resi- dent of D.C., and said people should notbe concerned with a city not their own.If that were the case, we would not betalking about $414 million for Wash-ington, D.C., but we are because Wash-ington, D.C. is not just another city. The Constitution specifies it is the Capital of the United States of Amer-ica, and as the Capital it has a distinctposition. Article I, section 8 of the U.S.Constitution says that exclusive con-trol over all legislation, in all caseswhatsoever, for the District of Colum-bia resides right here in the Congressof the United States, because theFounding Fathers knew that the Na-tion's Capital would be distinct, wouldbe different. One thing they wanted to be sure was that the Nation's Capital was in har-mony with the rest of the country. Wedo not want one thing going on in whatis supposed to symbolize and representAmerica that is totally foreign to therest of the country. We do not want oneset of standards in the Nation's Capitalthat is inconsistent with Federal lawor that is inconsistent with the valuesof the Nation. So to create that consistency, the Constitution says legislative controlover the Nation's city belongs to theNation. I realize that is difficult sometimes for people that live here to recognizewhy it is set up that way, but to saythat this should not concern peoplewho are not residents or this is a citythat does not belong to the rest of thecountry, I have to disagree. When onecomes here and they see the best ofWashington, they visit the Capitol,they see the Lincoln Memorial, theWashington Monument, the JeffersonMemorial, the new memorials to FDR,to Korean veterans, the Vietnam vet-erans, the one underway for World WarII veterans, they see those things andthey get a sense, they get an inspira-tion from it. Then to be told, oh, no,they are not a part of this, this is nottheir city, sure it is. It is the Nation'scity. That is why we do things and will do things here today, to try to make surethat Washington, D.C. is in harmonywith the Nation. If we are not the Na-tion's city would we have the hundredsof thousands of people that are em-ployed here because the Federal Gov-ernment is located here? No, the Dis-trict of Columbia would not have thatguarantee of employment, of revenue,of opportunity that comes with it. Itwould not enjoy that. The District also would not have the burdens that come with it; the Presi-dential inauguration, for example,coming up. One of the things in thisbill is approximately $6 million to re-imburse D.C. for special expenses thatit will have when the presidential inau-guration occurs, the security needs, allthe influx of Americans coming herefor the presidential inaugural. Nowsome cities would be saying, hey, thatis great for business, that is great forCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7024 July 26, 2000 tourism; we do not need the extra money to pay for these additionalcosts; that revenue itself is going to beenough. We have not taken that approach with D.C. We have said they have anextra burden. We want to help themwith it. So some of the money whichthe gentlewoman complains about, andsays I wish it were applied some placeelse, is to reimburse the District of Co-lumbia for this expense when they haveto have all of the overtime, all theextra work by their transit people,their public safety people, their peoplethat work with waste disposal, withcleaning up afterward. It is a big ex-pense, and we are trying to be respon-sible in taking care of that. Washington, D.C., in addition to $414 million of Federal money from the restof the country under this bill, stillqualifies the same as any other munici-pality and school district in the Nationto receive Federal grants, Federal as-sistance, Federal funds that help theirschools. In addition, they get transpor-tation grants. One of the riders of which the gentle- woman complains is to improve theability of Washington, D.C. to fullyqualify for grants from the Environ-mental Protection Agency, becausethey do have pollution problems, espe-cially the Anacostia River. We pro-vided special funding to help withcleaning that up. We are doing thesethings because we do believe Wash-ington, D.C. belongs to all of us. We donot all live here. There is a differencebetween people who live here and peo-ple who do not, but that difference isnot to say that the Nation's Capitaldoes not belong to all of us. It does be-long to all of us. It must belong to allof us, and if we want to have pride inthe country we have to have pride andconfidence in what is happening inWashington, D.C. If we find out that the District is going off in a totally different direc-tion and thereby become the symbolfor the whole country, we have tomake sure that it is in tune instead. Sosometimes the local officials do thingsand Congress says, no. If you were inNew York, if you were Chicago, if youwere Detroit, if you were Phoenix, ifyou were Tampa, if you were Wiscon-sin's Madison, any of these other com-munities, we would not do that becausethey are not the Nation's Capital. They do not belong to all of us, but we will do some things differently. This rule makes in order an oppor- tunity to consider those things, andMembers have had the opportunity topresent them. Now I heard the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. N ORTON ) say, well, we have riders on the bill andsome of them have been there too long.Well, what was not mentioned was wewent through and we dropped 25 provi-sions that have been carried year afteryear after year after year in this billthat we did not see where they servedany further purpose. We knocked out 25of them.Now, are there some others that still need to go? We are going to look atthem and continue to make deletionsas we go through the process. If some-thing is actually outdated or coveredby some other provision of law, we willcontinue working with people to dothat. But the ones that remain are theones in harmony with what I have ex-plained, that distinct relationship be-tween the Nation's Capital and the Na-tion. It is not just another city. We have in this bill, and this is a pro- gram adopted last year, we have in thisbill millions of dollars to provide as-sistance to any student who has grad-uated from public school, or privateschool for that matter, in the Districtof Columbia. I think the cutoff date issince 1998. This program provides themassistance up to $10,000 a year to go tocollege. We have not done that for anyother community in the country. We think there are good reasons why we have set it up, because there is nota State education system and there aredefinitely education problems, majorones, here in the District of Columbia.That program was started last yearand every penny necessary for everystudent who qualifies is fully funded inthis bill, plus a reserve fund of aboutan extra 12 percent. We hear people say but the President requested more. Well, last year we ap-propriated $17 million for the program.Guess what? Now that we have had ayear to get the program in motion tofind out how much it really costs, wefound out that $14 million does the job.So there is a $3 million carryover. Sowe do not need to appropriate as muchnext year, but we have still gone 12percent beyond what they figured theyneeded next year just to be sure. Just because we do not give the same amount of money as the President re-quests does not justify coming here andsaying, oh, our budget is being cut. No,that simply is not true. We are not cut-ting a single penny from the budgetsubmitted by the District of Columbiawith the control board that has beenhelping it out with oversight. Not asingle penny is cut from their budget.We have approved their budget, and wehave $414 million of Federal money be-yond that. The Federal Government, a couple of years ago, assumed new responsibil-ities. We are in charge of funding thecourt system. We are in charge of fund-ing the probation and parole services.We are in charge of funding the prisonsystem. That consumes most of the$414 million, and we fund that in here. Yes, sometimes Federal agencies sub- mit budgets to us, and we make adjust-ments, but we have not adjusted theDistrict's own budget. Now let us talk about this Metro sta- tion. We have put over $7 million ofFederal money in this bill and allo-cated an additional $18 million from anaccount where the District depositsfunds it gets from the Federal govern-ment and collects interest on those andother funds. We have said they can usethe rest. Last year it was Congress that made the decision on how to use thatsame fund, to assist the District withbuy-outs of its employees because theyhave a big problem with too manyworkers not doing enough work. To tryto reduce the size of the work force theMayor, Anthony Williams, who is agood man and a good mayor, says he needs to reduce the size by buying outpeople's contracts. And we providedmoney from the same fund last year,done by this Congress, to help themwith what the Mayor said was his toppriority. This year, we are told the top pri- ority is the Metro station, we said fine,we will make that money availablefrom that same fund for the Metro sta-tion, and suddenly we are told, oh, weare meddling; that they should nothave to use that fund for the metroconstruction. Contrary to what has been claimed by some people before, that fund is notpart of the District's budget. The Dis-trict has not put any budget here thatsays this is a part of our budget tospend it. What they have done, sincewe said we will put it on their top pri-ority then, they have come up with alaundry list and say, oh, we want tospend it on some different things in-stead. Some of those things are bo-nuses for people working in the May-or's office. Some of those things areseverance pay, perhaps golden para-chutes, for this control board that hasbeen helping with the fiscal responsi-bility in helping D.C. get its budgetback in balance, which they have doneand they deserve a lot of credit forthat, both D.C. and the control board,because they were in deficit for somany years and now they are in their4th year of having a budget surplus;and we want that to continue. As this control board goes out of ex- istence, they want to double theirbudget in their last year, double theirbudget in their last year. They want togo into this fund, which we say oughtto go to the New York Avenue Metrostation, and they say no, we ought tohelp double the budget in the last yearfor the control board so we can have allof these real nice severance pay pack-ages for them. That is what this debate is about. We have funded the priorities of the Dis-trict. Every penny that is necessary forwhat has been authorized in this col-lege assistance program is in the bill,paid for. We have provided the moneyfor the New York Avenue Metro sta-tion. Now we were told those are thetop two priorities, and we have been re-sponsible and handled them respon-sibly. Had this been the top two prior-ities for any other city in the country,do my colleagues think they would geta direct Federal appropriation for itlike this? No. They might qualify forFederal assistance through differentgrant programs and apply for this andso forth, but they would not just get ithanded to them on a silver platter, say-ing because they are Washington, D.C.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7025 July 26, 2000 we are going to do something more for them. We are trying to be responsibleand do that, and it really galls me tohear some people in the District grip-ing; ``well, this is being done for us butwe want more.'' The rest of the country does not ap- preciate that. The rest of the country,if they see somebody from Washington,D.C. in their State and the licenseplate says ``Washington, D.C., taxationwithout representation,'' what willthey think? Something very differentthan people in the District will think.Others around the country will think,yes, they are taking my money and Iam not getting enough representationfor it. Let us have some perspective here. We have a special responsibility for theCapital of the United States of Amer-ica. It has severe drug problems. It hassevere crime problems. It has some de-crepit public schools that need im-provement for the future of our kids. Ithas major management problems and ahuge bureaucracy that has more confu-sion and more complexity than theFederal bureaucracy, but still it is theNation's Capital and we are doingthings trying to help D.C. come backand rebound. b1315 And I hear people come up on this Floor and try to pretend, oh, you arenot doing this and you are not doingthat. Take a look at what we are doing.This is a good bill. It deserves supportfrom every Member of this body. It de-serves support from people who say, Ido not want to give money to Wash-ington, D.C., because I do not like a lotof the things they do there. I under-stand that; I do not like a lot of thingsthe District does either. But it is theNation's Capital; it was set up dif-ferently under the Constitution. Theydo not get the same tax base that somepeople do because of all of the Federal land here. There are restrictions on construc- tion, for example, of high-rise buildingsthat do not exist elsewhere, because ofnational security issues. The Districtis different. We should be helping theDistrict, whether one is on the right, oron the left, or in the middle. We aredoing the right thing with this bill. Be-cause it gives us a fair chance to con-sider the differences, the rule should beadopted, and the bill as well. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. PEASE ). The Chair notes a disturbance in the gallery in contravention of thelaw and the Rules of the House. TheSergeant at Arms will remove thosepersons responsible for the disturbanceand restore order to the gallery. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-ginia (Mr. M ORAN ). Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speak- er, this rule should be rejected. Let me first say to the chairman of the subcommittee, I appreciate hisfeelings that are inspired by the Fed- eral monuments, whether it be theF.D.R. Memorial, the Vietnam Memo-rial, the Washington Monument, or theLincoln Memorial. Of course, that is allon Federal land, it is owned by theFederal Government, it is run by theInterior Department through the Na-tional Park Service. That is not atissue here. What we are talking about here is the people who live within the Districtof Columbia who buy their own home,who are responsible for maintainingtheir own property, who elect theirown representatives, and would liketheir representatives to be able to rep-resent them, but would not like theCongress necessarily to be overruling their elected representatives, becausethey have no democratic right to holdus accountable, and that is the problemwith this bill. The legitimately electedrepresentatives of the District of Co-lumbia are being overridden by Mem-bers of Congress who will never be heldaccountable for what they do to theDistrict of Columbia. In terms of the budget, we made a deal back in 1997. Basically, becausethe District of Columbia has no Stateto support it, there are certain func-tions that we agreed we would pick up,and those functions are being short-changed in this bill to the tune of $31million. The bill is even $22 million lessthan last year's level. For those rea-sons, plus four specific reasons, I thinkthis rule should be rejected. First of all, it protects four Repub- lican amendments, which are all of theRepublican amendments that were of-fered. Those Republican amendments,if they were treated the same way asthe Democratic amendments, would besubject to a point of order. The Demo-cratic amendments are all subject to apoint of order. The gentlewoman fromthe District of Columbia (Ms. N ORTON ) wanted to offer a ``Democracy'' amend-ment. I think she has some very com-pelling arguments, and I totally agreewith those arguments; but they aregoing to be ruled out of order. We can-not bring them up, we cannot get avote on them, because they are notprotected. Why? Because they wereDemocratic amendments. Secondly, two of these Republican amendments that could have beenruled out of order are wholly contraryto what we would do to our own citi-zens in the jurisdictions that we are le-gitimately elected to represent. TheTiahrt needle exchanges amendmentinserts new language that will kill theDistrict's private needle exchange pro-gram that is run by a local nonprofitorganization. It negates it. We aregoing to show that. It means that, de-spite what the House full Committeeon Appropriations did, this program,run by a private organization, will notbe able to operate. No Federal and nolocal public funds are involved in thisprogram, and yet we are going to en-sure that it cannot even operate. The Bilbray smoking amendment would impose Federal penalties andsanctions on children caught smoking. That is a well-intentioned thing to do,but no other jurisdiction in this coun-try faces a similar Federal penalty forchildren caught smoking. We wouldnever do that to any district we rep-resent. It is clearly legislating on anappropriations bill. There is not oneMember of this body that would imposethis restriction on any citizen thatelects them directly to represent them. Third, it protects the bill against a point of order that could be raisedagainst a whole host of provisions inthis bill that are legislating on an ap-propriations and have no business in anappropriations bill. We do not havethose type of legislative restrictions onany other appropriations bills. Theyare punitive provisions put in to fixone-time situations and left in there. Lastly, these amendments are a clear violation of the spirit of District homerule, offering amendments that pro-hibit the District from implementinglocal initiatives where no Federalfunds are involved. It is an abuse ofcongressional power. With the passageof the 1997 D.C. Revitalization Act thateliminated direct Federal payments tothe district, the context and cir-cumstances with which Congress mighthave justified past intervention is nowgone. Federal taxpayer funds are notinvolved, we should not be involved,and that means we should vote againstthe rule. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I urge a no vote on the rule. Mr. Speaker, I have no further re- quests for time and I yield back thebalance of my time. Mr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule sowe can begin the important debate onthe Washington, D.C. Appropriationsbill for 2001. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previousquestion on the resolution. The previous question was ordered.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered as havingbeen read the first time. Under the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. I STOOK ) and the gen- tleman from Virginia (Mr. M ORAN ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. I STOOK ). Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this is the appropria- tion bill that we consider each year forthe District of Columbia, the Capital ofthe United States of America. In addi-tion to local monies and in addition tomonies that the District receives, justas other communities and other Statesdo through different Federal programsfor transportation, for education, forpublic assistance, for Medicaid andMedicare; in addition to all of those,this bill appropriates $414 million forthe District of Columbia to operate itsprisons, its courts, and the program ofsupervising those that are on someform of probation or parole. And even beyond that, this makes ad- ditional monies available for a numberof special items in the District of Co-lumbia, such as the new expansion ofthe metro system, the subway systemCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7027 July 26, 2000 in the District; funding for a special college tuition program that providesthousands of dollars to D.C. students togo to college, dollars that are not pro-vided to students from any other partof the country; providing environ-mental cleanup monies; or providingassistance in the development and thestrengthening of the charter schoolmovement here in the District of Co-lumbia. I do not want to detail all of them right now. I do not think I need to. Mr.Chairman, as I made the point earlier,this is a different community than anyother community in the Nation or wewould not be talking about this. Wewould not be making special moneyavailable to D.C. were it not our Na- tion's Capital. We have a Nation's Capital that was in severe financial straits, basicallybankrupt financially, a few years ago;murder rates were at the top of thecharts; failure rates in schools at thebottom. This Congress got busy severalyears ago and created a plan to re-structure and restrengthen the Districtof Columbia, to get it back on its feet.And I want to applaud the people thatwere involved in this Congress, the peo-ple that were involved in the adminis-tration, the people involved in the Dis-trict government, the people involvedon the control board that was set up tooversee the District government, whocollectively have worked together andhave brought the Nation's Capital outof bankruptcy so that this year, for thefourth straight year, they are going tohave a budget surplus. The figure I amhearing is they are looking at a surplusof about $280 million. That is great. Now, it would not have happened, Mr. Chairman, had the Federal Govern-ment not assumed some direct liabil-ities that other States and commu-nities face themselves, such as I men-tioned earlier, the prison system, thecourt system and so forth. We also as-sumed some retirement obligationsthat are not directly appropriated butare paid through the Federal Govern-ment, and increased the Federal shareof Medicaid reimbursements from 50percent to 70 percent. So, with thathelp, and some of it seen and some un- seen, but with an agreement of involve-ment and help of this Congress, theDistrict of Columbia is back on its fi-nancial feet. They still have severe problems in schools, with drugs, with crime, butthere is also a resurgence of the busi-ness community. The D.C. Council\u00d0and they deserve all the credit in theworld for this\u00d0a year ago they led theway saying that D.C. was going to re-duce taxes on people here because theywanted people to come back and live inthe city. Tens of thousands of peopleover the years moved out of the Dis-trict. We want them back and we wantto create financial incentives as well asa better and safer place for the people who live here, who work here, and whovisit here. The District has made a lot of finan- cial progress. But everything is notstraightened out yet, and we under-stand that and we are trying to workpatiently. There is a new Mayor: An-thony Williams. He is a good mandoing a good job, really focusing onworking the bureaucracy and getting itwhittled down because it consumes re-sources and it stops things from hap-pening that ought to be happening,whether it is a business that wants apermit or whether it is a matter of run-ning the D.C. General Hospital. Now, here we have a public hospital that already gets tens of millions ofdollars each year in direct subsidiesfrom the District government and stillhas been going beyond that. They havetaken hundreds of millions of dollars inmoney that was not even budgeted. Itwas not even budgeted. And here iswhere I will fault the local govern-ment. They took money that was noteven budgeted, and hundreds of mil-lions of dollars were supposedly loanedto the hospital and then they wrote offthe loans. The District needs to be hon-est in its budgeting. And taxpayers arenot getting their monies' worth in pub-lic health benefits, yet they are payinginordinately high amounts for it. Andthey are paying through the use ofgimmicks such as loans, which theythen write off.I say that as one example of the man- agement problems and the waste prob-lems that are still severe in the Dis-trict. If they took even half the moneythat they were wasting and applied itto things like a metro station, or acleanup problem, or an economic devel-opment problem, whatever it might be,they would not need to ask for specialmoney from Congress to help with the revitalization of the District of Colum-bia. They would have it. So we are trying to work with them on all fronts. This bill does that. Ithelps with the charter school move-ment, which is a part of public schools,but is run differently without the nor-mal school bureaucracy, that is ap-proaching 15 percent of the students inD.C. public schools. These parents havechosen to send their children to a pub-lic charter school instead of one of theother regular public schools, and weare trying to help give them equal foot-ing with the regular public schools asfar as the way that public resources areallocated and the way the bureaucracytreats them so the bureaucracy doesnot try to hold them back but, for thebenefit of the future of these kids, itlets them advance. So we will have a debate, Mr. Chair- man, on many of these different items.I know it is not all financial. Life isnot just all about money, and being theNation's Capital and being in harmonywith the rest of the country is not allabout money either. I appreciate the gentleman from Vir- ginia (Mr. D AVIS), who chairs the au- thorizing committee, the oversightcommittee. We have not worked withhim as smoothly as we should have onmany things, but he and his committeehave been so supportive of helping D.C.to get back on its feet and helping tomake reforms happen in Washington,D.C. Mr. Chairman, I am submitting here- with for the R ECORD a chart comparing the amounts recommended in H.R. 4942with the appropriations for fiscal year2000 and the request for fiscal year 2001:CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7028 July 26, 2000 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7029 July 26, 2000 Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I mayconsume. Mr. Chairman, the District of Colum- bia has 13 elected city council mem-bers; they have an elected mayor; andthere are six members on the controlboard that are not elected but have re-sponsibility. It is more members thanwe have on the Subcommittee on theDistrict of Columbia of the Committeeon Appropriations, and yet we gave theelected representatives of the Districtof Columbia 1 day of hearings and thenturned around the very next day andmarked up this bill. In the markup we decided to impose our fixes on some of the most seriousproblems that the District faces. Forexample, let me just give one example.In Anacostia, in the poorest part ofthis city and one of the poorest parts ofthis Nation, where there are homicidesthat occur on a nightly basis, wherethere is some of the worst poverty anddesperation, rapes and all the thingsthat occur when too many low-incomepeople are forced into desperate cir-cumstances, they depend on what iscalled D.C. General Hospital. The folkswho use that hospital do not havehealth insurance, for the most part,and the care they need is very expen-sive care and it is very difficult to getdoctors and health care professionalsworking there. So what we decided to do, because they have management problems andfinancial problems, is to say that D.C.General cannot use its line of creditany more. It is actually operated bywhat is called the Public Benefits Cor-poration. We are now told that meansthat this hospital goes under; it willbecome insolvent within a year, as wellas the Southeast Community and anumber of health care clinics in South-east D.C. that deal with women andchildren throughout the neighbor-hoods. Now, an alternative might have been to consult with the mayor, the citycouncil, the professional experts work-ing on this problem. But we did not dothat. We gave 1 day, then imposed oursolutions. I do not think that is theway we should be doing things. Now, we are going to talk at greater length on that when we have a specificdiscrete amendment on that issue, butit is typical of a number of what arecalled general provisions in this billthat attempt to legislate and to over-ride what D.C.'s legitimately electedofficials are trying to do to solve theirown problems. But in addition to that,we have a funding shortfall. The bill is$31 million short of what the adminis-tration and the District of Columbiagovernment requested. It is $22 millionbelow what Congress appropriated forthe District of Columbia last year. Now, what excuse can we offer? We are in a time of great surplus. This isone of the cities that needs help themost. It is our capital city, and wemade a commitment in the 1997 D.C. Revitalization Act to assume certainresponsibilities; to make them Federalresponsibilities. And now, in this bill,we are shortchanging the D.C. govern-ment, reneging on our commitment tothe tune of $31 million. In a $1.7 trillionbudget we cannot find $31 million tomeet our own commitments? The factis we can, but we choose not to. Now, with this lower allocation, what don't we fund? Well, we have two criti-cally needed economic developmentinitiatives in the District, and one iscompletion of a New York Avenuemetro station. The private sector, thebusiness community, said that theywould put up $25 million, D.C.'s owntaxpayers said they would put up $25million, and the Federal Governmentwas to put up $25 million as well. Thisbill does not do that, though. They mettheir share, we are not meeting ourshare. We are putting up $7 million in fed- eral funds. We are going to use $18 mil-lion from an interest account that ex-ists, but we find out now that the $18million does not exist. It has alreadybeen used in the D.C. budget that hasalready been submitted; that has beenapproved by the District and will be-come law unless Congress disapproveit, which we will not do. So the $18 million does not exist. It is a shell game. It is double counted. Sowe are underfunding the New York Av-enue metro station when two-thirds ofit is not even being funded by the Fed-eral Government. And then there is the Poplar Point brownfield remediation project, an ex-cellent project. We agree with it. Wegive it all the rhetoric and none of themoney that it needs. b1400 We will not have the funds to extend the foster care adoption incentives.There are kids languishing in the fos-ter care. There are people that want toadopt them, good parents, and weunderfund that. It even underfunds ourown Financial Control Board that weset up to oversee the District's budget. So I do not think that this is a bill that we should be particularly proudof. But even more troubling, once againwe are going to debate a series of socialriders and address some new ones aswell that violate the principle of de-mocracy and home rule and restricthow the District may elect to use itsown funds to address its own set of pri-orities. Earlier this year I asked the gen- tleman from Oklahoma (ChairmanI STOOK ) if we could not start with a clean appropriations bill this year,clear it of all of last year's general pro-visions that did not belong in an appro-priations bill. The District of Colum-bia, the Mayor, and the President ofthe United States followed this rec-ommendation in their budget. But wehave not done so. We have got 68 superfluous general provisions; and in the vast majority ofthem we would never think of imposing these kind of punitive, paternalistic re-strictions on any jurisdiction that wewere elected to represent. Why do we do it to the District of Co- lumbia? We do it to the District of Co-lumbia because they cannot fight back,they are helpless, we have control overthem, and they cannot vote us out ofoffice. They cannot hold us responsible.They cannot do a darn thing to us. Andso we beat up on them with these kindsof restrictive provisions and make our-selves look good back home. So we are going to offer a series of amendments here. I know we will prob-ably lose them, and many of them aregoing to be found out of order becauseof this rule that protected Republicanamendments and did not protect theDemocratic initiatives. One of them deals with a controver- sial issue, medicinal use of marijuana.But what did we do? We decided thatD.C. took a referendum, and we pre-vented them for the last year fromeven counting the results of that ref-erendum. Well, that is not the responsible way to address a controversial issue. I willnot get into that any further except tosay this is not the way that we treat acommunity; it is not the way we wouldtreat communities within our district. We have got a domestic partners law, and it says that D.C. cannot offerhealth insurance for domestic partners.But yet 3,000 employers across thecountry do it in any number of Stateand local jurisdictions. We never re-strict any of those States and local ju-risdictions. We did not tell employersthey cannot do it, but we tell D.C. itcannot do it. There is a Contraceptive Coverage Act that has received a lot of publicity.It does seem that if a health insurancecompany is going to cover things likeViagra for men, it ought to cover con-traception for women. That seems onlyfair and equitable. We put in legislation that said that they cannot do that unless they in-clude the kind of religious exemptionand ability to opt out on the grounds ofmoral objections, which makes sense,except that it is very broad and, again,we do not do it to anyone else. I think D.C. should be able to control these issues on their own. They are theones that are being held responsible.The Mayor is going to pocket veto thecontraceptive coverage and insist onthe religious exemption clause. But lethim do it. He is held accountable. Letthem make that kind of decision. It isnot up to us to be doing that. And the same legislation exists in 13 States. We have not tried to restrictthem in any of those States that wehave legitimate control over. Again, there are a number of specific situations that are objectionable inthis bill. We have 68 general provisionsthat I mentioned. Many of them werepunitive. They were one-time meas-ures. Five of them are already Federallaw. We have got another dozen rough-ly that are already included in the D.C.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7030 July 26, 2000 Code or in the D.C. budget. To include them is superfluous. Why do we leave this junk in an ap- propriations bill? We want to clear itout. That amendment should have beenmade in order. Mr. Chairman, we will now embark upon probably a spirited and controver-sial debate. But the bottom line is thatwe ought not be having this debate be-cause every issue we will discuss hasbeen discussed by the members of theDistrict of Columbia City Council, hasbeen considered by the Mayor, has beenconsidered by the citizens of the Dis-trict of Columbia. We live in a democracy. They should be able to exercise their democraticrights, and we should not be overrulingthem. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida(Mr. Y OUNG ), chairman of the full Com- mittee on Appropriations. Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Chair- man, I rise in support of the bill. I want to compliment the chairman and members of the subcommittee.This was not an easy bill to bring be-fore the subcommittee or the full com-mittee. There were considerable dif-ferences of opinion, to say the least. However, I am happy to report to our colleagues the good news. This is thefinal appropriations bill to go throughthe House of Representatives in thisphase of our appropriations process.Not only is this number 13, but theHouse has already concluded work onthe Supplemental. We haveconferenced the Supplemental. Wehave conferenced the Military Con-struction appropriations bill. We haveconferenced the Defense Appropria-tions bill. And several other con-ferences are under way as we speak. So we are moving right along. I think the Members will be happy to hear thatthis is the final bill, this is the 13thbill. I wanted to say something about the process. The gentleman from Virginia(Mr. M ORAN ) when he spoke earlier talked about treating the Democraticamendments one way and Republicanamendments another way. I will say toour colleagues that during the entireprocess on this bill and every other billwe have treated both Republicans andDemocrats the same way. If an amend-ment was germane to the bill, we de-bated the amendment as much time asthe Members wanted. And on occasionthat was a lot of time. But we tookwhatever time was necessary to giveeverybody a fair opportunity to presenttheir views and to support or opposethe amendments that were before thecommittee. Here in the House, on each of those amendments that we knew were sub-ject to a point of order, we allowed theMember who sponsored that amend-ment sufficient time to explain theamendment before we ever pressed forthe point of order. So I think we havebent over backwards.I served here for a long time in the minority, and I do not recall that everhappening to one of our amendmentswhen we were in the minority. If therewas a point of order lying, the point oforder was raised and the amendmentwas stricken at that point. In fact, on one occasion, just a few days ago, we allowed 3 hours of debateunder unanimous consent on an amend-ment offered by the Democratic side ofthe House knowing full well that it wassubject to a point of order. The sponsorof the amendment knew that it wassubject to a point of order, but yet weallowed 3 hours of debate. Now, how the gentleman could sug- gest that we have treated Democratsdifferently than Republicans I do notknow. But we have bent over back-wards to be extremely fair to bothsides of the aisle. And what is fair forone side is fair for the other. I hope that we can resolve these dif- ferences today, Mr. Chairman; and Ihope that we can pass this bill and letthe appropriators get busy with theconference meetings with the otherbody so we can conclude our appropria-tions business well ahead of the begin-ning of the fiscal year. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 5 minutes to the gentle-woman from the District of Columbia(Ms. N ORTON ), who is the one person ac- tually elected by the D.C. residents torepresent them. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me thetime. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak for the city where free Americans reside, notthe Federal city. The Federal city be-longs to everyone. As free Americancitizens, Wards 1 through 8 belong tothose of us who live in the District ofColumbia. Each year lots of time has been spent debating the minutia of details of onecity far afield from urgent nationalbusiness and outside the competence ofnational legislators. The result, with-out exception, has been multiple vetoesthat ultimately result in turningaround the very controversial amend-ments voted into this bill or substan-tially changing them. When will we learn? Hopefully, this year. There is not enough time left inthis session to play games with theD.C. appropriation. The Mayor, the D.C. council and I have been clear about our two majorobjections to this bill. One: not merelycuts, but redirection of the remainingfunds from indispensable prioritiesthat the Mayor and the council specifi-cally requested Federal funds to cover,including a subway station that is es-sential to the District's number oneeconomic priority and to a new FederalATF facility on New York Avenue; andtwo: reinserting into the bill not onlysocial riders, to which we have alwaysobjected, but gratuitously a far largernumber of riders that are so out ofdate, or irrelevant that OMB and theDistrict believed that no Memberwould want the bill encumbered with them. A new administration that is clean- ing house in the city and streamliningD.C. government deserves at least to berelieved of outdated and redundant rid-ers from prior city administrations. The dollars used in this bill to pay for items meant to be federally fundeddeserve special mention and has beendiscredited in a June 30 GAO reportcommissioned by the chairman him-self. The bill requires D.C. to use interest accumulated on D.C. accounts insteadof Federal money in the President'sbudget. Yet the June 30 GAO report tothe chairman stated that Congress hasalready instructed the District on howthe interest must be used. The GAOconcluded: ``As a result, the Districtdoes not have any interest earnings onavailable Federal funds.'' The Mayor and the city council have made their views known in writing tothe chairman, and I have had some dis-cussions with him. The bill is not yetacceptable to the District, and I askmy colleagues to vote no on this bill. We are not naive about bills before this body. We are prepared to supportany amendments or changes thatwould produce not the preferred billbut a better bill. To accomplish this, itwill take more give and take and morerespect for the local prerogatives freelygiven to every other locality than thisbill reflects for the District. Let us get to work and challenge our- selves to do better. Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 4 minutes to the distin-guished gentleman from Virginia (Mr.D AVIS). Mr. DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I thank my friend, the distin-guished chairman of the full com-mittee, for yielding me the time. My compliments to the chairman and the ranking member for the time andenergy they and their staffs have putforward devoted to reviewing the D.C.budget and bringing this bill to thefloor in a timely manner. Just a few years ago, the District of Columbia government faced a financialcrisis of epic proportions. That situa-tion was so severe that the Districtcould not deliver basic services, andthere was a very real concern that itwould run out of cash to pay its debtservice or to even meet its payroll. Today, the city's population is stabi- lizing, the real estate market is up,suburban residents are making moreleisure trips into the city, and jobshave increased dramatically. Next year, the Control Board will go in a dormant state, as anticipated inthe legislation that we passed here in1995. The city has balanced its budgetfor a fourth straight year; and its lead-ers are showing, with only a handful ofexceptions, that they are focused onfostering economic growth and deliv-ering basic services. This budget goes a long way toward continuing the tremendous strides weCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7031 July 26, 2000 have made in the Nation's capital over the past 6 years. It funds a wide varietyof programs. It will greatly enhancethe quality of life for D.C. residentsand those who visit and work in thiswonderful city from enhanced resourcefor foster care, for drug treatment andpublic education, to money to clean upthe Anacostia River and construct aMetro Rail Station on New York Ave-nue. b1415 There are funds for a number of pro- grams to bolster opportunities for thecity's youth population, including$500,000 for character education and$250,000 for youth mentoring programs. And there is much more: $1 million for the Washington Interfaith Networkfor affordable housing in low-incomeneighborhoods and another $250,000 fornew initiatives to battle homelessness;$6 million to cover the city's costs as-sociated with the 2001 presidential in-auguration; $250,000 for Mayor Williamsto simplify personnel practices, moneywhich will allow the city to build onthe many improvements already underway in the area of management reform. But there are shortcomings to this bill as well. I am concerned, for exam-ple, that funding for the D.C. collegeaccess program, a program created bylegislation I introduced in the last Con-gress, is cut by $3 million in this budg-et. I am profoundly concerned that thisshortage could leave some D.C. stu-dents out in the cold, back in their olddisadvantaged position and unable tobecome all that they can and shouldbe. However, I am heartened by thefact that the Senate has a higher 302(b)allocation and that hopefully when thiscomes to conference some of thismoney can be restored. I urge my col-leagues to restore the funding level forthis historic program. The religious exemption or con- science clause that is in this legisla-tion may be rendered moot by the factthat the Mayor has said that he willpocket veto this legislation. In myjudgment, the city council made a hugemistake in not having a conscienceclause attached to their contraceptivecoverage legislation, but we ought tolet the city and encourage the city toremedy the mistakes they make. Thatis the only way democracy is going togrow and nurture, is not having us tryto redo everything that they do butmake them accountable for their ownordinances and their own mistakes. Inthis case, I think the council and mostimportantly the Mayor have stepped upto the plate and have said that theywould try to remedy this on their own. Overall, I commend the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. I STOOK ), though, for this forward-looking spending plan,a budget that ensures the District ofColumbia's renaissance will continuein coming years. I am proud to haveplayed a part in the city's rebirth thesepast years, and I want to thank the fel-low members of my subcommittee onthe authorizing side, the gentlewomanfrom the District of Columbia (Ms. N ORTON ), the ranking Democrat; and the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs.M ORELLA ), my vice chairman; and other Republicans and Democrats forthe work that they have done overthese past years to get the Districtback on its feet. I wish Mayor Williamsand the city council the best of luck inthe future. I think the city is in prettygood hands at this point. Although thisbill is not everything it can and prob-ably should be, this is a very difficultmeasure to craft, as we have foundevery year on this floor. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill.Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-tleman from Massachusetts (Mr.D ELAHUNT ). Mr. DELAHUNT. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my concern about theamendments regarding needle ex-change programs in the District of Co-lumbia that are being offered by thegentleman from Indiana (Mr. S OUDER ) and the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.T IAHRT ). The bill before us already bars the use of Federal funds to pay forthese programs. But the Souder amend-ment would go further. It would pro-hibit the people of the District fromusing their own money, money ob-tained through local taxation, for pro-grams that are widely supported by thelocal citizenry. This is unfair to D.C.citizens who find themselves subject tothe whims of representatives whomthey did not elect. But I would submitit is also a terrible precedent for thecountry as a whole, because despite thesqueamishness of some Members ofCongress at the mere sight of a needle,the truth is that these programs work.They prevent HIV infection. They donot encourage or increase drug abuse.In fact, there is solid evidence thatthey actually help reduce drug abuseby encouraging injection drug users toenter treatment. It is bad enough for legislators to overrule local decision-makers in mat-ters of this kind, but it is the worstkind of irresponsibility for us to sub-stitute our own uninformed opinionsfor the sound judgment of the publichealth community, to say, in effect,Our minds are made up. Don't confuseus with facts. I have seen what needle exchange programs have accomplished in Massa-chusetts, Mr. Chairman. I know theysave lives. If the Souder amendmentbecomes law, more people in Wash-ington, D.C., may be infected with theAIDS virus. More people will die of it.And our Nation's capital will continueto lose ground in its fight to protectthe public health of its citizens. On the other hand, if the Souder amendment is enacted, local needle ex-change programs in the District willsomehow manage to carry on theirwork without the benefit of publicfunding as they have been doing withthe current restrictions. But theTiahrt amendment would have a seri-ous and immediate impact on these ex-isting programs. It would prohibit them from distributing sterile needleswithin 1,000 feet of a school or univer-sity, public housing project, studentcenter or other recreational facility. Irealize the gentleman is trying to pro-tect children from exposure to unsafeneedles and the drugs that are used toinject. I only wish the problem werethat simple. As a former law enforce-ment official, I have spent considerabletime in our inner cities. The reality isthere are plenty of needles out therewell within 1,000 feet of schools andhousing projects and student centers,and those needles are not sterile. This amendment will do nothing to change that tragic reality. It will notkeep out the drugs and drug para-phernalia that litter these urban bat-tlegrounds, if you will. It will not keepout the diseases that are spread by ig-norance and lack of sanitation. What itwill do is make sure that these kidswho inject drugs and who live in theseneighborhoods, the very young peoplewho are at most risk for HIV/AIDS,hepatitis and other diseases trans-mitted through infected needles, willhave no recourse but to reuse unsterileequipment. We cannot cure the problem by throwing a cordon around our publicinstitutions. Only good science andsound health policy can do that. I urge my colleagues to reject these amendments. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas(Mr. T IAHRT ), one of the valued mem- bers of our subcommittee. (Mr. TIAHRT asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Chairman, I would like to step back just 6 years and lookat the District of Columbia because itwas a very different place then. Theywere running a budget deficit. Schoolswere failing. It was known as the mur-der capital. And crime had kept peoplein fear. The first interaction that I had with the District of Columbia was trying toget a constituent who had been killedby a taxi, have their body released tothe family. Red tape ruled in the Dis-trict of Columbia, and it was a verylarge task just to get the deceased re-leased to their family. But today it is a better city by a long ways. The D.C. budget is balanced, andthat is why it was accepted in this bill.The quality of education has improvedthrough charter schools and throughnew projects in public schools. It is asafer community to live in. And thepeople from Kansas are more com-fortable when they come to the Dis-trict of Columbia. Things have gottenbetter. But it did not happen by accident. Congress did get involved. It providedoversight. The D.C. control Board in-sisted on revisions to the city and tothe police department. The gentle-woman from the District of Columbia(Ms. N ORTON ) said earlier the FederalCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7032 July 26, 2000 city belongs to everyone. I think that is exactly what the writers of the Con-stitution had in mind when they gaveCongress, and I quote, ``power to exer-cise exclusive legislation in all caseswhatsoever,'' in article 1, section 8 ofour Constitution. The opponents of our bill say, Well, our cities aren't regulated like this, sowe shouldn't be involved. But if youtalk to the city councils in Kansas,they know that Congress has inter-vened. They have intervened throughthe Clean Air Act, through clean waterregulations, through transportationregulations, air travel regulations,labor regulations, wage restrictions.And the people in the city have beenregulated by Congress, too, healthcare, work requirements. Congress hasinjected itself into our schools, ourhospitals, our city councils and ourown homes. Congress does have over-sight of the District of Columbia. So the question is, How should we be involved in this process? I think one ofthe things that this bill does that isvery positive is that we go into theareas of this city which need to be re-claimed and provide mentoring pro-grams to children that are at risk, giv-ing a mentor to them, to be with themwhen they need to go to school to findout their homework assignments, whenthey need to go to the hospital or tothe physician, and God forbid theyshould have to go to court, the mentoris there with them. This bill providessuch help. It also provides a hotline sothat if someone is in need in this city,they call a hotline and they are not letoff the phone line until they are di-rectly connected with an agency thatcan provide directly for their need. There are other things we are going to debate. We are going to debatewhere we should deliver needlesthrough the drug needle exchange pro-gram. I personally think we ought toprotect the children. We have talked tothe District of Columbia Police Depart-ment. There are currently four loca-tions that would not be affected by myamendment where needles could be dis-tributed. As we continue this debate, Mr. Chairman, I hope we come to a conclu-sion and pass this bill today. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself 30 seconds on thisissue, we are going to have a little timelater on to discuss it, in terms of nee-dle exchange. D.C. has the worst problem of AIDS infection of women and children, andthe principal reason is the exchange ofdirty needles. The exchange of cleanneedles works, but it is very restrictedbecause of the Congress' intervention.This amendment would effectively pre-clude even private organizations frombeing able to address this problem.There are too many women and chil-dren dying of AIDS in D.C. We ought todo whatever is necessary to save theirlives. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 1\u00a42minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.BLUMENAUER ), the leader of the Smart Growth Initiative nationwide. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I can only imagine the frustration thatthe gentlewoman from the District ofColumbia (Ms. N ORTON ) must feel talk- ing about the special benefits that areaccorded to the District of Columbia;for indeed what we have done, the Dis-trict has special obligations that noother local government in the countryhas. It has the burdens of both a cityand a State and it does not have thetools that we give the rest of America.On top of that, Congress is interferingunnecessarily, making that job evenharder. Not only does it add unnecessary and outdated riders, but the budget that weare discussing here today is $22 millionbelow last year's funding level. Thefunding that remains is not fairly dis-tributed to the city's most urgent eco-nomic and educational priorities. I care specifically about livable com- munities, and I would like to referencetwo: one, the New York Avenue Metrostation and Poplar Point in SoutheastDistrict of Columbia. The proposedMetro station at New York and FloridaAvenues is the linchpin of proposednew economic development activity forthe District. We here in the District every day ex- perience poor air quality, choking traf-fic. We hear about problems of sprawland economic development. The pro-posed Metro station represents an im-portant step in bringing jobs and peo-ple together in a location that is con-venient for commuters and does not in-crease sprawl or require massive addi-tional infrastructure investments inoutlying areas. This has been extensively planned through public and private initiativeswith the District, the Federal Govern-ment, and the private sector each com-mitting one-third of the funds. Whilethe city and the private sector havestepped up, Congress is shirking itsduty by not providing the full $25 mil-lion in Federal funds that the Presi-dent has proposed. It includes only $7million directly and makes up the re-maining $18 million through account-ing gimmicks, including the borrowingon the city's interest fund which onlyhas $6 million left and is already obli-gated by other uses. The choice forced on the city to delay building the station or losingother important priorities is not ac-ceptable. We compound this missed op-portunity by the nearby developmentof the Metropolitan Branch Trail, thebicycle beltway within the Beltwaythat could have the $8 million that wehave already allocated through TEA\u00b121coordinated with the station. We risklosing both the station and the coordi-nation of the trail. It would be a trag-edy. Poplar Point, a 110-acre site along the southern corridor of the AnacostiaRiver, has the potential of becoming avital urban waterfront, serving theneeds of District residents who nowmust travel faraway to enjoy the wa- terfront amenities that are right out-side their and our door. Not only has the site been neglected by the Federal Government, but a por-tion of the environmental damage isthe result of pesticide residue left bythe Architect of the Capitol, becausethat was our nursery that operatedthere for many years. It adds a new di-mension of interference for the Con-gress in the District of Columbia. It il-lustrates the special responsibility weowe to the District both as a neighborand as a tenant. The bill does not provide the re- quested $10 million for environmentalcleanup and infrastructure improve-ment needed to spur the redevelopmentand improve the economic health forthe residents living near Poplar Point. b1430 Between the irrelevant riders, the limitations of the District's ability toself-govern, we are missing an oppor-tunity. It is not just unfair to the resi-dents of the District of Columbia, it isnot fair to the American public. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, I keep hearing people try to create a fiction that supposedlywe are not taking care of what the Dis-trict says is its top priority; namely,the Metrorail station at New York Av-enue. In fact, at the Full Committee,we shifted a few million dollars more ofFederal funds into the Metrorailproject, as well as the interest earningson the Federal and other funds that weare allocating. Mr. Chairman, I heard the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. B LUMENAUER ) say, oh, but the fund only has $6 million,and it does not have $18 million. Thatis not accurate. Mr. Chairman, whathas happened is after the control boardfound out that we thought that moneyshould go to the top priority of the Dis-trict, then we started receiving listssaying ``we have these things that werenot part of our budget, we want tospend this money on something dif-ferent than our top priority.'' And thatis where we found out they want tospend the money on more bonuses atcity hall and golden parachutes forpeople involved with the control board,to double their budget in the controlboard in their last year of operation,Mr. Chairman. I wanted to correct that, Mr. Chair- man; and I yield 4 minutes to the gen-tleman from California (Mr.C UNNINGHAM ), a member of our sub- committee. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, I live in D.C. and have for some time. Ihave sat and I have talked to residents,many of them minorities, and manysaying to me we need help for years and years and years. When we look atthe school systems, we look at theeconomy, we look at the AnacostiaRiver, the sewage systems, the crime,the drugs and the lack of response,they would say, I know you are a Re-publican, we are Democrat, but wouldyou help us?CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7033 July 26, 2000 I think this committee has done a lot in the last few years. I say to my col-leagues that for 30 years my D.C. waskind of an anachronism, that there wasnot that help and we let the D.C. rule,but then we had a mayor that ended upputting more cocaine up his nose thanworrying about the economy of his owncity. The good news is that Mayor Wil-liams is trying to work with us and domany of the things that we are tryingto do for this city. I lived by the train station and in one year, my car was broken into twice. Iheard a gunshot out my driveway, ayoung man was caught and said he justwanted to know what it felt like to killsomebody. Two of the women in mycomplex were mugged going into alocked gate. There is a grocery store,the little mom and pop store, acrossthe street was robbed six times in oneyear. The residents were saying, wehave to live in this, can you do some-thing, Mr. Congressman. Our children,the roofs on their schools are fallingapart. And my colleagues will remem-ber they had to cancel schools. Wefully funded schools. We establishedcharter schools. My own party wanted to cut funds from our public funds, and we were ableto work in a bipartisan way sayingthat our schools are moving in theright direction, let us fully fund them.And I think we have seen some move-ment. We have a long way to go in thisNation's Capital, but there are goodteachers. There are good schools, butmany of those schools are still failingand we need help. That is the direction we are working in. When I first arrived here, there wasa woman on the board that was ap-pointed by Marion Barry that couldnot read. She was on the committee onthe budget, but she had never had anaccounting course. She was a func-tioning illiterate, but yet she was a po-litical appointee. We appointed a boardto try and help that. And we have donea lot of very positive things in that. We wanted to work on something for D.C. We need a long-term sewage prob-lem. Every time it rains in Wash-ington, D.C., and it is raining rightnow, that raw sewage goes into theAnacostia River every time it rains. Ithas the highest fecal count in any riverin the United States, and we need toaddress that. The mayor is trying to take that up as well, the cleanup of the AnacostiaRiver. But I look at the economy.When I first came here, the city wasleft up to its own devices, they hadmonth-to-month leases. Now no busi-ness is going to come into the city andmake an investment, because peoplewere getting money under the table. They had governmental control over those businesses to make them do whatthey wanted, and no one would invest.And we looked at the businesses. Wecould not even get a Safeway here be-cause of the practices of the city coun-cils and the government, and we havechanged that, in a bipartisan way. Weare starting to get investment. We have increased those leases. We arestarting to get jobs into D.C., and Ithink that is positive change. I would say one thing about the Tiahrt amendment, if we look at hisamendment on drug exchange, none ofmy colleagues would want one of theseoutside their door, because it attractsdrug dealers, it attracts drug users.Needles are discarded. What his amend-ment says, where we have schools,where we have parks and swimmingpools, where children play barefootedand fall, that we do not want to haveour children to have the risk of thecontracting AIDS or other diseases likehepatitis. Mr. Chairman, I ask for a support of the bill. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself 10 seconds to re-spond to the gentleman from Okla-homa (Mr. I STOOK ). With regard to the use of the New York Avenue Metromoney, the reality is that that moneywas included in the D.C. budget, thatD.C. budget was received by the Con-gress before the bill was marked up.There is no way that the D.C. govern-ment could have known, and so thatmoney was already spent before wespent it again. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.C UMMINGS ), a most respected and effec- tive legislator. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman fromOklahoma (Mr. I STOOK ) for yielding the time to me and to say to the lastspeaker, the gentleman from California(Mr. C UNNINGHAM ), one of the inter- esting things is about the needle ex-change program in Baltimore, thereare people who actually want the nee-dle exchange program in certain areas,because they have discovered that itcleans up the needles. It gets rid of theproblem. I think that one should takea look at that, and that is somethingvery important. The other thing that I find so inter- esting is how the gentleman from Vir-ginia (Mr. D AVIS) and now the distin- guished gentleman from California(Mr. C UNNINGHAM ) have talked about the wonderful job that the mayor isdoing. He is doing an outstanding joband a wonderful job. I would also saythat the gentlewoman from the Dis-trict of Columbia (Ms. N ORTON ) is doing a wonderful job. At some point in time, folks ought to be able to control D.C. themselves. Wedo not have to have Big Brother hang-ing around forever and forever. I thinkthat it has been clear and it has beensaid here over and over again by bothsides that they are doing an out-standing job. The motto for the District of Colum- bia is justice to all. Justice in the formof the ability of District of Columbiaresidents to use their own funds to op-erate needle exchange programs inareas they deem appropriate. Justice inallowing D.C. to determine appropriatelaws to address the issue of tobacco use among minors. Justice in the right ofDistrict of Columbia residents and thecity council to approve and enact legis-lation that will permit city employeesto receive health insurance benefits fortheir long-term partners, regardless ofgender, and to require insurers and em-ployers to cover contraceptive if otherprescription drugs are covered. Justice in increased funding for Met- rorail construction at New York andFlorida Avenues, Northeast, an arearipe for economic development. Justice in increased funding for tui- tion assistance for District of Columbiacollege-bound students, helping to off-set out-of-State tuition costs at col-leges and universities across the coun-try. As a result of this program, nu-merous D.C. students applied to Mary-land colleges and universities, includ-ing 10 at Coppin State University andMorgan State University in my dis-trict. Justice in the right of the District to use funds to petition for or file a civilaction intended to obtain District vot-ing representation in Congress. Unfortunately, if this bill is passed in its current form, justice to all will notprevail. Instead, this body will send amessage to District residents that theyare not to be afforded justice, but areto be burdened with requirements thatCongress imposes on no other local ju-risdiction and stripped of their right tomake local decisions. I submit that it is our duty as law- makers to ensure that justice is ap-plied impartially and equally to all ofour Nation's citizens. Therefore, I urgemy colleagues to oppose this bill andsupport District residents and the prin-ciple of justice for all. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, there is a general principle we often quote here that says,you should not do for people what theyare capable of doing for themselves, be-cause you don't want to restrict theirability to grow and to achieve. It is not a matter of we do not want to help them, but it is a matter wewant to do it in the right way. I hear a lot of comments about we ought to be doing more for the Districthere, we ought to be doing more for theDistrict there. Then I hear people say,oh, we have cut this budget or thatbudget. For example, they claim, inac-curately, but they claim, that we havecut a Federal commitment to themetro subway station. Let us back up. What Federal commitment are we talking about? We are talking aboutthe budget proposal submitted by theWhite House which is not a budget sub-mitted or approved by the Congress.Just because something is proposed bythe President, let us not pretend that ifwe do not agree with the President onsomething, that we have gone out andwe have cut budgets or that we renegedon a commitment; that is not the case. We have made sure that rather than going to this new, after-the-budget,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7034 July 26, 2000 laundry list of things that now they say are higher priorities than themetro subway station, so we cannotspend money out of this account for it.Instead of doing that, we said no, weare going with the top priority of themetro station. Let us look at what the District is doing or not doing for themselves. Weknow they have remaining significantmanagement and financial problems.Let me just give my colleagues the fig- ures on just one of them. In addition tothe money budgeted and tens of mil-lions of dollars of subsidies that werebudgeted, the D.C. General Hospitalwith the Public Benefit Corporation inthe last 4 years has had loans, so-called, of $174 million, which were, infact, spending beyond what was author-ized or appropriated by law. In that one institution alone there was $174 million. On top of the sub-sidies, on top of their budget. We had ahearing on this, more than one hearingthat we had, and District officials in-cluding the central board said they arenot loans they are receivables becausethe hospital is supposed to pay it backout of money they receive. No, theyknow that. They do not even have thehospital sign any paper. There is nowritten agreement. The city and thecontrol board just write checks for mil-lions of dollars until they have gone$174 million in the hole, beyond theirbudget, beyond the subsidies, and thenthe District government writes it off. They have a group looking at it right now that is telling horror stories aboutthe level of management. In fact, thejust-fired individual in charge, eventhough people will say when he was incharge, this hospital got run into theground even farther than it was al-ready, he wants a million dollars sever-ance pay, a million dollars severancepay for helping something go $174 mil-lion in the red. That is the kind of priorities or lack of them that waste money, and thenthey come to Congress and say wemake up the difference, and then claimwe are reneging on a pledge made at1600 Pennsylvania Avenue if we do notjust rubber stamp that instead of try-ing to take a more responsible ap-proach. They say we are using too much of their money for these things. We areusing money of the taxpayers of theUnited States of America in this bill,$414 million. And we still have manage-ment problems. I agree that MayorWilliams is working diligently andmaking a bona fide effort, but if welook at who is still in charge, the upperlevel, what they call the ``exceptedservice'' positions, in other words,these are the people that can be hiredand fired by the mayor, as opposed tothrough a civil service system. The Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs still has 62 percentof the upper level people who are hold-overs from the prior administrationand administrations that had these se-vere problems with how they handledtaxpayers' money.b1445 In the Department of Employment Services, two-thirds, two-thirds arestill management holdovers. In the Of-fice of Contracting and Procurement,two-thirds are holdovers. In the De-partment of Public Works, 62 percent.There is a lot of change that has nothappened yet. There is a lot of savingsthe District can achieve in its ownbudget, and we are trying everythingwe can to help them to do that. But remember, you ought to come to this Congress, and if you are wantingpeople to do something because you arethe Nation's Capital, you ought toshow what you have done for yourself.We had, I believe it was $330 million inpast years, that this Congress providedto the District for management re-forms to achieve savings, and we hadthe General Accounting Office go in afew months ago and say, okay, wespent $330 million supposedly to createsavings beyond that figure. How muchsavings can you find? GAO said, well, you spent $330 mil- lion, and the savings were supposed tobe $200 million annually. What was ac-tually achieved was about $1.5 millionannually. You spend $330 million, andyou get back $1.5 million? That is nota good investment by the taxpayers.The District needs more focus on get-ting its own House in order. It is mak-ing progress, but it has not made nearenough. It needs more focus on that,rather than accusing the Congress ofnot doing its job. Mr. Chairman, I ask support for this bill. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, we debated the D.C. bill six timeson the floor, and it was vetoed twicelast year. The principal issue was nee-dle exchanges. We are going to havethe ranking member of the PermanentSelect Committee on Intelligence, andfor many years the chairman of theSubcommittee on the District of Co-lumbia of the Committee on Appropria-tions, the gentleman from Los Angeles,California (Mr. D IXON), explain how im- portant this needle exchange programis and why the amendment that isgoing to be offered will not work. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Los Angeles, Cali-fornia (Mr. D IXON). Mr. DIXON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding metime. This is the traditional day that when the city is wrong, it is wrong; and whenthe city is right, it is wrong. The bill provides to allow the city of Washington D.C. to have a needle ex-change program to use its own fundsand private funds. The gentleman fromKansas (Mr. T IAHRT ) is going to offer an amendment that basically sayswithin 330 yards of 14 designated areas,that you shall not be able to imple-ment the needle exchange program. Itis really a fox in sheep's clothing. Thegentleman from Kansas (Mr. T IAHRT ) inthe full committee voted against the program, so he is not here to in fact as-sist the needle exchange program inany way or for good public policy rea-sons. When the gentleman shows you a chart later, he will have designatedsome schools that in fact one will notbe allowed within 330 yards to provideneedle exchange programs. But that isonly one element of the amendment.There are 13 others. So when you addthat to the list, and you consider thatWashington, D.C., is only 66 squaremiles, that leaves about five positionsthat you can exchange needles: theMall, Soldiers' Home, Bolling AirForce Base, St. Elizabeth's, Wash-ington Hospital Center, and RockCreek Park. The problem with the D.C. bill is that no one comes to the floor straight;they come with a cosmetic reason forwhatever they want to do. This Tiahrtamendment is designed to make theneedle exchange program ineffective. Itshould be voted down. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself the balance of mytime. Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman from California (Mr. D IXON) explained, the amendment that we will be consideringprecludes the ability of any needle ex-change program to effectively operate. Now, why is that important? It is im- portant because we have hundreds,thousands, of residents of the Districtof Columbia who are infected with theignominious disease of AIDS, and inthe District the population where theAIDS epidemic is growing fastest arewomen and children. Imagine what it must be like to real- ize that your baby is infected withAIDS. Now, you can blame the mother,you can blame whoever, you can blamesociety; but the reality is that there ishorrible, unjust suffering going on, andthe principal reason for that pain andsuffering is because of the use of dirtyneedles. The only program we have found that actually works, and we have any num-ber of studies that proves that itworks, is when an organization offersclean needles. But you only get a cleanneedle if you give back a dirty needle,and you have to get into a program. Itis access to drug treatment, and it isworking. Mr. Chairman, we might like to turn our backs and pretend this stuff doesnot go on and pretend there are easierways to do it and ways that are lesscontroversial, but there are not. Theyare not working as effectively, andthat is why the administration stoodup and kept vetoing this bill, becausewe have to care about people who aresuffering and dying needlessly, if thereis a way that we can stop it. This program can stop it, and that is why we ought to let it function, butnot with any Federal funds, not withany public money, all with private do-nations. That is the point, that is howthe program is being operated. But itCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7035 July 26, 2000 ought to be allowed to operate. That is only fair. And the D.C. Governmentought to be allowed to decide how it isgoing to cope with its problem, and notlet us gain political advantage by su-perseding their judgment and pre-venting them from being able to ad-dress a critically important, desperateneed within the District of Columbia.That is why this issue is so important. There are funding issues. Maybe we can take care of the funding issues inconference. We are going to try to dothat. It is silly, when we have a $2.2trillion surplus, a $1.7 trillion budget,we cannot find $31 million to make theDistrict whole on a contractual obliga-tion that we agreed to assume. So I trust we will be able to find that money. The District is getting on itsfeet. It has got a great Mayor, it hasgot a good city council. It is getting alot of good people in running its gov-ernment. If we believe in democracy, ifwe believe that the people have thepower to regulate, to run their own af-fairs, that they will elect the peoplethat will provide the kind of quality oflife and security in the future for theirchildren that they decide they want,that is what this is all about. Let us extricate ourselves from these matters where we ought not be in-volved. Let us do right for the Districtof Columbia. Until we fix this bill, I donot think we can support it. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 2 min-utes. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, drug problems in the District of Columbiaare America's problem, because Wash-ington, D.C., is America's capital. I amsorry to hear that the gentleman saysthat if you do not have a program toexchange drug needles, you are causingpain and suffering. No. Pain and suf-fering is caused by the use of drugs.Crime is caused by the use of drugs.Parents failing to take care of theirkids is caused by the use of drugs. You are saying dirty needles cause pain and suffering? No, people injectingthemselves with drugs cause pain andsuffering. We are not talking aboutsewing needles here; we are talkingabout hypodermic syringes, needles forpeople to inject illegal drugs intothemselves, and a program operating inbroad daylight out on public streets todo these swaps. Bring in a dirty needle,get a clean needle, go shoot yourselfup. I know a couple of people that the other day observed one of these sites,and it was an area where there wereresidences and small businesses. Thevan is there for a few hours, and justminutes after the van they used for theneedle exchange pulls away, you knowwhat pulled up? A school bus. It is abus stop for school kids. The D.C. Council passed its own law declaring drug-free zones. The amend-ment of the gentleman from Kansas(Mr. T IAHRT ) just says those areas thatthe District has already chosen to be drug-free zones should not be used forthese programs to exchange drug nee-dles. The D.C. Council defined them.For example, 1,000 feet around a youthcenter or public library or public hous-ing or a swimming pool or an elemen-tary school or vocational school or avideo arcade, the D.C. Council saysthose sites are supposed to be drug freezones. The amendment of the gen-tleman from Kansas (Mr. T IAHRT ) just says if that is supposed to be a drug-free zone, what are you doing with adrug needle exchange program takingplace in the same spot? I urge support of the bill; and when the time comes, I certainly will sup-port the amendment of the gentlemanfrom Kansas (Mr. T IAHRT ). The CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. No amendment to the bill shall be in order except those printed in the C ON- GRESSIONAL RECORD , pro forma amend- ments for the purpose of debate, andamendments printed in the House Re-port 106\u00b1790.

This simply removes an item for a study of the future tax structure po-tential in the District and shifts the$100,000 in Federal funds that was allo-cated for it to support the new Metrostation that is planned at the NewYork Avenue site. b1500 I believe there is no debate, and if that is the case I would ask unanimousconsent that we yield back the balanceof our time and adopt the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I mayconsume. Mr. Chairman, I want to respond, but not in a critical manner. Mr. Chair-man, what we are withdrawing here isa study that was proposed that was re-lated to the idea of a D.C. commutertax. There had been a provision thatwas included in the subcommittee billby the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.I STOOK ) that said that if residents of suburban Maryland or Virginia earnedmoney in the District of Columbia theydo not have to pay state income taxeson that money to Virginia or Marylandor basically any other State wherethey might reside. So it meant everyMember of Congress who earns theirmoney here would not have to pay anystate income taxes on their income,until the District was permitted to taxincome they might earn in the Dis-trict. What we could have done is to sug- gest then that if that is the case thenCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7037 July 26, 2000 any resident of the District of Colum- bia that earns money in another Statewould not pay taxes in D.C., and D.C.would have wound up worse becausethe reverse flow of people finding jobsin the suburbs where the economicgrowth is happening is even greaterthan economic development in D.C. Sothere were problems with that. It waswithdrawn. There was going to be a further study. The gentleman from Oklahoma(Mr. I STOOK ), upon consideration and discussion with the chair of the author-izing committee, has decided not to dothat study. I personally would havepreferred that we do a study that wasbroad based, looking at D.C.'s long-term revenue needs. I think that needsto be done. I think it could probably bedone for $100,000. So I was hoping wewould do that, but the study ought tobe done by organizations that are lo-cated within the District of Columbia,private, nonprofit organizations, prob-ably nonpartisan. We could get maybethe Brookings Institution and the Hud-son Institute to collaborate. In doingso, they could look at ways that we canraise sufficient revenues to ensure thatD.C. remains the economic core of themetropolitan Washington region butalso sustain the economic viability ofthe suburbs as well. That is a long-term, mutually shared objective. I know that the gentlemanfrom Virginia (Mr. D AVIS) is in agree- ment with that objective. I would hopethat we could find the money to put inthis bill to do that kind of a study, butI have no objection to the manager'samendment and the decision of thegentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.I STOOK ) at this point to withdraw fund- ing for this study. No one on this side is going to object to the manager's amendment, Mr.Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, any study that the District may desire to do certainlythey have the authority and the capa-bility of doing whatever study. I cer-tainly would not agree with all of the characterizations of the gentleman,but I certainly appreciate his interestin the economic conditions in the Dis-trict, as well as in the surroundingNorthern Virginia area that he rep-resents. However, I think we have all agreed that right now there is a high prioritywith the District of the New York Ave-nue Metrorail station, and if the Dis-trict wants to do a study they can doit. In the meantime, we would like toput this Federal contribution of the$100,000 toward that Metro station atNew York Avenue. Mr. Chairman, I ask adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. I STOOK ).The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN.

Is there objection to the request of the gentleman fromOklahoma? There was no objection.The CHAIRMAN. Are there amend- ments to that portion of the bill? AMENDMENT NO . 12 OFFERED BY MR . MORAN OF VIRGINIA Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I offer amendment No. 12. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 12 printed in the C ONGRES - SIONAL RECORD offered by Mr. M ORAN of Vir- ginia: In the item relating to ``D ISTRICT OF CO- LUMBIA HEALTH AND HOSPITALS PUBLIC BEN- EFIT CORPORATION '', strike ``funds:'' and all that follows and insert a period. Strike section 164 (and redesignate the suc- ceeding provisions accordingly). Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7041 July 26, 2000 The CHAIRMAN. The point of order is reserved. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, the purpose of this amendment is,again, to let the District of Columbiadeal with its most severe problems, andone of its most severe problems has todo with the operation of D.C. GeneralHospital. Mr. Chairman, within the District of Columbia, there are over 80,000 peoplewho have no health insurance, and D.C.General is their health care of last re-sort. When they go to the hospital, it istoo often because they have a gunshotwound, because they have been phys-ically attacked, because women havebeen raped, because they have seriousdrug problems, because they have prob-lems that take acute attention and of-tentimes very expensive care. Becausethese people generally do not have themoney to pay for their health care,D.C. General has gone broke, as hasSoutheast Community Hospital, anumber of the health clinics in thecommunity. We are talking about places like Ana- costia primarily, very low-income sec-tion of the city. Some people are indesperate poverty, even in today'sworld in the capital city. So a publicbenefit corporation was set up to see ifthey cannot manage these health carefacilities and find a way to financethem. The PBC has not been successfulin doing that. It is unfortunate. Itneeds to be corrected, but this bill triesto correct it without consultation withthe mayor, the D.C. council and theoutside health care consultants whohave been looking at this problem foryears. One of the ways it attempts to cor- rect it is by cutting off its funding, ter-minating its line of credit. So whathappens? The hospital, we are told, willbecome insolvent, will shut down with-in a year if this amendment is includedin the bill and the bill is enacted. Okay. Fine. It is not being run well. It is losing money, but tell me, Mr.Chairman, what do we do with thethousands of people who go to D.C.General as their health care of last re-sort? No one else wants to handlethem. No one else wants to handlethese gunshot victims. No one elsewants to handle these drug addicts. Noone else wants to handle these peoplewho have no money to pay for theirhealth care. So what are we going to do with them? Are we just going to let themloose without health care? We aregoing to send them to other hospitalsthat do not take them, that do notwant them, that are not going to treatthem. So that is my problem with thissolution. It is too easy. It was not doneby D.C. because D.C. is held account-able by its voters for coming up withconstructive alternatives. This is tooeasy an alternative: Cut it off, shut itdown. That is not the way to handle a very difficult, complex problem. So what Iwant to do with this amendment isstrike the language, leave it to D.C. to deal with. Do not come up with solu-tions that are going to make the situa-tion worse. Do not have that pain andsuffering of people who have no healthcare and desperately need it on ourhands. We have no business getting in-volved in this issue, unless we have aconstructive alternative. We do not, sowe ought to strike the language. POINT OF ORDER Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendmentas to the underlying merits. I will offerat an appropriate time a written state-ment for the record. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment becauseit violates the rules of the House sinceit calls for the en bloc consideration oftwo different paragraphs in the bill.The precedents of the House are clearin this matter: Amendments to a para-graph or section are not in order untilsuch paragraph or section has beenread. Cannon's Precedents, Volume 8,section 2354. Mr. Chairman, I ask for a ruling from the Chair. The CHAIRMAN. If no other Member desires to be heard, for the reasonsstated by the gentleman from Okla-homa (Mr. I STOOK ), the point of order is sustained. Are there any other amendments to this portion of the bill? PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, par- liamentary inquiry. Are we at generalprovisions where an amendment can beat the desk and now be pursued? The CHAIRMAN. When the Clerk be- gins to read again, he will begin at thatportion. The Clerk will read section 101.The Clerk read as follows: GENERAL PROVISIONS SEC. 101. The expenditure of any appropria- tion under this Act for any consulting serv-ice through procurement contract, pursuantto 5 U.S.C. 3109, shall be limited to thosecontracts where such expenditures are amatter of public record and available forpublic inspection, except where otherwiseprovided under existing law, or under exist-ing Executive order issued pursuant to exist-ing law. AMENDMENT NO . 22 OFFERED BY MS . NORTON Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 22 printed in the C ONGRES - SIONAL RECORD offered by Ms. N ORTON : Strike ``G ENERAL PROVISIONS '' and all that follows through the last section before theshort title. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order. The CHAIRMAN. This amendment touches portions of the bill that havenot yet been read or considered. Doesthe gentlewoman from the District ofColumbia (Ms. N ORTON ) ask unanimous consent for its present consideration? Ms. NORTON. I do, Mr. Chairman.The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewomanfrom the District of Columbia? Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order. I have no objection tothe gentlewoman proceeding for, I be-lieve, the agreed upon time was for 5minutes to certainly explain heramendment and her position. The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, pending the point of order, the gentle-woman from the District of Columbia(Ms. N ORTON ) is recognized for 5 min- utes on her amendment. There was no objection.Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I be- lieve that there has been a time agree-ment for 20 minutes divided equally. IfI may have unanimous agreement onthat time? Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I would certainly agree to that. I misstated onthe time. I agree to a unanimous con-sent request of 20 minutes to be divided10 minutes per side. The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the time on the amendment of the gen-tlewoman from the District of Colum-bia (Ms. N ORTON ) will be 20 minutes di- vided equally. There was no objection.The CHAIRMAN. That will include any amendments thereto. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise to introduce a democracy amendment that will wipeout all riders, most of them oper-ational riders, that are outdated or ir-relevant. Members would not committhemselves one way or the other on thesubstance of any underlying provisionby voting to eliminate them all. The chairman announced on the floor just a few minutes ago that he hashimself begun to look at these provi-sions and has found some of them to beoutmoded. I appreciate that he is nowlooking into the bill in this way. In his budget, as transmitted, the President offered to work with theCongress and the District to identifyand limit at the very least the numberof general provisions or attachmentsnot only to be consistent with the prin-ciple of home rule but also becausemost are so old that they have beenovertaken by events, or they are now apart of D.C. or Federal law. Last year, the chairman indicated that riders in the D.C. appropriationreflected the fact that over manyyears, whoever was President had beentransmitting old riders and the chair-man had simply included what thePresident sent. Upon inspection, theWhite House found that most of the at-tachments are no longer applicable.Many already exist in Federal law orthe D.C. Code. Example, section 114 re-quires council approval of capitalproject borrowing; but that is now re-quired by the D.C. code. Other riders should be deleted be- cause they are incorporated into theD.C. budget text or the local budgetact, or will be proposed locally thisyear. Example, restrictions on the useCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7042 July 26, 2000 of official vehicles, a restriction re- quired by Congress and adopted in thelocal Budget Support Act. Still, other riders should be deleted because they are one-time provisions,are no longer applicable or duplicateexisting Federal law. Example, the billsays appropriations or obligations thatexpire at the end of the year unlessotherwise stated. Yet this matter iscovered by Federal law. Other provisions should be deleted because they are issues of local homerule and/or should be deleted to ensurethat the District is treated the same asany other State or local jurisdiction.Some of these are social riders, such asvoting rights. Most, however, are oper-ational matters normally left to localjurisdictions. The democracy amend-ment I offer today would eradicate allof these riders, most of them oper-ational and out of date or redundant ofcurrent law. b1515 No Member would answer for any one of them, because the amendment is ademocracy and autonomy amendmentthat does not address any substantiveissue or specific provision. However, wewill surely answer for the piling on ofamendments that are already in localor Federal law, or corpses, left overfrom prior years and circumstancesand administrations that are dead andgone. Mr. Chairman, District residents gave themselves a new start with a newmayor and a reconstructed city coun-cil. I ask the House to respond with anew bill that does not hang on the backof today's cities, tails, and times it hasthrown off. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I con- tinue to reserve my point of order, andI yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, basically, the gentle- woman representing the District of Co-lumbia has offered an amendment tostrike out all of the provisions afterthe appropriating paragraphs, all of thesubstantive provisions in this bill; andbasically, as I believe she stated, thereare two categories. One of them are so-called social riders, such as the concernwith programs to exchange drug nee-dles out on the public streets, and pro-grams such as the marijuana initiativethat the District in a referendumadopted, which this Congress has ex-pressly disapproved and said it shallnot go into effect. Other provisions arenot so-called social riders, but they areprovisions that have been carried onthis bill for a number of years becausethey have not been enacted into sub-stantive law, where this would be thecontrolling standard if they were notin the bill. Now, I realize that the gentlewoman says, well, these are old things to bedone away with; they are not neededanymore. We went through those provi-sions before this bill was offered thisyear; and we wiped out two dozen, two dozen provisions that have been carriedon this bill for years, that I agree, fitthe description of things that were out-dated, outmoded, duplicative, and nolonger necessary. If there are any oth-ers of those that still remain, we wantto take them out too; but we are notsatisfied that that is the case. For example, we do have provisions in this bill to make it clear that allcontracts regarding the District are amatter of public record. We had a cir-cumstance, Mr. Chairman, just a fewweeks ago when the former head of thePublic Benefit Corporation, which op-erates the D.C. General Hospital, said,since you fired me, I am entitled to $1million, and people said, where is thecontract? And people could not find it.It should have been public record. We had testimony in a hearing from the control board that is supposed tobe a repository of these, and they said,we never saw such a contract. And getthis: the control board, headed by theformer vice chairman of the FederalReserve Board, has been writing checksfor millions of dollars not budgeted,not approved, for millions of dollars, asI mentioned before, to keep this facil-ity afloat, despite years of efforts bythis Congress, years and years by thisCongress saying, they are wastingmoney over there, it is a sink hole,they have not fixed it, and the controlboard continued writing millions ofdollars worth of checks. There were no signed agreements, there were no memoranda, there wereno security agreements, there was nopromissory note, there was no state-ment of collateral, there was nothing,nothing, for about $200 million of out-lay of public money, not budgeted, notauthorized by law, and they did noteven have any sort of written agree-ments for it. So of course we need a provision that says, all of these contracts are a mat-ter of public record. If the District orthe control board is going to loanmoney to the Public Benefit Corpora-tion for the D.C. General Hospital, theyought to have at least one piece ofpaper that reflects why they wrote allof these millions of dollars of checks.All contracts are a matter of publicrecord. That is an example of one ofthe provisions that the gentlewomanwishes to strike. Also, a restriction saying, we do not use this public money for personalcooks, chauffeurs or other servants.They cannot use it for any sole-sourcecontracts. They cannot renew con-tracts or extend them without takingcompetitive bids. Let us protect thetaxpayer from sweetheart deals. Now, we can be satisfied that some provisions are actually in the law else-where so that they do not need to becarried in this bill. That is why wewiped out two dozen of them that havebeen carried year after year; and wewant to get rid of all of these and havethem in substantive law, but they arenot there yet.That is just an example, Mr. Chair- man, of the provisions of the gentle-woman's amendment, along with manyothers that we will be discussing later,would wipe out all in one block. As well as reserving my point of order against this amendment, Mr.Chairman, as an improper way to bringissues up before this House, I certainlyoppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve my point of order, and I reserve the balance of mytime. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. If I may respond, the gentleman has named what amounts to violations ofD.C. law and violations of what is re-quired in this appropriation attach-ment. All that demonstrates is havingit in an attached provision, does notget the provision enforced. The point is, is it a matter of D.C. law, and is it a matter of Federal law?Once it is a matter of law, anythingelse we do to make it a matter of lawis redundant, a law that is alreadythere. And if one has a complaint aboutsole-source contracts, and I certainlywould, if one has a complaint aboutcompetitive bids, and I certainlywould, then you have to go to thosewho are not enforcing the law, not sim-ply pile on attachments, which also donot enforce the law. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.M ORAN ). Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I offered this democracy amend-ment in the full Committee on Appro-priations, and I appreciate the gentle-woman from the District of Columbia(Ms. N ORTON ) offering it today on the House floor, because she is the demo-cratically elected representative of theDistrict of Columbia, and she wellknows that most of the provisions inthis appropriations bill do not belongin any Federal appropriations bill. There are 72 provisions at last count, 17 new ones in the bill this time. Wehave a couple dozen provisions that areeither already part of Federal law,other parts of Federal law that do notneed to be here for any purpose, or arein the D.C. Code. D.C. is legally re-quired to do these things. It is in theirlaw. What are we doing keeping thisstuff in the D.C. appropriations bill? Itis sort of just making sure that thatheel stays deep on D.C.'s throat so thatthey do not ever think that they canrun their own affairs. Let us get rid of this junk. It is detri- tus. It does not belong on an appropria-tions bill. There are so many of theseexamples, punitive examples where wetell them what to do with their own ve-hicles, how much allowance for pri-vately owned vehicles, how fuel-effi-cient automobiles have to be. It is allstuff that is contained in other places,or it ought not to be contained any-place. Now, there are some controversial issues included in this amendment.There is a domestic partnership, toughCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7043 July 26, 2000 issue. But the reality is that 3,000 em- ployers across the country offer domes-tic partnership coverage. All kind ofStates and localities. I was not giventhose numbers this year, but we knowthe numbers; and it is a whole bunch ofStates and localities that do this. Whyare we telling the District that it can-not? We do not turn around and tellanybody in the jurisdictions that werepresent that they cannot do this; butwe tell D.C. they cannot do it, becausewe are not accountable to them. Theycannot do anything to fight back. Mr. Chairman, that is why this de- mocracy amendment is in order, andthat is why it is called a democracyamendment. We believe that peopleought to be able to run their own af-fairs, that the power comes not fromthe State to the people, but from thepeople to the government. Then let thepeople of the District of Columbia beempowered to run their own govern-ment and get rid of this extraneousstuff. It does not belong here. TreatD.C. residents the way we treat ourown constituents. That is all we areasking. That is the bottom line of thisamendment. Do unto others as youwould do unto yourself. Mr. Chairman, we would not do it to our constituents; we should not do it toD.C. residents. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wis-consin (Mr. P ETRI). Mr. PETRI. Mr. Chairman, I rise to commend the subcommittee chairmanfor the provisions he has put in thebill, and I oppose the amendment. Thefact of the matter is, there has been anongoing effort to expand charterschools in the District of Columbia. Itis one of the most successful efforts inthe United States. We have had a pol-icy for a number of years, when theD.C. government closes a school, toallow the people who have charterschool programs to have an oppor-tunity to use the unused school build-ing, and that policy has been flouted. Ithas not been put into effect. The chair-man, in the bill, is trying to honor thatagreement and get the D.C. Govern-ment off the dime to allow the unusedschool buildings, under proper cir-cumstances, to be used by the childrenof the District who are enrolled incharter schools. I understand that if we drop this lan- guage, the charter school people aregoing to be ignored. If we keep the lan-guage in, we will have an opportunityto work out something reasonable, so Icommend the chairman for his lan-guage. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Wis-consin (Ms. B ALDWIN ). Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of my colleague'samendment, and I thank her for herleadership on these issues. I want to address just one provision in the gentlewoman's democracyamendment, the domestic partnershiphealth benefits.At a time when 44 million people in our country lack health care coverage,this House has decided that it willerect new barriers for certain citizensof our capital city to obtain healthcare insurance. They have decided toprohibit the implementation of theDistrict's plan to extend health carecoverage to domestic partners of cityemployees, and I must ask why. Con-gress stands as the only barrier be-tween affordable health care for count-less families of city employees. Thisstand could mean the difference be-tween having a sensible health careplan or no plan at all; it could meanthe difference between wellness and ill-ness, and in some cases, life and death. As a proponent for health care for all, I am extremely disturbed by thisunderlying provision. The employees ofthis city want nothing more and noth-ing less than fairness and equality inthe workplace. Allowing access to themost basic of benefits, health care,does just that. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas(Mr. T IAHRT ). (Mr. TIAHRT asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Chairman, on July 11, the D.C. Council passed a bill whichwould require employers in the Districtof Columbia to provide contraceptivecoverage to their employees. Despitethe fact that a good conscience clauseexempting employers who wish towaive this on religious or moral obliga-tions was offered, it was not adopted bythe council. Furthermore, the debate got rather ugly and some council members es-poused anti-Catholic and anti-Chris-tian beliefs in the course of this discus-sion. One of the provisions that wouldbe deleted by the gentlewoman'samendment would be the requirementfor the District of Columbia City Coun-cil to go back and reconsider the con-science clause, allowing for religiousand moral obligations. Now, if the concern is that there are not contraceptives available in the Dis-trict of Columbia, according to the De-partment of Health and Human Serv-ices, there are 10 locations inside theDistrict of Columbia where contracep-tives can be obtained free. b1530 If one is above the poverty level, one can pay a minimum cost for contracep-tives. Contraceptives are available inthe District of Columbia. There is noreason for the District, for the councilto carry on this debate about religiousand moral convictions not being appli-cable. Because if someone for some rea-son did not have access to health carecoverage that provided contraceptives,and they wanted to obtain contracep-tives, they could go to one of the 10 lo-cations in the District of Columbiawhere they could get free contracep-tives at low cost if they are above thepoverty level.So I think the gentlewoman's amend- ment to strike all provisions would goway too fast and would not task thecity council with going back and recon-sidering the conscience clause which Ithink they should could consider. So if one strikes all the general pro- visions, I think it is a bridge too far, astep too far; and I think it is a wrongthing. I think we should allow Con-gress, which has the constitutional re-quirement to oversee this, to carry onwith these general provisions as arelisted in the bill. The CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman from the District of Columbia has 1 1\u00a42 minutes remaining. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. H OYER ). Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me thistime, and I rise in strong support of heramendment. Mr. Chairman, as I sat here to think about what could one say in 90 seconds,it occurs to me that each and every oneof my colleagues ought to considerthis. None of us, not one of us in thisbody wants to take ownership of everypolicy adopted by the D.C. City Counciland its mayor, not one of us. It istheirs to take, theirs to do. But I suggest to my colleagues, to the extent that we include provision 1,2, 3, and 4 and leave out 5, 6, and 7, onecould clearly argue, well, apparentlyone is against 1 through 5, but onemust be for 6, 7 and 8. That is not thecase. It is not the case. I am not re-sponsible for what the D.C. City Coun-cil does, the D.C. City Council is, andthe voters of the District of Columbiaare, any more than the D.C. Council isresponsible for what I do on this floor. This is called a democracy amend- ment, because, in a democracy, we be-lieve that the people can be wrong. Thepeople can disagree. The people do notall need to be overseen by Big Brother.It seems to me that is a conservativeconcept. It seems to me that is some-thing that people who want smallergovernment adopt as a premise, thatBig Brother ought not to be overseeingthe District of Columbia. Vote for thisdemocracy amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. I STOOK ) has 2 min- utes remaining. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colo-rado (Mr. T ANCREDO ). Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding methis time. There has always been, there always will be, there is now bureaucratic oppo-sition to any sort of reform, especiallyin school reform that gives parentsgreater opportunities, greater free-doms. The gentleman rails on about micro- managing this and avoidance of that.What we are trying to do with, espe-cially the charter school provision, isCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7044 July 26, 2000 to give people, the individuals, the par- ents in the District of Columbia, great-er freedom, greater choice, not the bu-reaucrats, not the educational systemin general, but parents, individuals. Is that not the best kind of freedom to give anybody? Is that not the bestkind of public policy to adopt here? Itis not a hard hand of government com-ing down on the District. It is the free-dom we are going to give parents in theDistrict of Columbia to select charterschools for their kids, the greatest op-portunity we can possibly give to any-one, including the residents of the Dis-trict of Columbia. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. I STOOK ) has 1 minute remaining. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time. Certainly, as I said before, I agree with the concept that, if there arethings in this bill that are carry-oversthat serve no purpose any further, thenthey should join the two dozen provi-sions that we have already taken outthat have been carried year after yearin this bill. We will continue to work with the other side of the aisle and our own sideto make sure that we do not carry any-thing that is not necessary. Of course,the other issues are policy issues suchas we have talked about relating todrug needles, relating to contraceptivemandates that exclude a conscienceclause. Those issues are going to bebrought up in further amendments. But as to this one, Mr. Chairman, I would like to close the debate. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. POINT OF ORDER Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment becauseit violates the rules of the House sinceit calls for the en bloc consideration oftwo different paragraphs in the bill. The precedents of the House are clear in this matter: ``Amendments to aparagraph or section are not in orderuntil such paragraph or section hasbeen read,'' Cannon's Precedents, Vol-ume 8, section 2354. I ask for a ruling from the Chair.The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentle- woman from the District of Columbiadesire to be heard on the point oforder? Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I under- stand the rules of the House. I appre-ciate that I have been heard on what,for us, is a vital amendment. I will con-tinue to work with the gentleman fromOklahoma (Mr. I STOOK ) to eliminate such provisions as we can agree shouldbe eliminated. The CHAIRMAN. For the reasons stated by the gentleman from Okla-homa (Mr. I STOOK ), the point of order is sustained. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to.Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.P ETRI) having assumed the chair, Mr.LAHOOD, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of theUnion, reported that that Committee,having had under consideration the bill(H.R. 4942) making appropriations forthe government of the District of Co-lumbia and other activities chargeablein whole or in part against the reve-nues of said District for the fiscal yearending September 30, 2001, and forother purposes, had come to no resolu-tion thereon. f LIMITATION ON AMENDMENTS DURING FURTHER CONSIDER-ATION OF H.R. 4942, DISTRICT OFCOLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONSACT, 2001 Mr. ISTOOK.

AMENDMENT NO . 13 OFFERED BY MR . MORAN OF VIRGINIA Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 13 printed in the C ONGRES - SIONAL RECORD offered by Mr. M ORAN of Vir- ginia: Strike sections 128 and 129 (and redesignate the succeeding provisions accordingly). Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. I STOOK ) reserves a point of order. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, the gentleman from Virginia(Mr. M ORAN ) and the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. I STOOK ) each will con- trol 5 minutes.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7047 July 26, 2000 The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. M ORAN ). Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I mayconsume. Mr. Chairman, the reason for doing this is we want to strike sections 128and 129. The reason is that the Districtof Columbia is already on the leadingedge of the charter school movementthroughout the country. It is reform-ing its schools. In fact, it had an en-rollment increase of over 100 percent inthe last year. Mayor Williams has seento it that the funding has increased by300 percent to $77 million for charterschools. That is good. That is what wewant. The Center for Washington Area Studies reported that D.C. charterschools funding is among the most gen-erous in the entire Nation in terms ofper-pupil expenditures. Unfortunately,these two provisions could potentiallyjeopardize both that funding and thepositive impact which charter schoolsare having because it substantially re-duces the authority of local elected of-ficials to determine the best use of sur-plus school properties. It was donewithout consultation with the Mayoror the school board or local elected of-ficials. So passage of these provisions is going to have a very serious effect po-tentially upon homeless shelters, alter-native education programs, the Metro-politan Police Department, becausethese organizations, these services areusing surplus school properties. These amendments say any charter school can go in and buy these surplusschool properties at 25 percent lessthan market even if they are occupied.So potentially, one could displace theCommission on Mental Health whichoperates a clinic at the AddisonSchool, the Center of Hope whichleases Keene School, the Commissionon Mental Health which operates achildren's program at the Reno School,the homeless shelters at MadisonSchool in Old Emery, the Police De-partment at Petworth School. I have got all kinds of examples here that could be displaced if any charterschool wants to come in and buy thesesurplus properties. They can get it at25 percent discount on all leases, salesand lease sales. That means that theDistrict of Columbia could lose $48 mil-lion from the market value of thisproperty. That is why the Mayor doesnot want this. This does not make sense. We would not want it if we were mayor. Whywould one lose that kind of money? Wewant to cooperate with charterschools. We are strongly in favor ofcharter schools. D.C. is doing a goodjob on charter schools. But this couldreally impede its efforts. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. M ORAN ) has 21\u00a42min- utes remaining.Mr. MORAN of Virginia. That is ex- actly even, Mr. Chairman, and that iswhat we want. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the very distinguished gen-tlewoman from the District of Colum-bia (Ms. N ORTON ). b1545 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me thistime. I am a strong supporter of charter schools. This city has more charterschools than any other jurisdiction inthe United States. It has been verygenerous with them. Some residents went around our mayor and came up here to get thisamendment. I believe Mr. Peabody andMr. Patten. There may be others. Ifthey were having trouble with the Dis-trict, they have now had a meetingwith the District, they should havecome to me or someone else. Instead,what we get is a heavy-handed amend-ment that this House could never,never, at least if it is a market-drivenHouse, could never approve. It slaps ahuge compelled nonmarket-driven re-duction on property without knowingwhere the property is or what it isworth and otherwise directs how prop-erties should be disposed of. We do notdo that in a free economy. We do notdo that in a market-driven economy. The District has very scarce re- sources precisely because the FederalGovernment takes up all of the space.Mayor Williams wrote to the chairmansaying, ``I am opposed to language con-cerning disposition of surplus schoolproperty that would hamper the Dis-trict Government's ability to utilize itsassets to reform our schools.'' This amendment is big-time overkill to tell the City how much it should sellproperty for, how much it should re-duce property to. Some of it should bereduced to nothing; some of it shouldbe reduced very little. None of us inthis body knows. I arranged a meeting when I learned of this problem. I understand that theCity itself is going to deal with thisand it should have it dealt with withina month. I hope that by the time weget to conference, the chairman willsee fit to withdraw this, because Ithink the matter shall have alreadybeen taken care of. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, as wellas reserving a point of order. What is happening with charter schools in the District of Columbia isthat parents and students are flockingto them because they offer an escapefrom the bureaucracy that governs theDistrict's schools, that assumes thecash, that has one of the highest per-pupil funding rates in the country; butwhere the cash ends up in a bureauc-racy not helping out in the classroomwith Johnny and Suzy. Charter schools have now attracted over 10 percent of the student enroll-ment, moving toward 15 percent of thestudents in the public schools in the District of Columbia. Charter schoolsare themselves public schools but theydo not get stuck with the same bu-reaucracy, and parents want thesecharter schools. They are sending theirkids to them. But what is happening,Mr. Chairman, is that the bureaucracyis striking back. Not openly, not out inthe open, but using their weapon ofchoice, red tape, and strangling thecharter schools when they try to dosomething. Charter schools are sup-posed to have the same access to publicresources as public schools do. We did not create this, Mr. Chair- man, but the control board had anorder that they issued in 1998 sayingthat if a charter school wanted tomatch the bid price of a vacant school,and they have tons of them in the Dis-trict of Columbia, if a charter schoolwanted to match the bid price, becausethey were also part of the public schoolsystem, that if the price was a milliondollars or less, they would get a 25 per-cent discount; if the price was over amillion dollars, it would be 15 percent.That is where this language providingdiscounts comes from. It is the stand-ard the control board approved. But guess what? Let me tell my col- leagues a couple of things. Charterschools found when they tried to makethe leases, the process was beingdragged out. Let me tell my colleaguesthe story of the Franklin School. TheFranklin School had bids solicited forthis vacant property in February of1998. There was an appraisal made sothe taxpayer would be protected. Theappraisal was $4.1 million, and the suc-cessful bidder was a charter school. But then the emergency board of edu- cation trustees said, well, we want tooppose this, and the control board re-jected the bid. Why? Well, the controlboard said they found out there was anassessment and the District claimedthe building is worth more than the $4million, that it is worth $15 million.And they hung on to that claim formonths and months as a reason, untilsomebody finally went back to the Dis-trict and checked the records, and theDistrict had changed its own assess-ment, but no one bothered to ask theDistrict about it. The District hadagreed. They had changed it back inJune of 1999 that the assessed valuewas $4.2 million, right in line with theappraisal of $4.1 million. Despite the successful bid of the charter school, which is now, gosh, Mr.Chairman, it is a year and a half oldnow, the D.C. schools and their bu-reaucracy are dragging their feet andrefusing to let the building be used fora charter school. They just drag it out.Never any overt actions; just we arewaiting on this, we are waiting on that.Mr. Chairman, we have to cut throughthe red tape sometime. Now, I want to work with the gentle- woman from the District; I want towork with the gentleman from Vir-ginia, the ranking member; and I wantto work with the District people andCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7048 July 26, 2000 the school people. I just want to make sure that they want to work with thecharter schools. The charter schoolsare public schools. They have the samerights, because they represent andteach the same kids, the same sourceof kids, and we have to stop the bu-reaucracy from trying to stranglethem. The general provisions in the bill just put in common sense requirements tomake sure they get equal treatment.We could delve into the details, but asI said, they could change as we workthrough this process. We want to pro-tect the kids, whether they attend aregular public school or a charterschool. They need protection. Theyneed a good solid education so thatthey can have a future of hope andgrowth and opportunity. Mr. Chairman, we certainly oppose the amendment that tries to take outthese efforts at reform, but we do wantto continue to work with everyone in-volved to make these provisions thebest they can be. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself the balance of mytime to sum up here. Mr. Chairman, I do not object if the intent is simply to help the charterschool movement. The mayor wants todo that. I think most people in D.C.want to have an alternative school sys-tem. The problem is this amendment could potentially take $48 million out of thepublic school system. It could displacea number of very important organiza-tions; the Commission on MentalHealth; the D.C. Police Department isusing Petworth School. Homeless shel-ters. So I do not think it was fullythought out. The problem is that it was done with- out consultation with the mayor, D. C.Council, and the school board. That iswhy the amendment really should bestruck. I understand the point of order,but I also know we are doing the rightthing if we were to strike it. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. I appreciate the gentleman's concern, Mr. Chairman. I want to assure himthis is not about displacing anyone,and certainly I do not believe theamendment does what the gentlemanclaims, but I understand the bona fideconcern to make sure that it does not. We have been working both directly and indirectly with the mayor's officeand other entities involved and willcontinue to do so. POINT OF ORDER Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendmentbecause it violates the rules of theHouse since it calls for the en bloc con-sideration of two different paragraphsin the bill.

Cannon's Precedents, Vol- ume 8, section 2354. I ask for a ruling from the Chair.The CHAIRMAN. Does any Member wish to be heard on the point of order?

AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . SOUDER Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 106\u00b1790 offered by Mr. S OUDER : In section 150, strike ``Federal''. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 563, the gentleman from In-diana (Mr. S OUDER ) and a Member op- posed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. S OUDER ). Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would prohibit the use of any funds appro-priated by this bill to finance needleexchange programs in the District ofColumbia. The reasoning is simple: Needle ex- change programs sanction and facili-tate the use of the same illegal drugswe are spending billions of dollars toCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7051 July 26, 2000 keep off our streets. They send the wrong message, and it simply does notwork. This is consistent with the needle ex- change ban we passed and that was en-acted in the bill last year, and I urgemy colleagues to maintain the ban inthis bill. This amendment restores theexact same language as the amendmentthat passed last year with 240 votes andwas signed by the President. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I am opposed to the amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. M ORAN ) is recog- nized for 5 minutes. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from California (Mr. Dixon),whose amendment passed in full com-mittee and whose amendment would benegated by this amendment. Mr. DIXON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me thistime. This amendment clearly illustrates the philosophy of this bill, and that is``do as I say.'' Let me read to my col-leagues the people that support theneedle exchange program. b1600 The American Medical Association, the American Public Health Associa-tion, the United States Conference ofMayors. Let me read to my colleagues what, on March of this year, the SurgeonGeneral said. He said that ``after re-viewing all of the research to date, thesenior scientists of the Department andI have unanimously agreed that thereis conclusive scientific evidence thatsyringe exchange programs as part of acomprehensive HIV prevention strat-egy are, in effect, public health inter-vention that reduces the transmissionof HIV and does not encourage the useof illegal drugs.'' Clearly, everyone can see that some people are opposed to it notwith-standing the facts, and that is the rea-son this amendment is being offered. The American Medical Association says that it has an impact. The Sur-geon General has studied this. It is asimple amendment. It is a matter ofsimple philosophy. They do not like it. What funds are they using? Their own funds. Is this some novel idea?Thirty States have these programswhere they use State and local funds,133 cities. But we come to the floor be-cause we personally do not like it andsay to them that they cannot use theirown funds. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this. Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 1\u00a42minutes to the distinguished gen- tleman from Virginia (Mr. G OODLATTE ). (Mr. GOODLATTE asked and was given permission to revise and extendhis remarks.) Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.S OUDER ) for yielding me the time and commend him for his effort. I strongly support his amendment. This is something that would make itabsolutely clear that the taxpayers'dollars, no matter what taxpayers' dol-lars those might be, cannot be used toprovide needles to drug addicts to par-ticipate in an illegal activity. We should not tell our children do not do drugs on the one hand while giv-ing them free needles to shoot up withon the other. We need a national drugcontrol policy which emphasizes edu-cation, interdiction, prevention andtreatment, not subsidies for addicts. Providing free hypodermic needles to addicts so that they can continue to in-ject illegal drugs sends a terrible mes-sage to our children that Congress hasgiven up on the fight to stop illegaldrug use and that the Federal Govern-ment implicitly condones this illegalactivity. As lawmakers, we have a responsi- bility to rise up and fight against theuse and spread of drugs everywhere wecan. We should start by making itharder, not easier, to practice thisdeadly habit. This amendment will reaffirm the Federal Government's commitment tothe war on drugs by prohibiting Fed-eral and District funds from being usedto conduct needle exchange programsin the District of Columbia. These pro-grams are harmful to communities andundermine our Nation's drug controlefforts. Drug abuse continues to ravage our communities, our schools, and our chil-dren. Heroin use is again on the rise.Thousands of children will inject hard-core drugs like heroin and cocaine. Thefirst year, many will die. Oppose the effort to have needle ex- changes. Support the Souder amend-ment. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 1 minute to the very dis-tinguished gentlewoman from Wis-consin (Ms. B ALDWIN ). Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amend-ment to prohibit the District of Colum-bia from using any funds, Federal orlocal, for a needle exchange program. The positive effects of needle ex- change are proven. In communitiesacross the country, needle exchangeprograms have been established and arecontributing to the reduction of HIVtransmission among IV drug users. In my hometown of Madison, Wis- consin, as well as in other Wisconsincommunities, outreach workers andvolunteers go into the community andprovide drug users with risk-reductioneducation and referrals to drug coun-seling treatment and other medicalservices. Yet Congress continues to ignore the overwhelming scientific evidence show-ing that needle exchange is an effectiveHIV prevention tool. I want to end with a personal note on this issue. When outreach workers inmy community and in other Wisconsincommunities go out to drug abusers and say, I care about whether you liveor die, it brings them into treatmentand takes them off their dependency. Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida(Mr. M ICA), the distinguished chairman who chairs the Subcommittee onCriminal, Justice, Drug Policy andHuman Resources of the Committee onGovernment Reform. Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I do not ask my colleagues to support thisamendment. I implore them to supportthis amendment. If we want to listen to people who are making statements about needle ex-change programs, take the word of ourdrug czar, this administration's drugczar, General Barry McCaffrey, whosaid, ``by handing out needles, we en-courage drug use. Such a messagewould be inconsistent with the tenureof our national youth-oriented anti-drug campaign.'' That is our drug czar that made that statement. If we want to look at examples where they have instituted drug and needleexchange programs and see the results,a 1997 Vancouver study reported thattheir needle exchange program startedin 1988 with HIV prevalence in drug ad-dicts at only 1 to 2 percent and now itis 23 percent. The study found that 40 percent of the HIV-positive addicts had lent theirused syringes in the previous 6 months. Additionally, the study found that 39 percent of the HIV-negative addictshad borrowed a used syringe in the pre-vious 6 months. If we want to see what a liberal pro- gram will do to a city, just look to thesister city to the north, Baltimore.With a liberal mayor who adopted aliberal policy on needle exchange, ev-eryone could do it. The murder rate is a national dis- grace. The addicts, and this informa-tion was given to our subcommittee byDEA, in 1996 were at 39,000. Recently, a councilwoman, Rickie Specter, said that the statistics are notone in 10 of the city population, accord-ing to a Time Magazine report in Sep-tember of 1999, but, and these are herwords, ``it is more like one in eight.'' So if we want to ruin this city, adopt the policy in the bill and defeat theamendment. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I mayconsume. Mr. Chairman, drug czar General McCaffrey has never opposed a prohibi-tion on local jurisdiction's efforts toimplement a needle exchange program. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to my friend, the honorable gentleman fromNew York (Mr. H INCHEY ). Mr. HINCHEY. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is an example of the mis-guided moralism that is so replete inthis District of Columbia appropria-tions bill. What is at issue here is public health. It has been clearly demonstrated thatCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7052 July 26, 2000 by providing sterile syringes and nee- dles to drug addicts, we cut back dra-matically on the incidence of HIV andAIDS. Fifty percent of the AIDS-positive people in the District of Columbia con-tracted that condition by using con-taminated needles. Seventy-five per-cent of the women in the District ofColumbia who are HIV-positive gotthat way as a result of contaminatedneedles. Seventy-five percent of thechildren who are HIV-positive in theDistrict of Columbia got that way as aresult of contaminated needles. This is a public health issue. My col- leagues ought to poke their noses outof it. Let the District run their ownbusiness. They are condemning peopleto contract HIV and AIDS by proposingthis amendment if it passes. More peo-ple will become HIV-positive and morepeople will die of AIDS as a result ofthis amendment if it passes. It shouldbe defeated. Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time. (Mr. SOUDER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, let me make it clear. There are only two sci-entific long-term studies, one in Van-couver and one in Montreal. In Mon-treal, the number that contracted theAIDS virus more than doubled; in Van-couver, it was higher among partici-pants in the program. Furthermore, one prominent advo- cate of the needle exchange programsaid most needle exchange programsprovide a valuable service to users.They serve as sites of informal and in-creasingly formal organizing and com-ing together. A user might be able todo the networking needed to find gooddrugs in the half an hour he spends atthe street-based needle exchange site,networking that might otherwise havetaken half a day. This does not help HIV people. This does not help drug addicts. The mer-ciful thing to do, the caring thing to dois to help people get off of their addic-tion, not to fuel their habit by givingthem free needles paid for by the tax-payers either directly or indirectly. This idea that the money is not fun- gible is laughable. Either directly orindirectly, it should not come from thetaxpayers of Indiana or anywhere elseto fuel people's drug habits that alsocan lead them to the HIV virus. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would pro- hibit the use of any of the funds appropriatedby this bill to finance needle exchange pro-grams in the District of Columbia. The rea-soning is simple: needle exchange programssanction and facilitate the use of the same ille-gal drugs we are spending billions of dollars tokeep off our streets, send the wrong message,and simply don't work. It is consistent with theneedle exchange ban we passed and that wasenacted in the bill last year, and I urge my col-leagues to maintain the ban in this bill. Thisamendment restores the exact language thatpassed last year with 240 votes and wassigned by the President.NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROMOTES DRUG USE Our experience with the needle exchange programs so far has shown us that needle ex-change programs can become havens notonly for drug use, but also magnets for drugdealers and networking sites for addicts tolearn where to find more drugs. For example,Donald Grovers, who is a prominent advocateof needle exchange programs, has said: Most needle exchange programs provide a valuable service to users. . . . They serve assites of informal (and increasingly formal)organizing and coming together. A usermight be able to do the networking neededto find good drugs in the half an hour hespends at the street-based needle exchangesite\u00d0networking that might otherwise havetaken half a day. It's also a basic economic law that sellers go where their customers are, and for a drugdealer there can be few targets of opportunityriper than a needle exchange location. It is al-most literally bringing sheep to the wolf. TheNew York Times reported in 1997 that: When a storefront is handing out 20,000 sy- ringes a week, suppliers are not far away.East Villagers who have been trying to re-build a neighborhood devastated by drugsduring the 1980s complain that the needle ex-change has brought more dealers back to thestreets and more addicts into the halls of thepublic housing projects at the corner. James Curtis, a Columbia University Pro- fessor, observed in a New York Times Op Edthat tenant groups around one of New York'slargest needle exchange programs told himthat the center had become a magnet for deal-ers, and that used needles, syringes andcrack vials litter their sidewalks. The police donothing. Needle exchange sites have become, for all practical purposes, safe havens for drug usersto escape law enforcement. The office of theDC Police Chief has previously said that itspolicy is to ``look the other way'' when drugaddicts approach the Whitman-Walker clinic'smobile van unit to receive needles, and otherprograms are designated ``police-free zones.''The Office of National Drug Control Policyconcluded that the highest rates of propertycrime in Vancouver were within two blocks ofthe needle exchange. NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE Mr. Chairman, we have already appro- priated billions of dollars for next year to keepdrugs off our streets through drug interdictionand law enforcement, including aid to thestates and the District of Columbia. We havealso appropriated substantial sums to helpthose who are addicted to drugs get off andstay off through prevention and treatment ef-forts, also including aid to the states and theDistrict of Columbia. It makes no sense what-soever to turn around in this bill and appro-priate more funds to directly counter those ef-forts by passing out free needles to addicts, orto support efforts by the District of Columbia(or any state for that matter) to counter thegoals of federal policy in these areas. Finally, General McCaffrey also pointed out that: Needle exchange programs are almost ex- clusively located in disadvantaged, predomi-nantly minority, low income neighborhoods.. . . These programs are magnets for all so-cial ills\u00d0pulling in crime, violence, addicts,prostitution, dealers, and gangs and drivingout hope and opportunity. The overwhelminglikelihood is that the burdens of any expan- sion in needle exchange programs will con-tinue to fall upon those already struggling toget by. Just yesterday, we passed the Community Renewal bill, one of the most hopeful and opti-mistic pieces of legislation we have consid-ered this Congress. Do we want to turnaround today and go in the other direction? NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS DON 'T WORK Finally, even if we were to ignore all of that and adopt for the purposes of argument thefundamental premises of needle exchange ad-vocates, the cold fact of the matter is that nee-dle exchange programs simply don't work. Dr. Fred Payne, medical advisor to the Chil- dren's AIDS Fund, found that ``the data fromfour studies . . . strongly indicate that needleexchange is ineffective in reducing HIV trans-mission among study participants,'' and con-cluded that the evidence on the whole indi-cated that programs were ineffective. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield the final one minute tothe gentlewoman from the District ofColumbia (Ms. N ORTON ). Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me thetime. Mr. Chairman, for many of us, this has become an issue laden with emo-tional content because of its life-or-death consequences so visible where welive. HIV-AIDS has become another bur- den of race in our country and in thismajority black and Hispanic city.Today, the disease is largely a blackand brown killer because of contami-nated needles. The overwhelming ma-jority of new cases have been black andHispanic for years now. HIV-AIDS isnow a racially based public healthemergency. What Congress does on needle ex- change is heavily laden with racialcontent. The Congress allows citizenlocalities everywhere else on Earth todo what is safe and what works forthem. The Congress must not condemn women, men, and children who live inthe District to die because they live inthe District. That is what we do if wewipe out the District needle exchangeprogram in the city. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, I yield such time as she may con-sume to the gentlewoman from Mary-land (Mrs. M ORELLA ). (Mrs. MORELLA asked and was given permission to revise and extend her re-marks.) Mrs. MORELLA. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to allow the Dis-trict to make its own decisions on howto best prevent new HIV infection. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Souder amendment. This amendment will pro-hibit the use of both federal and local funds forthe City's needle exchange program to pre-vent new HIV infections in injection drug usersand their partners. The District of Columbia has one of the highest HIV infection rates in the country. In-travenous drug use is the District's secondhighest mode of transmission, accounting forover 37 percent of all new AIDS cases. ForCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7053 July 26, 2000 women, where the rate of infection is growing faster than among men, it is the highest modeof transmission. Scientific evidence supports the fact that needle exchange programs reduce HIV infec-tion and do not contribute to illegal drug use.The American Medical Association, the Amer-ican Bar Association, the American PublicHealth Association, the American Academy ofPediatrics, and the United States Conferenceof Mayors all have expressed their support forneedle exchange, as part of a comprehensiveHIV prevention program. Dr. C. Everett Koop,former Surgeon General, also expressed sup-port for clean needle exchange programs.These are his words, ``Having worked on theHIV/AIDS epidemic since its emergence in theU.S., I . . . express my strong belief that localprograms of clean needle exchange can be aneffective means of preventing the spread ofthe disease without increasing the use of illicitdrugs.'' Once again, we are engaged in heated de- bate over policies that are best left in thehands of the scientific community. We shouldnot be politicizing public health decisions. The District of Columbia has had a local needle exchange program in place since1997. By using its own funds the number ofnew HIV/AIDS cases due to intravenous druguses had fallen more than 65% through 1999.This represents the most significant decline innew AIDS cases, across all transmission cat-egories, over this time period. Mr. Chairman, AIDS is the third leading cause of death in the District. Without a nee-dle exchange program, HIV will spread un-checked, and more people will be at risk. Pub-lic health decisions should be made by publichealth officials; science should dictate suchdecisions, not politics. I urge my colleaguesallow the District to make its own decisions onhow best to prevent new HIV infections. Vote``no'' on this amendment. Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose the Souder amendment andthe bill for several reasons. The bill ignores the fact that needle ex- change does not increase drug use. It ignoresthe fact that society would have fewer individ-uals infected with HIV if they used clean nee-dles. Needle exchange programs make nee-dles available on a replacement basis only,and refer participants to drug counseling andtreatment. Numerous studies concluded thatneedle exchange programs have shown a re-duction in risk behaviors as high as 80 percentin injecting drug users, with estimates of 30percent or greater reduction of HIV. Mr. Chairman, it has long been known that socioeconomic status impacts not only an indi-vidual's access to and use of health care butalso the quality and benefits derived fromhealth care. Impoverished communities havehigher numbers of homeless individuals.Homelessness, in turn, increases risk for HIVdue to associated high rates of substanceabuse and prostitution. The Federal Office of Minority Health has determined that increased economic inequalityis the driving force behind the rising healthdisparities among Americans. Today, racialand ethnic minorities comprise approximately27 percent of the U.S. population, but accountfor more than 66 percent of the Nation's newAIDS cases. Mr. Chairman, last year I said this amend- ment was politically driven, rather than sci-entifically based and that still remains true. This bill whips on the poorest of the poor. Thisbill puts at risk millions of Americans whomight be married or committed to someonewho they may not know is an intravenous druguser. More importantly, this bill puts children atrisk. Mr. Chairman, in order to stop the spread of HIV and improve the health care of those al-ready infected, prevention and interventionprograms that are designed to address thespecific needs of the population affected mustbe supported. The D.C. ``clean'' needle ex-change program must be funded. I urge allmembers to vote against this thoughtlessamendment. The CHAIRMAN. All time has ex- pired. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana(Mr. S OUDER ). The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes ap-peared to have it. Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I object to the vote on the ground that aquorum is not present and make thepoint of order that a quorum is notpresent. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 563, further proceedings onthe amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Indiana (Mr. S OUDER ) will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.

POINT OF ORDER Mr. PETRI. Mr. Chairman, I raise a point of order against section 153 onthe grounds that it is legislation on anappropriations bill in violation ofclause 2 of rule XXI of the rules of theHouse. This provision makes changes to ex- isting law by earmarking up to $5 mil-lion of the District of Columbia's Fed-eral highway funds to complete designand environmental requirements forthe construction of expanded lane ca-pacity for the 14th Street Bridge. Thiswould be an unprecedented earmarkingof State formula highway funds by theCongress. The CHAIRMAN. Does any Member wish to be heard on the point of order? The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. M ORAN ) is recognized. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chair- man, put this language in. We have adesperate situation on the 14th StreetBridge that is going to be exacerbatedby construction on the Woodrow Wil-son Bridge and construction on I\u00b166. Right now, on many days we will see backups for miles both north and southon the GW Parkway. I am sure thatmany of the Members who do live inVirginia are acutely aware of this prob-lem. We need to widen the 14th StreetBridge desperately. It should be takencare of by the Public Works Com-mittee. Now, all this is is money for plan- ning, design, and construction to widenthe 14th Street Bridge. I can see thatthe Public Works Committee wants toretain all of its prerogatives and this isa turf thing, and that is understand-able. What we were trying to do was to help out the District of Columbia sothey did not have to take it from theirown transportation money. No good deed generally goes unpunished, and I see this good deed isgoing to be punished. So I understandthe motion of the gentleman from Wis-consin (Mr. P ETRI). There is little we can do at this point because, under theparliamentary rules, it is a point oforder. At this point I would concede the point of order. b1615 The CHAIRMAN. Section 153 of the bill proposes directly to amend exist-ing law. As such, it constitutes legisla-tion in violation of clause 2(b) of ruleXXI. The point of order is sustained.Section 153 is stricken from the bill. The Clerk will read.The Clerk read as follows: SEC. 154.

AMENDMENT NO . 23 OFFERED BY MS . NORTON Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 23 printed in the C ONGRES - SIONAL RECORD offered by Ms. N ORTON : In section 168, strike ``(a)'' and all that fol- lows through ``(b)''. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the order of the House today, the gentle-woman from the District of Columbia(Ms. N ORTON ) and the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. I STOOK ) each will con- trol 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentle- woman from the District of Columbia(Ms. N ORTON ). Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise to ask that subsection (a) of section 168 be stricken as moot. It cer-tainly repeals a section of D.C. lawsoon to be vetoed locally. The Congresslike every legislature or law enforce-ment body always prefers to have peo-ple act on their own. This is what the mayor and the D.C. council have done to extinguish thecontroversy that arose concerning thecouncil bill to provide contraception asan option in insurance sold in the Dis-trict. The council, on its own, cameclose to adopting a conscience clausebut narrowly failed. Now indisputablythe council is ready, willing and able toact. A joint letter from Mayor AnthonyWilliams and Council Chair LindaCropp to the chairman indicated thatthey, quote, ``who know the issues bestand all the parties well are prepared to address the necessary clause, givinggreat weight to parties in the Districtwho advocate family planning and reli-gious liberty,'' end quote. To make good on his letter, the mayor publicly announced, on tele-vision, that he will pocket veto thecontraception bill and work with thecouncil to produce an acceptable com-promise. The mayor is using a pocketveto rather than a veto now not be-cause of any reluctance to veto the billbut because he has taken upon himselfto bring all the parties together to asolution acceptable to all. Mayor Williams is himself Catholic, and he has met with Auxiliary BishopWilliam Lori. He knows his council,and his judgment is that a pocket vetois what is appropriate if the point is toreach a solution acceptable to churchand state alike, rather than further po-larize the parties. The letter fromCouncil Chair Cropp and Mayor Wil-liams to the gentleman from Oklahoma(Mr. I STOOK ) and the Mayor's public an- nouncement that he will pocket vetothe bill as well as assurances of thepocket veto received here in writing tothe chairman makes subsection (a) ofsection 168 moot. What would remain issection 168(b). This section relating to religious and moral concerns more than satisfies theissue that has been raised in the Con-gress. Not to strike section (a) comesclose to an insult to the Mayor and theCouncil Chair who have given theirword in writing and publicly. In polit-ical life, a public man or woman's wordis his or her bond. What D.C. officialshave written and the Mayor has pub-licly declared concerning a pocket vetosurely closes the circle and gives allthe assurances that out of respect anddignity should ever be asked. There is more. As you know, D.C. law is not law until it lays over for 30 legis-lative days. That time frame meansthat considering the upcoming recessdays, no bill could become law untilsometime in March. To add to that in-surance policy, the Congress can on itsown, sui sponte, introduce and enactany bill or amendment concerning theDistrict, such is your all-consumingpower over the District of Columbia. Mayor Anthony Williams and Council Chair Linda Cropp and the D.C. CityCouncil deserve their dignity as grown-up public officials with reputations forintegrity elected to govern our Na-tion's capital. I ask you to show themthe same respect we ourselves woulddemand. Please strike section 168(a). Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am going to have a somewhat mixed response to the comments by the gen-tlewoman from the District of Colum-bia. What we are talking about herehas not, I do not think, been fully stat-ed, and it needs to be. I believe the datewas July 11 when the Council had itsmeeting.At that meeting, an ordinance came up for consideration requiring placinga mandate compelling employers in theDistrict of Columbia to make one por-tion of health insurance coverage bethat contraceptives would be covered,that they would be part of the benefit.Now, we could have a separate debate,we are not going to, but we could havea separate debate about what happenswhen you keep putting different man-dates on health insurance. No matter how common sense some particular mandate may seem to somepeople, it still drives up the cost. It islike every time you buy a car, theysay, do you want this option or thatoption, or anything else that you pur-chase that you have got options, themore options you choose, the higher itcosts. The same thing is true, ofcourse, with health insurance. If you require that people cannot buy health insurance unless you get it withall these options, then you find thatnobody can buy plain coverage. Justlike they could not buy a plain car ifthey had to buy the ones with all theoptions with it. Now, that is a separateissue because frankly it is not the coreof the debate but that is where it start-ed. They said we want to mandate. We want to make sure if you are an em-ployer in the District of Columbia andyou are offering health care benefits,you cannot do it unless you includecoverage for contraceptives. In theprocess of doing so, there had been alot of work behind the scenes and a lotof debate and a lot of effort by the D.C.Council and by people within the com-munity bringing up the issue of a con-science clause. The Catholic Church, and entities af- filiated with it, which has religious be-liefs that are negative toward contra-ceptives, at least in the way that manyother people may look at them, but theCatholic Church is a major employer inthe District of Columbia. GeorgetownUniversity, the hospital services theyprovide, I will mention maybe as partof the laundry list later, but the pointis they said, ``For us and for other peo-ple, you are asking us to be doingsomething that is against our beliefs.You shouldn't do that.'' We have got the first amendment protecting religion in this country.And what happened\u00d0and people saw iton TV, and they read about it\u00d0wasthat a little bit of a fire storm devel-oped because rather than accommo-dating a good faith request for a con-science clause for people who have a re-ligious or moral problem with pro-viding contraceptives, the D.C. Councilran roughshod over them. Not onlythat, they conducted a hearing thatwas vitriolic toward people of faith ingeneral and the Catholic Church in par-ticular. That did not sit well with this Con- gress. That did not sit well with agreat many people in the District. Thatdid not sit well with people in thecountry. So we put in the bill a simpleCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7056 July 26, 2000 provision under our authority, under our obligation of article 1, section 8 ofthe Constitution, to have the legisla-tive authority over the District of Co-lumbia, saying this proposed law, thatI believe ultimately was even adoptedunanimously by the D.C. Council, thisproposed law shall not take effect, can-not do it. And if you come back to fixthings, to adopt a conscience clause,make sure that it covers religious be-liefs and moral convictions, which isthe law that is found in the Federalstandard that we have adopted, for ex-ample, for the Federal employeeshealth benefit plan. The Federal stand-ard provides coverage for contracep-tives but does not mandate that it has to be done so in violation of a religiousbelief or a moral conviction of the em-ployer, employee and so forth. So wehave got that in there. The gentlewoman from the District of Columbia, however, makes an objec-tion to the portion, and to her creditshe is not asking that we strike the en-tire section, she is not asking that andnobody should think that she is. She isnot asking that we strike the sectionthat says if they come back and dosomething again, they must provide aconscience clause for religious beliefand moral conviction. What she is re-questing is that we strike the part thatsays this proposed law shall not go intoeffect. Well, why? Because, she says, having been subjected to this fire storm, themayor and the council have learnedand they have made public statementsthat they intend to do this and themayor has made a public statement,indeed he has done so to me in writing,that he intends to do a pocket veto ofthe bill. Now, that legislation was passed by the D.C. Council a couple of weeks ago,and he has had an opportunity to vetothis legislation. He has had the oppor-tunity. He could just take it, writeveto, and it is vetoed. And then what isleft for us to do? Instead, he said he wants to use a procedure that drags it out, that givesthem, I think it is about 10 businessdays or so, that may ultimately resultin vetoing that legislation which somany people find so offensive, but hehas not done it yet. We are dealingwith the here and now. We are talkingabout the current circumstances,which is that this provision is alive,and people want to look to us and theysay, ``We don't want you to dem-onstrate the disregard for religiousconvictions and beliefs of people offaith in this country that was dem-onstrated by the Council in the Dis-trict of Columbia.'' They want to makesure that we take action to show whichside we are on on this issue. If we do not use our opportunity to disapprove it, who are we siding with?The mayor could veto this bill, the billthat was passed by the D.C. Council. Hecould veto it. He has chosen not to doso. He has said he will do it with apocket veto in the future. I believehim.Nevertheless, right now it is a live issue. And since a live issue is before usand people in the District governmentknew the basic schedule of when thisbill would come to the floor, they couldhave taken action before it got to thispoint. They have not chosen to do so.The D.C. Council could have gotten to-gether and said, we rescind, we takeback what we did. They have not donethat. They have had time to do it.They have not done it. People want toknow where we stand. I believe thatwe, under the situation as it existsnow, should not accept this amend-ment, we should oppose it, but cer-tainly we look forward to the futurewhen the D.C. Council and the mayorwill actually take action, not just saythey are going to do something but willactually take action to fix this situa-tion. Mr. Chairman, I would like to include a letter from the National Conference of CatholicBishops and printed excerpts from D.C. Coun-cil proceedings on this issue. NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS , Washington, DC, July 25, 2000. To Hon. E RNEST ISTOOK , JR. DEARMEMBER OF CONGRESS : As the House of Representatives considers the District ofColumbia appropriations bill for Fiscal Year2001, I write to explain the need for strongconscience protection in the bill's provisionon mandated contraceptive coverage. As approved by committee, the bill pre- vents implementation of the D.C. City Coun-cil's proposal to force all employers in theDistrict of Columbia, to buy coverage for abroad range of contraceptives and abortifa-cient ``morning-after'' drugs for their em-ployees. The bill also expresses the intent ofCongress that any future D.C. legislation onthis issue include a conscience clause that``provides exceptions for religious beliefs andmoral convictions.'' On the House floor there may be an effort to delete or weaken this provision, possiblyby deleting conscience protection based onmoral convictions. Congress should rejectsuch a change. We object to a government mandate for contraceptive coverage generally. At a timewhen tens of millions of Americans lackeven the most basic health coverage, effortto mandate elective drugs and devices whichraise serious moral problems and can posetheir own health risks are misguided. In ad-dition, any such mandate will cause needlessinjustice if it does not provide full protec-tion to those who object for reason of con-science. This is so for several reasons: Narrow Language Protecting only Church- es Is Inadequate. City Council members whostrongly favor the contraceptive mandate of-fered a concscience clause protecting only``religious organizations'' when they ap-proved their bill July 11. But they defined a``religious organization'' so narrowly that itwould exclude hospitals, universities, reli-giously affiliated social service agenciessuch as Catholic Charities, and even Catholicelementary schools. An organization couldqualify for exemption only it its ``primarypurpose'' is the ``inculcation of religious be-liefs''\u00d0and as a Council member observed,Catholic schools teach subjects other thanreligion. The Council also would have as-sessed a fine against each religious organiza-tion claiming an exemption; the fine woulddefray the costs of investigations by the D.C.Insurance Commissioner to ensure that theorganization is ``reglious enough.'' Councilmembers who support genuine conscience protection rightly declined the offer of ``pro- tection'' framed in this way. A vague re-quirement to protect only ``religious be-liefs,'' however, may invite renewed mischiefof this kind. Moral Concerns and Abortifacient Drugs. The D.C. mandate requires coverage of allprescription drugs and devices approved bythe FDA for contraception, including, whatthe FDA calls ``postcoital emergency contra-ception.'' Aside from specifically religiousconcerns, there is broad agreement that suchdrugs often work by destroying an earlyhuman embryo. This raises moral concernsabout early abortion which transcend anyparticular religion. Congress itself bans fed-eral funding of experiments that harm or de-stroy human embryos in the first two weeksof life\u00d0a sound moral decision based on noone religious belief. Congress should notdeny the same right of morally based deci-sion making to others. Federal Precedent on Rights on Con- science. Numerous conscience clauses in fed-eral law protect conscientious objectionbased on both religious and moral grounds,in contexts ranging from capital punishmentto abortion and sterilization. Many statelaws are similarly broad. These are based ona sound understanding that forcing someoneto engage in activity that violates his or herdeeply held conscientious beliefs is a viola-tion of human rights and an abuse of govern-ment. Clearly, not all conscientious moralconvictions are based on religious belief. In-deed, Congress protects medical residencyprograms from being forced to provide abor-tion training regardless of whether their op-position is morally based, because abortionis simply not the kind of practice which any-one should be forced to participate in for anyreason. Current protections against forcedparticipation in abortion and sterilizationalso extend to organizations as well as indi-viduals. To retreat from this tradition nowin favor of narrower and more grudging pro-tection restricted to religious belief alonewould send an ominous signal regarding theU.S. government's respect for rights of con-science. Protecting Individuals' Conscience Rights. By mandating prescription contraceptivecoverage in health plans, the government in-creases the pressure on individual physiciansand pharmacists in these plans to violatetheir own consciences. Even without a gov-ernment mandate, pharmacists' careers havebeen endangered when they refuse on moralgrounds to fill prescriptions for abortifacient``emergency contraception'' tug ofwar,'' Washington Times, May 27, 1997, p.A3). In light of such cases, the American Pharmaceutical Association and other orga-nizations have urged respect for rights of``conscientious refusal'' which they do notconfine to religious grounds. Codes of med-ical ethics, as well, generally speak of physi-cians' right to refuse participation in activi-ties they find immoral or unethical. The fed-eral government has already enacted con-science protection based on both religiousand moral convictions for health care per-sonnel in health plans providing coverage tofederal employees. It should do no less here,attending as well to employees who could beforced by government to purchase morallyobjectionable contraceptive coverage orforgo prescription drug coverage altogether. We believe contraceptive mandates should not be imposed on private organizations. Butif some form of mandate is adopted, effectiveCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7057 July 26, 2000 protection for conscientious objection on both moral and religious grounds should beensured. Sincerely yours, Rev. Msgr. D ENNIS M. S CHNURR , General Secretary.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I have had it. I have really had it. Why do you see people goto the gallery, screaming at the top oftheir lungs, something I do not encour-age now and did not encourage then, ithas a lot to do with what we have justheard. A mayor of the District of Columbia who has credibility with every Memberof this body has indicated in writingand publicly on television that he willpocket veto a bill, and the reason he isgoing to pocket veto the bill is becauseif he just vetoed it in the face of thecouncil, then it would be hard of himto bring the Catholic Church, and he isa Catholic, together with his council. He has indicated publicly, this mayor, who has all the credibility inthe world, that he is going to do whatthis chairman has asked him to do. Themayor has asked me to accept the lan-guage this chairman has written andthis chairman has just gotten up andsaid that that is not enough. We, in theDistrict, are damned if we do and weare damned if we try to do what we saydo. A pocket veto from a mayor who is trying to do what you say do should beall you need when he has accepted thelanguage that we asked him to acceptand when he is working with his ownCatholic Church, and they have agreedto work with him and they have agreednot to come here to ask us to do an-other thing, we ought to declare vic-tory and go home. I am insulted by the fact that you would not accept my amendment byhow hard my mayor and my city coun-cil have worked. You have cast asper-sions on their credibility. You have in-dicated that the mayor had nothing todo with the debate in the council, itwill never be enough for you. You have two more bites at the apple. Supposedly he is a liar, and thatis what you called him today. Sup-posedly he is a liar. You need to havea veto. You need to make it almost im-possible for him to bring the sides to-gether by putting a veto in his face.Supposedly he is a liar. You still have two bites at the apple by rubbing the city's nose in it, timeand time again. Patience is runningout with this body. I resent what thegentleman has done, and I want you toknow it. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman fromVirginia (Mr. M ORAN ). Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Chairman, perhaps some people takeumbrage at the passion of the gentle-woman from the District of Columbia(Ms. N ORTON ), but I would expect that any of us if facing the same level offrustration and unfairness would react in the same passionate manner. She is defending, not only her con- stituents but a process, a democraticprocess, that she believes in thatcaused all of us to get into public serv-ice, and the fact is, she is right, MadamChairman. The mayor of the District ofColumbia said he is going to pocketveto this bill. We have to believe themayor, I cannot believe any of us donot believe that he is going to do that.So if we believe he is going to do that,why are we doing this? He is going to insist that there be a religious exemption clause. People thathave moral objections are going to beable to raise them. So why are wedoing this, putting this offensive lan-guage in this bill? Just to show that weare more powerful than them, just toshow them. She is right. This is wrong. Now, let me also say it is wrong for insurance companies to cover viagrafor men and not cover contraceptionfor women. Let us just tell it like it is.What could be more unfair? All thiscontraceptive equity provision says isthat insurance companies ought to befair and start respecting women, whencontraception is the largest single ex-pense, out-of-pocket expense, forwomen during most of their lives. Itought to be covered. So it is the right legislation. They should have passed this legislation, andit is also true that most of theseCatholic institutions are self-insured.It does not even apply to them. Theyare self-insured. Let me also say something else. I cer- tainly would never say this if my ownlife were different, but having beeneducated in Catholic schools all my life, I understand the sense of frustra-tion and disappointment that Council-man Jim Graham expressed on the D.C.council on this matter. He expressed disappointment with the Catholic church as an institutionbecause of its position towards homo-sexuality. That is his right. So I do notblame him for that. I know he wisheshe had not said that, but these are de-bates that belonged in the D.C. council.These are debates and issues thatshould be settled, should be settled bythe D.C. government. The Catholic institutions within the D.C. government have plenty of access.They are well respected, deservedly so.They contribute tremendous benefitsto D.C. government and its society.They will be fully reflected in the leg-islation that becomes law, and that isthe way it ought to be. We have nobusiness getting involved in this issue,particularly when we have no legiti-mate role to play. The gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. N ORTON ) is absolutely right. The mayor is going to take careof that situation. Let him take care ofthe situation. He will be held account-able. He should be held accountable. HeCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7058 July 26, 2000 is elected. He understands it. He has a solution for it, and that is the way itshould be, and what we are doing onthis floor is not what should be done bythis Congress. Madam Chairman, Igather we are going to continue thisdebate tomorrow. Ms. NORTON. Madam Chairman, I re- serve the balance of my time. Mr. ISTOOK. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Madam Chairman, although I think everyone wants to continue the debatetomorrow, I do find it necessary totake at least 30 seconds, because Ithink a couple of things need to besaid. I certainly would not endorse and ex- tend the attacks on the CatholicChurch or any other church, whetherthe gentleman from Virginia (Mr.M ORAN ) wishes to do so is his free speech right. I fear that he has addedfuel to the fire rather than trying tosuppress it. In response to the gentlewoman from the District (Ms. N ORTON ), I said clear- ly, and I will repeat it, the mayor saidin writing to me that he intends to dothe pocket veto of the bill, and I be-lieve him. That does not change thefact that it has not been vetoed; it re-mains a live issue where people expectthis Congress to do something. It is alive issue until such time as the vetohas indeed occurred. Madam Chairman, I reserve the bal- ance of my time. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Representative N ORTON's Amendment be- cause I am concerned about several of theprovisions in the ``General Provisions'' sectionof this bill. Specifically, I object to discrimina-tory riders targeting the District's lesbian andgay people, and people living with HIV/AIDS. Approximately half of all new HIV infections are linked to injection drug use, and three-quarters of new HIV infections in children arethe result of injection drug use by a parent.Why would we pass up the opportunity tosave a child's life by shutting down programsthat work? Although AIDs deaths have declined in re- cent years as a result of new treatments andimproved access to care, HIV/AIDS remainsthe leading cause of death among African-Americans aged 25\u00b144 in the District. In spiteof these statistics Republicans have singledout the District and attempted to shut downprograms that the local community has estab-lished to reduce new HIV infections. This Con-gress should be supporting the decisions thatlocal communities make about their healthcare. Giving local control back to the Americanpeople has been a major theme of the currentCongress, and interfering with District self-gov-ernment is contradictory to that goal. Numerous health organizations including the American Medical Association, the AmericanPublic Health Association, and the National Al-liance of State and Territorial AIDS Directorshave concluded that needle exchange pro-grams are effective. In addition, at my requestthe Surgeon General's office has prepared areview of all peer-reviewed, scientific studiesof needle exchange programs over the pasttwo years and they also conclusively foundthat needle exchange programs reduce HIV transmission and do not increase drug use. I also object to the provision in this bill that prevents the Health Care Benefits ExpansionAct from being implemented. The Districtpassed this legislation eight years ago to allowDistrict employees to purchase health insur-ance for a domestic partner, take family andmedical leave to care for a partner, and visita hospitalized partner. This legislation pro-vides basic, fundamental health care rightsthat all Americans should enjoy regardless ofsexual orientation. Over 3,000 employers around the country, including hundreds of cities, municipalities, pri-vate and public college and universities, haveestablished domestic partnership health pro-grams. A list of these firms includes almost ahundred Fortune 500 companies, includingsome of the biggest, like AT&T, Citigroup, andIBM. These companies understand the bene-fits of offering these programs in today's com-petitive work environment. Cities such as Atlanta, Chicago, Los Ange- les, San Francisco, and New York all have do-mestic partnership benefits in place. Congresshas taken no action to block any of the do-mestic partnership benefits provided by hun-dreds of municipalities throughout the nation. Gay and Lesbian Americans in the District of Columbia and across the country make sig-nificant contributions to our society and theirrelationships, in the community and in theworkplace, should be treated with respect. Iurge my colleagues to support the NortonAmendment. Mr. ISTOOK. Madam Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to.Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.L ATOURETTE ) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Morella, Chairman pro tem-pore of the Committee of the WholeHouse on the State of the Union, re-ported that that Committee, havinghad under consideration the bill (H.R.4942) making appropriations for thegovernment of the District of Columbiaand other activities chargeable inwhole or in part against the revenuesof said District for the fiscal year end-ing September 30, 2001, and for otherpurposes, had come to no resolutionthereon. f MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON H.R. 4205, FLOYD D. SPENCENATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001 Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, by direc- tion of the Committee on Armed Serv-ices and pursuant to clause 1 of ruleXXII, I offer a privileged motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. S PENCE moves that the House take from the Speaker's table the bill H.R. 4205,with the Senate amendment thereto, dis-agree to the Senate amendment, and agreeto the conference requested by the Senate onthe disagreeing votes of the two Housesthereon. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LATOURETTE ). The gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. S PENCE ) is recog- nized for 1 hour.Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to going to conference with the Senate andbringing back an agreement that canbe supported by all of my House col-leagues. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previousquestion on the motion. The previous question was ordered.The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered bythe gentleman from South Carolina(Mr. S PENCE ). The motion was agreed to. MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES OFFERED BY MR. TAYLOR OF MISSISSIPPI Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I offer a motion to instructconferees. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. T AYLOR moves that the managers on the part of the House at the conference onthe disagreeing votes of the two Houses onthe Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4205be instructed to insist upon the provisionscontained in section 725, relating to theMedicare subvention project for military re-tirees and dependents, of the House bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to rule XXII, the gentleman fromMississippi (Mr. T AYLOR ) and the gen- tleman from South Carolina (Mr.S PENCE ) each will be recognized for 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. T AYLOR ). Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as Imay consume. Mr. Speaker, the motion to instruct conferees would instruct the Houseconferees to retain the House-passedprovisions of the bill that make Medi-care subvention for our Nation's mili-tary retirees permanent and nation-wide. I think in May when the House voted on this we finally took a historic stepin fulfilling a promise that has beenmade by recruiters across our countryfor decades, those recruiters were wear-ing the uniforms of the United Statesof America; they were in Federal build-ings. They promised young,unsuspecting 17-year-olds, 18-year-olds,and 19-year-olds that if they enlisted inour country, if they served their coun-try honorably for 20 years, they wouldbe given lifetime health care in a mili-tary installation. Mr. Speaker, as a result of the De- fense drawdown and as a result ofshrinking Defense budgets, the Depart-ment of Defense was unfortunately leftwith no other choice but to start ask-ing military retirees who have attainedthe age of 65 to go out and see a privatesector doctor and have Medicare paythe bill. After going to the same hospital since they were 18 years old or 19 yearsold, you can imagine how angry theywere, because they had kept theirpromise to our Nation, and our Nationdid not keep its promise to them. It is said when a politician breaks his word, shame on him; but when a Nationbreaks its word, shame on all of us.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7059 July 26, 2000 In May, the House took what I thought was the unprecedented step ofmaking lifetime health care for mili-tary retirees, for the first time it willbe treated the same as Medicare andMedicaid and that that money will bethere every year and not subject to anannual appropriation. Mr. Speaker, I was very pleased to have a number of people helping onthat, Democrats and Republicans fromall parts of our country, in an unitedeffort that just passed the House by 400votes. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman fromMissouri (Mr. S KELTON ), one of the Members that helped make this pos-sible. Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.T AYLOR ) for granting me this time, and I urge my colleagues to support themotion to instruct conferees that hasbeen offered by the gentleman. The motion directs the House con- ferees to maintain the House positionin conference on expanding and makingTRICARE Senior Prime permanent. b1645 As you may recall, on May 18 during consideration of H.R. 4205, the Floyd D.Spence National Defense AuthorizationAct for fiscal year 2001, the House over-whelmingly voted 406 to 10 to makepermanent TRICARE Senior Prime,more commonly known as MedicareSubvention. The House sent a clear sig-nal that Medicare Subvention shouldcontinue to be available to our Medi-care-eligible military retirees and theirfamilies. Expansion of permanent au-thority for Medicare Subvention is avital step toward fulfillment of thecommitment made to our career menand women in uniform who were prom-ised access to health care services forlife. We made a promise to take care of those who served their Nation with dis-tinction for 20 years or more. We mustkeep that promise. The motion to in-struct conferees to retain the Houseposition will help to ensure access tomedical care for Medicare-eligible mili-tary retirees. By spreading TRICARE Senior Prime to military hospitals and making theprogram permanent, we will begin tomeet our promise. Medicare Sub-vention is an important step towardensuring access to care for retirees andtheir dependents over the age of 65 wholive near military facilities. Militaryretirees and their dependents that par-ticipate in the program are very satis-fied with the quality of health carethey receive. In fact, there are manyretirees and their family members inthe current test areas that have beenplaced on a waiting list because mili-tary treatment facilities cannot takemore patients at this time. As I have stated before, this is the year of military health care. As theranking member of the House Com-mittee on Armed Services, I focused onthe need to improve access to health care services for men and women inuniform, particularly for our Medicare-eligible retirees. Retention ofTRICARE's Senior Prime is the firstimportant step in meeting our moralobligation to provide access to qualityhealth care for our military retireesand their families. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to instruct offeredby the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.T AYLOR ). Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the motion by the gen- tleman speaks to a provision thatpassed this House by an overwhelmingvote of 406 to 10 on May 18. I supportedthe provision at the time, reflectingmy strong support for addressing thehealth care crisis afflicting our over-65military retiree population. Since that vote, the Senate, the other body, adopted a differing pro-posal to accomplish the same objectivethat in turn will form the basis for ne-gotiating between our two bodies.Given the strong support in bothChambers for each of these provisions,it is clear to me that the conferencewill bring back an agreement that goesa long way toward addressing this le-gitimate and pressing priority. Accordingly, I will support and urge my colleagues to support the gentle-man's motion as a further affirmationof the bipartisan and bicameral com-mitment to address the unacceptablesituation facing our military retirees. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as Imay consume. Mr. Speaker, let me say that I cer- tainly welcome the support of the gen-tleman from South Carolina, a personwho has served our country all the wayfrom a paratrooper to the chairman ofthe Committee on Armed Services. Mr. Speaker, in the bipartisan spirit in which we passed this amendmentand hope to keep this amendment inthe bill in the final form, I yield suchtime as he may consume to the gen-tleman from Maryland (Mr. B ARTLETT ). Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise instrong support of the Taylor motion toinstruct the conferees. I have seen the recruitment bro- chures from a number of years agowhen those who are now our seniorswere recruited. The recruitment bro-chures promised them and their familylifetime care in a military facility. Wehave broken that promise, and we arepaying a heavy price for having brokenthat promise. Three of the services are now unable to meet their recruitment goals, andthat is partly because when prospectiveenlistees confer with their father ortheir uncle or their grandfather, theyfrequently get the advice that ``I amnot sure that you can believe whatthey are telling you, because they didnot keep their promise to me.''We are having problems with reten- tion for exactly the same reason, be-cause our young men and women in themilitary are not sure that what wehave now promised them is going to bethere after they retire because we havebroken our promise to their elders. What Medicare Subvention does is to permit our retired military people, whoeither with great difficulty or not atall, can now get health care in a mili-tary facility. For those who have notbeen in the military or worked for themilitary and lived in a military com-munity, they cannot understand thesense of community that these peoplehave, how important it is that theycontinue to get health care where theyhave gotten it all their life, in a mili-tary facility. We have had a demonstration project which has been very successful, andwhat the legislation now in conferencedoes is simply to make this universaland permanent. It is the right thing todo, and the benefits we are going to ac-crue from this are enormous comparedto the modest cost, because the costshould be very, very modest, becauseMedicare Subvention assures that themoney is going to be there. What this does is to help us in re- cruitment and help us in retention.Even if there were a meaningful cost, Ithink that that cost should be morethan justified by the benefits that weare going to have in recruiting andkeeping our young people in the mili-tary. This is the right thing to do. My only regret is that we did not do it yearsago. But we are doing it now. So let usmake sure that our conferees under-stand that we want them to hold withthe position that we voted so over-whelmingly here in the House. Again, I want to thank the gen- tleman from Mississippi (Mr. T AYLOR ) for his commitment to this cause. Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. C UNNINGHAM ). Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, the promise for veterans health care hasbeen 58 years, 58 years. The subventionbill was not written by D UKE CUNNINGHAM ; it was written by my con- stituents in San Diego, California. I was the originator of this sub- vention bill. Why? Because nothing wasbeing done for our veterans. TRICARE,if you live in a rural area, is a Band-aidand does not serve. Subvention, if youlive in a rural area, my bill is a Band-aid if it is not controlled. I am going to support this. Even though it was in my bill, I have con-cern. Subvention, TRICARE, FEHBP,like civilians have, if you take a civil-ian secretary that works alongside amajor or lieutenant commander, whenthey retire they get a governmenthealth care plan that supplementstheir Medicare. The military workerdoes not. There is a board already formed look- ing at what is the most universal waythat we can provide this health care;CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7060 July 26, 2000 and whatever that is, I would hope that this House and the other body willcome together to provide whatever isneeded, whether it is a combination ofTRICARE, a combination of sub-vention, or FEHBP. I do not feel thatsubvention is an end-all for our vet-erans, and I would hope that we cometogether on that. I would also tell my colleagues there was another promise. My colleague, thegentleman from California (Mr. F IL- NER), is working on it, as I am. A prom- ise was made to our Filipinos in WorldWar II on that health care. It has notbeen completed, and I would hope thatthis body and the other body would acton that as well. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman for what he has done. I stillhave concern that it may in some way,down the line, if we do not come to-gether, negate what we could do in to-tality for our veterans. I would like towork with the gentleman to make surethat that comes to fruition. Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as Imay consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr.C UNNINGHAM ) for his assistance on this. As the gentleman pointed out duringthe previous debate, he was truly oneof the founding fathers of the idea ofsubvention. And I do not claim to haveinvented it; I just think it is a heck ofa good idea. For the public who may not quite un- derstand what we are trying to do, weare trying to fulfill the promise of life-time health care to our Nation's mili-tary retirees, a promise made to them.We are trying to do it in a way they arecomfortable with. They have beengoing to military treatment facilitiesfor most of their lives, and they arejustifiably angry that upon hitting theage of 65 they are being turned awayfrom those treatment facilities, whenthey have been promised they coulduse that facility, they and their spouse,for the rest of their lives. It is also something that we did not point out in the first debate, but if youlook on the pay stub of the people whoserve in our Nation, on their tax formthey pay into the Medicare TrustFund, just like every other American.So the question is, should not they beallowed to take that Medicare thatthey have contributed to and use it inthe hospital that they wish to go to?That is the hospital on a military in-stallation. Let us give them the choice that every other American has been having,to go to the private sector. Let us letthem go to the hospital that they wantto go to. We know that we can savemoney. The Treasury report that came out just a couple of days ago showed thatthe Nation, despite the talk of unprece-dented surpluses, really had to borrow$11 billion from other trust funds thusfar this year. There is not a lot ofmoney laying around. But we knowthat with Medicare Subvention, that we can treat these same people for 95cents on the dollar of what we wouldhave paid a private sector doctor forthe exact same treatment. So we aregoing to let them go to the hospitalthey want to go to. They have not onlypaid into the system with their taxes,but paid into the system with at least20 years of dedicated service to theirNation. They deserve it. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman fromNorth Carolina (Mr. J ONES ). Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman fromMississippi for yielding time, as Ithank the chairman of the Committeeon Armed Services. This is an important motion to re- commit, to make sure that those whoserve on the conference understandthat the House, as the chairman of theCommittee on Armed Services said, al-most 100 percent said that we want tomake sure that our retirees who are 65years and older will have adequatehealth care. I want to thank the gentleman from Mississippi, because I know he has beenfighting this issue for a couple of years,and I was delighted along with otherMembers from the Republican Party aswell as the Democratic Party to bepart of his amendment. Mr. Speaker, I have 77,000 retired vet- erans in my district. I have about 13,000retired military retirees. I have threemilitary bases: two Marine, CampLejeune and Cherry Point Marine AirStation; and Seymour Johnson AirForce Base. Since I have been in Con-gress, for approximately 6 years, I cantell you from day one, the biggest issuehas been health care for our veteransand our military retirees. I think we have made some great progress in the last 6 years to speak tothis issue, because as has been said bythe gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.T AYLOR ) and by the gentleman from South Carolina (Chairman S PENCE ) and others, the gentleman from California(Mr. C UNNINGHAM ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. B ARTLETT ), those men and women who have served thisNation, whether it be wartime orpeacetime, certain promises were madeto them, and if you cannot look toyour government who made that prom-ise to keep that promise, then there isa big problem; and in the eyes of manyof our men and women who have servedthis Nation, the Government has notkept its promise. I want to thank again the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. T AYLOR ) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.S PENCE ), because we are keeping that promise now; and this amendment bythe gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.T AYLOR ) was certainly a great step for- ward, as it deals with those who arereaching the age of 65. Many of our veterans and retirees are like all of us, with the better quality oflife and health care, we are living to bein the seventies and eighties, and thesemen and women were made a promise, and the promise should be kept. So I strongly support this motion to instruct conferees as it relates to theTaylor amendment, because this issueof Medicare Subvention is with us, andwe have to do what is right for thosemen and women who have served thisNation. Mr. Speaker, as I start closing down on my comments, it is always brought to my attention back home that weseem to find the monies to send ourtroops to Bosnia, or we seem to findthe money to go to Yugoslovia. I thinkBosnia and Yugoslovia both have prob-ably cost the American people about 10or 11 billion, and yet we have got menand women who have served this Na-tion that do not have adequate healthcare. b1700 That is what this bill is doing and that is what this amendment by thegentleman from Mississippi (Mr. T AY- LOR) is doing. We are finally saying to those who have served we are not goingto make them wait any longer. We aregoing to start addressing this issue ofthem having adequate health care andwe are going to make sure that theyhave it. Mr. Speaker, let me quote Abraham Lincoln because he said it better thanI could ever say it. He said, ``Let uscare for him who shall have borne thebattle and for his widow and his or-phan.'' I think that should always be a re- minder to those of us in Congress thatmen and women who have served thisNation in wartime or peacetime, thatwe made a promise to give them thevery best of health care and I want tosay to them today that we are takinggiant steps to keep that promise. I want to thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. T AYLOR ) for his effort. I want to thank the chairman of theCommittee on Armed Services who hasbeen fighting to help those men andwomen to have the very best healthcare possible. I am pleased to support this motion to instruct. Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as Imay consume. Mr. Speaker, the last point I would like to make is that since the passageof this amendment I have had the op-portunity to visit with the surgeongeneral of the United States Air Force,and I had some concerns that quitepossibly the services, if they were notin favor of this idea, could administra-tively poison it. I asked him, I said if we can find the money for this will he make it work? I am not smart enough to remember his exact words, but his sentimentswere that he was extremely excitedabout the idea of being compensatedfor taking care of 65 and older retirees,something that he has been doing basi-cally out of hide.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7061 July 26, 2000 The second thing that he was ex- tremely excited about is the variety ofhealth care cases that his doctors willnow be able to see and be compensatedfor because, as he said, and I will neversay it as well as he did, cardiologists donot stay very busy when all they aretaking care of is 18- and 19- and 20-year-olds; but in order to have themwell trained for mobilization, it is im-portant that some of the older retireesare included in this mix so that thosepeople can hone their skills that theyare going to need in the event of a na-tional emergency. So for so many reasons, I think this is a good idea for our Nation. Numberone, it is the right thing to do. We aregoing to keep our promise to those peo-ple who kept their promise to us. Number two, we are going to do it in a fiscally responsible manner. I think, Mr. Speaker, quite frankly, I am most pleased that in the history ofthis committee we have tried to dothings in a bipartisan manner. I ammost pleased that we are going to keepthat promise in a bipartisan manner. Ivery much welcome the remarks of thechairman of the committee. I verymuch welcome the remarks of gen-tleman from Missouri (Mr. S KELTON ), the ranking member. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. K UCINICH ). Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.T AYLOR ) for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition. The Congressional Budget Office has esti-mated that this national missile de-fense system, which is part of this re-port, will cost $60 billion to build anddeploy. Congress intends to spend $12billion in the next 6 years. The SDIStar Wars system has cost the tax-payer more than $60 billion, and it isestimated that this system though lessfar-reaching than Star Wars will costmore. We have spent more than $122billion on various missile defense sys-tems. We need to reorganize our prior-ities and look at how we could betteruse these funds for programs that ben-efit the poor, seniors, and our Nation'schildren. Before the decision is made, three exo-atmospheric intercept tests havebeen scheduled to determine the sys-tem's success rate and reliability to de-ploy the system, but one of two testsfailed. The third test failed miserablyas well. Three tests cannot define thetechnical readiness of the system andserve the basis for deploying a nationalmissile defense. According to the Union for Con- cerned Scientists, countermeasurescould be deployed more rapidly andwould be available to potentialattackers before the United Statescould deploy even the much less capa-ble first phase of the system. A report by the Union of Concerned Scientists details how easily counter-measures could be used against thissystem and would not have to use newtechnology or new materials.We are the only superpower in the world. The deterrent that we currentlyhave is sufficient. We have thousandsof missiles on hand that act as a deter-rent. Any attack by another statewould not be massive and would not beable to completely destroy our countryor our nuclear arsenals. So any attackwould leave the United States and itsArmed Forces intact. Our deterrent is impaired only if an- other state had enough missiles toknock off ours before they launched. The national missile defense system will simply line the pockets of weaponscontractors, spending billions of dol-lars for a system that does not workand does not protect against realthreats. We will undermine our legiti-mate military expenditures and erodethe readiness of our forces. So who is benefiting from having a national missile defense system? Ac-cording to The Washington Post, Boe-ing in 1998 already obtained a 3-yearcontract for $1.6 billion to assemble abasic system before the President evendecided to deploy the system. The Poststates that TRW has contracts for vir-tually every type of missile defenseprogram. The military industry has themost to gain from a national defensesystem. According to The WashingtonPost, Lockheed Martin is the majorcontractor on theater missile defensewith its upgraded version of the Pa-triot missile and the Army's $14 billionTheater High Altitude Area Defensesystem. Deploying a national missile defense system could politically succeed in set-ting the stage for a worldwide armsrace and dismantle past arms treaties. The NMD violates the central prin- ciple of the ABM treaty, which is a banon deployment of strategic missile de-fenses. It will undermine the nuclearnonproliferation treaty. It will frus-trate SALT II and SALT III. It willlead directly to proliferation by the nu-clear nations. It will lead to transi-tions toward nuclear arms by the non-nuclear nations. It will make the worldless safe. It will lead to the impoverish-ment of the people of many nations asbudgets are refashioned for nucleararms expenditures. Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as Imay consume. Mr. Speaker, one of the lessons I had to teach myself was that almost everyMember of Congress represents about600,000 people. Even those people I dis-agree with, everybody in this floor waselected by a majority of the voters andI am going to respect their ability tosay what they want to say. I would like to remind the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. K UCINICH ) that the mat- ter at hand is health care for our Na-tion's military retirees. This is a mo-tion to instruct the conferees to stickto the House-passed provisions of thebill, provisions that I think greatly im-prove health care for our Nation's mili-tary retirees; a much better packagethan the other body.At this moment we are instructing our conferees to stick to what I thinkis the better language of the two. Itreally has nothing to do with missiledefense. Mr. Speaker, again, it is always to be a position to be envied when one hastheir chairman and ranking memberwith them and most of their sub-committee chairmen with them. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. L ATOURETTE ). Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the mo-tion to instruct. There was no objection.The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to instructoffered by the gentleman from Mis-sissippi (Mr. T AYLOR ).

W ILLIAM J. C LINTON . THEWHITE HOUSE , July 26, f EDUCATION DEPARTMENT'S MIS- MANAGEMENT OF TAXPAYERS'MONEY (Mr. SCHAFFER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. SCHAFFER. Mr. Speaker, I am here on a personal crusade. I came toCongress because I have got five chil-dren and I care about their school.They are getting ready to go back toschool in August. A couple of things disturb me, Mr. Speaker. The Department of Educationcontract employees, some of them,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7062 July 26, 2000 pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme to defraud the Department ofmore than $1 million in equipment andfalse overtime. They illegally procuredequipment, including a 61-inch tele-vision set, digital cameras, and Gate-way computers for the personal use ofDepartment employees and their fami-lies. That is not all. Another fraudulent overtime claim includes a trip to Balti-more to pick up crab cakes for anotherDepartment employee. Two more De-partment employees were recentlycharged by the Department of Justicewith involvement in this scandal, andas many as four other Department em-ployees remain under investigation. In 1998, the Department could not even audit its books, they were sobadly managed. In 1999 when they didaudit their books, they got a D minus. Republicans have a different idea. We want to get dollars to the classroomand out of that bureaucracy over there. Mr. Speaker, unbeknownst to all but Belt- way bureaucrats and a handful of reformminded Members of Congress, the U.S. De-partment of Education has failed its last two fi-nancial audits. The nationally known and respected ac- counting firm Ernst and Young has attempted, for fiscal years 1998 and 1999, to determineif the Department of Education has spent themoney sent to it by Congress appropriatelyand lawfully. The sad truth is, we just don't know. The Department's books were unauditable for FY1998. This means the auditors couldn't evenform an opinion on the state of the Depart-ment's books, let alone say whether thosebooks were balanced and accurate. In FY 1999, the Department received a grade equivalent of a D \u00b7. This means the auditors could put the books together intosome sort of coherence, but not well enoughto give the Department a passing grade in Ac-counting 101. According to the auditors, if a private com- pany received the same results the Depart-ment did on its FY 1999 audit, its stock wouldplummet. A real life example of this is Micro-Strategy, whose stock, on the day a criticaland unfavorable audit was announced, fell62% and unleashed a slew of investor law-suits. Sadly, no one really knows when the De- partment will be able to receive a clean audit. So, Mr. Speaker, what does this really mean to taxpayers\u00d0parents\u00d0and children? A fewrecent incidents illustrate the effects of this fi-nancial mis-management. A Department of Education contract em- ployee pleaded guilty to participating in ascheme to defraud the Department of morethan one million dollars in equipment and falseovertime. Illegally procured equipment in-cluded a 61 inch TV, digital cameras, andGateway computers for the personal use ofDepartment employees and their families. However, that's not all. Among the fraudu- lent overtime claims was a trip to Baltimore topick-up crab-cakes for another Departmentemployee. Two more Department employees were re- cently charged by the Department of Justicewith involvement with this scandal, and asmany as four other Department employees re-main under investigation.Earlier this year, 39 students were incor- rectly notified by the Department that they hadwon the prestigious Jacob Javits scholarships.The cost of the mistake? Nearly $4 million dol-lars. The theft ring and mis-identified students may only be the tip of the iceberg. Who knowswhat other kinds of waste, fraud, abuse andmismanagement might be taking place rightnow because of the inaction of the A LGORE and Education Secretary Riley? For example, in one academic year alone, $177 million dollars in Pell Grants were im-properly awarded, and the Department forgavealmost $77 million in student loans for bor-rowers who falsely claimed to be either per-manently disabled or dead. The Department of Education also maintains a ``grantback'' account which at one time con-tained $750 million. Not surprisingly for anagency that cannot pass a basic audit, most ofthis money didn't really belong there. So far,the Department has been unable to explainexactly where the money came from, where itwent, or why it came and went. Is a clean audit an unreasonable goal for a federal agency? Bureaucrats would have youbelieve it is, but we all know it isn't. In fact,businesses large and small comply with thissimple measure of fiscal responsibility everyday. Any business owner will tell you the im-portance of a clean audit to maintain the con-fidence of investors and customers and to pre-vent waste, fraud and abuse. The Department has failed to address its fi- nancial management for eight years running.Inaction has consequences and our childrenare paying the price. Fortunately, Republicanshave responded to this inexcusable waste ofhard-earned taxpayer money devoted to sup-port the education of American children. Wehave held numerous oversight hearings, con-tinue a rigorous investigation and passed a billrequiring a comprehensive fraud audit of theDepartment by the General Accounting Office. We know what needs to be done. Until it is, the taxpayers' investment in the education ofAmerican school children will not reap any-thing close to maximum return. f OMISSION FROM THE CONGRES- SIONAL RECORD OF TUESDAY,JULY 25, 2000 AT PAGE H\u00b16853 (The following addition to the state- ment of the gentleman from Wisconsin(Mr. R YAN) was omitted from the C ON- GRESSIONAL RECORD of Tuesday, July 25, 2000 at page H6853.) Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4924, the ``Truth in Regulating Act of 2000,'' is a bi-par-tisan, good government bill. It estab-lishes a regulatory analysis functionwithin the General Accounting Office(GAO). This function is intended to en-hance Congressional responsibility forregulatory decisions developed underthe laws Congress enacts. It is theproduct of the leadership over the lastfew years by Small Business Sub-committee Chairwoman on RegulatoryReform and Paperwork Reduction, SueKelly. The most basic reason for supporting this bill is Constitutional: Just as Con-gress needs a Congressional Budget Of-fice (CBO) to check and balance the ex-ecutive Branch in the budget process,so it needs an analytic capability to check and balance the ExecutiveBranch in the regulatory process. GAOis a logical location since it alreadyhas some regulatory review respon-sibilities under the Congressional Re-view Act (CRA). Article I, Section 1 of the U.S. Con- stitution vests all legislative powers inthe U.S. Congress. While Congress may not delegate its legislative functions,it routinely authorizes ExecutiveBranch agencies to issue rules that im-plement laws passed by Congress. Con-gress has become increasingly con-cerned about its responsibility to over-see agency rulemaking, especially dueto the extensive costs and impacts ofFederal rules. During the 105th congress, the House Government Reform Subcommittee onNational Economic Growth, NaturalResources, and Regulatory Affairs,chaired by David McIntosh, held ahearing on Mrs. Kelly's earlier regu-latory analysis bill (H.R. 1704), whichsought to establish a new, freestandingCongressional agency. The Sub-committee then marked up and re-ported her bill (H. Rept. 105\u00b1441, Part2). H.R. 1704 called for the establish-ment of new Legislative Branch Con-gressional Office of Regulatory Anal-ysis (CORA) to analyze all major rulesand report to Congress on potentialcosts, benefits, and alternative ap-proaches that could achieve the sameregulatory goals at lower costs. Thisagency was intended to aid Congress inanalyzing Federal regulations. TheCommittee Report stated, ``Congressneeds the expertise that CORA wouldprovide to carry out its duty under theCRA. Currently, Congress does nothave the information it needs to care-fully evaluate regulations. The onlyanalysis it has to rely on are those pro-vided by the agencies which promul-gate the rules. There is no official,third-party analysis of new regula-tions'' (p. 5). Unfortunately, CORA supporters in the 105th Congress could not overcomethe resistance of the defenders of theregulatory status quo. Opponents ar-gued against creating a new Congres-sional agency on the basis of fiscal con-servatism. By this logic, Congressought to abolish CBO, as an even moreheroic demonstration of fiscal conserv-atism in action. Of course, most of usrecognize that dismantling CBO, how-ever penny wise, would be pound fool-ish. In the 106th Congress, Government Reform Subcommittee Chairman DavidMcIntosh and Small Business Sub-committee Chairwoman Sue Kelly,seeking to accommodate the prejudiceagainst a CORA within GAO, which is an existingLegislative Branch agency. McIntoshand Kelly introduced their bills in Jan-uary and February 2000. On May 10th,the Senate passed its own regulatoryanalysis legislation, S. 1198, the ``TruthCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7063 July 26, 2000 in Regulating Act of 2000,'' by unani- mous consent. Like the McIntosh andKelly bills, the Senate legislationwould also establish a regulatory anal-ysis function within GAO. During the 106th Congress, the Gov- ernment Reform Committee did nothold a hearing specifically on H.R. 4924but the Subcommittee on NationalEconomic Growth, Natural Resources, and Regulatory Affairs did hold a June14th hearing, entitled ``Does CongressDelegate Too Much Power to Agenciesand What Should be Done About It?''At the hearing, Senator S AM BROWNBACK and Representative J.D. HAYWORTH testified that Congress needs to assume more responsibilityfor regulations. Dr. Wendy Lee Gramm,Director, Regulatory Studies Program,Mercatus Center, George Mason Uni-versity and former Administrator ofthe Office of Information and Regu-latory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB); AlanRaul, partner, Sidley & Austin andformer OMB General Counsel; andDavid Schoenbrod, Professor of Law,New York Law School and AdjunctScholar, Cato Institute, all affirmedthat Congress needs to conduct moreoversight of regulations, especiallyregulatory proposals lacking an ex-plicit delegation of authority fromCongress. Witnesses discussed the need for a CORA function that would assist Con-gress in assuming more responsibilityfor agency rules, which now imposeover $700 billion in annual off-budgetcosts on the American people. Wit-nesses stressed the need for analyticalassistance so that Congress could espe-cially provide timely comment on pro-posed rules, while there is still an op-portunity to influence the cost, scopeand content of the final agency action.Witnesses stated that a regulatoryanalysis function should: (a) take intoaccount Congressional legislative in-tent; (b) examine other, less costly reg-ulatory and nonregulatory alternativeapproaches besides those in an agencyproposal; and (c) identify additional,non-agency sources of data on benefits,costs, and impacts of an agency's pro-posal. Dr. Gramm testified that, ``there's clearly a need for more and betteranalysis that is independent of theagency writing the regulation . . . Inmy view, Congress cannot carry She continued by rec-ommending, ``a shadow OIRA, and thatis to perform independent, agency regulations at theproposal stage . . . whether or not theagency has considered the al-ternatives, what might be other alter-natives . . . I would suggest that allthis analysis be done at the proposalstage so that this information can beput into the rulemaking record.'' On June 26th, Chairwoman Kelly and Chair- man McIntosh introduced H.R. 4744, whichmade several needed improvements to theSenate-passed S. 1198, along the lines sug-gested by the witnesses at the June 14th hearing. For example, whereas S. 1198 mere-ly permits GAO to assist Congress in submit-ting timely comments on proposed regulationsduring the public comment period, H.R. 4744would require GAO to provide such assist-ance. This was a critical improvement, be-cause it is only by commenting on proposedrules during the public comment period thatCongress has any real opportunity to influencethe cost, scope, and content of regulation. Inaddition, unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 4744would require GAO to review not only theagency's data but also the public's data to as-sure a more balanced evaluation, analyze notonly rules costing $100 million or more butalso rules with a significant impact on smallbusinesses, and examine whether alternativesnot considered by the agencies might achievethe same goal in a more cost-effective manneror with greater net benefits. On June 29th, the Government Reform Committee favorably reported H.R. 4744, witha thorough discussion of issues in its accom-panying report (H. Rept. 106\u00b1772). H.R. 4924, introduced July 24th, only two\u00d0or, more accurately, one and ahalf\u00d0of H.R. 4744's improvements to S. 1198:(a) inclusion, within the scope of GAO's pur-view, of agency rules with a significant impacton small businesses; and (b) a directive toGAO to submit its independent evaluation ofproposed rules within the public comment pe-riod, albeit only when doing so is ``prac-ticable.'' House Report 106\u00b1772 explains thebasis for these improvements. Nonetheless, Iam deeply disappointed that we could not per-suade the Honorable gentleman from Cali-fornia that timely comments on proposed rulesare better than untimely or late comments.But, I understand that, in politics, half a loaf\u00d0or, in this case, a fraction of a loaf\u00d0may stillbe better than none. H.R. 4924 is, in my judg-ment, inferior to H.R. 4744, which is itself awatered down version of the complete reformneeded to implement Congress' Constitutionalresponsibility for regulatory oversight. But, it isa step in the right direction. And, it will give re-formers something to build upon in the nextCongress. H.R. 4924 is truly a modest proposal. It does not require or expect GAO to conductany new Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs),cost-benefit analyses, or other impact anal-yses. However, GAO's independent evaluationshould lead the agencies to prepare any miss-ing cost/benefit, small business impact, fed-eralism impact, or any other missing analysis.For example, after the McIntosh Sub-committee insisted that the Department ofLabor prepare a missing RIA for its Birth andAdoption Unemployment Compensation(``Baby UI'') proposed rule, Labor finally pre-pared one. Unfortunately, H.R. 4924 excludes from GAO's purview major rules promulgated bythe independent regulatory agencies, such asthe Federal Communications Commission, theFederal Trade Commission, and the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, which regulatemajor sectors of the U.S. economy. Since theanalyses accompanying rules issued by theindependent regulatory agencies are often in-complete or inadequate, this omission is unfor-tunate and makes the bill less useful than ei-ther S. 1198 or H.R. 4744. Here's how H.R. 4924 works. The Chairman or Ranking Member of a Committee of juris-diction may request that GAO submit an inde- pendent evaluation to the Committee on amajor proposed rule during the public com-ment period or on a major final rule within 180days. GAO's analysis shall include an evalua-tion of the potential benefits of the rule, thepotential costs of the rule, alternative ap-proaches in the rulemaking record, and thevarious impact analyses. Congress currently has two opportunities to review agency regulatory actions. Under theAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), Congresscan comment on agency proposed and interimrules during the public comment period. TheAPA's fairness provisions require that allmembers of the public, including Congress, begiven an equal opportunity to comment. LateCongressional comments cannot be consid-ered by the agency unless all other late publiccomments are equally considered. Agenciescan ignore comments filed by Congress afterthe end of the public comment period, as theDepartment of Labor did after its proposed``Baby UI'' rule. Therefore, since GAO cannotbe given more time than other members of thepublic to comment, GAO should complete itsreview of agency regulatory proposals duringpublic comment period. Under the CRA, Congress can disapprove an agency final rule after it is promulgated butbefore it is effective. Unfortunately, Congresshas been unable to fully carry out its responsi-bility under the CRA because it has neither allof the information it needs to carefully evalu-ate agency regulatory proposals nor sufficientstaff for this function. In fact, since the March1996 enactment of the CRA, there has beenno completed Congressional resolutions ofdisapproval. In recent years, various statutes (such as the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995and the Small Business Regulatory Enforce-ment Fairness Act of 1996) and executive or-ders (such as Reagan's 1981 mandated that Executive Branch agen-cies conduct extensive regulatory analyses,especially for economically significant ruleshaving a $100 million-or-more effect on theeconomy or a significant impact on small busi-nesses. Congress, however, does not havethe analytical capability to independently andfairly evaluate these analyses. To assume oversight responsibility for Fed- eral regulations, Congress needs to be armedwith an independent evaluation. What is need-ed is an analysis of legislative history to seeif there is a non-delegation problem, such asin the Food and Drug Administration's pro-posed rule to regulate tobacco products, whichwas struck down by the Supreme Court inFDA v. Brown & Williamson, or backdoor leg-islating, such as in the Department of Labor's``Baby UI'' rule, which provides paid familyleave to small business employees, eventhough Congress in the Family and MedicalLeave Act said no to paid family leave andany coverage of small businesses. Sometimes the quickest (or only) way to find out that an agency has ignored Congressionalintent or failed to consider less costly or non-regulatory alternatives, is to examine non-agency (i.e., ``public'') data and analyses. It isfor that reason that, under H.R. 4744, GAOwould be required to consult the public's dataCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7064 July 26, 2000 in the course of evaluating agency rules. Al- though H.R. 4924 does not require GAO to re-view public data, neither does it forbid or pre-clude GAO from doing so. I bring this up, be-cause some hope that H.R. 4924 implicitlycontains a gag order, forbidding GAO to con-sult any analyses or data except those sup-plied by the agency to be reviewed. This read-ing of H.R. 4924 would defeat the whole pur-pose of the bill, which is to enable Congressto comment knowledgeably about agencyrules from the standpoint of a truly inde-pendent evaluation of those rules. Instructed by GAO's independent evalua- tions, Congress will be better equipped to re-view final agency rules under the CRA. Moreimportantly, Congress will be better equippedto submit timely and knowledgeable commentson proposed rules during the public commentperiod. I say this, notwithstanding the words``where practicable,'' which some CORA foeshope will ensure that all GAO analyses of pro-posed rules are untimely and, therefore,worthless. I am confident that, despite the``where practicable'' language, GAO will wantto please rather than annoy its customers andemployers, and will not fail to help Members ofCongress submit timely comments on regu-latory proposals. Thus, even though a far cry from the origi- nal idea of an independent CORA agency,and although inferior to the Kelly-McIntosh billreported by the Government Reform Com-mittee, H.R. 4924 will increase the trans-parency of important regulatory decisions, pro-mote effective Congressional oversight, andincrease the accountability of Congress. Thebest government is a government accountableto the people. For America to have an ac-countable regulatory system, the people'selected representatives must participate in,and take responsibility for, the rules promul-gated under the laws Congress passes. H.R.4924 is a meaningful step towards Congress'smeeting its regulatory oversight responsibility. f SPECIAL ORDERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 1999, and under a previous orderof the House, the following Memberswill be recognized for 5 minutes each. f FARM ECONOMY IN THE UNITED STATES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Minnesota (Mr. M INGE) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MINGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to address this Chamber onthe topic of the farm economy in theUnited States and the agriculturalpolicies that we have adopted in Con-gress. The 1996 farm bill, generally called the Freedom to Farm Act, has been ef-fective in one respect, and that is ithas given farmers flexibility to plantwhat they are interested in raising andnot be tied as closely to particularcommodities by the design of the farmbill itself. Unfortunately, the Freedom to Farm Act has become a freedom to fail act,and we have farmers that are exitingfrom farming at a record rate. We have prices for commodities in this countrythat have dropped to levels that are aslow as they have been in 100 years, ifwe adjust for inflation. We constantlyhear about the plight of those whowere producing oil and now we havegasoline at $1.50 to $1.75 a gallonthroughout the country. Well, if farmers had seen their prices go up without any adjustment for in-flation, they at least would be paying$2.50 for corn, $3.00 for wheat, and high-er amounts for other products. Trag-ically, in the United States, in themidst of a very robust and healthy andgrowing economy, one sector of theAmerican economy that is hurting se-verely is agriculture. So I am pleasedto announce that today I have joinedwith my colleague, the gentleman fromNorth Dakota (Mr. P OMEROY ), and we have introduced legislation that is theFamily Farm Safety Net Act of 2000. The purpose of this legislation is to provide an outline or guide to the typeof prices that are necessary in order toenable a farm to survive in the UnitedStates. Since 1996, we can see what has hap- pened to the prices for corn, wheat andsoybeans. Prices have dropped precipi-tously. In 1996, corn was at $2.71 a bush-el. Here we are in the summer of theyear 2000, corn is roughly half thatprice at most of the elevators in theMidwest. b1715 The drop in the price of wheat has not been quite as dramatic, but it stillhas come down by roughly $1.80 a bush-el, and the price for a bushel of soy-beans has come down by about $2.50 abushel. This certainly is not success in terms of agricultural policy. In terms of flexibility, we also have a very frustrating situation. This chartshows what has happened in terms ofthe planting of wheat compared to theplanting of soybeans. Soybeans, ac-cording to agricultural economists, arefavored by the current situation.Wheat, by comparison, is not as advan-tageous to raise. So as a consequence,we have seen the acreage of wheat, ithas been reduced by thousands of acres,and at the same time, the planting ofsoybeans has gone up by about a cor-responding amount. Mr. Speaker, we need to reestablish parity among the various crops. Oneway to do this is to take the loan ratefor the marketing loans and harmonizethe loan rates so that the loan rates forsoybeans, for corn, for wheat, barleyand other crops are neutral, and at thesame time, have the loan rates peggedat a level where America's farmers cancover most of the costs of their oper-ation. So as a consequence, our pro-posal is to increase the loan rate forcorn as an example, to $2.43 a bushel;the loan rate on soybeans to $5.50 abushel; to extend the period of the mar-keting loan to 20 months; and to in-clude payment limitations, so that thisfarm program does not enrich those that are farming tens of thousands ofacres, but instead, focuses its benefitsand its attention on those farmers thatare moderate size, family farming oper-ations. Mr. Speaker, I submit that this is the track that we need to take if we aregoing to get American agriculture backon course, and I urge my colleagues tojoin with the gentleman from NorthDakota (Mr. P OMEROY ) and myself on this legislation. f TOPICS OF NATIONAL INTEREST The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LATOURETTE ). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Ten-nessee (Mr. D UNCAN ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to- night to speak on two unrelated, butvery important topics of national in-terest. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, first, I spent 71\u00a42years before coming to Con- gress as a criminal court judge, tryingfelony criminal cases. I tried severaldeath penalty cases, and I think I amthe only Member of this Congress whohas sentenced anyone to the electricchair. It is almost impossible, Mr. Speaker, to get a jury to return a death sentencetoday. Despite polls showing very highsupport for capital punishment, it isone thing to favor the death penalty,but a much more difficult thing to ac-tually impose it. It is so difficult, infact, that most prosecutors will noteven ask for a death sentence except inthe most gruesome, horrible cases; andthat is the main point I wish to maketoday, that juries return death sen-tences only in extremely brutal, ter-rible crimes. In fact, it has been the law in this country for many years that an ordi-nary, simple murder, if there is such athing, with nothing more, is not a cap-ital case. To have a case justifying thedeath penalty, there must be aggra-vating circumstances that outweighany mitigating factors, anything sym-pathetic in favor of the defendant.There have to be multiple crimes orkillings, circumstances that make thecase especially heinous. I do not think a death sentence is ap- propriate except in 1 in 1 million veryrare, very unusual kinds of cases. But Ido believe that there are cases whichare so gruesome, so horrendous that adeath sentence is the only appropriatepunishment. Those who oppose thedeath penalty should ask themselves,would they oppose it if their daughteror wife or sister was brutally raped asher three small children watched andthen all were strangled to death, an ac-tual case. The media does a great job gaining sympathy for those who are about to beput to death. I wish they would do justas good a job describing the sickeningdetails of the murders that have beenCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7065 July 26, 2000 committed, even if almost shockingly, a prosecutor can get a rare, unusualjury to return a death sentence, thetrial judge sits as the 13th juror andmust later approve the verdict or grant a new trial or sometimes a lesser sen-tence. Following the trial judge, bothState and Federal appellate courts re-view the case. Usually at least 30 or 40judges review a death sentence beforeit is carried out, and many of thesejudges are philosophically opposed tothe death penalty. There seems to be areal drum beat in the media to do awaywith capital punishment. I urge my colleagues and others to look very closely at this before theyjump on this particular band wagon. SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS IN AMERICA Mr. DUNCAN. Secondly, Mr. Speak- er, another important, but unrelatedissue of national concern is the im-pending teacher shortage. This is avery artificial, political government-produced shortage. It has come aboutonly because the teachers' unions andcolleges of education want to dras-tically restrict and limit and controlthe number of people allowed to teachin the Nation's public schools. If a person with a Ph.D. and 30 years of experience, say a chemist, wanted toteach after working for years for theGovernment, he cannot do so under therules in most States today. If a smallcollege went under and a professor with25 years of teaching experience, let ussay a professor of English, wanted tomove to a public school, he could notdo so in most States today. If a verysuccessful businessman wanted toteach for a few years as a way to con-tribute back to society, he could not doso today, despite all of his great wealthand success and experience. Why? Be-cause they would not have the requireddegrees in education. So school boards are restricted to hiring 22-year-olds with no experiencebecause they have taken a few edu-cation courses over people with Ph.D.sand great experience and success andknowledge who have not had the edu-cation courses. This makes no sense atall at any time, but it is crazy in atime when there is or is about to be ateacher shortage. School boards shouldnever hire an unqualified teacher, butthey should be given the flexibility andfreedom and power to hire people whohave great knowledge or experience orsuccess in a particular field, even ifthey have never taken an educationcourse. If they could do this, therewould be no teacher shortage in thiscountry. There are hundreds of thou-sands of experienced, well-trained,well-educated people with degrees andeven graduate degrees who have nottaken education courses, but who couldand would make great teachers, if onlygovernment regulations would givethem the freedom and opportunity todo so.HIV/AIDS, THE WORLD'S DEADLIEST DISEASE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Maryland (Mr. C UMMINGS ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to discuss one of the most chal-lenging and life-threatening publichealth issues facing the global commu-nity, HIV infection and AIDS. I willalso highlight significant actions ourgovernment and fellow Americans havetaken to combat this threat. HIV/AIDS is now the world's dead- liest disease with more than 40 millionpersons infected worldwide. Not sur-prisingly, the pandemic affects themost vulnerable citizens of our globalcommunity. In fact, nearly 95 percentof infected persons live in the devel-oping countries, with sub-Saharan Af-rica being the hardest hit of any otherregion in the world. The statistics are startling. New HIV infections in Africa have numberedmore than 1.4 million each year since1991. That is an average of more than3,800 new HIV/AIDS infections per day.Nearly 6,000 will die within this sametime frame. Mr. Speaker, 23.3 millionadults and children are infected withthe HIV virus in the region, which has about 10 percent of the world's popu-lation, but nearly 70 percent of theworldwide total of infected people. Life expectancy in these nations has been reduced by the disease to between22 and 40 years. Some sub-Saharan Af-rican countries could lose as much as athird of their adult population by 2010,and 16 African countries have an HIVinfection rate of more than 10 percent.South Africa is 20 percent, Zimbabweand Swaziland are at 25 percent; and inBotswana, which has the highest infec-tion rate in the region, 36 percent ofadults are HIV infected. When I hear these daunting statis- tics, I am reminded of a quote by JohnF. Kennedy. He said, ``Mankind mustput an end to war, or war will put anend to mankind.'' HIV/AIDS and itsdeath toll have declared war on our hu-manity. We must fight back. All sec-tors and all spheres of society have tobe involved as equal partners in fight-ing this assault. The health sector can-not meet this challenge on its own, norcan one government or nation. It is im-perative that we have a collective glob-al effort. Although I do believe we can do more, I am proud to say that the exec-utive and legislative branches of ourgovernment, as well as the private sec-tor, have taken significant steps inthat direction. Earlier this month, theU.S. Export-Import Bank extended upto $1 billion in financing to 24 sub-Sa-haran African countries to buy anti-AIDS drugs. The financing will be com-bined with a $500 million commitmentfrom the World Bank to help thesecountries purchase reduced-priceddrugs, buy medical equipment, and de-velop specialized health services. More recently, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE), along withthe gentlewoman from California (Ms. WATERS ), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. H ASTINGS ), and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. J ACKSON ), and the Congressional Black Caucus success-fully offered an amendment adding $42million to the Infectious Disease Ac-count for international HIV/AIDS fund-ing in the House-passed version of thefiscal year 2001 Foreign Operations Ap-propriations Act. The amendment in-creased this important funding for HIV/AIDS to the President's original budg-et request of $244 million, which is $190million over current-year funding. Additionally, during the 13th Inter- national Annual AIDS Conference inDurban, South Africa this month, theBill and Melinda Gates Foundation an-nounced a round of grants amountingto $100 million to prevent AIDS inmothers and children, assist AIDS or-phans, and relieve suffering in dyingpatients. Of this funding, a $50 milliongrant will go to Botswana, the countryin sub-Sahara with the highest HIV in-fection rate. That will be matchedmostly through drug donations by theU.S. Merck Pharmaceutical Corpora-tion. When the history of this war is writ- ten, it will record the collective effortsof societies. Future generations willjudge us on the adequacy of our re-sponse. I commend the Ex-Im Bank,my colleagues in this House, and theBill and Melinda Gates Foundation fortheir compassion and foresight in ad-dressing this issue. f TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIESACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentle-woman from Maryland (Mrs. M ORELLA ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. MORELLA. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to comment this evening tothis body on the 10th anniversary ofthe Americans With Disabilities Act. I want to make a quote: ``I now lift my pen to sign the Americans WithDisabilities Act and say, let the shame-ful wall of exclusion finally come tum-bling down.'' That was spoken by President Bush on July 26, 1990. Mr. Speaker, I risetoday to reflect on how far we as a Na-tion have come since that summer day10 years ago when I was honored to bean original cosponsor of the AmericansWith Disabilities Act. Today, I joined another President and disability advocates at the F.D.R.Memorial, President Franklin DelanoRoosevelt Memorial, to commemoratethis landmark law. I want to discuss a little bit what has happened in the decade since its enact-ment, but I would like to recognize forabout 40 seconds the distinguished gen-tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.G EKAS ), who would like to make a com- ment. Mr. GEKAS. Mr. Speaker, I join with the gentlewoman in the celebration ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7066 July 26, 2000 the moment of the 10 years of good times spent in developing the Ameri-cans With Disabilities Act. I was on thecommittee, as I still am, on the Com-mittee on the Judiciary, when we hadthe first hearing; and one of the prin-cipal witnesses, some may remember,was Attorney General, then AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornberg in the Bushadministration, speaking for the Bushadministration, endorsing the Ameri-cans With Disabilities Act, and bring-ing into play not only his personal andprofessional endorsement of it for theBush administration, but also becausehe himself as a father has undergoneproblems in the family with peoplewith disabilities. So we had a merging, during that committee, of all of the elements thatare necessary to make the AmericansWith Disabilities Act work, namely,that the administration, whatever ad-ministration it is, always is behind it;number two, that spokesmen for theadministration now and in the futurewill be developing programs with theAmericans With Disabilities Act; and,third, to recognize that members of ourown families and neighbors and friendsare all subject to the benefits of theAmericans With Disabilities Act. I thank the gentlewoman. b1730 Mrs. MORELLA. Yes, Mr. Speaker, in the decade since its enactment, theADA has changed the social fabric ofour Nation. It has brought the prin-ciple of disability civil rights into themainstream of public policy. In fact,the law, coupled with the disabilityrights movement, has fundamentallychanged the way Americans perceivedisability. ADA placed disability discrimination alongside race gender discrimination,and exposed the common experiences ofprejudice and segregation, and provideda cornerstone for the elimination ofdisability discrimination in this coun-try. The passage of ADA resulted from a long struggle by Americans with dis-abilities to bring an end to their infe-rior status and unequal protectionunder law. It is well documented thesevere social, vocational, economic,and educational disadvantages of peo-ple with disabilities. Besides widespread discrimination in employment, housing and public ac-commodations, education, transpor-tation, communication, recreation, Icould go on, institutionalization,health services, voting, and access topublic services, people with disabilitiesfaced the additional burden of havinglittle or no legal recourse to redresstheir exclusion. Mr. Speaker, over the past decade, ADA has become a symbol of the prom-ise of human and civil rights. It hasbrought change and access to the ar-chitectural and telecommunicationslandscape of the United States. It hascreated increased recognition and un-derstanding of the manner in which thephysical and social environment can pose discriminatory barriers to peoplewith disabilities. I want to point out that we have been making some strides. My Sub-committee on Technology passed andallows Congress significant assistivetechnology which was included in thebudget. Just last week, a commissionon the advancement of women, minori-ties, and persons with disabilities inscience, engineering, and technologyestablished under my legislation in thelast Congress did a roll-out of their rec-ommendations. We are hoping to pulltogether a public-private partnershipso that we can give more access and op-portunity to persons with disabilities. ADA is not self-acting in ensuring its provisions are fully enforced. The Federal Government commit- ment to the full implementation ofADA and its effective enforcement isessential to fulfill the law's promises.Although this country has consistentlyasserted its strong support for the civilrights of people with disabilities, manyof the Federal agencies charged withenforcement and policy developmentunder ADA, to varying degrees, havebeen overly cautious, reactive andlacking any coherent and unifying na-tional strategy. Enforcement efforts are largely shaped by a case-by-case approachbased on individual complaints ratherthan an approach based on compliancemonitoring and a cohesive, proactiveenforcement strategy. In addition, enforcement agencies have not consistently taken leadershiproles in clarifying frontier or emergentissues, issues that, even after nearly 10years of enforcement, continue to becontroversial, complex, unexpected,and challenging. Mr. Speaker, for ADA to be effective, this needs to be changed. There is something ADA cannot leg- islate, and that is attitude. There is asaying with the disability community:``Attitude is the real disability.'' Theattitude toward employment of peoplewith disabilities has to change. In closing, President Bush said it best at the signing of the ADA. He said,``This Act is powerful in its simplicity.It will ensure that people with disabil-ities are given the basic guarantees forwhich they have worked so long and sohard. Independence, freedom of choice,control of their lives, the opportunityto blend fully and equally into theright mosaic of the American main-stream.'' Let us remember that. f CONGRATULATIONS ON THE RE- TIREMENT OF GENERAL JOHNGORDON, USAF The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. L ATOURETTE ). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Flor-ida (Mr. G OSS) is recognized for 5 min- utes. Mr. GOSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding Americanwho has faithfully served our countryfor the past 32 years, General John A. Gordon. General Gordon, who retired from the Air Force earlier this month, wasawarded two commendations this morning in a ceremony at the GeorgeBush Center for Intelligence. GeorgeTenet, Director of Central Intelligence,awarded him the National IntelligenceDistinguished Service Medal; and Gen-eral Michael Ryan, Air Force Chief ofStaff, awarded him the Air Force Dis-tinguished Service Medal. John Gordon's Air Force career began in 1968, and his early assign-ments were in the highly scientificareas of weapons research, develop-ment and acquisition. He went on toserve as a long-range planner at theStrategic Air Command. He was thenassigned as a politico-military affairsofficer at the Department of State. Hereturned to the real Air Force as com-mander of the 90th Strategic MissileWing. General Gordon also served our coun- try as a staff officer with the NationalSecurity Council and in several seniorDepartment of Defense planning andpolicy-making positions. Joining the intelligence community late in his career, General Gordon wasfirst appointed as associate director ofCentral Intelligence for Military Sup-port back in 1996. Following that as-signment, he was named Deputy Direc-tor of Central Intelligence, the second-highest ranking intelligence officer inthe United States, a position he heldwith great distinction from October of1997 through June of this year. His tenure came at a time when the intelligence community was rebuildingin response to new threats to theUnited States national security thathave emerged since the end of the ColdWar, things we know as transnationalthreats, terrorism, weapons prolifera-tion, weapons of mass destruction pro-liferation, illegal arms sales, narcotics,those types of things. As DDCI, GeneralGordon worked closely with Congressand the House Permanent Select Com-mittee on Intelligence to improve U.S.intelligence capability and to safe-guard sensitive national security infor-mation. General Gordon brought a singular sense of purpose to the Deputy Direc-tor's job that was highly valued bythose inside and outside the intel-ligence community. I would like to point out, despite the fact that he does not have a back-ground in intelligence, John Gordonwould have made a great case officer.Last year he took time to sit downwith a group of high school studentsfrom my district, some of the top stu-dents in southwest Florida. After hespoke to them, several were ready tosign up for a career in the U.S. intel-ligence community; and this comes inan era where many gifted students areleaving school early to earn a fortunein a new digital economy. I think Gen-eral Gordon has another career outthere as a recruiter for Intelligence ifhe wants it.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7067 July 26, 2000 From this gentleman's perspective, it was a pleasure to work with GeneralGordon while he wore the uniform ofthe United States Air Force. I am surehe will bring the same diligence andprofessionalism and integrity to hisfirst civilian job as the Under Sec-retary of Energy for Nuclear Securityand the first administrator for the Na-tional Nuclear Security Administra-tion. As we all know, our nuclear se-crets and weapons abilities will bemore secure, and needs to be more se-cure in places like Los Alamos, withJohn Gordon as their steward. We lookforward to his taking up the reins. On behalf of the members of the House Permanent Select Committee onIntelligence, I would like to thankGeneral John Gordon for his con-tinuing service to our Nation. I wishJohn and his wife, Marilyn, and theirdaughter, Jennifer, all the best fortheir future. I offer sincere gratitudefor the family sacrifices I know havebeen made to allow General Gordon tocommit so much time and energy todistinguish himself in critical 7-day-a-week, 24-hour-a-day top-level jobs thathe has done so well. That is a greatcontribution to our country. It de-serves to be recognized. f PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FOR SENIORS TOP PRIORITY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentle-woman from Michigan (Ms. S TABENOW ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. Speaker, I ap- preciate the opportunity to rise todayand have an opportunity to speakabout an issue that I have come to thefloor very frequently to speak aboutfor many, many months now. I am asking my colleagues to make sure that we place prescription drugcoverage for seniors under Medicare asa top priority for us before we leavesession this year. Time is running out. We have the best economy in a gen- eration. We have budget surpluses thatwe are deciding how to use and how toinvest. I cannot think of a more impor-tant issue than investing in the futurehealth and well-being of older Ameri-cans and families all across the UnitedStates. I have been coming to the floor of the House on a regular basis to speak outand to share stories of constituents ofmine, family members, older Ameri-cans who have been calling me andwriting me. I set up a hotline back in August of last year and have set up somethingcalled the Prescription Drug FairnessCampaign, whereby I have been askingpeople to share with me their stories,what is really happening in their livesas it relates to the issue of their medi-cations and the high costs of prescrip-tion drugs. I have been overwhelmedwith the letters and the phone callsthat we have received. I want one more time to be reading a letter this evening on the floor of thisHouse from one of my constituents in Michigan. This is a letter from Mr.James Schlieger from Flint, Michigan.He writes to me: ``My wife Joan hasAlzheimer's Disease. In 1999, my out-of-pocket payment for preparations was$3,020.43. Our other medical expenseswere $3,909.79. Our Social Security in-come is $20,252. This leaves us littleover $13,000 to pay our property taxes,utility bills, food, and gasoline and allof our other expenses. Bottom line,there is nothing left to enjoy the Gold-en Years. With my wife's condition, ina few years, we will have depleted oursavings, then we will have to becomedependent on government care. Pleasehelp us. James Schlieger from Flint,Michigan.'' I think we need to help Mr. Schlieger. We need to make sure thatour seniors are not using all of theirsavings to pay for the cost of thehealth care that they are supposed tobe receiving under Medicare. This Sunday is the 35th anniversary of the day that the Medicare legisla-tion was signed. At the time it was setup, it covered the way health care wasprovided. The promise was there that,once an American reached the age of 65or was disabled, they knew that therewould be health care available to them. The difficulties that we have now is that health care has changed. The waywe treat people has changed. Instead ofit being in the hospital and with oper-ations and inpatient prescriptiondrugs, we are now in a situation wherethe majority of care is outpatient, ishome health care. It almost always in-volves prescription drugs. So Medicaresimply needs to be modernized to coverthe way health care is provided today. There are others who are talking about privatizing. There are otherstalking about other kinds of ap-proaches. I would urge my colleaguesto simply look at a system that theseniors of our country know and trust.It has worked. It just needs to be up-dated. If we cannot do that now withthe best economy in a generation, withbudget surpluses and the ability totake a small percentage and investthat back into Medicare to lower thecost of prescription drugs, I do not be-lieve we ever will. So I call on my colleagues one more time. Let us not let one more senior sitdown at breakfast in the morning anddecide, do I eat today or do I pay formy medications? That is a choice thatolder Americans should not have tomake. I am going to do everything in my power to fight on behalf of the seniorsof Michigan, to make sure that wemodernize Medicare for prescriptiondrugs. f WHALE KILLING ENDS FOR MAKAH INDIAN TRIBE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Washington (Mr.M ETCALF ) is recognized for 5 minutes.Mr. METCALF. Mr. Speaker, the Makah Indian Tribe in WashingtonState has been granted special permis-sion by the Clinton-Gore administra-tion to kill four gray whales each year.They have already killed one whale andinjured at least one. By the way, forevery whale killed, there is an averageof two that are injured and get away. But last year, I filed an appeal along with several co-plaintiffs to overturnthe decision made by the U.S. DistrictCourt to allow whaling by the MakahIndian Tribe. Two months ago, a three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit Courthanded down a decision in that case.The decision specifically confirmed myposition. We won. Whale killing wasended. The only way the Clinton-Goreadministration would be able to gainapproval for this whale hunt now wouldbe to blatantly violate the Federal en-vironmental protections law. In fact, the court specifically asked, and I quote from the decision language,``Can the Federal Defendants now betrusted to take the clear-eyed hardlook at the whaling proposal's con-sequences required by law, or will anew (Environmental Assessment) be aclassic Wonderland case of first-the-verdict, then-the-trial?'' Alice in Wonderland, indeed. How- ever, in this story, the heads that arebeing chopped off belong to the majes-tic gray whales that ply the westerncoast of America and each year travelnorth to the Bering Sea and occasion-ally even to Siberia. Most Americansbelieve that we have risen above thewanton slaughter of the buffalo fortheir hides, or the whales for the valueof their body parts. This would have been the first step toward returning to the terrible com-mercial exploitation of whales of the19th century. In the papers filed withNOAA by the Makah Tribe, the triberefused to deny that this was a movetoward renewal of commercial whaling. b1745 It is important to understand that the International Whaling Commissionhas never sanctioned the Makah whalehunt. Under the International WhalingConvention, of which the United Statesis a signatory, it has been legal to huntwhales for scientific or aboriginal sub-sistence purposes only. The tribe clear-ly has no nutritional need nor subsist-ence need to kill the whales. Even in the face of the strong Inter- national Whaling Commission's opposi-tion to the original Makah proposal in1997, the U.S. delegation unbelievablyignored years of U.S. opposition towhale killing and cut a sleazy dealwith the Russian government in aback-door effort to find a way to grantthe Makah's the right to kill whales. The agreement was to allow the Makah Tribe to kill four of the whalesfrom the Russian quota each yearunder the artificial construction of cul-tural subsistence. Before this shamefulback-door deal, the United States hadled the opposition worldwide to anyCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7068 July 26, 2000 whale killing not based on true subsist- ence need. Cultural subsistence is afraud. It is a slippery slope to disaster. Cultural subsistence would have ex- panded whale hunting to any nationwith an ocean coastline and any his-tory of whale killing. The whaling in-terests in Norway and Japan, who stilloccasionally pirate whales on the highseas, were delighted with the U.S. posi-tion. They have orchestrated and fi-nanced an international cultural sub-sistence movement. America's histor-ical role as a foe of renewed whalingaround the world would have been dras-tically undercut. The treaty signed by the Makah Tribe in 1855 only gives them the rightto hunt whales in common with thecitizens. This provision was to ensureequal rights, not special rights. Now,under the 9th Circuit Court ruling, theMakah Tribal Government will not beallowed to kill whales when it is illegalfor anyone else in the United States todo so. It is shameful that the Clinton-Gore administration supported a proposalthat flies in the face of the values, in-terests and desires of the majority ofUnited States citizens. It violates thelaw and the clearly stated U.S. policyin opposition to whaling. I support those Makah tribal elders and others who oppose this hunt, and Iam deeply appreciative of the courtruling and our success in stopping therenewal of the barbaric practice ofwhaling. f ENSURING A COMPETITIVE AIRLINE INDUSTRY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LATOURETTE ). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Min-nesota (Mr. O BERSTAR ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply troubled over the possibility ofmergers of major domestic airlines.Many observers have predicted that ifthe proposed merger of United Airlinesand US Airways is allowed to proceed,it will be followed by mergers of othermajor carriers, and soon we will havean industry dominated by three mega- carriers. This would be devastating toconsumers. The father of deregulation, Alfred Kahn, observed ``Because of the United-US Airways threatening to set off a se-ries of imitative mergers that wouldsubstantially increase the concentra-tion of the domestic industry, there isa possible jeopardy here to the manybillions of dollars that consumers havebeen saving each year because of thecompetition set off by deregulation.'' I am strongly opposed to the United- US merger and other mergers thatlikely will follow. I have asked the De-partment of Justice and Transpor-tation to use all available authority tostop the mergers under the antitrustlaws, and many Members have indi-cated they share those concerns. At hearings held in several House and Senate committees there was littlesupport for the United-US merger. Members raised concerns about the im-pact of the merger on service to theareas they represent as well as to theNation at large. As one Member in ourhearing in our Committee on Transpor-tation and Infrastructure observed, ``Idon't think the merger is a win-win forthe consumer. As a matter of fact, itmight be a lose-lose look for the con-sumer.'' A number of Members ex-pressed the sentiment that if Congresswere to vote on the proposed United-US merger, it would fail. I hope and expect that the Depart- ment of Justice will heed those strong-ly-held views. At the same time, how-ever, I believe we have to begin think-ing about steps we would take to pro-tect consumers if competition in theindustry is reduced to a point where itis no longer an affective check on mo-nopolistic behavior. I must emphasizethat this type of legislation is not mypreference. I would greatly prefer anenvironment in which consumers areprotected by adequate competition in afree market. The legislation I am introducing will give the Department of Transportationextended authority to protect theAmerican consumer should a series ofmergers or acquisitions be approved,leaving our domestic market withthree or fewer carriers, who would ac-count for over 70 percent of scheduledrevenue passenger miles. The authoritythat I would extend to the Departmentof Transportation in this legislationwill include oversight of air carrierpricing, anti-competitive responses tonew entrant competition, and other un-fair competitive practices. This is not reregulation. Airlines will remain free to set prices and enter orleave markets without prior govern-ment approval. But the bill will giveDOT authority to intervene if the air-lines take unfair advantage of the ab-sence of sufficient competition. I just want to cite the highlights of this legislation. The bill would take ef-fect when, as a result of mergers be-tween two or more of the top seven car-riers, three or fewer carriers controlmore than 70 percent of domestic rev-enue passenger miles. Monopolistic fares. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to requirereduction in fares that are unreason-ably high. When the Secretary findsthat a fare is unreasonably high, hemay order that it be reduced and thatthe reduced fare be offered for a speci-fied number of seats and that rebatesbe offered. Preventing unfair practices against low-fare new entrants. If a dominantincumbent carrier responds to low-fareservice by a new entrant, and matchesthat low fare, and offers two or moretimes the low-fare seats as the new en-trant, the dominant carrier must con-tinue to offer the fare for 2 years, for atleast 80 percent of the highest level oflow-fare seats it offered. Increasing competition at hubs. If a dominant carrier at a hub airporttakes advantage of its monopoly power by offering fares 5 percent or moreabove industry averages in more than20 percent of hub markets, DOT maytake steps to facilitate added competi-tion at the hub. And, finally, the measures to encour- age competition may include measuresrelating to the dominant carrier'sgates, slots, or other airport facilities,to travel agent commissions, frequentflyer programs and corporate discountprograms. I hope we do not ever have to come to a point where this legislation must beenacted and must take effect. I hopethat the Justice Department will dis-approve the United-US merger and dis-courage all other mergers that arelikely to follow this one. If not, and ifthe domestic airspace and the worldairspace is reduced to three globe-straddling mega-carriers, then we willneed this legislation in place to protectcompetition and protect consumers. Mr. Speaker, I want to go into a lit- tle more detail about some of the prob-lems my legislation seeks to address. MONOPOLISTIC FARES If the airline sector is reduced to three major carriers the remaining mega-carriers couldsubstantially reduce competition and raisefares. The way airline competition workstoday, when established carriers control mar-kets, the tendency is for the carriers to followeach other's fare changes so that the faresare identical, and the passenger choice is lim-ited. These tendencies would be magnified ifthere were only a few major airlines. Therewould be enormous incentives for each carrierto avoid competing with the others at theirstrong hubs and routes. This strategy wouldlikely lead to the greatest mutual profitability,while strong competition across the boardcould prove suicidal. As the DOT aptly stated,``[e]conomic theory teaches that the competi-tive outcome of a duopoly is indeterminate:the result could be either intense rivalry orcomfortable accommodation, if not collusion,between the duopolists.'' Collusion to fix pricesis not new to the airline industry\u00d0in 1992 itwas caught red-handed in an elaborate price-fixing scheme using computer reservationssoftware. The impact of mergers on fares goes be- yond the effects of having only three majorcompetitors. Each merger by itself eliminatescompetition between the parties to the merger;history shows that this reduction in competitionwill lead to higher fares. The General Account-ing Office, in a 1988 report, found that afterTWA bought Ozark, it raised roundtrip fares13 to 18 percent on 67 routes serving St.Louis. An October 1989 report by the Eco-nomic Analysis Group, a DOJ research arm,noted that: ``The merger of Northwest and Re-public appears to have caused a significant in-crease in fares [5.6 percent] and a significantreduction in overall service on city pairs out ofMinneapolis-St. Paul.'' That happened despitethe fact the number of cities served from Min-neapolis-St. Paul increased after Northwest/Republic merger. My bill will give DOT authority to intervene if carriers take advantage of the absence ofcompetition by raising fares above competitivelevels. The bill gives DOT authority to requireCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7069 July 26, 2000 reductions in fares which it finds to be unrea- sonably high. The bill gives examples of situa-tions in which a fare might be found to be un- reasonably high: if the fare in a particular mar-ket is higher than the fare the carrier chargesin other markets with similar characteristics, orif the fare in a market is increased beyond in-creases in costs. The bill provides that if DOTfinds that a fare is excessively high it mayorder that the far be reduced, specify the num-ber of seats at which the reduced fare mustbe offered, and order rebates. UNFAIR COMPETITIVE PRACTICES AGAINST LOW FARE CARRIERS A second problem that my bill deals with is unfair competitive practices against new en-trants. New entrants providing low fare service have been a critical element in airline competi-tion under deregulation. In fact, history hasshown that the public experiences real com-petition only when low far carriers like South-west Airlines enters a market. DOT called itthe ``Southwest effect.'' Studies have shownthat when Southwest begins service to a newcity, competitors tend to lower their fares andmore people start flying. DOT studies showthat average fares in markets served by low-fare carriers were $70\u00b1$90 lower than aver-age fares in other markets. On the other hand,fares were higher in markets not served by alow-fare carrier, even when these markets hadcompetition from several established carriers.New entrants with low fare service will beeven more important in an industry dominatedby three large carriers. In recent years, low fare carriers have faced great difficulty in establishing their services.Last year on the House floor, I expressed myconcern over unfair competitive practices thatincumbent airlines have used when new en-trant low fare carriers try to compete. In thetypical scenario, the low fare carrier enters amarket with a limited amount of low fare serv-ice. The incumbent carrier responds by match-ing the low fare and adding service so that thelow fare will be available on many times thenumber of seats offered by the low fare car-rier. This flooding of the market frequentlydrives the low fare carrier out, and permits theincumbent to raise its fare to the prior level. The adverse effect of these practices on competition does not end with the particularchallenger. Once it becomes known in the in-dustry that an incumbent will respond aggres-sively to a challenge by a low fare carrier,other prospective competitors will also be de-terred in the future. This is not a theoreticalproblem. DOT investigations and Congres-sional hearings have uncovered a number ofinstances in which major airlines have adoptedmoney-losing strategies to drive out new en-trants who have instituted low fare service atthe major carrier's hub airports. The Transportation Research Board (TRB), in its 1999 study Entry and Competition in theU.S. Airline Industry, examined 32 complaintsof unfair competition on file with the DOT, con-cluding that ``it is apparent that some of theactions described are difficult to reconcile withfair and efficient competition.'' The TRB re-ported that one-half of the cases involvedsharp price cutting and excessive increases incapacity. In fact, last year the DOJ filed suitagainst American Airlines to enforce the anti-trust laws against alleged predatory practicesby American Airlines to drive new entrants outof its Dallas/Ft. Worth hub.If the industry is reduced to three mega-car- riers, these carriers will have greater financialresources and general freedom from competi-tion. This will enhance their ability to eliminatenew entrants by unfair practices. To deal with this problem, my bill adopts a concept suggested by Dr. Kahn and others todiscourage unfair tactics against new entrants.In cases where a dominant carrier at a hubairport meets new low fare competition by re-ducing its fares and offering the new low fareon more than twice the number of seats asthe new entrant carrier on that route, the billrequires the dominant carrier to continue tooffer the new low fares for two years. Duringthis two year period, the low fares must bemade available on at least 80 percent of thehighest number of seats per week for whichthat fare has been offered. This will ensurethat a dominant carrier's efforts to defend itsmarket, route or hub will be a truly competitiveresponse, not one designed only to drive anew competitor out of business and then re-coup reduced profits or losses by raisingfares. MONOPOLISTIC ABUSES AT HUB AIRPORTS Another major problem that my bill address- es is monopolistic practices at hub airportsdominated by a single airline. Several studieshave shown that fares for hub airports arehigher than fares in markets where there ismore competition. The recent TRB study con-cluded that ``the consistency with which hubmarkets appear among the highest-free mar-kets is noteworthy and raises the possibilitythat the hub carriers are exploiting marketpowers in ways that would not be sustained ifthey were subject to more competition.'' In an environment of less competition, the hub problem can be expected to grow worse.My bill addresses this problem in severalways. First, as I have previously discussed,the bill gives the Secretary authority to requirethat fares at hub airports be reduced if theyare higher than fares elsewhere. Secondly, the bill includes provisions to en- courage more competition at hubs. The billprovides that, upon a finding that a dominantcarrier is exploiting its position at a hub airportby offering unreasonably high fares in morethan 20 percent of the hub's markets, the Sec-retary may require the dominant air carrier tomake gates, slots, and other airport facilitiesreasonably available to other carriers. Wehave often heard of dominant air carriers thatrefuse to give to other carriers, especially newentrants, access to key airport facilities. The ability to prevent other air carriers from competing effectively at hub airports will onlybe magnified if the industry is reduced to threemajor carriers. My bill would also give the Secretary the au- thority to require that the air carrier exploitinga hub monopoly make adjustments in commis-sions paid to travel agents, in frequent flyerprograms, and in corporate discount arrange-ments. Each of these marketing programs hasserved, in the past, to make it nearly impos-sible for new entrants to gain a foothold in adominant hub market. The recent TRB reportnoted that use of these programs to drive outcompetition ``merits further investigation byDOT.'' UNREASONABLY HIGH FARES FOR BUSINESS PASSENGERS A final problem the bill addresses is excessibly high fares for business travelersand others who cannot meet the conditions ondiscount tickets. In the last several years, air- lines have been charging increasingly higherairfares to business travelers who do not qual-ify for discount tickets. The TRB noted thatthe: ``higher-fare travelers . . . are now paying5 to 25 percent more. Also evident is thatthese travelers are paying fares much higherthan the median, at least in comparison withearlier periods (1995 to 1992). For instance,travelers paying the highest fares in 1992 paid2 to 2.1 times the median fare. In 1998, thesetravelers paid 2.7 to 2.9 times the median.'' Ifthe aviation industry were to consolidate tojust three globe-straddling mega-carriers, thebusiness traveler is the one who would bearthe brunt of the super-premium airfares thatare sure to be charged in those monopolypower airport markets. My bill would give the Secretary power to require reductions in fares that are unreason-ably high, either in and of themselves, or bycomparison to the lower fares offered otherpassengers. Mr. Speaker, I believe that we are at a crit- ical point for the future of a competitive airlineindustry. The inescapable lesson of 22 yearsof deregulation is that mergers and a reduc-tion in competition often lead to higher faresfor the American traveling public. We cannotstand idly by and allow the benefits of deregu-lation to be derailed by a wave of mergers. Ifthese mergers are approved, we will need anew legislative framework to give the Sec-retary of Transportation appropriate authorityto combat anti-competitive practices by thenew line-up of powerhouse mega carriers, topreserve competition in the public interest, andensure the widest range of travel options atthe lowest possible prices for air travel. If the mergers proceed without the competi- tive protections I am proposing, then the ulti-mate irony of deregulation will be that we willhave traded government control in the publicinterest, for private monopoly control in the in-terests of the industry. Mr. Speaker, I submit for the R ECORD herewith a section-by-section summary of my legislation: AIRLINE COMPETITION PRESERVATION ACT\u00d0 SECTION -BY-SECTION SUMMARY SECTION 1 \u00d0SHORT TITLE This section provides that the Act may be cited as the ``Airline Competition Preserva-tion Act of 2000.'' SECTION 2 \u00d0OVERSIGHT OF AIR CARRIER PRICING Subsection (a)(1) provides that the Act takes effect immediately upon a determina-tion by the Secretary of the Department ofTransportation that, as a result of consolida-tion or mergers between two or more of thetop 7 air carriers, three or fewer of those aircarriers control more than 70 percent ofscheduled revenue passenger miles in inter-state air transportation. Subsection (a)(2) states that the Secretary shall, in determining the number of sched-uled revenue passenger miles under sub-section (a)(1), use data from the latest yearfor which complete data is filed. In addition,subsection (a)(3) provides that the Secretaryin making the concentration determinationin (a)(1) should attribute to the remainingairline those routes acquired from the aircarrier with which it has merged or consoli-dated. Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) give the Sec- retary the authority to investigate whetheran air carrier is charging a fare or an aver-age fare on a route that is unreasonablyhigh. The factors in making this determina-tion include whether the fare or average fareCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7070 July 26, 2000 in question: is higher than fares charged in similar markets; has been increased in ex-cess of cost increases; and strikes a reason-able relationship between fares charged topassengers who are price sensitive and thosecharged to passengers who are time sen-sitive. Under subsection (b)(3), if a fare is found to be unreasonably high, the Secretary mayorder, after providing the air carrier with anopportunity for a hearing, that it be reduced,that the reduced fare be offered for a speci-fied number of seats and that rebates be of-fered. Subsection (c) provides that if a dominant air carrier, on any route in interstate trans-portation to or from a hub airport, respondsto low fare service by a new entrant bymatching the low fare, and offering two ormore times the low fare seats as the new en-trant, the dominant carrier must continue tooffer the low fare for two years, for at least80 percent of the highest level of low fareseats it offered. Subsection (d)(1) authorizes the Secretary to investigate whether a dominant carrier ata hub airport is charging higher than aver-age fares at that airport. Subsection (d)(2)provides that the Secretary may determinethat higher than average fares are beingcharged where an air carrier is offering faresthat are 5 percent or more above industryaverage fares, in more than 20 percent of itsroutes that begin or end in its hub market.If higher than average fares are beingcharged, the DOT may, after providing theair carrier with an opportunity for a hearing,take steps to facilitate added competition atthe hub, including measures to relating tothe dominant carrier's gate, slots, and otherairport facilities, travel agent commissions,frequent flyer programs and corporate dis-count programs. Subsection respect to a hub airport, as an air car-rier that accounts for more than 50 percentof the total annual boardings at the airportin the preceding 2-year period or a shorterperiod as specified by the Secretary. A ``hubairport'' means an airport that each year hasat least .25 percent of the total annualboardings in the United States. ``Interstateair transportation'' is defined as includingintrastate air transportation. A ``new en-trant air carrier,'' with respect to a hub air-port, is defined as an air carrier that ac-counts for less than 5 percent in the pre-ceding 2-year period or a shorter period asspecified by the Secretary. f SEND EDMOND POPE HOME The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. P ETER - SON) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavyheart. On my left is a picture of Ed-mond and Cheri Pope, a lovely couplefrom State College, Pennsylvania. OnMarch 14, Edmond left for Russia on aroutine trip, a business trip. It wouldhave been his 27th trip there. He wassomeone very involved in working withthe Russians on business development,helping them market their declassifiedtechnology, someone who was veryfond of the Russians and liked to help them economically in deals that werebeneficial to both our countries. For 115 days Edmond Pope, from April 3 on, has been in a Russian pris-on. For 115 days Mrs. Pope has not had a husband, except for 2 hours that shespent with him several weeks ago. Hischildren have had no father for 115days. His aging parents do not under-stand why for 115 days they have notbeen able to talk to their son. My colleagues, Edmond Pope was placed in prison unfairly. He is not aspy. He was charged with espionage.That is not true. And what is dis-turbing is for the first 11 weeks his wifeand family had no chance to commu-nicate with him; did not receive onenote from him, one phone call fromhim, or able to get a note or a phonecall or letter to him. That is 77 days hewas absolutely separated from his fam-ily. They had no idea of his health, noidea if he had a lawyer; a good lawyer. On June 19, Mrs. Pope, Cheri, and two of my staff, were leaving for Russia toattempt to visit him. That afternoonCheri's mother passed away unexpect-edly in San Diego, California. Mrs.Pope had to make the decision whethershe went to bury her mother or shewent to Russia to encourage her hus-band. She made the decision to go toRussia, and so she went. And severaldays later she had the chance to spenda few moments with him. On Tuesday, June 20, they met for the first time in 3 months, just a fewfeet from a watchful prosecutor inLefortovo prison. Edmond and CheriPope hugged and belatedly wished eachother a happy 30th anniversary. ThenCheri Pope said, ``The first thing hesaid to me was, `Cheri, I didn't do any-thing wrong. I didn't.' And I said tohim, I never thought for a minute youdid.'' In an emotional interview on Tues- day after that reunion, Cheri Pope saidher husband, whom the Russians hadaccused of spying, was strikingly thin.He had a rash; he had lost a lot ofweight; he had a pallor about him andsome skin problems. She said, ``Eventhough he didn't look well, he stilllooked handsome to me.'' While they were there, Cheri and my staff were able to obtain a good lawyerfor him. He did not have a good lawyer,and they had no way of knowing that.And since that time we have beenworking hard to obtain his release. On June 26, we wrote President Putin a letter, and I will share with my col-leagues some of the things we sharedwith him. ``Mr. Putin, if you value ourfriendship, send Edmond Pope home.President Putin, if you value the grow-ing business relationships beneficial toboth of our countries, send EdmondPope home.'' It said, ``President Putin,if you value the many ways we aid youfinancially, send Edmond Pope home. ``Edmond Pope is a man who was there on sound financial business rea-sons. He is not a spy. He needs to behome with his family and with hisgrieving wife. He needs to be home tovisit his father, who is seriously ill. Heneeds to be home to have his ownhealth monitored, and he needs to behome so that our relationship betweenthe Russian Federation and America can grow and not be destroyed.'' We have not heard from that letter, though we thought we would. Today, Iwrote another letter to PresidentPutin and it has been faxed to him. Onehundred fifteen days have passed. Thiscase has no merit. His new lawyer tellsus he has shredded the evidence com-pletely. On August 5, in just a few days,his son, Dusty Pope, plans to marry ayoung lady named Justin. It is only fit-ting that Edmond Pope be home tostand with his son and his futuredaughter-in-law and wish them intothe world of matrimony. I hope and believe that it is impor- tant that we get this issue resolved andthat we get him home, because it isvital that we build a relationship be-tween these two countries. I have a res-olution that urges the President, with109 signatures, and I could get manymore, to discontinue our assistance tothe Russian Federation, to approve nomore loans to the Russian Federation,or no more technical assistance. I donot want to do that. I believe the fu-ture of Russia depends much on afriendship with this country. But it istime to send Edmond Pope home sothat our relationship can grow to thebenefit of both our countries. I askPresident Putin to help us accomplishthis today. f CALLING ON RUSSIAN GOVERN- MENT AND PRESIDENT PUTIN TOFREE EDMOND POPE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Oregon (Mr. W ALDEN ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WALDEN of Oregon. Mr. Speak- er, I rise this evening to reinforce thecomments of my colleague, the distin-guished gentleman from Pennsylvania(Mr. P ETERSON ), and to call on the Rus- sian government and President Putinto free Mr. Ed Pope. We have heard heis an American businessman that theyhave held without trial for months, andI rise to assure Mr. And Mrs. Pope'sfamily that the gentleman from Penn-sylvania (Mr. P ETERSON ) and I are doing everything we can to secure hisrelease. b1800 Mr. Speaker, the Russian govern- ment's continued incarceration of Mr.Pope, an American citizen, is nothingshort of outrageous. Not only was hisarrest and subsequent imprisonmentcontrary to international law, but thetreatment he has received while in cus-tody has been appalling. Until recently, I am told, he has been denied communications with his wife.We heard they went for 70-plus dayswithout being able to exchange lettersor any communication. He has been de-nied access to sufficient food and med-ical treatment by American standardsand certainly every other basic rightwe associate with justice systems ofcivilized nations.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7071 July 26, 2000 Indeed, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Pope's im- prisonment is reminiscent of thoseugly dark days of the old Soviet regimewhen men and women were taken fromtheir homes in the dark of night, inter-rogated, and sometimes never seenagain. And that is wrong. Mr. Speaker, as of yesterday, I was told that Mr. Pope still lacks such ba-sics as a blanket, a blanket his wife hasbeen trying to send to him, a blanketthat has been described and detailedabout what they have to do to getthrough the Russian bureaucracy andyet continued to be denied, a blanket. A few weeks ago, I had the oppor- tunity to meet with Mr. Pope's par-ents, Roy and Elizabeth Pope, who livein my district in Grant's Pass, Oregon.Mr. Speaker, both of them are elderly.Mr. Pope suffers from terminal cancerand dementia. They and I do not fullycomprehend the diplomatic obstaclesthat keep their son away from his fam-ily. Mr. Speaker, on May 9, I wrote to our own Secretary of State. On June 27, Iwrote again. In neither case has thisadministration bothered to respond tothe two letters of inquiry that I havesent directly to the Secretary of State. Mr. Speaker, Ed's family knows that Ed is no criminal and that his impris-onment is unjust. Mr. Speaker, we simply must do ev- erything in our collective power to see to it that he is freed as soon as hu-manly possible. Mr. Pope is no spy and he should be returned to his family. So I urge mycolleagues on both sides of the aisle tojoin us in sending a strong message toPresident Putin and the Russian gov-ernment that the American people areserious about this and will not forgettheir actions if Mr. Pope is not re-turned immediately. In an era when the opportunity exists for better relations between our twonations, now is not the time to returnto the mutual antagonism and sus-picion that held the entire world hos-tage for a half a century of the ColdWar. f TRIBUTE TO HONORABLE JIMMY MORRISON The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LATOURETTE ). Under the Speaker's an- nounced policy January 6, 1999, thegentleman from Louisiana (Mr.V ITTER ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. VITTER. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to mourn the passing of a formerMember of this body, the HonorableJimmy Morrison of Louisiana. Congressman Morrison was one of my constituents and represented much ofthe district I now represent. He servedin this body from 1944 through 1966. I was only 5 years old when he left this House, so my knowledge, obvi-ously, of his tenure here is limited toconversations with those who wereprivileged to work with him and to thehistory books. I do know that he was aMember of whom we can all be proud.In 1944, when he was first elected to office, his district was, like much ofthe country, a rural area still workingto recover from the Great Depression. Congressman Morrison earned a seat on the Committee on Agriculture andthe Post Office and Civil Service com-mittee, two assignments that allowedhim to address the immediate needs ofhis constituents. The esteem in which my older con- stituents hold him speaks volumes ofhis effectiveness. He had a distin-guished record in this body. He alwaysstood up for the downtrodden andspoke very passionately about his com-mitment to speaking and working forthe causes of the downtrodden. Perhaps the clearest example of that was his vocal support of the CivilRights Act of 1964. He was extremelyinstrumental in furthering the needsand the interests of his particular dis-trict. He was really personally respon-sible for seeing to it that the intersec-tion of I\u00b112 and I\u00b155 in his district hap-pened in the area of Hammond, whichhelped enormously with the growth ofthe entire Hammond area. He also worked as a leading member of the Committee on Post Office andCivil Service to establish needed postoffices throughout his district. On a more national scale, he intro- duced the legislation that led to theJohn F. Kennedy Center for the Per-forming Arts. He was also very colorful and effec- tive in the realm of politics. Besidesbeing a sterling stump speaker, Mr.Morrison staged what he called the``convicts parade'' on Canal Street dur-ing the 1939\u00b11940 campaign to call at-tention to the convictions arising outof the Louisiana scandals involving theHuey Long machine. Perhaps those of us in Louisiana poli- tics today should take a lead from thatin light of the recent conviction of ourformer governor, Edwin Edwards.Maybe we need another convicts pa-rade. I can speak from personal knowledge of his life after Congress. He returnedfull time to his hometown of Hammondand resumed an active role as an attor-ney and civic leader. Leaving Congressin no way weakened his commitmentto public service. He was a strong sup- porter of Southeastern Louisiana Uni-versity in Hammond, the institutionthat houses his congressional papers. In honor of this support, the Univer- sity hosts an annual lecture. TheJames H. Morrison Lecture on Politicsand Government has brought leadersfrom throughout Louisiana and the Na-tion to Hammond to share their wis-dom with the southeastern community. Shortly after joining this body a lit- tle over a year ago, I traveled to Ham-mond to seek Congressman Morrison'sadvice. It is clear from our conversa-tion that he held the House in great es-teem and viewed his opportunity toserve as a great honor accompanied bygreat responsibilities. I always will re-member our discussion and the adviceand wisdom he shared.To his wife, Marjorie, to family and many friends, let us all offer our sin-cere condolences. May they be com-forted by the knowledge that he is nowblessed with the joy and peace fargreater than any on Earth. Mr. Speaker, Congressman Morrison served with only two present Membersof the House. One of those with whomhe served for quite a bit of time wasthe honorable gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. D INGELL ). The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. DINGELL ) could not join with me to- night. He had a pressing engagementoff the floor. But he did give me astatement which he asked for me toread on his behalf. This again is fromthe gentleman from Michigan (Mr. D IN- GELL ): Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to an honorable, courageous man who passed awaylast Thursday in his hometown of Hammond,Louisiana. James H. ``Jimmy'' Morrison rep-resented his constituents well, fought for theunderdog admirably, and served in this bodywith distinction. I had the pleasure of serving with Jimmy Morrison, a principled populist and a pas-sionate fighter on behalf of Louisiana andhis Sixth District, which he served from1942\u00b11966. He was an advocate for workingmen and women before he came to Congress,beginning his legal career organizing straw-berry farmers who fell prey to unfair pricefixing. In Congress, he continued to fight toensure that every individual was entitled to fair treatment in the workplace and giventhe opportunity to live the American dream.Always alert to the needs of his constitu-ents, he brought back federal dollars homefor roads, schools, and post offices. Mr. Speaker, I would like to note Jimmy Morrison's courage. Jimmy Morrison'sproudest and most courageous vote, in sup-port of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, undoubt-edly cost him his seat. His opponent playedthe race card during a tense time in theSouth, throwing fuel on the fire of fear andhate, and beat Jimmy in doing so. But thatdid not matter; Jimmy Morrison knew hewas on the side of righteousness, not polit-ical expediency. History should rememberhis courage. I would ask my colleagues to join me in honoring James H. Morrison, a good, de-scent, courageous public servant who shouldbe remembered both for his accomplishmentsand the example he set. Those were the comments, as I said, Mr. Speaker, of the gentleman fromMichigan (Mr. D INGELL ). Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. B AKER ) joins me in this special order, and he is here withus on the floor. I yield to the gen-tleman. Mr. BAKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, as a recent high school graduate many, many years ago, I hadthe occasion to open my mail and therein the mailbox was a letter from myCongressman. I was so shocked tothink that he first knew that I hadgraduated high school and that hewould send me such a nice congratula-tory note. Many years later, I was at the dedi- cation of a new building project in thecongressional district and in the audi-ence was Congressman Jimmy Morri-son. And I reminded him of his kind actCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7072 July 26, 2000 of courtesy in sending me this con- gratulatory letter in which he not onlysaid ``Congratulations on your fine aca-demic achievement. But should youever have occasion to come to Wash-ington, I certainly want to invite you.'' In that context, I extended my appre- ciation for that offer and accepted hiskind invitation to come to Congress. Congressman Jimmy Morrison was more than just a good political figure.He had exemplary courage. In fact, hewas a leader in the civil rights fights ofthe 1960s. And many believe it was hisbelief and conviction in the action ofcivil rights that brought his long anddistinguished congressional career toan end. But it was also exemplary of the core of what Congressman Morrison'sstrengths really were. He was a coura-geous person. Serving in office from1943 to 1967, he was never afraid to takea stand whether controversial or not. Many might say about many Lou- isiana politicians that at times theycan be flamboyant. Certainly Congress-man Morrison was no exception to thatobservation. But throughout it all, hewas a leader. He is a leader who isknown in the State for his accomplish-ments but also as a political legend.But he is known as a legend for all theright reasons. Mr. VITTER. Mr. Speaker, reclaim- ing my time, we will all rememberCongressman Morrison very fondly,very proudly for his contributions notonly to his part of Louisiana, to ourhome State, but to the Congress and tothe country. f FUNDING FOR NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 1999, the gentleman from Penn-sylvania (Mr. G EKAS ) is recognized for 50 minutes. Mr. GEKAS. Mr. Speaker, we rise here today to state and restate a goalthat we had set several years ago to at-tempt to and to succeed in doublingthe funding for NIH, the National Insti-tutes of Health, over a 5-year period.This was 3 years ago. We began that by introducing a reso- lution to that effect and gatheringsponsorship. And lo and behold, thefirst 3 years have yielded the steadyadvance toward that doubling of fund-ing that we so earnestly felt was nec-essary for the people of our country. Today, as we stand here, the Con- gress is poised to do the third leg ofthat doubling process down the road byengaging in a conference report be-tween the House and the Senate inwhich the top figure, that contained inthe Senate, $2.7 billion, or thereabout,would be exactly the amount requiredto keep us on the path towards the dou-bling of the funding. We anticipate that Members of the House and the Senate will eventuallysupport that final figure that will keepus on this track.But why is this important? It is im- portant not just for the sake of themoney required to keep an enterprisemoving, but the work of that enter-prise will be to relieve pain, to relievesuffering, to prevent disease, to curedisease. Because that is what the busi-ness of the NIH is, to reach out and,through research and through effortsin the world of medicine andhealthcare, to bring about break-throughs in the various maladies thatface the people of the Earth. We have seen evidence over the last 10 years of tremendous breakthroughsand advances in Parkinson's disease, inwomen's breast cancer, in other typesof cancer, in Alzheimer's disease, inmany of the things that plague us andfor which there is sometimes said to beno cure. And that is true, but we do notknow how soon we could reach a pointwhere we might develop a cure. b1815 But the point is that is the purpose of the increased funding for the NIH.Along the way, then, we in this Con-gress submitted a similar resolution,H. Res. 437, which does the very samething. $2.7 billion is our target. We areshort of that in the House, but as I saidthe conference report will probablyyield assent by the Congress to thisthird leg of the doubling effort aboutwhich we speak. We have ample docu-mentation and evidence from otherMembers of Congress and peoplethroughout the Nation that there is gi-gantic support for this particular ef-fort. Mr. Speaker, I want to enter into the R ECORD my own statement in this re- gard, a copy of H. Res. 437, variousDear Colleague letters that speak onthe subject, a list of cosponsors of theeffort, and also letters of support, somedozen of them. H.

It is the sense of the House of Representa- tives that funding for the National Institutesof Health should be increased by $2,700,000,000in fiscal year 2001 and that the budget reso-lution should appropriately reflect sufficientfunds to achieve this objective.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7073 July 26, 2000 WASHINGTON , DC, July 12, 2000. TAKE THE THIRD STEPTOWARD DOUBLING THE NIH B UDGET IN FIVEYEARS : COSPONSOR THE ``BIOMEDICAL REVITALIZATION RESOLUTION OF2000'' DEARCOLLEAGUE : We are writing to invite you to join us in becoming a cosponsor of the``Biomedical Research Revitalization Resolu-tion of 2000,'' a bipartisan resolution thattakes the third step toward doubling the Na-tional Institutes of Health (NIH) budget infive years. This Resolution expresses thesense of the House of Representatives thatthe NIH budget should be increased by $2.7billion in Fiscal Year 2001. The Resolution states that we can accom- plish this goal in five years through budgetsurpluses, budget offsets, and the regular ap-propriations process. The budget resolutionmust reflect these potential funding opportu-nities to make this goal a reality. NIH fund-ing has doubled over the past ten years, butwith scientific discoveries occurring at arevolutionary pace, this investment must beaccelerated NOW! The outstanding perform-ance of the American economy is providingbudget surpluses at just the time when NIHneeds this money the most. By 2005, the NIHwill complete the mapping and sequencing ofthe human genome. This will usher in a newera of molecular medicine with unprece-dented research potential to prevent, diag-nose, treat, and cure diseases that currentlyplague our society. These future breakthroughs, however, de- pend upon Congress appropriating sufficientfunds to continue and expand on the researchcurrently being conducted. We are seekingfunding that will ensure the realization ofmajor biomedical breakthroughs in the nextdecade. We must demonstrate our commit-ment to improving the health and well-beingof all Americans by increasing funding forNIH and keep medical advancements on thefast track to discovery. NIH research has spawned the bio- technology revolution, whose products grewinto a $50 billion industry in 1999. NIH sup-ports over 50,000 scientists at 1,700 univer-sities and research institutes across theUnited States. The biotechnology industry\u00d0a direct result of advances in biomedical re-search funded by the NIH\u00d0employs 118,000people in over 12,000 biotechnology compa-nies across the country. The biotechnologyrevolution has also spurred advancements inother industries that have applied the dis-coveries to their own fields. In agriculture,biotechnology is producing greater cropyields while reducing the dependence on tra-ditional chemical pesticides. Biotechnologyresearch, while conducted by the public sec-tor, has had substantial impacts on the econ-omy and society as a whole that affect thelives of every individual in this country.Continued advances, however, are directlydependent on the biomedical research con-ducted by the NIH. Whether affecting our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, we have all seenthe heartbreaking impact of cancer, stroke,diabetes, heart disease, AIDS, and other dis-eases that cause chronic disability andshortened lives. We can do something aboutthese diseases by making the investment todouble NIH funding this year. Last year asimilar proposal to double the NIH budget infive years received the bipartisan support ofover sixty five members of the House of Rep-resentatives. We enjoyed some success in theeffort when we added $2.3 billion to the NIHFiscal Year 2000 budget.

JOINT STEERING COMMITTEE FORPUBLIC POLICY , Bethesda, MD, July 18, 2000. Hon. George Gekas,House of Representatives,Washington, DC. D EARREPRESENTATIVE GEKAS : On behalf of the Joint Steering Committee for PublicPolicy, representing 25,000 basic biomedicalresearchers, thank you for your leadership inorganizing a Special Order to support dou-bling the NIH budget from 1999\u00b12003. We alsosalute your introduction of H. Res. 437,which calls for the same. Your outstanding efforts to educate the Congress through the Congressional Bio-medical Research Caucus about the NationalInstitute of Health and its ability to effec-tively utilize a 15%, $2.7 billion increase inthis year's appropriation. We recognize thedifficulty Congress faces in achieving thisgoal, but we are confident that through yourleadership and that of Congressman Porter,this goal will be achieved and health re-search will be accelerated by this visionaryinvestment. As you well know, our country leads the world in biological science, enabled by a far-sighted national policy of federal funding forresearch at our Nation's colleges and univer-sities through the NIH and other agencies.The NIH is the major source of funds for crit-ical basic research in laboratories through-out the U.S., on Alzheimer's disease, cancer,diabetes, heart disease and many other dev-astating diseases. This investment will pro-vide a significant boost to these importantefforts by translating the promise of sci-entific discovery into better health. The sequencing of the human genome has provided a huge amount of information high-ly relevant to human health. However, theinformation is encoded in a form that is cur-rently unreadable by modern methods for de-ciphering the biological meaning of genomesequences require extensive computation, some of it still beyond the limits of existingcomputer algorithms, software and hard-ware. Incremental investment in the NIHwill enable the important search for the keyto the human genome. Thank you for your support of biomedical research and basic science. Sincerely yours, E RICS. L ANDER , Ph.D., Chair. FEDERATION OF AMERICAN SOCIETIES FOREXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY , May 8, 2000. Hon. G EORGE W. G EKAS , House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE GEKAS : On behalf of the more than 60,000 scientists belonging tothe Federation of American Societies for Ex-perimental Biology (FASEB), thank you foryour continued efforts to support biomedicalresearch, specifically the National Institutesof Health (NIH). By introducing the Bio-medical Revitalization Resolution of 2000 (H.Res. 437) in support of a $2.7 billion dollar in-crease in NIH funding in FY 2001, you havemade a testament to your steadfast dedica-tion to this cause. As stated in the resolution, continued in- vestment in biomedical research will resultin further improvements in our nation'shealth, quality of life and economy. We canexpect this investment to lead to decreasesin health care expenditures and stimulationof biotechnology and pharmaceutical indus-tries. This increase, together with the mo-mentum from other recent investments,should enable the biomedical sciences to cap-italize on expanding knowledge of diseaseprocesses and their underlying genetic basisin order to develop new therapies. We depend on the insight and leadership you have shown once again. Your strong sup-port enables scientists to seize current op-portunities in biomedical research and bringabout advances in science and health thatbenefit the American public. Sincerely, D AVID G. K AUFMAN , M.D., P H.D. AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION , Washington, DC, June 14, 2000. Hon. G EORGE GEKAS , House of Representatives,Washington, DC. D EAR REPRESENTATIVE GEKAS : The Amer- ican Heart Association applauds your con-tinuing initiative and leadership in the bi-cameral, bipartisan effort to double fundingfor the National Institutes of Health by FY2003. The historically large funding increasereceived by the NIH for FY 2000 representedthe second step toward that goal. Your ongoing efforts and those of the 33 co- sponsors of H. Res. 437, expressing the senseof the House that the federal investment inbiomedical research should be increased by$2.7 billion in FY 2001, are vital in securingthe third installment to double funding forthe NIH. The American Heart Associationstrongly supports your hard work in makingfunding for the NIH a top priority in the FY2001 appropriations process. State-based polls show that an over- whelming majority of Americans favor dou-bling federal spending on medical researchby FY 2003. NIH research reduces health carecosts, provides cutting-edge treatment andprevention efforts, creates jobs and main-tains America's status as the world leader inthe biotechnology and pharmaceutical indus-tries. Also, an overwhelming majority of Ameri- cans want Congress to increase funding forheart and stroke research. According to anApril 2000 national public opinion poll, 73CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7074 July 26, 2000 percent of Americans say increased federal funding for heart research is very importantand 66 percent say increased federal fundingfor stroke research is very important. The fight against heart disease\u00d0America's No. 1 killer\u00d0and stroke\u00d0America's No. 3killer\u00d0requires innovative research and pre-vention programs. However, these programsto help advance the battle against heart dis-ease and stroke are contingent on a signifi-cant increase in funding for the NIH. Now isthe time to capitalize on progress and pursuepromising opportunities that could lead tonovel approaches to diagnose, treat, preventor cure heart disease and stroke. The American Heart Association com- mends you for your outstanding leadershipand steadfast commitment to double fundingfor the NIH by FY 2003. Thank you. Sincerely, L YNNSMAHA , M.D., P H.D., President. JEFFERSON MEDICAL COLLEGE , May 11, 2000. Representative G EORGE W. G EKAS , U.S. House of Representatives, Room 2410, Ray- burn HOB, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE GEKAS : I write to urge you to support the 15%, $2.7 billion in-crease in the Fiscal Year 2001 Labor, Healthand Human Services and Education Appro-priations bill for the National Institutes ofHealth. I also call for your support of a 17%increase for the National Science Founda-tion in the Fiscal Year 2001 VA\u00b1HUD andIndependent Agencies Appropriations bill. These increases are essential for bio- medical research to capitalize on the manyopportunities that we now have to benefitthe health of the Nation. Strong NIH andNSF funding is also essential for the sci-entific discoveries that fuel the burgeoningbiotechnology industry in the United States. My own work on steroid receptors and cell death, especially in cells that invade the air-way during asthmatic attack, is supportedby the National Institutes of Health. Thank you for your consideration. Yours sincerely, G ERALD LITWACK , PH.D., Chairman, Department of Biochemistry and MEDICINE , CENTER FOR GENETHERAPY , MCP H AHNEMANN UNIVERSITY , PA, April 4, 2000. Hon. G EORGE GEKAS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE GEKAS : I would like to ask for your continuing support of a 15%increase in the National Institutes of Healthbudget and a 17% increase in the NationalScience Foundation budget for FY 2000. Asyou are well aware, the tremendous invest-ments that the citizens of the United Stateshave made in research over the past severaldecades are beginning to pay off. We are justat the brink of tremendous benefits that willinclude dramatic new cures for diseases andproduce a thriving industry for creating newjobs for our citizens. I know you have been a strong supporter of these research budgets in the past. I thankyou for that support. Sincerely yours, D ARWIN J. P ROCKOP , M.D., Ph.D, Director. AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH , INC., Philadelphia, PA, March 23, 2000. Hon. G EORGE W. G EKAS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE GEKAS : As we enter the 21st Century, we have an unprecedentedopportunity to take the bold steps requiredto end the human and economic devastationcaused by cancer. As you consider and delib- erate the 2001 budget, consider that cancerwill kill more than half a million of our citi-zens this year, more Americans than werelost in all of the wars we fought in the 20thCentury. More than 1.2 million Americanswill receive a diagnosis of cancer in 2000.However, as horrible as these statistics are,we anticipate that cancer incidence and mor-tality will increase significantly in the next10\u00b120 years due primarily to the aging andchanging demographics of America. Cancerwill hit those hardest who can least afford it,the minority and medically underserved andaged populations. Addressing the current andfuture cancer epidemic must become one ofAmerica's highest health care priorities. Ifwe act now with a sense of urgency to pro-vide the resources and continuity needed tocure and prevent cancer, we can and will pre-vail. On behalf of the more than 15,500 basic, translational, clinical researchers and otherresearch professionals who are the membersof American Association of Cancer Research(AACR), we appreciate your steadfast sup-port for increasing our commitment to theconquest of cancer. We recognize that as amember of the House of Representatives youface a range of priorities and deserving re-quests each year to provide increased fundsfor many of this Nation's healthcare needs.However, this year we ask that you carefullyreflect on the very real possibility that wecan finally turn the tide against cancer. Ourprior investments in cancer research arepaying off in advances in basic research thatwe could have only dreamed of 10 years ago. There are now unimagined opportunities toprevent and cure cancer through the transferof these discoveries into new prevention andtreatment technologies. We can acceleratethe realization of these new diagnostic tech-nologies, therapeutic drugs and preventionprograms and continue needed advances inbasic cancer research by deciding as a Nationto mount a multi-year final assault to defeatcancer at the earliest possible time. To achieve the first step in this bold goal, the AACR requests that you support fullfunding for the Bypass Budget of the Na-tional Cancer Institute (NCI) at the $4.135billion requested. This level of funding willprovide funding to support major initiativessuch as individual research grants, clinicaltrials, training, cancer centers, improvingquality of life for cancer patients, and allowthe NCI to pursue several extraordinary re-search opportunities in cancer imaging, newcancer therapeutics, chemoprevention andtobacco control and tobacco related cancers.We also urge you to ensure that the NationalInstitutes of Health receives a 15% increasein funding to continue the current plan ofdoubling the NIH budget in five years. Last-ly, to provide needed funds for key programsin early cancer detection and cancer preven-tion, so badly needed by minority and medi-cally underserved populations, the AACR re-quests that you support increasing the budg-et for cancer control programs of the Centersfor Disease Control (CDC). This is a bold first step, but we urge you to look beyond 2001. Last year Congress re-ceived a document, created by more than 150of the Nation's leading cancer researchers,clinicians, survivors, advocates and businessleaders, entitled, ``Report from The MarchResearch Task Force,'' that outlined in sim-ple fashion a set of cogent recommendationsregarding what it will take to accelerateprogress against cancer. This unprecedentedReport stated that if we are willing to lookbeyond 2001 and define a multi-year strategyand plan to address the cancer epidemic nowand in the future, we can conquer cancer. Westrongly encourage you to do just that\u00d0takethe bold step this year to provide the neededincreases for the NCI, NIH and the CDC, and take the next bold step, to develop a five-year strategy and funding plan to finally de-feat this tragic killer. Thank you again for your past support. The AACR looks forward to working withyou in the future as we take the steps nec-essary to prevent and cure cancer. Sincerely yours, A NNAD.

WHY DOUBLE THE NIH BUDGET ? Based on the potential of current scientific opportunities and the successes of the past,we can confidently predict that an invest-ment of a doubling over five years will beeasily repaid in discoveries that will benefitthe U.S. public and mankind. The Human Genome Project will enable doctors to identify individuals at increasedrisk for diseases like hypertension andstroke, glaucoma, osteoporosis, Alzheimer'sdisease, or severe depression. Our ultimate goal will be to find ways to prevent the development or progression ofthese diseases and design ways to interveneto prevent the development of these horrificdiseases. Cancer therapy will change; physicians will be able to customize cancer treatmentby knowing the molecular fingerprint of apatient's tumor. The genetic ``fingerprint'' of a person's cancer cells will be used to create a drugthat will attack only the cancer cells\u00d0andrender targeted treatment which is more ef-fective and safe. We will have effective vaccines for infec- tious diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis,and malaria. New science on the brain will lead to treat- ments for alcoholism, drug abuse, and men-tal illness. HOW CAN INCREASED FUNDING BE USED TO HELP MAKE MORE PROGRESS ? Improvements in the treatment and pre- vention of disease are dependent on the gen-eration of new ideas. The speed of discoverycan be accelerated by devoting greater re-sources to the NIH and NSF budgets. The explosion of new knowledge from ex- plorations of the human genome and the bi-ology of the cell is providing new opportuni-ties to further understand disease, and newinnovative ways of treating, diagnosing, andpreventing illness. Unused capacity remains available in this great research enterprise. The great re-sources provided the Congress in FY 1999 andFY 2000 have facilitated the nation's re-search system to more fully use its potentialcapacity to respond more quickly to newways to cure disease. The more new ideas explored and the more rapid the effort, the sooner these findingswill be translated into the real life medicalbenefits and medical practice.

WHO WAS THE FIRST TO CALL FOR DOUBLING OF THENIH ANDNSF B UDGETS FOR BASIC RE- SEARCH ? In 1993, the magazine Science published a call for action by two Nobel Prize Laureates,and other science leaders Drs. MichaelBishop, Harold Varmus and Mark Kirschner,who plead that their Government and theirCongress double the amounts of federal fund-ing for the basic research being undertakenby the National Institutes of Health over aperiod of five years. This was not the enter-prise of some creative lobbyists, but ratherborn from the thoughtful, rational and sci-entific deliberations of some of the foremost minds in science. When Members of thisgreat Chamber consider their votes for theconsistent and substantial increases in fund-ing of basic research at the National Insti-tutes of Health and the National ScienceFoundation, they can rely with great con-fidence on the fact that these scientistsplaced their entire reputations on the line inmaking the recommendation that this Gov-ernment and this Congress continue to ex-pand their investment of federal dollars inbasic research. RECOMMENDATIONS These great scientists stated and I quote in part, ``If the United States is to realize thepromise of science for our society, the newAdministration should take action on sev-eral fronts: Develop an economic strategy for opti- mizing investment in biomedical research,which would take into account the new op-portunities that have been made available bythe recent revolution in biology, the poten-tial for reducing health-care costs, and thebenefits to agriculture and industry. Until afull evaluation has been completed, Drs.Bishop, Varmus, and Kirschner recommendincreasing the NIH budget by 15% per year,which would double the budget in currentdollars by 1998. This increase would providefunds for approximately 30% of approvedgrants, thereby retaining healthy competi-tion and exploiting the major areas of sci-entific opportunity. Generate a comprehensive plan for the best use of federal funds for biomedical research. Institute a mechanism for the periodic evaluation of peer-review procedures, uti-lizing scientists from inside and outside thegovernment. Facilitate the application of fundamental discoveries by encouraging technology re-search in the private sector. Ensure that new departures by the NIH and NSF in education and technology do not di-minish the support of basic research. Strengthen the position of the presidential advisor on science and technology. Create a program for long-term investment in research laboratories and equipment. Increase federal attention to science edu- cation.'' These were the recommendations of Amer- ica's best and brightest scientists in 1993 andwe should work to fulfill and implementthese excellent recommendations. S CIENCE AND THE NEWADMINISTRATION (J. Michael Bishop, Marc Kirschner, Harold Varmus) With the new presidential Administration now in office, the scientific community ishopeful that measures will be taken to en-hance research and the contributions it canmake to our society. What little was said ofresearch during the presidential campaignconcerned technological improvement andeconomic stimulus. This limited focus prob-ably arose from the necessities of electoralpolitics. Now it is important to broaden thediscussion to include aspects of the scientificenterprise that are essential for its long-term viability. The opportunities for progress through science are greater than ever. However, thelast decade has witnessed an acceleratingerosion of the infrastructure for fundamentalresearch in the United States. If that erosionis not reversed soon the pace of discoverywill necessarily decline, with widespreadconsequences for industry, health care, andeducation. In hopes that President Clinton and Vice President Gore will soon address the pros-pects for basic science in the United States,we offer our view of how fundamental re-search benefits our nation and what should be done to secure those benefits for the fu-ture. We speak here for biomedical research,our area of expertise, but believe that our re-marks illustrate problems and opportunitiesfound throughout science. THE PROMISE OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH Recent progress in biomedical research has brought an understanding of molecules,cells, and organisms far beyond anything an-ticipated a generation ago. The benefits ofthis progress include the makings of a revo-lution in preventive medicine, novel ap-proaches to the diagnosis and treatment ofcancer, heart attacks, infections, inheriteddiseases, and other ailments; the prospect ofimproving agricultural productivity in waysnever imagined by the Green Revolution;new tools for environmental protection; anda renewed impetus to stimulate and informpublic interest in science. The economic benefits of these gains are substantial. Consider two examples: First, itis often argued that advances in research in-crease the costs of health care. However, bio-medical research typically generates simplerand less costly devices; Inexpensive viralvaccines now save the United States billionsof dollars annually; new tests for viruseshave helped cleanse our blood supply, greatlyreducing the economic losses from diseasesthat are spread by transfusion; and growthfactors for blood cells are cutting the costsof caring for patients who receive bone mar-row transplantation or chemotherapy forcancer. Second, fundamental researchspawned the biotechnology industry, ofwhich our nation is the undisputed leader.Biotechnology is a growing contributor toour economy, a source of diverse and grati-fying employment, a stimulus to allied in-dustries that produce the materials requiredfor molecular research and development(R&D), and a vigorous partner to our aca-demic institutions in the war against dis-ease. CHALLENGES TO BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH Despite the progress, preeminence, and promise of American biomedical research,the enterprise is threatened by inadequatefunding of research and its infrastructure;flawed governmental oversight of science,confusion about the goals of federally sup-ported research, and deficiencies in scienceeducation. The productivity of biomedical research is limited most immediately by financial re-sources. In 1992 the nation spent about $10billion on biomedical research, mostly bycongressional appropriations to the NationalInstitutes of health (NIH). This investmentis too small by several measures: (i) TheUnited States currently devotes between $600and $800 billion annually to health care, yetless than 2% is reinvested in the study of dis-ease. In contrast,the defense industry spendsabout 15% of its budget on research. (ii) U.S.expenditures on R&D as a percentage of ourgross national product have been decliningsteadily and are now lower than those ofJapan and Germany. Moreover, 60% of ourR&D dollars is designated for defense. (iii)The funding of approved NIH grant applica-tions has fallen below 15% in some categoriesand under 25% in many, compared with ratesof 30% or more in the preceding two decades,when progress was so rapid. Under these con-ditions, outstanding proposals cannot be pur-sued, first-rate investigators have becomedispirited, and even the best students arediscouraged from pursuing a career inscience. (iv) Outstanding institutions lackfunds for laboratories and replacement of in-adequate instruments; as a result, the con-duct of biomedical research is constrainedand even dangerous.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7077 July 26, 2000 Biomedical research is also impeded by outmoded procedures for the federal admin-istration of science. Agencies that should beworking together to promote research in thelife sciences, instead remain separated incompeting departments. NIH has sufferedfrom a chain of command that requires ap-proval from secretaries and undersecretarieswith little expertise or interest in science.Some sources of funding for research in thelife sciences lack appropriate mechanisms orexpertise for initiating, judging, and admin-istrating programs, and others have notadapted their mechanisms appropriately tothe progress that has been made in research.For example, many of the NIH study sec-tions, traditionally the pride of the peer-re-view system, are now organized according tooutmoded or otherwise inappropriate cat-egories. In addition, the government has notlearned how to involve the scientific commu-nity adequately in administrative decisionsto initiate targeted projects. To cope with adecaying infrastructure, Congress has occa-sionally appropriated substantial funds forconstruction, but they have done so in a waythat circumvents peer review and serveslocal needs rather than the advancement ofscience as a whole. The confidence that the scientific commu- nity once had in the federal governance ofbiomedical research has been further erodedby the use of inappropriate criteria for ap-pointments to high-ranking positions, par-ticularly within the Department of Healthand Human Services. In recent administra-tions it has become commonplace to con-sider political views on issues such as abor-tion and the use of fetal tissue in research.This tendency has compromised our abilityto select leaders on the basis of their sci-entific accomplishments and their capacityto manage complex programs and make ob-jective decisions. These administrative problems have been compounded by confusion over the goals offederally supported biomedical research.Economic woes have encouraged call for in-creased application of current knowledge topractical problems in all branches of science.These appeals have special resonance in bio-medical science now that so many opportuni-ties for practical applications are at hand. Inrecent months such calls for applied sciencehave gained further prominence because theyhave been championed by National ScienceFoundation (NSF) director Walter Masseyand Representative George Brown (D\u00b1CA), along-time friend of science. (1) Claims that ``society needs to negotiate a new contract with the scientific community. . . rooted in the pursuit of explicit,longterm social goals'' (2) are, however,based on debatable assumptions and threatenthe viability of our greatest asset\u00d0basic re-search. Such claims imply that basis re-search has become an entitlement program,although evidence shows it to be under-funded. They presume that basic and appliedresearch can be unambiguously distin-guished, although the experimental objectiveof academic and industrial sectors of bio-medical research are often synonymous.They seem to deny that science has producedbenefits for society, although its positive ef-fects on health and the economy can be read-ily measured. Finally, in asking that feder-ally supported academic investigators be-come responsible for practical applications,they ignore the demonstrated ability of thebiotechnology and pharmaceutical industriesto develop the fruits of basic science. Enactment of policies that favor practical applications over basic science or narrowlydefined objectives over scientific excellenceis likely to come at the expense of tradi-tional, broadly conceived explorations of bi-ology. At this stage in the growth of bio-medical science, when major discoveries are still unpredictable, this sacrifice would jeop-ardize the scientific progress required for so-cial benefits and economic growth in the fu-ture. This year, for example, the NSP budgetfor basic research declined, despite an over-all increase that benefited more appliedareas. The long-range future of biomedical science is also jeopardized by the deteriora-tion of our educational programs in mathand science. Academic institutions and thebiotechnology and pharmaceutical industriesdepend on the nation's schools to supply acompetent work force by stimulating inter-est in scientific thought and by training stu-dents in scientific methods. Many indicatorsshow that we are failing to achieve thesegoals, especially with students in their earlyschool years and when our performance iscompared to those of other countries. We arealso failing to produce an informed publicthat can respond intelligently to scientificadvances. RECOMMENDATIONS If the United States is to realize the prom- ise of science for our society, the new Ad-ministration should take action on severalfronts. (1) Develop an economic strategy for opti- mizing investment in biomedical research,which would take into account the new op-portunities that have been made available bythe recent revolution in biology, the poten-tial for reducing health-care costs, and thebenefits to agriculture and industry. Until afull evaluation has been completed, we rec-ommend increasing the NIH budget by 15%per year, which would double the budget incurrent dollars by 1998. This increase wouldprovide funds for approximately 30% of ap-proved grants, thereby retaining healthycompetition and exploring the major areas ofscientific opportunity. (2) Generate a comprehensive plan for the best use of federal funds for biomedical re-search. Development of new strategies, pro-grams, and funding mechanisms should in-clude the active participation of the sci-entific community and not originate solelyfrom administrative directives. (3) Institute a mechanism for the periodic evaluation of peer-review procedures, uti-lizing scientists from inside and outside thegovernment. Efforts should be made to en-sure that the thematic alignments of reviewpanels accurately reflect contemporaryprogress and opportunities in biomedical re-search. (4) Facilitate the application of funda- mental discoveries by encouraging tech-nology research in the private sector,culmulating alliances between industry andacademia, and clarifying the federal areas ofconflict of interest. (5) Ensure that new departures by the NIH and NSF in education and technology do notdiminish the support of basic research. If theAdministration or Congress provides newmandates or new requirements for the NIHand NSF, it should also provide the nec-essary additional funds. (6) Strengthen the position of the presi- dential adviser on science and technology.The adviser should have strong credentialsas a scientist and as an administrator, bealert to contemporary developments in boththe biological and physical sciences, be en-couraged to consult the diverse representa-tives of the research community, and haveregular access to the president and vicepresident. (7) Establish the NIH as an independent federal agency and consolidate the authorityof the director over the individual institutes. (8) Apply appropriate criteria to the choice of science administrators. Appointmentsshould be based on stature in the research community and administrative ability rath-er than on political and religious consider-ations. (9) Implement a uniform and comprehen- sible policy for indirect costs that providesincentives to institutions for cost savingsand ensure that the funds will be used onlyto support the infrastructure required for re-search. (10) Create a program for long-term invest- ment in research laboratories and equipmentbased on peer review of merit and need rath-er than on political affiliations (11) Increase federal attention to science education. Measures could include the devel-opment and dissemination of new curriculaand textbooks, enrichment programs for es-tablished teachers, improvements in thetraining of science teachers, and scholar-ships and other incentives for prospectivescience teachers. CONCLUSION We look to our new president and vice president for leadership in fulfilling thepromise of science for our nation. We hopethat they will not fall prey to the view thatthe problems of our society might be solvedby a shift in emphasis from basic science toapplied research. Instead, the U.S. federalgovernment should act decisively and soonto revitalize the support of fundamental aswell as applied research. President Clintonand Vice President Gore have spoken clearlyon health care, economic policy, and edu-cation. We ask them to do the same on theissues that confront science (3). R EFERENCE AND NOTES 1.

JOINMEI N THENA- TIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE NEWNATIONAL GOAL: T HE ADVANCEMENT OF GLOBAL HEALTH DEAR COLLEAGUE : The entire world ac- knowledges that the 20th century was en-gaged by our nation's leadership in the re-moval of the threat of totalitarianism and ofworld communism. The national goals werethe safeguarding and expansion of democracythrough the maintenance of military and po-litical power. With the fall of the BerlinWall, these goals were made a reality. As weapproach the beginning of the 21st century,America has a unique opportunity to chan-nel the genius of its technology, industrialmight, scientific research and dedicated willof our people into a positive goal equal tothe 20th century challenge of defeating total-itarianism. Today, it is time to rechannelthese tremendous energies to an all-out ef-fort to enhance the health of Americans andto combat disease worldwide. America has both humanitarian and en- lightened, self-interested reasons to committo the global eradication of disease\u00d0such ac-complishments would protect our citizens,improve the quality of life, enhance oureconomy, and ensure the continued advance-ment of American interests worldwide. Whilethe actual eradication of disease on a globalscale may not be possible, the pursuit ofsuch a goal could lead to new products inhealth care, new medicines, and new meth-ods of treating disease. On June 30, 1999, I introduced H.R. 2399, the National Commission for the New NationalGoal: The Advancement of Global HealthAct. This legislation would create a Presi-dential/Congressional commission to inves-tigate how we as a nation can commit our-selves to the goal of the global eradication ofdisease. Specifically, this commission wouldrecommend to Congress a nationwide strat-egy of coordination among governmentalhealth agencies, academia, industry, andother institutions and organizations that areestablished for the purpose of preventing anderadicating diseases. In order to accomplish these objectives, H.R. 2399 sets two tangible goals for theCommission. First, the Commission wouldassist the Center for Vaccine Development atNIH to achieve global control of infectiousdiseases. In addition, the Commission woulduse NIH and NSF to expand health resourcesand research information globally throughInternet conferencing and data dissemina-tion capabilities. The Commission would beauthorized to spend up to $1 million as seed money to coordinate and attract private andpublic funds, both at home and abroad, toreach these goals. The knowledge and unbounded imagination of our researchers, doctors and scientistshave ensured the preeminence of researchthat has fostered our freedom and economicwell being. Now, we can empower these indi-viduals in a all-out effort to devise the meth-ods and substances to eradicate diseaseworldwide. The concern for human life re-quires us to muster all available resources,bolstered by a concerted, dedicated will toeradicate diseases from the face of the Earth. Please join me and Rep. John Porter in co- sponsoring this important legislation. If youhave any questions about this proposal, orwould like to become a cosponsor, pleasecontract Matt Zonarich at 5\u00b14315. Very truly yours, G W. G EKAS , Member of Congress. H.R. 2399 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America inCongress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``National Commission for the New National Goal: TheAdvancement of Global Health Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress makes the following findings:(1) During the 20th century the United States led the world in defeating totali-tarianism and communism. (2) The United States also led the world in spreading and establishing democracy inevery region. (3) The end of global conflict and the end of the Cold War, now guaranteed by the powerand leadership of the United States, allowthe Nation to establish new goals for the 21stcentury. (4) The United States, the world leader in the research, development, and production oftechnologies, medicines, and methodologiesutilized to prevent and cure disease, has es-tablished a Center for Vaccine Developmentat the National Institutes of Health thatcould assist in the global control of infec-tious diseases. Infectious disease is the num-ber one global health challenge killing 11million people globally and 180,000 people inthe United States and is the third leadingcause of death in the United States. TheUnited States has the resources, through theNational Institutes of Health and the Na-tional Science Foundation, to expand healthresearch information globally through theuse of Internet conferencing and dissemina-tion of data.

Mr. GEKAS. Mr. Speaker, we have here a little poster that tells the storyand tells you the intricate number ofsteps and areas in which we are in-volved on behalf of the American peo-ple. That is the important thing. Areyou not interested as an American inthe person down the street who hascancer and might be dying from can-cer? Are you not concerned about him?How about your own child who mightneed a new device, a new biotechnicaldevice to sustain life? How about an el-derly person that is beginning to be af-flicted by Alzheimer's? Do we not wantto do something about this? That iswhat we are going to be doing in thecontinued work of the National Insti-tutes of Health. And doubling it willincrease the focus and effort on everyone of these diseases that can plagueyour family or the people down the street. For instance, the human genome project will enable doctors to identifyindividuals at increased risk for dis-eases like hypertension and stroke,glaucoma, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's orsevere depression. These are not justlabels that we throw out. These are liv-ing organisms of disease that are kill-ing us, that are hurting us as an Amer-ican people; and we are trying throughthis effort to reduce the pain and suf-fering and to eliminate the earlydeaths that so hurt our Nation. Our ultimate goal will be to find ways to prevent the development ofprogression of these diseases and de-sign ways to intervene to prevent thedevelopment of these horrific diseasesas we have said. Cancer therapy willchange. Physicians will be able to cus-tomize cancer treatment by knowing amolecular fingerprint of a patient'stumor. That is important work. Thegenetic fingerprint of a person's cancercells will be used to create a drug thatwill attack only the cancer cells andrender targeted treatment which ismore effective and safe. In other words,hit the cancer cells and do not allowthis other destruction of tissues thatso often this day and age while some-times helping to cure the cancer killsthe patient because of the reduction ofvital tissues in other parts of the body. These are living species that we are talking about. We will have effectivevaccines for infectious diseases such asAIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Newscience on the brain will lead to thetreatments for alcoholism, drug abuseand mental illness. What this newfunding brings about is progress in allof these things. Improvements in thetreatment and prevention of diseaseare dependent on the generation of newideas. We all know that. The speed of discovery can be accel- erated by devoting greater resources tothe NIH and the National ScienceFoundation budgets. We have been say-ing that, we will resay it, it is impor-tant to restate it as often as possible,but it is absolutely vital. One thing I want to mention, that not only do we along the way start todiscover methodologies for preventingdisease but there is a side dividend tothe American people for all of this, be-cause as we begin to treat and, let ussay, cure kidney disease, just to giveyou an example, we would be savingmillions and millions of dollars to theAmerican taxpayers, to the Federalbudget, to the local budgets by bring-ing about a closure to this terrible dis-ease. And when you add that combined with kidney disease are blindness, hy-pertension, all other kinds of side mal-adies, bringing them all into a cure orpreventive methodology means that wewill be saving not just the pain and suf-fering which are reason enough to tryto do this but to have the added benefitof reduced health care costs which is somuch on the mind of all the Membersof the Congress and on the members ofthe public, knowing what bills theyhave for pharmaceuticals, for doctors bills, for HMOs, for hospital care, all ofthe various expenses to keep ushealthy. We will, as we progress towards dou- bling this effort of funding, come to apoint where we are also saving money.That should be good news because thatis one of our duties as Members of Con-gress, not just to bring about an invest-ment in trying to prevent disease butalso to do it as economically and withas much saving of taxpayers' money aspossible. Just to give you an example, in 1994, the direct costs for cancer, in billions,$41 billion was spent. Indirect costs,some $68 billion. So the total cost forcancer in 1994, $110 billion. What hap-pens if we start to focus on certaincures and bring about a no cost to thatkind of particular tumor or cancer thathas taken the life of someone? We will not only have saved the life and otherlives and prevent it, but the costs ofhealth care go down proportionately. Look at diabetes. In 1997, $44 billion actually spent, $54 billion of indirectcosts, $98 billion in costs for just that,in one year, 1997. As we know, diabetes,back to kidney disease and other con-sequences of diabetes, the costs and theeffects all mount up to the detrimentof the American people. We are out tostem the tide of these adverse effectson our fellow Americans. And so on and so forth. Look at pulmonary diseases in 1998, $21 billion. Kidney and urological dis-eases in 1985, $26 billion. Stroke, $28billion. And so on and so forth. No won-der we have rising health care costs.All the more reason why we should bedevoting our efforts, legislative and fi-nancial, fiscally, fiscal concentration,on defeating some of these diseasesthat plague us as they are doing. So wesave lives and while we are doing it,not an inconsequential thing, we savetaxpayers' money. Now, what I want to do, also, is to mention here that in support of theNIH and all these efforts, about 10years ago we developed a very uniquelecture series here in the Capitol. TheBiomedical Research Caucus as weframed it at that time was going tobring and has brought scientists of thefirst order to the Capitol to explain thelatest developments and bring us up todate on what is happening in the fieldof women's breast cancer or Alz-heimer's disease or Parkinson's dis-ease. Just today, we had a wonderfullecture by astronauts and astronautscientists, NASA scientists on micro-gravity and some of the things that arebeing discovered in space that help ushere on Earth to early detection of cer-tain diseases and prevention of otherdiseases, and the cure of some diseases. Why? Because we are engaged in while we are funding space projects,marrying them to the National Insti-tutes of Health so that the new scienceCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7080 July 26, 2000 of the space age can be adopted and adapted to human endeavors here onEarth, blending every new advancethat we make, in space and on Earth. Which brings me to something poign- ant in what we have been trying to sayhere. In one of our recent lectures onJune 7, 2000, the subject was, just togive you an example, metastasis, howcancer cells invade the body. We allknow what metastasis is. That is, adiscovered tumor, even though excisedfrom the body, can still result in thedestruction of that individual, thedeath of that individual through me-tastasis, that it spreads to other vitalparts of a body and the surgeons andthe medical people are helpless to stemthe tide of this metastasis, this spread-ing of the tumor. Ironically, one of the stronger figures in our enterprise, a lady by the name ofBelle Cummins, an attorney who hasbeen helping us for years in all theseprojects and was very close to the sci-entists and to the legislators and knewthe subject matter back and forth, wasvery helpful, as I say, on every detail ofour massive enterprise here, herselfwas struck with cancer, a rare form ofcancer, actually. But the cause of finaldeath was the metastasis, the irrev-erent spreading of this cancer to otherparts of the body which killed her androbbed us of a friendly agent in the gi-gantic enterprise in which we havefound ourselves here. The other kinds of subject matter we had, just in the year 2000, we have hadsome 90 sessions on Capitol Hill sincewe started this program and among thepeople who lectured to us were a hand-ful, six or seven or eight, Nobel win-ners. I sometimes jokingly say theywon the Nobel because they came andlectured to us, because we broughtthem to Capitol Hill. That is not ex-actly the case. But the point is that wehave had the latest news that has beendeveloped across the globe on the var-ious diseases, from cloning and the ge-nome project, the mapping of thehuman gene, all of these things are apart of the regular routine of our Bio-medical Research Caucus, keeping allthe Members of Congress aware of thevarious developments. I see sitting with us one of the mem- bers of the Biomedical Research Cau-cus, as a matter of fact one of the co-chairs, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.B ENTSEN ). I wish to yield to him now for the purpose of adding his com-mentary to this special order. Mr. BENTSEN. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for yielding. Let mesay, Mr. Speaker, at the outset thatthe gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.G EKAS ) is the real driving force behind this particular effort in doubling theNIH budget as well as in the entireCongressional Biomedical Caucus. I think all Members of the House and the American people owe him a greatdebt of gratitude for the tireless workthat he has put into this effort. I alsowant to join with him in his commentsregarding Belle Cummins. It was a tre-mendous loss to this effort and to many of us personally for the workthat she had done in her tireless effort.She will be greatly missed. But perhapsin her loss, that should afford us theability to redouble our efforts in tryingto achieve the goal that she so muchsought to see the Congress achieve. b1830 I also want to add, before I get to my prepared statement, my comments re-garding the marriage of medical re-search and scientific research, because,in fact, in my congressional districtthat I have the honor of representing,it includes the Texas Medical Centerand it abuts the Johnson Space Center;and the Texas Medical Center is thefirst biomedical research center ofNASA. It is a joint project between NASA and Baylor College of Medicine, RiceUniversity and several other institu-tions, including some other institu-tions around the country. This is something that the NASA ad- ministrator, Dan Golden, and his peo-ple came up with early on as an idea ofhow to leverage both the basic sci-entific research being done at NASA,with the medical research being doneat our medical institutions with thehope that this type of leveraging cango on in other areas beyond medical re-search. But it would not have happened, it would not have happened had it notbeen for the seed capital put in by theCongress through the National Insti-tutes of Health and through the Medi-care program and other programs thathave established these academic med-ical centers which now are true labora-tories for growth. It is a tremendous ef-fort. I want to say, I am not going to go through my whole statement, I willsubmit most of it for the R ECORD , but I do have the honor of being one of thecochairs with the gentleman fromPennsylvania (Mr. G EKAS ), he is the real chair, we just work for him in thisprocess. He is absolutely correct on H.Res. 437, a sense of the House that theHouse should provide an additional $2.7billion for the National Institutes ofHealth budget for fiscal year 2001. This is one of the best things we could do in the United States in termsof what it does to continue to try andfind cures for diseases that ail our pop-ulace and the populace of the world.People do not realize that we have aquarter of a million people who cometo this country every year seekingmedical treatment, because we havethe best medical treatment in theworld in the United States, and that isbecause of the leverage done off of theNIH. This resolution would help to ensure that more scientists and doctors andresearchers have the resources to con-duct the cutting edge research. Today,only one-third of NIH peer-reviewed,merit-based grants are funded, and thisadditional investment would allow usto increase the number awarded each year and ensure, particularly, that theyounger scientists have the resourcesthat they need to find the cures to savethe lives of so many Americans. I am also convinced that this addi- tional 50 percent investment in NIH isbeing wisely used. There are more than50,000 scientists across the UnitedStates who directly benefit from NIHresearch funds. At the Texas Medical Center, which I mentioned is in the district I represent,there was a total of $289 million fundedthrough the NIH for clinical researchprojects in fiscal year 1999 alone. Formany of these scientists, the NIH fund-ing is critically important to fundingtheir research and without it, theywould not be able to test new thera-pies. Today with many academic medical centers struggling to maintain theirmission of training our Nation's healthcare professionals with the advent ofmanaged care, providing quality healthcare services and conducting clinicalresearch, it is critical, it is criticalthat they have adequate resourcesfrom the NIH. Mr. Speaker, I also believe that in- vesting in the NIH helps our economyto grow. For every dollar spent on re-search and development, our nationaloutput is permanently increased by 50cents or more each year. There are notmany government programs we canfind that have that kind of yield on in-vestment. The government funds the basic re- search with which biotechnology andpharmaceutical companies use to cre-ate new therapies and treatments forcancer, diabetes and heart disease andthe like. A lot of our colleagues may say, why should we not just allow the privatesector to fully fund this? The fact re-mains that there is a lot of researchwhere the private sector will not go.The risk is far too great, and there is alarge gap there, which only a public en-tity, in this case, the Federal Govern-ment, can fill that gap. It can underwrite that risk and, yet, even doing that, we know that there isa tremendous return, not only in thebetter well-being and health of our citi-zens, which should be our first concern,but there is an economic return in thelong run to the general economy of theUnited States, and that is a benefit Ithink all of us can be proud of. Let me just finally say that we are all extremely excited with the an-nouncement just this past month thatthe scientists who were mapping the human genome have made significantdiscoveries and are on the cusp of final-izing that project. I was honored that Baylor College of Medicine is one of the three researchorganizations that are part of the NIHprogram. I met with the officials fromthe researchers from Baylor on numer-ous occasions about this program thatthey are doing, and I know that at onepoint it appeared there was a race be-tween the Federally funded projectCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7081 July 26, 2000 with worldwide assistance and the pri- vate project that was being done. But Ithink it goes without saying, had NIHnot been there at the beginning, notfunded this, we would not have seen aprivate entity come in to it. Furthermore, and I have talked with many of the researchers about this,had there not been a Federal public do-main involvement in something ascritical as the human genome project, Ithink it is unlikely that we would havehad the early commitment that thedata that has been found will be datathat is part of the public domain andnot something that is down at the Pat-ent Office that says that the futuretreatment that can be so critical to thefuture well-being of the American citi-zenry is something that we would haveto go through a copyright and pay apremium for as opposed to somethingthat we as Americans can all enjoy theopportunity of. So I think it is a testament to the work of the NIH, and I would just sayto my colleague, the gentleman fromPennsylvania (Mr. G EKAS ), that, once again, on this particular issue, andthere are other issues as well, but onthis particular issue, he is very muchon the right track, taking a leadershiprole in saying that the United Statestaxpayers should put its resources be-hind funding and doubling the budgetfor the NIH. We get a tremendous return for our well-being, and I commend the gen-tleman for once again taking the leadon this and this resolution. I look for-ward to continuing to working withhim on this until we achieve that goalof doubling it over the 10-year period. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 437, a Sense of the House of Res-olution that the House of Representativesshould provide an additional $2.7 billion for theNational Institutes of Health (NIH's) budget forFiscal Year 2001. This $2.7 billion investmentwould be the third installment on our five-yeareffort to double the NIH's budget. As one of four Co-Chairs of the Congres- sional Biomedical Caucus, I have stronglysupported providing maximum resources forbiomedical research conducted at the NIH.This $2.7 billion investment in NIH's budgetwill help to save lives and improve our inter-national competitiveness. Our nation's bio-medical research is the envy of the world, butwe must continue this investment to ensurethat we maintain this preeminence. This resolution would help to ensure more scientists have the resources they need toconduct cutting-edge research. Today, onlyone-third of NIH peer-reviewed, merit-basedgrants are funded. This additional investmentwould help us to increase the number ofgrants awarded each year and ensure thatyoung scientists have the resources they needto save lives and cure diseases. I am also convinced that this additional 50 percent investment in the NIH is being usedwisely. Today, there are more than 50,000 sci-entists who directly benefit from NIH researchfunds. At the Texas Medical Center, which Irepresent, the NIH provides a total of $289million for clinical research projects in FiscalYear 1999. For many of these scientists, theNIH funding is critically important to funding their research. Without it, they would not beable to test new therapies. Today, many aca-demic health centers are struggling to main- tain their mission of training our nation's healthcare professionals, providing quality healthcare services, and conducting clinical re-search. As managed care plans reducing re-imbursements for health care services, theNIH funding helps to ensure that this missionis achieved. I also believe that investing in the NIH helps our economy to grow. For every dollar spenton research and development, our nationaloutput is permanently increased by 50 centsor more each year. The government funds thebasic research which biotechnology and phar-maceutical companies use to create newtherapies and treatments for cancer, diabetes,and heart disease. As the representative for the Texas Medical Center, one of our nation's premiere researchcenters, I have seen firsthand that this invest-ment is yielding promising new therapies andtreatments for all Americans. Just this month,it was announced by Baylor College of Medi-cine and 2 other research organizations havereached their goal of mapping the human ge-nome. With this genetic map, researchers willhave the information they need to developnew treatments to cure diseases such as can-cer, heart disease, AIDS, and Alzheimer's. AtBaylor College of Medicine, the NIH funding isleading to new information about pediatricAIDS treatments, tuberculosis, and prostatecancer treatments. As a member of the House Budget Com- mittee, I coauthored an amendment to add$2.7 billion to the NIH's budget. Although theNIH amendment was not successful, I believeit is critically important to continue to remindmy colleagues of the potential for success withmore investment in biomedical research. Formany families, maximizing the NIH budget isan important part of their efforts to fight andbeat chronic diseases such as heart diseaseand diabetes. As we learn more about the mo-lecular basis for disease, we can bring newtools to defeat diseases and save lives. As part of the Congressional Biomedical Caucus, we have also sponsored luncheons todiscuss biomedical topics in Congress. Thesewell attended luncheons provide an oppor-tunity for Congress and staff to learn aboutnew research programs which have beenfunded by the NIH-sponsored grants. Thisfirst-hand information will help to highlight howwell these resources are being used. I strongly urge the House of Representa- tives to support and become a cosponsor ofH. Res. 437, legislation that would provide$2.7 billion more for the NIH's budget as partof the Fiscal Year 2001 budget process. In a related matter, a conference is currently meeting to reconcile the differences betweenthe two versions of Fiscal Year 2001 Labor,Health and Human Services, and Educationappropriations bill. I am concerned that theHouse bill includes $18.8 million, a 6 percentincrease above this year's budget. However, Iam pleased that the Senate appropriations billincludes the additional $2.7 billion investmentin the NIH that we need. I strongly urge mycolleagues in this conference committee toadopt the Senate funding level so that theNIH's budget will be doubled over five years. Mr. GEKAS. Mr. Speaker, we thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. B ENT- SEN) for his very valuable contribution.There is something I always wanted to put in the R ECORD to how we got started on this tremendous effort onbehalf of the National Institutes ofHealth, and after a number of searchesof memory as to how this all began, weconcluded that the starting point wasan article written by scientists inter-ested in expanding the avenue towardsincreased research. In 1993, the magazine Science pub- lished a call for action by two NobelPeace Laureates and other scienceleaders like Dr. Michael Bishop, HaroldVarmus and Mark Kirschner, who atthat time pleaded with their govern-ment and their Congress to double theamounts of Federal funding for thebasic research being undertaken by theNational Institutes of Health over a pe-riod of 5 years. This was not the enterprise of some creative lobbyists, but rather bornfrom the thoughtful rationale and sci-entific deliberations of some of theforemost minds in science. When Members of this great Chamber consider their votes for the consistentand substantial increases in funding ofbasic research at the National Insti-tutes of Health and the NationalScience Foundation, they can rely withgreat confidence on the fact that thesescientists placed their entire reputa-tions on the line in making rec-ommendation that the government andthe Congress continue to expand theirinvestment of Federal dollars in basicresearch. So there we have it. Dr. Kirschner, Bishop and Varmus preeminent scientists who thought itwould be a great idea if we could dou-ble the effort of the NIH to get sci-entists to focus on new research andcontinued expanded research. We seizedupon that, certain Members of Con-gress, and thought that was a lightbulb for the Congress upon which to be-come enlightened as to progress thatcan be made. And from that, emerged the effort about which we speak here tonight, theresolution to double the effort. Wepicked up adherence and supporters inthe Senate of the United States, and loand behold, again, we are here tonightreporting to the American people thatwe are intent on moving along on thisspiraled staircase towards doubling thefunding of the NIH within 5 years. The 3rd year is here upon us, next year we will come back to these Cham-bers and see how far we have gottenand be able to report to my colleagueseven more progress. Mr. Speaker, the last item that we wish to record for my colleagues aresome of the recommendations thathave come out of the scientific dia-logue on this important question.These great scientists stated, and Iquote, in part, if the United States isto realize the promise of science for oursociety, the new administration, thiswas back in 1993, should take action onseveral fronts, and here are bits andpieces of these several fronts, developan economic strategy for optimizingCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7082 July 26, 2000 investment and biomedical research, and what we are saying is, the doublingof the funding of NIH is one of thosestrategies. Number two, generate a comprehen- sive plan for the best use of Federalfunds for biomedical research; implicitin what we have said. Institute a mechanism for the peri- odic evaluation of peer-review proce-dures utilizing scientists from insideand outside the government. That isvery important in the world of healthcare, because if one scientist says a-ha,I can cure brain cancer overnight, thathas to be evaluated and reviewed andcriticized and analyzed, et cetera. The American people know that we have a system in place that has checksand balances in everything we do, notthe least of which should be in the dis-coveries or research breakthroughsthat we see now on a daily basis. They go on and say facilitate the ap- plication of fundamental discoveries byencouraging technology research in theprivate sector; that goes without say-ing. Strengthen the position of thePresidential advisor on science andtechnology, increase Federal attentionto science education. Do you know what? Without knowing it, it just dawned on me that about 2years ago I introduced a concept, and itis in legislation and heading for a hear-ing in September, on something akinto this, that is, I believe that in the20th century, the one which was justengulfed us in so many conflicts, somany tears, but so much progress atthe same time, this century, our coun-try was faced with one gigantic goal,that goal was to overturn tyranny andrepression and to advance democracy,to repel tyrannical governments, Com-munism, Naziism, all of the tyrannicalforms that have hurt us so blatantlyacross the years. Our goal as a Nationwas to repulse all of that and to estab-lish and reestablish and ferment de-mocracy throughout the remainder ofthe world. It dawned on me we ought to be stat- ing a goal for the next century, for the21st century. What should that goal befor the United States of America? Inmy judgment, it should be the eradi-cation of disease from the face of theEarth. Mr. Speaker, now the goal of repuls- ing tyranny and establishing democ-racy was worthwhile, we would not bein a position where we could even talkabout eradication of disease as in a newgoal, but listen to what has happened.Our country is the foremost in everyendeavor of the human mind can gen-erate, in everything. We are the super-power. We are the supersuperpower ineverything. We do not want to be justthe superpower in military strength,we have the capacity now to lead theworld in those efforts that can lead tothe eradication of disease. Now, I mentioned this to Dr. Harold Varmus, who later became the directorof the National Institutes of Health,and now most recently has transferredhis talents to Sloan Kettering in New York, a renowned scientist, a Nobelwinner. b1815 I mentioned this to him while he was director of NIH, that we ought to try todo something to try to eradicate dis-ease across the face of the Earth. Hesaid, ``George, I don't think we can ac-tually eradicate every disease.'' I said,``I know that, Harold. I know thoughthe effort has to yield progress in theeradication of disease, even if we fallshort of total eradication of every dis-ease known to mankind.'' But the point is that should be the national goal. And if you look at itagain, in rounder terms, the goal oferadicating disease that the UnitedStates would undertake would be in itsown self-interest, its own enlightenedself-interest. Why? While we are trying to eradi- cate disease or leading the world inthose efforts, we are producing newpharmaceuticals, new biotechnologydevices, new methodologies for treat-ing disease, for discovering new anec-dotes, et cetera. While we are doingthat then, we are creating economicfervor, economic opportunities andeconomic expansion, enterprises ofevery stripe while marching down theroad towards leading the world, leadingmankind, in the eradication of disease. We are number one in biotechnology now, number one in biomedical re-search, number one in every effortleading towards these things. Why notthen move towards this goal aboutwhich I speak? Let me tell you that my bill, the one I have introduced and on which a hear-ing will be held, as I said in September,would create a commission of thegreatest experts our country canproduce on how we can begin thisworldwide enterprise of eradicatingdisease from the face of the Earth. Itwould employ every sector of our coun-try and all its citizenry, from teachingchildren in first grade about washingtheir hands before meals and in wash-ing their hands as often as possible, asimple little gesture, as part of a globalstrategy to eradicate disease, not tomention space exploration and all ofthe other things about which we havemade mention here today. So from washing one's hands in kin- dergarten to climbing to Mars in 3years, all of these things can be a partof the global effort on the part of theUnited States to eradicate disease fromthe face of the Earth; and these mem-bers of these commissions, the commis-sion that I envision through this legis-lation, could create the steps necessaryto begin that enterprise. We have been joined by the gentle- woman from North Carolina, is thatcorrect? Mrs. CLAYTON. That is correct.Mr. GEKAS. I get North and South mixed up once in a while. Mrs. CLAYTON. South Carolina is good, but North is even better.Mr. GEKAS. I yield to the gentle- woman. Mrs. CLAYTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadershipon this issue and allowing me to par-ticipate. I think this issue that thegentleman brings before us is excitingand has great potential and is criticaland needed. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.G EKAS ) and others in their effort to double the funding for the National In-stitutes of Health for research in thebiomedical field. Research today willbe the basis for the discovery of treat-ments and prescription drugs that willprovide much needed benefits tomor-row. Passive investments in biomedical research have resulted in better healthand improved quality of life for allAmericans, as well as a reduction innational health care expenditures. TheFederal Government represents thesingle largest contributor to bio-medical research conducted in theUnited States and must continue toplay a vital role in the growth of thisnational biotechnology industry. The National Institutes of Health is prepared to lead us into a new era ofmolecular medicine that will provideus with unprecedented opportunitiesfor the prevention, the diagnosis, thetreatment, the cure of all diseases thatcurrently plague our society. Currently more than 297,000 Ameri- cans are suffering from AIDS, and hun-dreds of thousands more with HIV in-fections. These Americans, althoughstill facing serious and life-threateninghealth problems, can benefit from bio-medical and biotechnology advances inthe treatment of HIV. Biomedical ad-vances assist in providing assurances ofmore effective and accessible and af-fordable treatment for persons withHIV and the hope of arresting the dis-ease until a cure is discovered. Patients with debilitating diseases such as osteoporosis and diabetes, orlife-threatening cervical, breast, andprostate cancer will benefit from thefurther understanding of the principlesof biometrics. The development of newhard tissue, such as bone and teeth, aswell as the study of soft tissue develop-ment, holds great promise for the de-sign of new classes of bio-materials andpharmaceuticals, and the diagnosis andanalytical reagents for use in thetreatment of disease and their side ef-fects. We are on the dawn of a biomedical revolution, and most Americans showoverwhelming support for an increasedFederal investment in biomedical re-search to improve the quality of theirlives and of world citizens. Again, I support the request to in- crease by $2.7 billion the budget to theNational Institutes of Health to fundbiomedical research. American bio-medical researchers should not have towait any longer than necessary tobegin the new generation of discoverythat awaits them and to benefit theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7083 July 26, 2000 overall health of our great Nation and the world. Again, I thank the gentleman for al- lowing me to participate. Mr. GEKAS. I thank the gentle- woman. Mr. Speaker, to bring to a close our special Special Order, I just want to re-peat some of the promises that lieahead with the continued developmentof our research capability: new ways torelieve pain, that goes without saying;medications for the treatment of alco-holism and drug addiction; clinicaltrials database to help the public gainaccess to information about all of thesetrials through the Internet andthrough other devices that we have. I see our colleague, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. G ANSKE ), who is seated here, ready to take a Special Order onhis own. Just today he and I had a dis-cussion about the Patients' Bill ofRights and the pharmaceuticals and allof that, which is a part of all of this;and I maintain if we can pass our billand establish this commission to lookat all the phases of health care for theeradication of disease, that the plightof our teaching hospitals, patient care,pharmaceuticals, everything that wor-ries us on a daily basis, can be placedin a proper order to take the lead glob-ally in the eradication of disease. Mr. PACKARD. Mr. Speaker, I urge my col- leagues to support increased funding for theNational Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH isthe pre-eminent biomedical research enter-prise in the world, relied on for its innovationby countries spanning the developing and in-dustrialized world. The vast bulk of the NIHfunding we appropriate goes to the large med-ical research institutions in this country thatlead the fight against disease and illness. The NIH has always enjoyed strong bipar- tisan support from Congress. An increase inNIH funding would accommodate substantialincreases in the grants, training awards, andinfrastructure improvements that are critical tothe continued success of medical research.Additional funding would also give the NIH agreater ability to disseminate information onnew breakthroughs to patients and health careproviders. NIH researchers are on the verge oftremendous new discoveries in science andmedicine. Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to continue their support for the NIH in the bestway possible\u00d0by increasing funding. Mr. L AFALCE. Mr. Speaker, the National In- stitutes of Health benefits all Americans, andwe should all be proud of the research workthat they do. Thanks to the scientists, doctorsand other professionals at NIH, we are closerthan ever before to finding cures and im-proved treatments for diseases like Alz-heimer's, diabetes and cancer. We need toshow our unwavering commitment to the NIHand the important work that they do. That iswhy I strongly support doubling the NIH budg-et. In addition to the countless health benefits that this will bring to the American people, itwill result in savings as well. Every dollar thatwe invest, particularly in preventive medicine,will reduce hospitalization and the costs oftreating a disease that we can cure. Diabetesis a prime example of this. It is estimated thatone out of every ten health care dollars in the United States and one out of every four Medi-care dollars is spent on diabetes care. If weinvest enough money to follow all the prom-ising leads that the congressionally-mandatedDiabetes Research Working Group has identi-fied, we can cure this disease. We should dothat. Just think what it would mean to the 16million Americans, and their families, who suf-fer from this disease. As Vice-Chair of theHouse Diabetes Caucus, I urge all of my col-leagues to support this investment in finding acure. And it truly is a cost-effective, life-savinginvestment. In this time of unparalleled pros-perity, there is no reason that we can't do it. Alzheimer's, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancer, autism,macular degeneration and on and on\u00d0we allhave family, friends, constituents who are af-fected by these diseases in one way or an-other. Particularly as our older population con-tinues to grow, we need to increase our com-mitment to health care. An appropriate invest-ment now, when the resources are available,will translate into immeasurable savings, bothin human life and in dollars, down the road. This is truly an investment in our future. Let's make this commitment and let scienceshow us how we can all live healthier, happier,longer lives. Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of doubling the budget of the NationalInstitutes of Health to further life-saving re-search. The world is at the cutting edge of bio- medical research breakthroughs that will alterforever the age-old battle of humans againstdisease. The discovery of cures for most lifethreatening diseases can, and will, beachieved in our lifetime. But, we can crossthat ultimate frontier of an improved quality oflife for all Americans only if this Nation com-mits itself to funding biomedical research at asufficient level to do the job. Mr. Speaker, we can demonstrate our col- lective resolve to accomplish that result bydoubling the funding for the National Institutesof Health. Our research is beginning to pay off. Hun- dreds of new drug discoveries are rapidlymaking their way through clinical trials.Through the concerted genome effort, we willin a very short time have effectively decodedthe enormous amount of DNA sequence infor-mation that forms the blueprint for human ife.The developing field of proteomics will providethe tools to understand the function of proteinsproduced by genes. The quantity and qualityof targets for the development of new drugswill be increased by a factor of previously un-believable proportions. In addition, progress isbeing made in learning how to stimulate theimmune system itself to fight cancer and otherdiseases. Immunotherapy, and gene therapy,as demonstrated by the scientists at the Sid-ney Kimmel Cancer Center in San Diego, arebeginning to unlock the secrets of how to ef-fectively combat disease in virtually every cellof the body. Anti-angiogenesis\u00d0a processwhich prevents the formation of new bloodvessels which feed the cancer as it multi-plies\u00d0offers great hope. The progress beingmade in San Diego research institutes suggestthat the accelerating pace of laboratory dis-coveries will soon be translated into innovativetreatments. In San Diego, basic sciencebreak-throughs are happening at the Univer-sity of California, San Diego (UCSD)\u00d0one ofthe largest recipients of NIH funding in the country\u00d0and also at the Salk Institute, theBurnham Institute, and the Scripps ResearchInstitute. And, the most dramatic results ofthese scientific advances may be dem-onstrated when they work in combination withchemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. At the University of California at San Diego, for example, Dr. Mark Tuszynski has receivedapproval from the FDA to test a form of genetherapy in humans with the dreaded Alz-heimer's disease. Alzheimer's now afflicts 4million Americans, a number which is pro-jected to grow to 8 million in this country aloneby the year 2020. Dr. Tuszynski will surgicallyimplant genetically modified cells into thebrains of human volunteers to determine if wecan slow the progression of Alzheimer's dis-ease and enhance the function of some of theremaining brain cells. Mr. Speaker, charitable contributions and the scholarship of great universities and re-search institutes play important roles in theevolution of our scientific success. It is throughthe investsment of significant Federal dollarsin the National Institutes of Health that we cancombine all of these positive forces to realizethe medical miracles on our horizon. NIH pro-motes the research and coordinates thescience. NIH helps to develop new skills ofscientific investigators, and provides the stim-ulus for the emergence of new technologies. I am privileged to represent San Diego, the biotech capital of the world. What we do inSan Diego in collaboration with scientistsaround the globe will enhance life itself at atime in history when life is most worth living. Now is the time to redouble our investment in biomedical research. America is at peace,our economy is prospering, our citizens aregainfully employed, our budget is balanced,and our surplus is real, There is no excuse toignore what Americans want more than any-thing else: the cure of diseases which inflictdeath, pain, suffering, and economic distressto almost every family. Mr. Speaker, let's do it; let's do it now.Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to the gentleman from Pennsylvania(Mr. G EKAS) for arranging this special order to- night, to focus on the importance of doublingAmerica's investment in health research overthe next five years. I am honored to be a cosponsor of his reso- lution, H. Res. 437, expressing the sense ofCongress on how to accomplish our goal ofdoubling our national investment in health re-search. This research is the gift of America'shard-working taxpayers to this generation andthe next\u00d0not just to Americans, but to theworld. Furthermore, for us to take fullest advantage of this investment, we must take care to investit wisely. So in addition to increasing our workin basic health research at the National Insti-tutes of Health, we should treat in a similarfashion our investment in the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention, and in the pro-grams of the Health Resources Service Ad-ministration, which are vital to putting in prac-tice the things we learn through basic healthresearch. As a strong fiscal conservative, andas a member of the House AppropriationsSubcommittee on Labor, Health and HumanServices and Education, I am committed toworking with my colleagues to achieve thesegoals within a limited federal budget.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7084 July 26, 2000 Rather than to address this issue myself, I have asked several of my constituents andleaders in the field of health research to ad-dress this issue themselves. With the consentof the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.G EKAS), I would like to insert in the R ECORDat this point several letters, e-mails, and notesthat describe in further detail the importance ofdoubling our investment in health research. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following letters for the R ECORD. CHIRON CORPORATION , Emeryville, CA, June 14, 2000. Hon. R ANDY ``DUKE'' CUNNINGHAM , House of Representatives,Washington, DC. D EARREPRESENTATIVE CUNNINGHAM : On be- half of Chiron Corporation's Blood TestingDivision, I appreciate this opportunity toconvey our support for increased funding forbiomedical research. Chiron Corporation, headquartered in Emeryville, California, is a leading bio-technology company with innovative prod-ucts in three global healthcare markets: bio-pharmaceuticals, vaccines and blood testing.Chiron, and its partner, Gen-Probe Incor-porated of San Diego, formed a strategic alli-ance in 1998 to develop, manufacture andmarket genomic nucleic acid testing (NAT)for detection of blood transfusion associatedviruses such as Human ImmunodeficiencyVirus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Genomic NAT is the next technological ad- vance in ensuring the safety of the nation'sblood supply. It detects small amounts ofvirus in donated blood before antibodies orviral proteins are detectable by currentblood screening technologies. Today's bloodtesting methods depend solely on the detec-tion of these antibodies or viral proteins, sonewly infected donors may escape detectionduring the ``window period'' between infec-tion and appearance of these serologic mark-ers. Since April of 1999, the Chiron-Gen-Probe partnership has been supplying NAT re-agents, instrumentation, training, and tech-nical support to U.S. blood centers per-forming NAT under FDA approved clinicalprotocols. The Chiron Procleix HIV\u00b11/HCVAssay is currently utilized to screen approxi-mately 75% of all volunteer blood donationsin the U.S. In addition, the Armed ServicesBlood Program now routinely screens blooddonations with the Chiron assay. Genomic NAT testing has already in- creased the safety of the U.S. blood supply.In less than one year, testing by Chiron'ssystem alone has detected 28 infected HCVdonors and 4 HIV\u00b11 infected donors. Identi-fication of these infected donors preventedthe potential transfusion of over 100 HCVand/or HIV\u00b11 infected units of blood compo-nents. Scientific studies estimate thatgenomic NAT may reduce the window periodof potential HCV infection by 70% and bynearly 50% for HIV. Recent studies also indi-cate that genomic NAT, when used on indi-vidual donor samples, may close the Hepa-titis B Virus (HBV) window by 50% (as muchas four weeks) compared to currently avail-able tests. Implementation of NAT has required the utilization of many new scientific inventionsand innovations. One historic discovery inthis effort was the genomic mapping of theHIV and HCV viruses by Chiron scientists.Gen-Probe Incorporated developed new highthroughput genomic amplification and de-tection technologies known as TMA, that arerequired to detect very low levels of virusesin blood donations. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti- tute of the National Institutes of Health con-tracted with Chiron's partner, Gen-Probe In-corporated, to develop genomic NAT testing assays and automation. All of these factorsin combination have led to the developmentof genomic NAT as the new world standardin blood screening technology, and offers thepromise of providing Americans a blood sup-ply that is safer from risk of HIV, HCV andHBV transmission. HCV is becoming a significant public health concern, both here in California andelsewhere. Despite these remarkable ad-vances in blood testing and safety, our workis not complete. There are new viral strainsthat may contaminate our blood supply. Theimmensely important genomic amplificationtechnologies are at the beginning of theirtechnological life cycle. It is vitally impor-tant that the U.S. Government continues,and increases where possible, its investmentin these areas of biomedical research. Thank you again for the opportunity to provide Chiron's comments on this impor-tant public policy issue. Sincerely, R AJEN DALAL , President, Chiron Blood Testing Division. POWEY , CA, June 14, 2000. DEARCONGRESSMAN CUNNINGHAM : I am a 47 year old woman. My diabetes was discovered40 years ago. I should be dead! Due to the ad-vances in health research I am not only alivebut a success despite my physical challenges. I am a speaker for UCSD transplantation and animal research program. I should havedied at the age of 15, being unconscious andhaving extremely high, unexplained bloodsugars. I survived that challenge and thenlater went on to college supported by theRehab. center for the blind in Connecticut.My kidneys failed as I was receiving my BAin Psychology and BS in Business. (DoubleMajor). I then moved to San Diego and re-ceived my first kidney transplant. My rightleg was amputated as I was in Graduateschool. As I was finishing Graduate school Ireceived my first Service dog for Physicalassistance. To make a long story short. I am able to drive with one good eye\u00d0medical research. Ican walk, but do use a wheelchair, to reserveenergy. I am now a licensed Marriage andFamily Therapist!!! (long haul and Hall)AND I have founded and co run with my fi-ance, Leashes for Living Assistance/ServiceDogs. A unique program enabling the chal-lenged to train their own Service Dogs. Without medical and health research I would not be able to give back so much tothe community. I pride myself in the factthat along with the medical teams, I haveworked hard to stay alive . . . and now amable to help others live happier and healthierlives despite their challenges. With my highest regards for your endeav- ors, C YNTHIA CLAY. POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME ASSOCIATION , INC., Rosemont, IL, June 14, 2000. Rep. R ANDY CUNNINGHAM , Rayburn Bldg,Washington, DC. D EAR CONGRESSMAN CUNNINGHAM , We at the PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome Associa-tion, Inc., or PCOSA, would like to add ourvoices in support of House Resolution 437,sponsored by Rep. George Gekas from Penn-sylvania. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a little understood endocrine disease that af-fects as many as 1 in 10 women and yet con-tinues to be misdiagnosed by doctors. Recentresearch strides point only to the need formore research, education and raised aware-ness about PCOS, which is the leading cause of infertility and puts women at risk for typeII diabetes, endometrial cancer, and cardio-vascular disease. PCOSA is an internationalnon-profit organization dedicated to the edu-cation and support of women with PCOS andtheir healthcare providers. Dr. R. Jeffrey Chang, at the University of California at San Diego is a pioneer in theresearch and education of women and doc-tors about PCOS. Having edited one of thefew texts on the subject for doctors, he re-mains a strong voice for women's healthcare. At our recent membership conferencein San Diego, Dr. Chang spoke to patientsand other doctors, and was even able to ex-plain this complicated syndrome to membersof the San Diego press. He is a tremendousasset to endocrinology and to California. It is imperative that Dr. Chang's research, and that of his colleagues searching for thecause and treatment of PCOS, continue to besupported by the NIH until we understandthe disease and have an answer for every sin-gle woman that suffers from it. With Best Regards, C ORRINA P. S MITH, Dir. of Media Relations. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA , SANDIEGO, La Jolla, CA, June 12, 2000. Hon. R ANDY DUKECUNNINGHAM , House of Representatives,Washington, DC. D EARDUKE, I am writing to urge you and your colleagues to support an increase infunding for the NIH for FY2001 that will keepus on track for doubling in five years. Inspite of our continued and spectacular recentprogress in the fight against disease, toomany of our friends and loved-ones die pre-maturely or suffer needlessly from diseasesthat we could defeat if our research effortscould proceed more swiftly. This year alone,I have already lost one dear friend to a pre-mature death from cancer, and several otherfriends are literally in a fight for their lives.I have also received many phone calls andletters from people afflicted with presentlyincurable diseases, but where research holdshope for treatment in the not too distant fu-ture. Better and faster biomedical researchis clearly the best answer for these people. Itis only by understanding fully the cellularand molecular basis for disease that we canthen develop effective therapeutic strategies. As you know, the House and Senate have been working toward the goal of the dou-bling of NIH by the year 2003. Congress hasprovided the necessity 15% increases overeach of the past two years to meet this im-portant goal. For FY2001, Congress must pro-vide an increase of $2.7 billion in order toreach the doubling goal. These funds arecritical for our continued rapid progress inthe battle against cancer, diabetes, ALS,Alzheimer's and other diseases affecting mil-lions of Americans. I know that you share my belief that bio- medical research and our fight against dis-ease is one of our most important nationalpriorities. I look forward to working to-gether with you in the future on this impor-tant battle. Sincerely, L AWRENCE S.B. G OLDSTEIN , Ph. D. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to thank my colleague fromPennsylvania, Mr. G EKAS, for arranging to- night's special order, as well as the distin-guished chairman of the Labor-HHS-EducationAppropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Porter, forhis work and dedication in support of bio-medical research at the National Institutes ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7085 July 26, 2000 Health (NIH). I believe it is essential that Con- gress move forward in its commitment to dou-ble the research budget at the NIH. Currently,scientists at the NIH are developing cutting-edge treatments for hundreds of diseases, in-cluding cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes. In-creased funding for medical research and de-velopment will allow millions of Americans tolead healthier lives. I, therefore, rise in supportof efforts to provide a 15% increase for NIH inFY2001. This increase will mark the third in-stallment of the plan to double the NIH budgetover a period of five years. Each and every day, researchers at the NIH succeed in making important discoveriesabout the human body and the diseases thatmay effect it. These scientists work tirelesslyto develop cutting-edge technologies that pushthe envelope of human capacity. For FY2001, the NIH have developed four critical initiatives. These include: (1) GeneticMedicine\u00d0this involve the mapping of thehuman genome and the subsequent genetherapy. Advances in the treatment of cancer,chronic illness, and infectious disease may bepossible through this work; (2) Clinical Re-search\u00d0this initiatives reinforces the goal ofturning the results of laboratory research intotreatment for patients; (3) Fostering Inter-disciplinary Research; and (4) EliminatingHealth Disparities. These four areas of sci-entific research present incredible opportuni-ties that have the promise to generate tremen-dous benefits in the future. Providing in-creased funding for biomedical research todaywill allow millions of Americans to leadhealthier lives tomorrow. With this in mind, I urge each of my col- leagues to support funding the full 15% budgetincrease for the National Institutes of Health. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup- port of increasing the Federal Government'scommitment to biomedical research throughthe National Institutes of Health. As chairmanof the Health and Environment Subcommitteeof the House Commerce Committee, and as amember of the Congressional Biomedical Re-search Caucus, I am a strong advocate of thisagency's vital mission. I have joined many ofmy colleagues in supporting efforts to doublefederal funding for the NIH. The NIH is the primary Federal agency charged with the conduct and support of bio-medical and behavioral research. Each of itsinstitutes has a specialized focus on particulardiseases, areas of human health and develop-ment, or aspects of research support. Whenwe consider its role as one of the world's fore-most research centers, it is amazing to re-member that the NIH actually began its exist-ence as a one-room Laboratory of Hygiene in1887. Medical research represents the single most effective weapon against the diseases that af-fect many Americans. The advances madeover the course of the last century could nothave been predicted by even the most far-sighted observers. It is equally difficult to an-ticipate the significant gains we may achievein years to come through increased funding forfurther medical research. Last year, Congress gave a substantial in- crease in funding to the NIH. The fiscal year2000 omnibus appropriations law provided$17.8 billion for the NIH\u00d0an increase of $2.2billion or 14 percent over the previous fiscalyear. This increase represents a sizable downpayment toward the goal of doubling its fund-ing over 5 years. This year, I am hopeful that we can make similar progress in that regard. As we work to increase Federal funding, I am also sponsoring legislation to encourageprivate support for NIH research efforts. Mybill, H.R. 785, the Biomedical Research Assist-ance Voluntary Option or ``BRAVO'' Act, wouldallow taxpayers to designate a portion of theirfederal income tax refunds to support NIH re-search efforts. I introduced the bill on a bipar-tisan basis with the ranking member of theHealth and Environment Subcommittee, Mr.B ROWNof Ohio. Mr. Speaker, every dollar invested in re- search today will yield untold benefits for allAmericans in years to come. Indeed, our ownlives might some day depend on the efforts ofscientists and doctors currently at work in ourNation's laboratories. I urge all Members tojoin me in supporting a strong Federal commit-ment to biomedical research. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisleto talk about the importance of doubling thefunding for the National Institutes of Healthover the next 5 years. As we all know, wehave already made two down payments onthis goal, first in 1999 and again in 2000. Un-fortunately, last month the House approved aLabor-HHS-Education bill which significantlybacktracks from our commitment. We must in-sist on a bipartisan basis that this seriousunderfunding is corrected in conference. I support full funding for the NIH on behalf of all of my constituents who struggle with ill-nesses that we do not fully understand. Iknow, as they do, that the work of NIH-fundedscientists offers their best hope for a cure. Atthe same time, each year NIH researchers un-cover new information which helps doctorsbetter treat patients with heart disease, can-cer, diabetes, mental illness, and many otherterrible diseases. The National Institutes of Health fund well over a third of all biomedical research in theUnited States. But NIH's role goes well be-yond that, because NIH is the primary funderof all basic research. Basic research, which isgenerally focused on discovering new sci-entific principles, often cannot be patented andis therefore not appealing to for-profit compa-nies. But basic research provides the buildingblocks on which new treatments and cures arebuilt. Of the 21 most important medications in-troduced between 1965 and 1992, 15 weredeveloped using tools from federally fundedresearch. Seven were directly developed bygovernment-funded researchers. One of these exciting new drugs, Cisplatin, was developed by researchers in my homeState at Michigan State University. Workingwith NIH's National Cancer Institute, bio-physicist Barnett Rosenberg developedCisplatin, an anti-cancer drug which curessixty to sixty-five percent of testicular cancercases and reduces risk of death by fifty per-cent when used to treat cervical cancer. With-out NIH's expertise and resources, Dr. Rosen-berg might not have been able to completethe pharmacology, toxicology, and clinicaltrials needed to get this drug to the cancer pa-tients who need it. Each year that we increase funding for NIH, we make possible more discoveries like thisand we make sure that the public benefitsfrom those discoveries. Currently, the eco-nomic cost of illness in the United States isestimated at about $3 trillion. An annual ap-propriation of $16 billion\u00d0less than 1 percent of the Federal budget\u00d0is a small price to payto maintain NIH's strength in controlling andcuring disease. I hope that all of my col-leagues will join with me and the other mem-bers of the Congressional Biomedical Caucusin supporting full funding for the NIH and med-ical research. Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in support of doubling theNIH budget for fiscal year 2001. I thank my colleague G EORGEGEKASfor or- ganizing this special order. This is one budgetthat affects every single American. Whether itis diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer, or safe child-birth, the NIH is there as a shining star to pro-tect our Nation and help us understand andtreat dreaded diseases. One of the diseases that NIH researchers feel could be cured in a matter of years is Par-kinson's disease. I am proud to be the founderand co-chair of the Congressional Group onParkinson's Disease with my friend and col-league F REDUPTON. We are so close to a cure for this disease. Leading scientists describe Parkinson's as the most curable neurological disorder. Break-through therapy or\u00d0perhaps a cure\u00d0is ex-pected within a decade. When have research-ers ever said that they think they can cure adisease in 10 years? I would like to focus my remarks tonight on the importance of giving NIH the largest in-crease possible. Specifically, I have been ad-vocating for $71.4 million to implement NIH'sParkinson's Disease Research Agenda. Dur-ing last year's appropriations debate, we weresuccessful in including language to supportthe development of this research agenda forParkinson's disease. It truly is a roadmap for what needs to be done in the next 5 years to beg to a cure. Ihave spearheaded a letter to the confereesasking for the $71.4 million needed in the firstyear to enact this research agenda. I am veryhopeful that we will get this money in thebudget this year. But if we don't, I will intro-duce legislation requiring this plan be fundedin its entirety. Finally, I just want to mention that I am anx- iously awaiting the release of the final guide-lines on stem cell research. We worked hardin Congress this year to not let stem cell re-search get politicized. We stood firm that Par-kinson's disease\u00d0along with diabetes, ALS,and a host of other diseases\u00d0must not beheld hostage to extremists in Congress. I willcontinue to work for prompt implementation ofthis critical research when the guidelines arefinalized. I thank my colleagues again for or-ganizing this special order. Mr. GEKAS. Mr. Speaker, reluc- tantly, because I am having a goodtime here, reluctantly, I am lookingaround, I see no other recourse exceptto yield back the balance of my time. f GENERAL LEAVE Mr. GEKAS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan- imous consent that all Members mayhave 5 legislative days within which torevise and extend their remarks on theSpecial Order just given. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Pennsylvania?CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7086 July 26, 2000 There was no objection. f IMPORTANT HEALTH CARE ISSUES FACING AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 1999, the gentleman from Iowa(Mr. G ANSKE ) is recognized for 60 min- utes. HMO ABUSES Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, tonight I am going to talk about two importanthealth care issues that are facing Con-gress. One concerns HMO abuses, andthe other concerns the number onepublic health problem in the country,and that is the use of tobacco. Mr. Speaker, about 8 months ago on the floor of this House we had a mo-mentous debate for about 2 1\u00a42days on patient protection legislation; and atthe end of that debate, 275 bipartisanRepublican and Democratic Membersof this Congress voted to pass the Nor-wood-Dingell-Ganske bipartisan con-sensus Managed Care Reform Act of1999. Nearly every nurse, nearly everydentist, nearly every doctor who is aMember of this body voted for that. Well, what has happened since then? Very little. A conference committeewas belatedly named to try to getagreement between the bill that passedthe House, the strong patient reformbill, and the bill that passed the Sen-ate, which was more an HMO reformbill. Unfortunately, nothing much is going on in that conference now. I donot think they have met for probablyabout 2 months. There has been a pau-city of public meetings. But a fewweeks ago the issue was brought backto the floor of the Senate and a GOPHMO bill was added as an amendmentto a bill, and it passed, just barely. Itwas the Nickles HMO amendment. I would have to advise my colleagues that that GOP Senate bill that passeda few weeks ago by a margin of aboutone or two votes is worse than no billat all. In fact, it is an HMO protectionbill, not a patient protection bill.Would Members like to have someproof of that? Well, let me tell my fel-low colleagues about some of thethings that HMOs have been doing thathave been documented in a recent arti-cle in Smart Money magazine in theirJuly issue. Consider the case of a man named Jim Ridler. It was shortly after noonon a Friday back in August 1995 whenJim Ridler, then 35 years old, had beenout doing some errands. He was return-ing to his home in a small town in Min-nesota on his motorcycle when aminivan coming from the opposite di-rection swerved right into his lane. Ithit Jim head on. It threw him morethan 200 feet into a ditch. He broke hisneck, his collarbone, his hip, severalribs, all of the bones in both legs. Itripped the muscles right through hisarm. Over the next 4 months, after a dozen surgeries, he still did not know wheth-er he would ever walk again. When he got a phone call from his lawyer whohad started legal proceedings againstthe driver of that minivan who hadswerved into his path, that call that hegot from his lawyer really shook himup. ``I am afraid I have got some bad news for you,'' said his lawyer. He toldJim that even if Jim won his lawsuit,his health plan, his HMO, wanted totake a big chunk out of what they hadspent on his care. ``You are joking, right?'' said Jim.``Nope,'' said the lawyer.Jim's health plan had a clause in its contract that allowed the HMO tostake a claim in his settlement, aclaim known in insurance as subroga-tion. ``So I pay the premium, and then something happens that I need the in-surance for, and they want their moneyback?'' Ridler asked incredulously.``The way I figure it, my health insur-ance is just a loan.'' Well, Ridler eventually settled his lawsuit for $450,000, which was all theliability insurance available. Hishealth plan then took $406,000, leavinghim after expenses with a grand totalof $29,000. Jim said, ``I feel like I was raped by the system,'' and I guess I can under-stand his point of view. I doubt that my colleagues know, and I doubt that most people know, thatthey have what are called subrogationclauses in their contracts that meanthat if they have been in an accidentand they try to recover from a neg-ligent individual, like the person who almost killed Ridler, that their HMOcan go after that settlement. Now, Mr. Speaker, originally sub- rogation was used for cases in whichcare was provided to patients who hadno health insurance at all, but whomight receive a settlement due tosomebody else's negligence. However,HMOs are now even seeking to be reim-bursed for care that they have not evenpaid for. Susan De Garmos found that out 10 years ago when her HMO asked for re-imbursement on her son's medicalbills. In 1990 her son, Stephen DeGarmos, who was age 10 at that time,was hit by a pickup truck while ridinghis bike to football practice near hishome in West Virginia. That accidentleft him paralyzed from the waistdown. His parents sued the negligentdriver; and they collected $750,000 insettlement, plus $200,000 from theunderinsured motorist policy. Now, re-member, this little boy is paralyzed forthe rest of his life. Well, the Health Plan of Upper Ohio Valley wanted $128,000 in subrogationfor Stephen's bills. It so happens thatStephen's mother thought that amountwas high, so she phoned the hospital inColumbus, Ohio, where Stephen hadbeen treated; and she got an itemizedlist of the charges. b1900 What she found out infuriated her. The HMO had paid much less than the$128,000 it was now seeking from her son, her paralyzed son's settlement. Mrs. DeGarmo had found another dirty little secret of managed care, andthat was that HMOs often use subroga-tion to go after a hospital's billedcharges, the fee for full paying pa-tients, even though the HMO gets a dis-count off the bill charges. According to DeGarmo's lawyer, the health plan of Upper Ohio Valley actu-ally paid about $70,000 to treat Steve.That meant they were trying to take$50,000 that they had not even paid forfrom Steve's settlement. They weregoing to make money off this little boywho had been paralyzed. When the DeGarmos refused to pay, get this, the HMO had the gall to suethem. Well, others found out about this HMO's action and in 1999 the HMO,that HMO, settled suits for $9 millionamong roughly 3,000 other patientsthat they had treated like theDeGarmos. Now, when HMOs get compensation in excess of their costs, I believe theyare depriving victims of funds thatthose victims need to recover. Thissubrogation process has even spawnedan industry of companies that handlecollections for a fee. It could be 25 to 33percent of the settlement. The biggestof these subrogation companies is Lou-isville, Kentucky-based Health CareRecoveries, Inc. Last year, Health CareRecoveries, Inc., of Louisville, whosebiggest customer, not surprisingly isUnited Health Care, recovered $226 mil-lion from its clients and its usual cutwas 27 percent. According to one former claims ex- aminer for HRI, Steve Pope, the com-pany is so intent on maximizing collec-tions that it crosses the line into ques-tionable perhaps. Take the case of 16-year-old Courtney Ashmore, who had been riding a four-wheeler on a country road near herhome by Tupelo, Mississippi. Theowner of the bordering land had strunga cable across the road. You guessed it.Courtney ran into it and almost cut offher head. Her family collected $100,000 from the property owner. Their health plan paid$26,000 for Courtney's medical care.Steve Pope, the claims examiner forHRI, that Louisville, Kentucky, com-pany, contacted the family's lawyerand wanted the $26,000 back. Well, the lawyer was no dummy. He asked for a copy of the contract show-ing the subrogation clause. Well, HRIcould not find a copy of the contract soMr. Pope was told by his supervisor atHRI to send out a page from a genericcontract that did have a subrogationclause in it, and later Mr. Pope foundout that Courtney's health plan didnot, in fact, mention subrogation. Still he has testified he was told to pursue the money anyway. Let me re-peat that. This employee of this com-pany in Louisville, Kentucky, theright-hand man company for UnitedHealth Care, was told to go after partCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7087 July 26, 2000 of this little girl's settlement even though they did not have a subrogationclause in the contract. Mr. Pope has testified, quote, these practices were so widespread and I justgot tired of being told to cheat andsteal from people, unquote. Mr. Speaker, the notion that sub- rogation should be prohibited or atleast restricted is gaining ground.Twenty-five States have adopted doc-trine that injured people get fully com-pensated before health plans, HMOs,can collect any share of personal injurymoney. In March, a Maryland appeals court went even further. It ruled that theState's HMO act prohibits managedcare companies from pursuing subroga-tion at all. The Court said, quote, anHMO by its definition provides healthcare services on a prepaid basis. A sub-scriber has no further obligation be-yond his or her fee, unquote. So what did the Senate GOP bill do to address this problem with subroga-tion? Did the Senate GOP bill try tomake the system more fair for pa-tients? Did it protect those State lawswhich are being passed to prevent sub-rogation abuses by HMOs? Oh, no, Mr.Speaker. The Senate GOP bill goeseven further than subrogation in pro-tecting HMOs. It says that the totalamount of damages to a patient likeJim Ridler or Steve DeGarmo or Ash-ley Courtland could be reduced by theamount of care costs whether theyhave a subrogation clause in their con-tract or not. In other words, the Senate GOP bill passed a few weeks ago would precludeState laws being passed on subrogationentirely, and over in the Senate theysay, oh, we are for States' rights; we donot want to take away the Statesrights to regulate insurance? And intheir bill they do exactly that. If that were not enough of a sop to the HMO industry, the Nickels bill saysthat the reduction in the award wouldbe determined in a pretrial proceeding. ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GREEN of Wisconsin). The Chair will caution the gentleman that it is not inorder to characterize Senate action orto otherwise cast reflection on the Sen-ate. Mr. GANSKE. In talking about other legislation on Capitol Hill, the bill thatpassed a couple of weeks ago says thatthe reduction in the award would be de-termined in a pretrial proceeding andthat any evidence regarding this reduc-tion would be inadmissible in a trialbetween the injured patient and theHMO. Well, what does that mean? Well, let us say that one is hit by a drunk driverwhile crossing the street and one'sHMO subsequently refuses to pay fornecessary physical therapy eventhough these are covered servicesunder one's employer plan. So one files two separate lawsuits, one against the drunk driver in theState court and the other against theHMO in the Federal court because the HMO is not treating one fairly. Let us say the civil case against the drunk driver is delayed because crimi-nal charges are prevailing against him.If the Federal case, the one against theHMO, proceeds to trial under the billthat passed a couple of weeks ago, theFederal judge would have to guess howmuch a State jury would award one,and the Federal judge would have noway of knowing what one actuallycould collect. This collateral source damages rule would leave patients uncompensatedfor very real injuries. For example, ifone is injured in a car accident by an-other driver who has a $50,000 insurancepolicy but one has medical costs of$100,000 that one's HMO refuses tocover, when one goes to collect the$50,000 from the negligent driver theymight get nothing. Why? Becausewhether one has brain damage or bro-ken legs or one's loved one is dead, onegets nothing because under the billthat passed a couple of weeks ago theHMO gets to collect all $50,000, eventhough it denied one necessary medicalcare for their injuries and one does notget a penny. Mr. Speaker, bills that have passed in the other body that value the financialwell-being of HMOs more than the val-ues and well-being of the patient do notdeserve the name ``patient protection.'' We passed a strong bill in this House. That is what we should be working on.We can do better than what has beendone recently. The voters are watch-ing. Now, Mr. Speaker, the Congressional leadership is trying to limit damagesby putting $300,000 caps on awards.Many times I have stood on this floorand talked about a mother, for in-stance, who has been mistreated by herHMO and lost her life. I want to ask, isthat mother's life worth $350,000? How many times have I stood on this floor talking about a little boy in At-lanta, Georgia, whose HMO was respon-sible for his losing both of his handsand both of his feet, the rest of his life,no hands, no feet? And they want toput a cap of $350,000 on that? That lit-tle boy, when he grows up and getsmarried, will never be able to touch theface of the woman that he loves withhis hand. I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but that is a travesty. People who put those kindof provisions in bills that deal with pa-tient protection should be ashamed ofthemselves. THE RESULTS OF TOBACCO , A TOUGH PRICE TO PAY Mr. GANSKE. Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to move on to another topic, anumber one public health problem. Ithink that HMO patient protection isvery important, but the reason thatthis House is out tonight is because weare having the Congressional baseballgame. I think that is a good thing, alittle bit of bipartisanship, have a nicecompetition, but I will say what isgoing on on that baseball field rightnow. There are colleagues of ours that are chewing tobacco, and they are spit-ting that tobacco out there and thereare a bunch of little kids that are inthat audience and they are looking atdad out there chewing and spittingthat tobacco and they are thinking,boy, that is kind of a neat thing. There are over 1 million high school boys in this country who chew tobacco.They probably watch some of the base-ball stars do it. They certainly havebeen enticed to do it by the tobaccocompanies. Before I came to Congress, I was a re- constructive surgeon and I can sayabout some of the patients that I tookcare of who chewed that tobacco, whoended up with cancer of their gums andcancer of their jaw and I had to removetheir lower jaws, and they ended uplike Andy Gump, cannot talk right, ifat all. They end up breathing through ahole in their windpipe. That is a stiffprice to pay for watching somebodychewing tobacco that one respects. Mr. Speaker, more than 400,000 people die prematurely each year from dis-eases attributable to tobacco use in theUnited States alone. Tobacco really isthe Grim Reaper. More people die eachyear from tobacco use in this countrythan die from AIDS, automobile acci-dents, homicide, suicides, fires, alcoholand illegal drugs combined. More people in this country die in one year from tobacco than all the sol-diers killed in all of the wars that thiscountry has fought. Treatment of these diseases will con- tinue to drain over $800 million fromthe Medicare Trust Fund. The VAspends more than one half billion dol-lars annually on inpatient care ofsmoking-related diseases, but thesevictims of nicotine addiction are sta-tistics that have names and faces. Mr. Speaker, about a month or two ago I was talking to a vascular surgeon who is a friend of mine in Des Moines,Iowa. He looked pretty tired. I said,``Bob, you must be working pretty hardthese days.'' He said, ``Greg, yesterday I went to the operating room at about 7:00 in themorning. I operated on three patients.I finished up about midnight and everyone of those patients I had to operateon to save their legs.'' I said, ``Were they smokers, Bob?''He said, ``You bet. And the last one that I operated on was a 38-year-oldwoman who would have lost her leg toarteriosclerosis caused by heavy to-bacco use.'' I said, ``Bob, what do you tell those people?'' He said, ``Greg, I talk to every pa- tient, every peripheral vascular patientthat I have, and I try to get them tostop smoking. I ask them a question, Isay, if there were a drug available onthe market that they could buy thatwould help save their legs, that wouldhelp prevent them from having coro-nary artery bypass surgery, that wouldsignificantly decrease their chances ofhaving lung cancer or losing their lar-ynx, would they buy that drug?''CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7088 July 26, 2000 b1915 Every one of those patients say, you bet I would buy that drug and I wouldspend a lot of money for it. Do my col-leagues know what he says to those pa-tients then, my friend, the vascularsurgeon? He says, well, you knowwhat? You can save an awful lot ofmoney by quitting smoking, and it willdo exactly the same thing as that mag-ical drug would have done. Mr. Speaker, my mom and dad were both heavy smokers, and they are onlyalive today because coronary arterybypass surgery saved their lives; andthey have finally stopped smoking. Iwill never forget some patients that Itook care of in the VA hospital. Theyhad a disease called thromboangitisobliterans. Now, I have talked about this on the floor a couple of times in the past, andwe got some phone calls from constitu-ents. They said, what are you talkingabout? I have never heard of this dis-ease. Well, this is a disease that reallyhappens, and I really took care of thispatient I am about to describe. Basi-cally, these people are addicted to to-bacco, and it sets up sort of an allergicreaction to the small vessels in theirfingers, in their hands, and in theirfeet, and those vessels clot off, theythrombose, and they start to lose onefinger after another. I remember taking care of one pa- tient who had lost both lower legs, hehad lost all of the fingers in one hand, and he only had one finger left on hisright hand, all due to that diseasecaused by his tobacco addiction. Do mycolleagues know what he had done? Hehad a little wire loop made that hecould put one loop over his one remain-ing finger and then a nurse or some-body, a friend, could stick a cigarettein the loop at the other end of thatwire and then he could smoke. He knewthat he could stop that disease fromprogressing and taking his fingers andhis hand and his feet if he would juststop smoking. Mr. Speaker, he could not. Tobacco is one of the most addicting substancesthat we know of, nicotine and tobacco,we know that. It is as addicting as co-caine; it is as addicting as morphineand heroin. Statistics show the magnitude of this problem. Over a recent 8-year period,tobacco use by children increased 30percent. More than 3 million Americanchildren and teenagers now smokecigarettes. Every 30 seconds, a child inthe United States becomes a regularsmoker. The sad fact is, Mr. Speaker,that each day, 3,000 kids in this coun-try start smoking. Each day. And 1,000of those kids will die of a disease re-lated to smoking tobacco. So why did it take a life-threatening heart attack to get my folks to quitsmoking? I nagged at them all thetime. It took that near-death experi-ence to get them to quit. Why wouldmy patient with that one finger notquit smoking? Why do fewer than onein seven adolescents quit smoking,even though 70 percent regret starting?I say to my colleagues, it is sadly be- cause of that addictive nature of thedrug nicotine that is in tobacco. Theaddictiveness of tobacco has becomepublic knowledge in recent years as aresult of painstaking scientific re-search that demonstrates that nicotineis similar to amphetamines, cocaine,and morphine. In fact, Mr. Speaker,there is a higher percentage of addic-tion among tobacco users than amongusers of cocaine or heroin; and recenttobacco industry deliberation showthat the tobacco industry knew aboutthis a long time ago. Those tobaccoCEOs who testified before Congressraised their right hands and took anoath to tell the truth. When they testi-fied that tobacco was not addicting,they were committing perjury, Mr.Speaker. Internal tobacco company documents dating back to the early 1960s showthat tobacco companies knew of theaddicting nature of nicotine, but theywithheld those studies from the Sur-geon General. A 1978 Brown &Williamson memo stated that very fewcustomers are aware of the effects ofnicotine, i.e., its addictive nature andthat nicotine is a poison. A 1983 Brown& Williamson memo stated that nico-tine is the addicting agent in ciga-rettes. Indeed, the industry knew thatthere was a threshold dose of nicotinenecessary to maintain addiction. A 1980 Lorilard document summa- rized the goals of an internal task forcewhose purpose was not to avert addic-tion, but to maintain addiction. It said,``Determine the minimal level of nico-tine that will allow continued smok-ing. We hypothesize that below somevery low nicotine level, diminishedphysiological satisfaction cannot becompensated for by psychological sat-isfaction. At that point, smokers willlearn to quit or return to higher tarand nicotine brands.'' Mr. Speaker, we also know that for the past 30 years, the tobacco industrymanipulated the form of nicotine inorder to increase the percentage of``free base'' nicotine delivered to smok-ers as a naturally occurring base; and Ihave to say, Mr. Speaker, this takesme back to medical school, bio-chemistry. Nicotine favors the saltform at its lower PH levels, and thefree base form at its higher levels. So what does that mean? Well, the free base nicotine crosses the alveoli inthe lungs faster than the bound form,thus giving the smoker a greater kick,just like the druggie who free bases co-caine, and the tobacco companies knewthat very well. In 1966, British American Tobacco, BAT, reported, ``It would appear thatthe increased smoker response is asso-ciated with nicotine reaching the brainmore quickly. On this basis, it appearsreasonable to assume that the in-creased response of a smoker to thesmoke with a higher amount of ex-tractable nicotine, not synonymouswith, but similar to free-based nico-tine, may be either because this nico-tine reaches the brain in a different chemical form, or because it reachesthe brain more quickly.'' Tobacco industry scientists were well aware of the effect of PH on absorptionand on the physiological response. In1976, RJR reported, ``Since the unboundnicotine is very much more activephysiologically and much faster actingthan bound nicotine, the smoke in PHseems to be strong in nicotine.'' There-fore, the amount of free nicotine insmoke may be used for at least a par-tial measure of the physiologicstrength of the cigarette. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, Philip Morris commenced the use of ammonia intheir Marlboro brand in the 1960s inorder to raise the PH of its cigarettes,and it subsequently emerged as theleading brand. So, by reverse engineering, the other manufacturers caught on to PhilipMorris's nicotine manipulation, andthey copied it. The tobacco industryhid the fact that nicotine was an ad-dicting drug for a long time, eventhough they privately called cigarettes``nicotine delivery devices.'' Claude E. Teague, assistant director of research at RJR said in a 1972 memo,``In a sense, the tobacco industry maybe thought of as being a specialized,highly ritualized and stylized segmentof the pharmaceutical industry. To-bacco products uniquely contain anddeliver nicotine, a potent drug with avariety of physiologic effects. Thus, atobacco product is, in essence, a vehi-cle for the delivery of nicotine designedto deliver the nicotine in a generallyacceptable and attractive form. Our in-dustry is then based upon the design,manufacture, and sale of attractiveforms of nicotine.'' Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. D REIER .) Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman for allow-ing me to take this time to congratu-late him on his effort. While our Re-publican colleagues are at this pointout working on a stunning victory overour Democratic colleagues on the base-ball field, the Committee on Rules ishard at work; and I know my friendfrom Iowa is working hard too, and Ithank him. Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, I have a bill before Congress that would basi-cally allow the FDA to prevent the to-bacco companies from marketing andtargeting children. It is not a tax in-crease bill, it is not a prohibition bill,it simply addresses the SupremeCourt's decision which says, Congressmust give the FDA authority for theFDA to regulate, to issue regulationsthat would prevent tobacco companiesfrom marketing and targeting kids. Wehave 95 bipartisan cosponsors on thatbill. Mr. Speaker, I want to continue on about tobacco, because I came acrossan article in the July 31 issue of News-week magazine, and it is entitled ``BigTobacco'S Next Legal War.'' I wantedto bring this to the attention of myCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7089 July 26, 2000 colleagues. I sit on the Committee on Commerce, and we held hearings on to-bacco a couple years ago when SenatorM CCAIN had his tobacco bill out- standing and we were looking at a to-bacco bill here in the House. The to-bacco companies said, if you raise thetax on tobacco, that will create a blackmarket, and a lot of smuggling and il-legal activities, i.e., look at what hap-pened in Canada. Well, since that testimony, it turns out that it was the tobacco companieswho were involved in the smuggling.This is an amazing story. I would high-ly recommend it to my colleagues. It iscalled ``Tobacco's Next War,'' News-week magazine, July 31. I just need toread a few of the excerpts from this ar-ticle. This is a quote from the article: ``For cigarette salesman Leslie Thompson,1993 was an especially good year. A staremployee with Northern Brands Inter-national, a tiny 4-person export outfitowned by the tobacco giant RJR Na-bisco, Thompson sold an astonishing 8billion cigarettes that year, reapingabout $60 million in profits. Walkingthe company's halls, Thompson re-ceived a standing ovation from RJR ex-ecutives who had gotten hefty bonusesas a result of his work. On his wrist heflashed a Rolex, a gift from gratefulwholesalers.'' ``These days, Thompson's name is no longer greeted with applause in the to-bacco industry. He and other formerexecutives are soon to be quizzed byFederal prosecutors about the shadyside of the cigarette business. News-week has learned that a Federal grandjury in North Carolina is investigatingexplosive allegations about links be-tween major cigarette makers andglobal smuggling operations that movevast quantities of cigarettes acrossborders without paying any taxes. It isa multibillion-dollar-a-year enterprise. ``The grand jury deliberations spot- light a new round of legal troubles forbig tobacco. The proceedings are secretand it could not be learned which com-panies are under scrutiny. The U.S. At-torney in Raleigh, North Carolina de-clined to comment. Cigarette makersare under attack from governmentsaround the world that seek to holdthem responsible for the costs of smug-gling: billions in lost taxes, soaring vi-olence, and weakened efforts to preventkids from smoking.'' b1930 Last week, the European Union an- nounced that it plans to launch a civilsuit against U.S. cigarette makers fortheir alleged involvement in smug-gling. In the last 8 months, Canada, Co-lombia, and Ecuador have all filedsmuggling suits against American to-bacco companies using U.S. anti-rack-eteering laws. Britain, Italy, China have also mounted extensive investigations. TheCanadian and European investigatorsare cooperating closely with their U.S.counterparts building a case againstthe industry. The World Bank and World Health Organization plan to re-lease the results of the 3-year inves-tigation claiming the tobacco industryhas deliberately thwarted inter-national efforts to control the tobaccotrade. In the United States, Thompson is expected to be an important witness inthe Grand Jury proceedings. In Feb-ruary, he began serving a 6-year sen-tence in Federal prison after pleadingguilty to money laundering related tothe smuggling case. American and Canadian prosecutors charged that Thompson racked up hisimpressive sales numbers through hisinvolvement with smugglers whoshipped billions of RJR cigarettes intoCanada. On the books, everythinglooked legitimate. But once over theborder, the cigarettes were passed onto black marketers, evading high Cana-dian cigarette taxes. Investigators believe this soft-spoken 52-year-old family man was merely abit player in the global smugglingscene. Before his sentencing and inpress interviews before he went to pris-on, he said he operated with the knowl-edge and encouragement of his superi-ors. His case has given prosecutors a road map of how the underground tradeworks. His company MBI was locatedinside R.J. Reynolds' Winston Salem,North Carolina headquarters. To thepublic Thompson's job was to sell Ex-port A's, a leading Reynolds brand inCanada. But the Canadian governmentcharges MBI was nothing more than ashell company that supplied smugglerswith cigarettes. According to court documents and Thompson's own testimony, Thompsonshipped millions of cartons of ExportA's from Canada and Puerto Rico tothe United States where virtually noone smokes them. The crates were thendiverted to a Mohawk reservation onthe U.S.-Canadian border, the secretstaging ground for the operation. Smugglers on the reservation built huge warehouses to stockpile the ciga-rettes. After dark, a flotilla of speedboats would ferry the cargo across theSaint Lawrence River to the Canadianside of the reservation. The cigaretteswere then sold on the black market,skirting Canada's cigarette taxes. In 1994, Canadian politicians were so horrified by the brazenness of the lawbreakers that the government rolledback the cigarette taxes, and thatslowed down the smuggling. MBI worked out a plea bargain with U.S. prosecutors and paid $15 million in fines and forfeitures. In a related Cana-dian proceeding against Thompson, theprosecutors made it clear that he be-lieved that the tobacco company hadhung its former employee out to dry.In other words, he was a little guy, sohe was going to get the 6-year term injail while his superiors who knew aboutthose tobacco CEOs for RJR, theyskate free with their big bonuses. ``Thompson was not on a lark of his own here, he told the court. He did notcommit this crime by himself. His acts were part and parcel of a corporatestrategy developed largely by othersenior executives who closely mon-itored his work.'' We then have reports in the British press that have focused attention onthe alleged role of British-Americantobacco in foreign smuggling oper-ations drawing on internal companydocuments recently made public. The British House of Commons, the equivalent of our House of Representa-tives, has recommended that the Brit-ish government launch a formal inves-tigation into the allegations. One set ofdocuments highlighted by English anti-smoking groups they say indicates thatthe company went out of its way to billmarket share by encouraging smug-gling. Those pages, culled from vast ar- chives, suggest that the company wasaware of just how many of its owncigarettes were being smuggled. The1993 through 1997 marketing plan forone of BAT's key subsidiaries includedprojected profits from what are called``general trade'' cigarettes. These arecigarettes where taxes are not paid onthem. The document describes plans to ``grow our business'' in ``general trade''countries, including China and Viet-nam where most foreign-made ciga-rettes are illegal. Anti-smoking activists say that gen- eral trade is industry jargon for smug-gled cigarettes. Another BAT docu-ment they focus on suggests that thecompany closely monitored the smug-gling of its brands. Records show ittracking how cigarettes entered Viet-nam ``from sailors, 40 percent; fromfisherman, 25 percent; from smugglingby sea, 35 percent.'' Mr. Speaker, Mr. Thompson was the first to go to jail, but given all theheavy guns trained on the industry, Idoubt that he will be the last. I would ask this of my colleagues, es- pecially my colleagues and the chair-man of the Committee on Commerceon which I sit, we have ample evidencethat the tobacco companies have beensmuggling cigarettes and breaking thelaw. It is time for the oversight com-mittee of the Committee on Commerceto hold a full-scale investigation intothis corrupt practice, another exampleof how tobacco companies have notreally shot straight with the Americanpublic. Mr. Speaker, I have talked briefly to- night about patient protection legisla-tion, something we need to get done be-fore we recess, a piece of legislation modeled after what passed the House.Neither the gentleman from Georgia(Mr. N ORWOOD ), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. D INGELL ), nor I who wrote the bill that passed with 275votes have ever said that it has to beevery word our way or the highway. Wehave never said that. We have alwayssaid that we would be willing to sitdown and try to achieve a compromise. Unfortunately, the Speaker of this House decided not to appoint to theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0 HOUSE H7090 July 26, 2000 conference committee the two Repub- licans, the gentleman from Georgia(Mr. N ORWOOD ) and myself, who wrote the bill that passed this House with 275votes, thus precluding our efforts totry to achieve a compromise to get astrong piece of legislation passed. Butwe are still available, and we are stillworking. I actually am optimistic about the chances of getting true patient protec-tion legislation passed because, as Ilook at the vote in the Senate, I thinkwe now have 50 supporters plus for thebill that passed this House. I expectthat, when that bill comes up again inthe Senate after the August recess, wevery well may see that the bill thatpassed the House with 275 votes alsopasses the Senate, and I am sure thePresident will sign that. On the matter of tobacco, I see very little movement in the House eventhough the gentleman from Michigan(Mr. D INGELL ) and I have 95 cosponsors for a bill that would simply allow theFDA the authority to regulate an ad-dicting substance, as I said, not to in-crease taxes and not to prohibit thesubstance, but to make sure that thosetobacco companies which have mar-keted and targeted kids 14 and youngercannot get away with that in the fu-ture. Well, I remain optimistic that, as we continue to work on these issues, wewill make progress. I sincerely thankall of my colleagues from both sides ofthe aisle who have shown so much in-terest in actually achieving true andreal reform legislation in both of theseareas. f REPORT ON RESOLUTION PRO- VIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OFH.R. 4865, SOCIAL SECURITY BEN-EFITS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2000 Mr. DREIER (during the Special Order of Mr. G ANSKE ), from the Com- mittee on Rules, submitted a privi-leged report (Rept.

The acting majority leader, Senator A LLARD , is recognized. SCHEDULE Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morn-ing business until 10:15 a.m. with Sen-ators D URBIN and C OLLINS in control of the time. Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the Treasury and general government ap-propriations bill. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will begin 30 hours of postcloture debate. If cloture is not in-voked, the Senate will proceed to a sec-ond vote on the motion to proceed to the intelligence authorization bill. Again, if cloture is invoked on the mo-tion, postcloture debate will begin im-mediately. As a reminder, on Thursday the morning hour has been set aside for those Senators who wish to make their final statements in remembrance of the life of our former friend and col-league, Senator Paul Coverdell. At the expiration of that time, a vote on the motion to proceed to the energy and water appropriations bill will occur. I thank my colleagues for their at- tention. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. A LLARD ). Without objection, it is so or- dered. f RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. f MORNING BUSINESS The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be a period for the transaction of morning business for debate only, except for a motion to proceed made by the major-ity leader or his designee and the filing of a cloture motion thereon. Senators will be permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. Under the pre-vious order, there should be 20 minutes under the control of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. D URBIN , or his designee, and under the previous order there should be 20 minutes under the control of the Senator from Maine, Ms. C OL- LINS, or her designee. The Senator from Illinois. f LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am certain those who were observing the Senate Chamber yesterday and perhaps the day before are curious as to why absolutely nothing is happening. It re-flects the fact that there is no agree-ment between the parties as to how to proceed on the business of the Senate, particularly on the appropriations bills. At this moment in time negotiations are underway, and hopefully they will be completed successfully very soon. At issue is the number of amendments to be offered, the time for the debate, and some tangential but very impor-tant issues such as the consideration of appointments of Federal district court judges across America to fill vacancies. These judgeships have been a source of great controversy in recent times be-cause there is a clear difference of opinion between Democrats and Repub-licans about how many judges should be appointed this year. Of course, the Republicans in control of the Senate are hopeful that their candidate for President will prevail in November and that all of the vacancies can then be filled by a Republican President. That is understandable. The Democrats, on the other hand, in the minority in the Senate, have a Presi-dent who has the authority to appoint these judges and wants to exercise that VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7588 July 26, 2000 authority in this closing year. Therein lies the clash in confrontation. Historically, the last time the tables were turned and there was a Repub-lican President and a Democratic Sen-ate, President Ronald Reagan had 60 Federal district court judges appointed in the election year. In fact, there were hearings on some of them as late at September of that year. This year, we have had about 30 appointed and we have many more vacancies, many more pending. We are hopeful, on the Demo-cratic side, these will be filled. Those on the Republican side are adamant that they do not want to bring them up. I hope they will reconsider that and at least give Democrats the same con-sideration we offered President Reagan when he faced a Democratic Senate with many Federal district court va-cancies. The other item of business which consumed our attention over the last week or two related to tax relief. It is an interesting issue and one that many Members like to take back home and discuss; certainly most American fami-lies, regardless of whether they are rich or poor, desire some reduction in their tax burden. The difference of opinion between the Democrats and Republicans on this issue is very stark. There is a consider-ation on the Republican side that tax relief should go to those who pay the most. Of course, those who pay the most taxes are, in fact, the wealthiest in this country. We have a progressive tax system. We have had it for a long time. We believe if one is fortunate enough to be successful, those tax-payers owe something back to this country. Those who are more success-ful owe more back to this country. You can't take blood from a turnip; you can't put a high tax rate on a person with a low income. But you can cer-tainly say to a successful person: We ask you to contribute back to America. We ask you, in the payment of taxes, to help maintain this great Nation which has given you, your family, and your business such a wonderful oppor-tunity. The Republican program from the start, as long as I have served in Con-gress, has always been to reduce the tax burden on those who are the wealthiest in this country. I happen to believe the tables should be turned and we should have a situation where those who are in the lower income groups and middle-income families who are struggling to make ends meet should be the ones most deserving of tax re-lief. That is a difference in philosophy, a difference between the parties, and is reflected very clearly in the debate we have had over the last 2 weeks. This is a chart which I have been bringing to the floor on a regular basis. Some House Republicans told me this morning that they are tired of seeing my chart. They are going to have to get a little more exhausted because I am going to produce it again today. This chart outlines what happens with the Republican tax plans, with their idea of tax cuts. In the area of the estate tax, a tax is imposed on less than 2 percent of the American population. Of 2.3 million people who die each year, only 40,000 end up with any liability under the es-tate tax. It is a tax reserved for those who really have large estates that they have accumulated during a lifetime. There are exemptions that people can write off when it comes to the estate tax liability, and those exemptions are growing, as they should, to reflect the cost of living increases. By and large, the Republicans have proposed to do away with the tax com-pletely, so the very wealthiest of Americans who pay this tax would re-ceive the tax relief. What does it mean? On the Repub- lican plan, if you happen to be a person making over $300,000 a year in income\u2014 if my calculations are correct, that is about $25,000 a month in income\u2014the Republicans have suggested you need an annual tax cut of $23,000 as a result of their elimination of the estate tax. That boils down to close to $2,000 a month, for those making $25,000 a month, that the Republicans would send your way when it comes to tax re-lief. Most American income categories are people making between $40,000 and $65,000 a year. Under the Republican plan, if you happen to be with the vast majority of Americans paying taxes, you aren't going to notice this tax re-lief; $200 a year is what the Repub-licans offer to you. That comes down to $16 a month they are going to send your way. If you are in the highest in-come categories, you receive $2,000 a month; if you happen to be with the vast majority of Americans, you re-ceive $16 a month. That is the Republican view of the world. That is the Republican view of tax relief: If we are going to help peo-ple, for goodness' sake, let's help the wealthy feel their pain, understand the anxiety they must face in making in-vestments, in choosing locations for new vacation homes, and give them some tax relief. The fact is that 80 percent of Ameri- cans are making under $50,000 a year. For these Americans, $15 or $16 a month is something, but it is certainly not going to change their lifestyle. Mr. President, 26 percent of Ameri- cans make between $50,000 and $100,000 a year. In those two categories of peo-ple under $100,000 a year and under $50,000 a year, we find the vast major-ity of American families, the over-whelming majority, and the people who will not benefit from the idea of tax re-lief propounded by the Republicans on the floor. They suggest to all American families they have them in mind when it comes to tax relief. The facts tell a different story. Look at what we have suggested in- stead. The Democrats think we have to be much more responsible in spending this Nation's surplus or investing. It wasn't that long ago we were deep in deficit with a national debt that accu-mulated to almost $6 trillion. Now we are at a point where we have a strong economy, families are doing better, businesses are doing better, people are making more money, and the tax reve-nues coming in reflect it. That surplus is what we are debating. We have gone from the days of the Reagan-Bush defi-cits to a new era where we are talking about a surplus and what we will do with it. Those who are younger in America should pay attention to this debate. If you are a young person in America, we are about to give you a very great na-tion. Our generation hopes to hand over as good a country as we found, perhaps even better, but we are also going to hand over to you a very great debt of $6 trillion. That debt we have to pay interest on. It is like a mortgage. You say to your children and grand-children: Welcome to America, wel-come to this land of opportunity, here's the debt you will have to pay. In the late 1980s and 1990s in America, the political leadership in this country accumulated a massive debt, starting with the election of President Reagan, then with President Bush, and for the first few years of President Clinton we continued to see this debt grow. We have turned the corner. Under the Clin-ton-Gore leadership, under the votes that have been cast by Democrats in Congress, we now have a stronger econ-omy. People have a right to ask, What are we going to do with the surplus? The Republican answer is: Tax cuts for wealthy people. The Democratic an-swer is much different: First, pay down the national debt. We can't guarantee the surplus will be here in a year, 2 years, or 10 years. If it is here, shouldn't it be our highest priority? Let's wipe off the debt of this country as best we can, reduce the burden on our children, invest in Social Security and in Medicare. This is not a wild-eyed idea. It is what Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve recommends. It is what major economists recommend. But you can-not sell it on the Republican side of the aisle. They think, instead, we should give tax cuts to the wealthy. We think we should bring down the national debt and invest in Social Se-curity and Medicare. If we are to have tax cuts, let us target these tax cuts to people who really need them, not the folks making over $300,000 a year. They are going to do quite well. They are going to have nice homes on islands off the coast of Maine. They are going to have places in Florida and California. They are going to have a very com-fortable life. But what about the people who live in Chicago? What about the people who live in Portland, ME? What about those who live in Philadelphia, PA? I would like to take to them this proposal, not to eliminate taxes on those making VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, SENATE S7589 July 26, 2000 over $300,000 a year but to say to work- ing families and middle-income fami-lies: Here are targeted tax cuts that you can use, that will help your life. Let's provide for a marriage tax pen-alty elimination for working families. Let's expand educational opportunities by making tuition costs tax deductible. Think about your concern of sending your son or daughter through college and the increasing cost of a college education. For a family who is strug-gling to try to make ends meet and to give their kids the best opportunity, to be able to deduct those college edu-cation expenses means an awful lot more to them than the comfort in knowing that Donald Trump does not have to pay estate taxes under the Re-publican proposal. That is the difference in our view of the world. The Republicans feel the pain of Donald Trump, that he might have to pay these estate taxes. We be-lieve that families across America face a lot more anxiety and pain over how to pay for college education expenses. We had a vote on the floor here, up or down, take your pick: Estate tax relief for Donald Trump or college deductions for the families working across Amer-ica. Sadly, the Republicans would not support the idea of college education expense deductions. Let's talk about caring for elderly parents. Baby boomers understand this. Everyone understands it. As your parents get older, they need special help. You are doing your best. I cannot tell you how many of my friends this affects. I am in that generation of baby boomers\u2014slightly older, I might add\u2014 but in a generation where a frequent topic of conversation for my age group is how are your mom and dad doing? The stories come back, and some of them are heartbreaking, about Parkin-son's and Alzheimer's and complica-tions with diabetes that lead to ampu-tations and people finally having to make the tough decision of asking their parents to consider living in a place where they can receive some as-sistance. It is expensive. We, on the Demo- cratic side, believe that helping to pay for those expenses the families endure because of aging parents is a good tax cut, one that is good for this country and good for the families. Not so on the Republican side. When we offered this, they voted against it. They would rath-er give estate tax relief to the wealthi-est people. How about child care? Everybody who got up this morning in America and headed to work and left a small child with a neighbor or at a day-care center understands that this is tugging at your mind constantly during the day. Is my child in safe hands? Is this a quality and positive environment for my child to be in? How much does it cost? Can we afford it? Can we do a lit-tle better? We, on the Democratic side, think we ought to help these families. They are working families who should have peace of mind. Senator D ODDoffered an amendment that proposed tax credits, not only for day care, but also tax credits for stay-at-home moms who de-cide they are going to forgo working, to stay with the children and try to raise them. We want to help in both of those circumstances. We think those are the real problems facing America. The Republicans instead believe that estate tax relief for the superrich is much more important. Expand the earned-income tax credit for the working poor, help families save for retirement, provide estate tax relief\u2014particularly to make sure that a family-owned farm or a family-owned business can be passed on to the next generation. I think the estate tax needs reform. We support that. We voted for it. But we think the Repub-lican proposal goes way too far in pro-posing we abolish it. I see my time is coming to a close. We think the agenda before this Con-gress is an agenda of missed opportuni-ties. The Republicans are in control in the House and Senate. They decide what will be considered on the floor, if anything. They have failed to bring forward commonsense gun safety legis-lation after Columbine, to try to keep guns out of the hands of kids and criminals. We passed it in the Senate with A LGORE's vote, sent it to the House\u2014the gun lobby killed it. We lose 30,000 Americans every year to gun vio-lence; 12 children every single day. For the Republicans, it is not a priority to bring this bill forward. The Patients' Bill of Rights, so your doctor can make the call on your med-ical treatment or your family's med-ical treatment\u2014most people think that is common sense. The insurance com-panies do not. They want their clerks to make the decision based on the bot-tom line of profit and loss. It is not a medical decision for them, it is a finan-cial decision. And for a lot of families it is disastrous when they cannot get the appropriate care for their kids and their families. We think a Patients' Bill of Rights makes sense. The insur-ance lobby opposed it. The insurance lobby prevailed. The special interest groups won on the floor and we have gone nowhere with this proposal. Minimum wage: $5.15 an hour for a minimum wage that affects some 10 million workers across America. It is about time for a pay raise. These folks deserve to do better. It used to be bi-partisan. We didn't even argue about it. Now the Republicans say: No, no no, we can't give a 50-cent-an-hour pay raise to people making $5.15 an hour. Do you realize that 50 cents an hour comes out to, what, $1,000 a year that we will give these people? Yet we are going to turn around and give Donald Trump a $400 million tax break on his estate? You cannot give working families a thousand bucks a year, but you can give the one of the superrich $400 million tax relief? Is something upside-down in this Cham-ber? I think so. Take a look at the prescription drug benefit. Ask Americans\u2014Democrats, Republicans, and Independents\u2014the one thing we ought to do this year? A guaranteed universal prescription drug benefit under Medicare. The pharma-ceutical companies oppose it. They are pretty powerful characters in this town. They have stopped this Senate and this House from considering it. Here we are, languishing, doing noth-ing, when it comes to a prescription drug benefit. Finally, something for our schools. Seven million kids in America attend schools with serious safety code viola-tions; 25,000 schools across our country are falling down. Are we going to be ready for the 21st century? Will our kids be ready? Will our workforce be ready? You can answer that question by deciding at this point in time whether education is truly a priority and, if it is such a priority, then for goodness' sakes we should invest more than 1 percent of our Federal budget in K-12 education. That is what we invest. The Democrats, under the leadership of Senator K ENNEDY , believe that invest- ment is overdue. We think that is what families in America are looking for, not for tax relief for the wealthiest among us. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator's time has expired. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair. (The remarks of Ms. C OLLINS per- taining to the introduction of S. 2924 are located in today's R ECORD under ''Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I see that the Senate majority leader has come to the floor, so I yield to him. I thank the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. C HAFEE ). The Senate majority leader. Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her comments, her leadership on so many important issues in the Senate, and for yielding to me at this time so we may proceed. f ORDER OF BUSINESS Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, obviously I had hoped we would be making a lot more progress this week on appropria-tions bills and other issues. That has not transpired yet. But we have been filing cloture motions, and we will be getting votes. In some way we will deal this week with the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. I hope we can find a way to proceed on the en-ergy and water appropriations bill. We will get to a vote at some point on the intelligence authorization bill. So, hopefully, we can still go forward. I do not feel as if we are proceeding appropriately, but in spite of that, I think it generally was interpreted or understood that I would try to begin the discussion on the China PNTR bill. Even though it will be difficult to get through the maze of clotures we have VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7590 July 26, 2000 had to file this week, I still think it is the appropriate thing to do to begin this process because we do not know exactly how long it will take to get to a final vote on the China trade issue. I am still going to do my best to find a way to have the Thompson-Torricelli legislation considered in some manner before we get to the substance of the China trade bill because I think Chi-nese nuclear weapons proliferation is a very serious matter. We should discuss that and have a vote on it. I think it would be preferable to do it aside from the trade bill itself. In the end, if we can't get any other way to get at it, these two Senators may exercise their right to offer it to the China PNTR bill. But I am going to continue to try to find a way for that to be offered in another forum. I think Senator D ASCHLE indicated he would work with us to try to see if we could find a way to do that. But I do think if we can go ahead and get started\u2014and since there will be resistance to the motion to proceed\u2014then we will file cloture and have a vote on it then on Friday. f NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\u2014MOTION TO PROCEED Mr. LOTT. So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 575, H.R. 4444, regarding normal trade relations with the Peo-ple's Republic of China. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. REID. Objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec- tion is heard. Mr. LOTT. I am sorry there is objec- tion just to proceeding to the bill. But I know that Senator R EIDis objecting on behalf of others who do not want us to proceed to it. I hope we can get to a vote on Friday; and then when we come back in September this will be an issue we can go to soon rather than later in the month. CLOTURE MOTION I move to proceed to the bill. So I make that motion to proceed at this time, and I send a cloture motion to the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clo- ture motion having been presented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: CLOTURE MOTION We the undersigned Senators, in accord- ance with the provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the mo-tion to proceed to calendar No. 575, H.R. 4444, a bill to authorize extension of nondiscrim-inatory treatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the People's Republic of China: Trent Lott, Pat Roberts, Larry E. Craig, Christopher Bond, Chuck Grassley, Ted Stevens, Connie Mack, Orin Hatch, Frank H. Murkowski, Wayne Allard, Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Don Nickles, Bill Roth, Michael Crapo, Slade Gor-ton, and Craig Thomas. Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this clo- ture vote will occur on Friday, unless consent can be granted to conduct the vote earlier or we are in a postcloture situation on the Treasury-Postal Serv-ice appropriations bill. There is opposi-tion, obviously, to this motion to pro-ceed. But I still think that adequate time can be used for discussion. I know there are a number of Senators who would like to see this vote occur on Thursday instead of Friday. I am will-ing to accommodate that. But if that cannot be worked out, then we will have the vote on Friday. If we are in a postcloture situation, the vote could be postponed for some time. But I ask unanimous consent that the manda-tory quorum be waived. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LOTT. I now withdraw the mo- tion to proceed. I believe I have that right. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator has that right. The motion is withdrawn. Mr. LOTT. In conclusion, while we seek Utopia in dealing with these ap-propriations bills, the promised land of how we can work together to do the people's business, which we are not doing right now, at least in the case of this bill, I believe we will have broad bipartisan support for the China PNTR bill. I might add, there is going to be some bipartisan opposition, too. So as we get into the substance of this\u2014which I would rather be getting into rather than having to once again file cloture on a motion to proceed\u2014I think we will have a good debate. I think it is going to serve the Senate well. I think it will serve the American people well. I believe when we do fi-nally get to a vote, it will pass\u2014and probably should. But there are a lot of serious questions still involved in how we are going to deal with China. So I look forward to this discussion. Mr. President, I yield the floor. f TREASURY AND GENERAL GOV- ERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001\u2014MOTION TO PROCEED\u2014Re-sumed The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: CLOTURE MOTION We the undersigned Senators, in accord- ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the mo-tion to proceed to calendar number 704, H.R. 4871, a bill making appropriations for the Treasury Department, the United States Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain independent agencies, for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes: Trent Lott, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Pat Roberts, Richard G. Lugar, Jesse Helms, Jeff Sessions, Larry E. Craig, Jon Kyl, Craig Thomas, Don Nickles, Strom Thurmond, Michael Crapo, Mitch McConnell, Fred Thompson, Judd Gregg, and Ted Stevens. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unan- imous consent, the mandatory quorum call under the rule has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 4871, an act making appropriations for the Treasury Department, the United States Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain Independent Agencies, for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are required under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. T HOMAS ) is necessarily absent. Mr. REID. I announce that the Sen- ator from New Jersey (Mr. T ORRICELLI ) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(The remarks of Senator T HURMOND pertaining to the introduction of S. 2925 are located in today's R ECORD under ''Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7591 July 26, 2000 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I take a few moments following this cloture vote to talk about the appropriations bill and a couple of related matters to that bill that are to be brought to the Senate floor. We are completing the last week of the legislative session be-fore the August break. When we come back following the August break, we will have a number of weeks in Sep-tember and a couple of weeks in Octo-ber, perhaps, at which time the 106th Congress will be history. We will have an election in early No- vember, something that the late Con-gressman Claude Pepper, a wonderful public servant, used to call one of the miracles of democracy. He said: Every even numbered year, our Constitution provides that the American people grab the steering wheel and decide in which direction this country moves. He said it was one of the miracles of democ-racy. Indeed it is. We are headed to-ward an election. That will affect the Senate schedule. That means it is like-ly the Senate will complete its work, the Congress will complete its work, in the 106th Congress by the middle of Oc-tober. As we look to that moment, we have a lot of work to do between now and then. We have appropriations bills to complete. After all that, one of the fun-damental responsibilities we have is to provide for the funding of things we do together in government. We build our roads together. It doesn't make sense for each family to build their own road to the supermarket. It is called govern-ment. We come together and build a system of roads. We come together to build schools and maintain and operate schools in which the American people can send their children. It doesn't make sense for each and every person to build their own school. So we have roads and schools. Then we hire a po-lice force. We hire folks who will serve in the Armed Forces to defend our lib-erty and freedom. All of these things we do, and much more, as a part of our governing proc-ess. I am proud of much of what we do. Much of what we have accomplished in this country is a result of the inge-nuity of people in the private sector, in the market system, competing, the ge-nius of those who are willing to take risks and use ideas to build new prod-ucts and create new markets; on the other side, in the public sector, the vi-sion that has been exhibited by some who have served this country for many years to do the right things in the pub-lic sector, to do together what we should do to provide for our common defense and build our schools, build roads, and do those things that we know also make this a better country. One of the pieces of legislation we are intending to bring to the floor very soon is the Treasury-Postal appropria-tions subcommittee bill. That is through the full Appropriations Com-mittee in the Senate. It is legislation that will be, I hope, debated next on the Senate floor. The bill is through the full Appropriations Committee and includes funding for a wide range of things we do in this country. One of the larger portions of the bill is the funding for the Customs Service. The Customs Service is a very impor-tant element. Given the expanding na-ture of world trade, with the amount of commerce and goods and services mov-ing in and out of our country and across our borders, the Customs Serv-ice provides an ever increasing impor-tant service to our country. We fund the Internal Revenue Serv- ice which collects the revenue by which we fund most of the government serv-ices we have in this country. One of the areas of this legislation is the national youth antidrug media campaign. That campaign in the drug czar's office is now about 3 years old, and the Con-gress has been working on that dili-gently, as well. We have a number of issues in this legislation that are very important, that are timely, and that we need to get to the floor of the Senate to debate and try to make some decisions about them. Let me comment for a moment about a couple of issues that no doubt will be brought to the Senate floor on this bill. I will talk about why these issues are important and what I think will hap-pen with these issues. In the House of Representatives, when they wrote the legislation dealing with Treasury and general government in that sub-committee, that legislation included some amendments dealing with the subject of Cuba and the sanctions with respect to food and medicine that exist with respect to Cuba. I want to talk just a bit about that because those provisions are included in the House bill. We will undoubtedly have amendments on that same subject in the Senate bill. There will be a de-fense of germaneness on those amend-ments. I will offer one of those amend-ments. I believe my colleagues Senator D ODD, Senator R OBERTS , perhaps Sen- ator B AUCUS , and others will offer simi- lar amendments. I want to describe why this is an important issue and why the Senate should consider these amendments, especially inasmuch as these types of amendments are in the House bill coming over for consider-ation in conference. There are some bad actors inter- nationally who run governments in a way that is well outside the norm of international behavior. We understand that. Saddam Hussein is one of those leaders. There are others. We have watched the behavior and the activities of countries such as Cuba, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and others, and view with alarm some of the things that are hap-pening. Cuba is a country that is run, with a Communist government, by Fidel Cas-tro. North Korea is a relatively closed society run by a Communist govern-ment, a Communist dictator. Iran is a different kind of country, run by a group of folks who seem to operate\u2014at least they have for some while\u2014outside the norms of international behavior, engaged in an attempt to acquire so-phisticated missile technology. I sus-pect they and others on the list would love to acquire nuclear weapons. These are countries that have demonstrated by their behavior, by their actions, that they are operating outside the norms of what we consider acceptable behavior. I am talking now about the international community, the commu-nity of nations. So what do we do? What we do is we say to Saddam Hussein: We are going to impose economic sanctions on your country. These sanctions, in the form of either sanctions or an embargo, are an attempt to choke your economy and cause you economic pain. They cause you to understand when you operate outside the norms of international be-havior, when you are attempting to ac-quire nuclear weapons, chemical weap-ons, and biological weapons with which you can threaten your neighbors, we care about that and we intend to do something about that. We and other countries have imposed sanctions against the country of Iraq. We have had an embargo against the country of Cuba for some 40 years. It is a small country 90 miles off the tip of Florida. We have had an embargo for some 40 years against the country of Cuba, preventing goods from being shipped to Cuba, preventing Cuban goods from coming into our country, essentially trying to shut down their economy with that embargo. We have had similar sanctions against North Korea and Iran. One of the mistakes this country has made\u2014and a very serious mistake\u2014is deciding we will include food and medi-cine as a part of our economic sanc-tions. We should not have done that. This country should never have done that. This country is bigger and better than that. We should never use food as a weapon. We produce food in such abundant quality\u2014the best quality food in the world. We have farmers today who are out driving a tractor in some field somewhere, planting a seed and raising crops with great hope they will be able to make a living on their family farm. We produce such wonderful quality food in such abundance, and then we say to countries whose behavior we don't like: By the way, we are going to slap you with economic sanctions. We are going to put our fist around your economic throat, and included in that, we are going to prevent the movement of food in and out of your country. I am all for economic sanctions. There is not any reason to make life better for Saddam Hussein. He ought to pay a price for his behavior. But this country is shortsighted to believe that using food as a weapon is an advance-ment in public policy for us. It is not. First, it hurts our farmers who are pre-vented from moving food through the international markets. Second, it takes aim at a dictator and ends up VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7592 July 26, 2000 hitting hungry people. That is not the best of what this country has to offer. So we have a very simple propo- sition\u2014those of us who care about this issue. We say let's stop using food as a weapon; let us, as Americans, decide we shall never use food as a mechanism to try to punish others. We understand that Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro have never missed a meal. They have never missed breakfast, they have never missed dinner, never missed sup-per. They eat well. When we use food as a weapon, it is only poor people, sick people, and hungry people who pay a price; and of course, our farmers here in America also pay a price. So last year we had a debate about this. My colleague Senator A SHCROFT , I, Senators D ODD, ROBERTS , BAUCUS \u2014a range of people\u2014have offered amend-ments. Last year we had a vote, and 70 Senators said: No, we shall not any longer ever use food as a weapon. Let us lift the sanctions on food and medi-cine; 70 percent of the Senate said let's stop it. I cannot speak for all 70, but I will speak for myself to say it is immoral to have a public policy that uses food as a weapon. It is immoral to punish hungry, sick, and poor people around the world because we are angry at dic-tators. Seventy percent of the Senate said: Let's stop. Let's change the sanc-tions. We can continue some of the eco-nomic sanctions. We are not making a judgment about using economic sanc-tions to punish dictators or punish countries whose behavior is outside the international norm. We are saying, however, we should not any longer use food or medicine as a weapon or as part of the sanctions. So 70 percent of the Senate voted. It was on the Senate agricultural appro-priations bill, and off we marched to conference. I was one of the conferees. One of the first acts of conference be-tween the House and Senate was my of-fering an amendment insisting that the Senate retain its position. In other words, we were saying as a group of Senators who were conferees: We insist on our provision, lifting the sanctions on food and medicine. I offered the amendment in the con- ference. We had a vote of the Senate conferees, and my amendment carried. Therefore, the Senators at this con-ference with the House Members said: We insist on the provision. We insist on our policy of removing food and medi-cine as part of our economic sanctions. Guess what. A Member of the House moved that the conference adjourn. We adjourned. It was late one morning, and we never, ever returned to con-ference. Do you know why? Because the House leaders, the House leader-ship, did not like that provision and they intended to kill it. They knew they could not kill it with their con-ferees. If there were a vote on it in the conference, they would lose. If there were a vote on it on the floor of the House, they would lose. So the only way they could win was to hijack that conference, adjourn it, never come back into session, and throw the ingre-dients of that bill into a broader bill, and we never saw the light of day on our policy. The result is we are back on the floor right now and this country still has in place a policy of using food and medi-cine as part of our economic sanctions. It is wrong. It is wrong. Following that conference last year, I had the opportunity to go to Cuba. I have traveled some, in various parts of the world, and have seen that what we produce in such abundance, the world needs so desperately. The winds of hun-ger blow every minute, every hour, and every day all across this world. So many people die of hunger, malnutri-tion, and hunger-related causes, and so many of them are children\u2014every sin-gle day. I went to Cuba. What I saw was a country in collapse. It is a beautiful country with wonderful people. The city of Havana is a beautiful city, but in utter collapse. There are gorgeous buildings designed in the 1940s and 1950s by some of the best architects\u2014 beautiful architecture, in total dis-repair. The city is collapsing. The Cuban economy is in collapse. There is no question about that. I visited a hospital, and I saw a young boy lying in a coma. His mother was seated by his bedside holding his hand. This was in an intensive care ward of a Cuban hospital. This young boy in intensive care was not hooked up to any wires. There was no fancy gadgetry, no fancy equipment, no beeping that you hear in intensive care\u2014the beeping of equipment\u2014no, none of that. He was lying on his bed with his mother holding his hand. I asked the doctor, Do you not have equipment with which to monitor this young boy? He had a head injury and was in a coma. He said, Oh, no; they didn't have any of that equipment. They didn't even have any rudimentary equipment with which to make a diag-nosis. Intensive care was to lay this boy in a room. They told me they were out of 250 different kinds of medicine in that hospital. My point is this. The Cuban people do not deserve Fidel Castro\u2014that is for sure. They deserve a free and open country, a free and open economy; they deserve the liberties we have and the freedom we have. But 40 years of an embargo, and especially 40 years pre-venting the movement of food and medicine back and forth, surely makes no sense. It has not hurt Mr. Castro. It has hurt the poor people of Cuba and the hungry people of Cuba. It is time to change that policy. A year ago we tried it. Seventy percent of the Senate voted for it, and it has not happened. This is what we have done this year: I offered an amendment, with Senator G ORTON from the State of Washington, on the Agriculture appropriations bill that lifts the sanctions on food and medicine and also let's us do one other thing. It prevents any future President from ever including food and medicine as part of economic sanctions unless they come to the Senate and get a vote and the Senate says: Yes, we ought to do that. We do two things: We lift the sanc- tions on food and medicine that exist with those countries that are subject to our economic sanctions, and we pre-vent future Presidents from imposing sanctions and using food as a weapon. That is in the Agriculture appropria-tions bill which came to the floor of the Senate. The Senate passed that bill. My amendment is in it. We will go to conference. The only way we can lose that issue is if the House leaders hijack it once again. There is a member of the leader-ship of the House, whom I shall not name, who makes it his cause to derail us. He believes we ought to use food as a weapon, especially with respect to Cuba. He believes we ought not change the policy and will do everything he can to stop us. My colleague in the House who has been working on this passed some leg-islation that was negotiated with the House leadership, but it turns out the legislation, when one looks at the lan-guage, is a step backward, not a step forward. We will go to conference on the Agri- culture appropriations bill with my amendment in it, and I say to those who might pay attention to the Senate record from the House side, if the House leaders expect to hijack this once again this year, they are in for a long session because there is a group of us\u2014Republicans and Democrats\u2014who insist this country change its policy. This policy is wrongheaded and it must change. Yes, we have some people in the Sen- ate who are still fighting the cold war. We have people in the Senate\u2014not very many, I admit\u2014but we have a few peo-ple in the Senate who do not want this changed, but 70 percent of the Senate want this changed. At some point, if they get a full vote in the House and we have a full vote in the Senate, 70 percent of the Congress will say: Let's change this foolish policy. This policy is not the best of this country. This policy is wrong, and we aim to change it. Now we bring this bill to the floor of the Senate. We had a cloture vote on the motion to proceed today, and the Treasury-Postal bill will come to the floor at some point. As I indicated, in addition to the description of the amendment I offered to the Agriculture appropriations bill on the floor of the Senate dealing with sanctions on Cuba, a couple Members of the House applied some amendments, which were success-ful, to the Treasury-general govern-ment bill which means when our bill comes to the floor of the Senate, it will also attract these amendments. That is fine with me. Having them in two places is better than having them in one place. Perhaps one conference will be successful in changing this policy. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7593 July 26, 2000 My colleagues in the House added a piece of legislation, for example, deal-ing with travel in Cuba saying that no funds will be used to enforce the re-strictions on travel to Cuba. I prefer to do it a different way. Who is going to believe it makes sense to travel to Cuba if it is still illegal but they just will not enforce it? If we change travel, let's change travel. Let's not say you shall not enforce something that re-mains illegal. Let's say the travel re-strictions are lifted. Period. End of story. I hope my colleague who intends to offer that amendment in the Senate will consider doing that. We have other amendments as well, and I intend to offer an amendment dealing with food and medicine sanctions on Cuba on the Treasury-Postal bill when it is brought to the floor of the Senate. There is another issue I wish to talk about briefly that relates in some measure to this bill, but especially to the issue of the Customs Service and our borders and the issue of inter-national trade. I am going to talk in a bit about our trade problem because we have the largest trade deficit in the history of humankind. There is a lot right with this coun- try. There is a lot going on to give us reason to say thanks and hosanna. We have a wonderful economy. It is pro-ducing new jobs and new opportunity. All of the indices are right: unemploy-ment is down; home ownership is up; inflation is way down. All the things one expects to happen in a good econ-omy have been happening. Some parts of the country are left be- hind, such as rural areas. We have a farm program that is a debacle, and we cannot get anybody to even hold a hearing to change the farm program, but that is another story. There are some areas that have not kept pace with the prosperity. We need to continue to fight to write a better farm program and make sure those rural areas share in the full economic prosperity of America. There is a lot right in this country. This is a good economy. It is producing unprecedented opportunities. The one set of storm clouds above the horizon, however, is in international trade. We have a huge trade deficit. Our merchandise trade deficit was nearly $350 billion in 1999, and is pro-jected to exceed $400 billion this year. Put another way: We are buying $1 bil-lion more in goods from overseas than we are selling each and every day, 7 days a week. Some say: Does that matter? Is it im- portant? Gee, our economy is doing well. How on Earth can you make the case we should care about this? You can live in a suburb someplace and have a wonderful home with a huge Cadillac in the driveway and have all the evidence of affluence, but if it is all borrowed, you are in trouble. On the borrowing side, we have made a lot of progress dealing with Federal budget deficits. In fact, we have eliminated the Federal budget deficits, and good for us, but the deficits on the trade side have continued to mushroom, and we must get a handle on that as well and deal with our trade imbalance. What causes the trade imbalance, and what relevance does it have to this bill? In this bill, we fund the Customs Service, and the Customs Service eval-uates what comes in, what goes out, and they try to assist in the flow of goods moving back and forth across our borders. The fact is, they have an old, anti- quated computer system to take care of all of that and it is melting down. With expanded trade coming in and going out, we need a new system. The Customs Service has proposed a new system to accommodate and facilitate their needs. We need to fund it. It is very important we fund this system. It is called the Automated Commercial Environment or ACE system. We need to keep it operational, and we need to build it and make it work. In 1 day, the Customs Service proc- esses $8.8 billion in exports and im-ports. They have to keep track of it all: $8.8 billion in daily exports and im-ports; and 1.3 million passengers and 350,000 vehicles moving back and forth across our borders. Think of that. This is the agency that has the responsi-bility of keeping track of all of it\u2014 whose vehicle, when did it come in, when did it go out, who is coming in, who is leaving our country, what are the goods coming in, what kind of tar-iffs exists on those goods, who is send-ing them, who is receiving them. All of that is part of what we have to keep track of in terms of movement across our border. The current system that keeps track of all of that is nearly two decades old, and running at near capacity. It is the single most impor-tant resource in collecting duties and enforcing Customs laws and regula-tions. This system has been experiencing brownouts over the past months that have brought the Customs operation at these border ports, in some cases, to a dead halt. Over 40 percent of the Customs sta- tions are using work stations that are unreliable, are obsolete operating sys-tems, and are no longer supported by a vendor. Trade volume has doubled in 10 years. The rate of growth in trade is astronomical. The Customs Service an-ticipates an increase of over 50 percent in the number of entries by 2005. That means the current system just can't and will not handle it. So we have a responsibility to do something about that. If anybody won-ders whether all this trade is impor-tant, and keeping track of it is impor-tant, as I said, look at the trade deficit and look at what is happening in this country. From the standpoint of policy\u2014I was talking about the system that keeps track of it\u2014but from the standpoint of policy, we also have to make signifi-cant changes. We will not make them in this bill because this isn't where we do that, but you can't help but look at what is happening in our country and understand that our own trade policy does not work. It just does not work. We have a huge and growing trade deficit with China\u2014growing rapidly\u2014of nearly $70 billion a year. We have a large abiding trade deficit with Japan that has gone on forever\u2014$50 to $70 bil-lion a year. This Congress, without my vote\u2014be- cause I voted against it\u2014passed some-thing called NAFTA, the North Amer-ican Free Trade Agreement. It was billed as a nirvana. What a wonderful thing, we were told, if we can do a trade agreement with Mexico and Can-ada. What a great hemispheric trade agreement, and how wonderful it would be for our country. In fact, a couple of economists teamed together and said: If you just pass NAFTA, you will get 300,000 new jobs in the United States. The problem is, there is never accountability for economists. Economists say anything, any time, to anybody, and nobody ever goes back to check. The field of economics is psychology pumped up with helium and portrayed as a profession. I say that having taught economics a couple years in col-lege, but I have overcome that to do other things. But economists told us, if we pass NAFTA, it will be a wonderful thing for our country. Well, this Congress passed NAFTA. I didn't vote for it. Guess what. We had a trade surplus with Mexico. We have now turned a trade surplus with Mexico into a sig-nificant deficit with the country of Mexico. They said, by the way, if we pass NAFTA, the products that will come in from Mexico will be products produced by low-skilled labor. Not true. The products that are coming in from Mex-ico are the product of higher-skilled labor, principally automobiles, auto-mobile parts, and electronics. Those are the three largest imports into the United States from Mexico. So the economists were wrong. I would love to have them come back and parade around, and say: I said NAFTA would work, but I apologize. We had a trade surplus with Mexico. Now it is a fairly large deficit. We had a trade deficit with Canada, and we doubled the deficit. I want one person to stand up in the Senate and say: This is real progress. Doubling the deficit with Canada, and turning a surplus into a deficit with Mexico\u2014hooray for us. That is real progress. I want just one inebriated soul to tell me here in Washington, DC, that this makes sense. Of course it does not make sense. It did not work. So we have trade policy challenges dealing with Mexico, Canada, and NAFTA. We have policy differences dealing with our big trade deficit with China. We are going to have other struggles and challenges VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7594 July 26, 2000 dealing with the recurring deficit that goes on forever with Japan. It might be useful\u2014I know people get tired of me talking about this\u2014but it might be useful to describe our dimin-ished expectations in this county and why we are in such trouble on trade. About 10 years ago\u2014we have always had a struggle with Japan\u2014we were having, at that time, an agreement ne-gotiated on the issue of American beef going to Japan. We were not getting enough beef into Japan. At that point, it cost about $30 a pound to buy a T- bone steak in Tokyo. Why? Because there was not enough beef. So you keep the supply low, the demand and price go up, and a T-bone steak costs a lot of money in Tokyo. We wanted to get American beef into Japan. After all, we buy all their cars, VCRs and television sets. Maybe they should buy American beef. So we sent our best negotiators, and they nego-tiated. Our negotiators were hard nosed. It only took them a couple of days to lose. They sat at the table, and they negotiated and negotiated. And guess what they negotiated? They had a press conference and said: We have a victory. We have a beef agreement with Japan. What a wonderful deal. You would have thought they had just won the Olympics because they celebrated. And everybody said: Gosh, what a great deal. Here is the agreement. You get more American beef into Japan. Yes, you do. And we did. Ten or 11 years after the beef agree- ment with Japan, the tariff on Amer-ican steak or American ground beef or American beef going to Japan today is 40 percent on a pound of beef. Can you imagine that? What would people think if you told them: In the United States, we only have a 40 percent tariff on your product coming into our country? They would say: What kind of nonsense is that? That is not free trade. Yet we celebrated the fact that we had an agreement with Japan that takes us to a 50 percent tariff, which is reduced over time, but snaps back up if we get more beef into Japan. We celebrated that. This is the goofiest set of priorities I have ever heard. We ought to learn to negotiate trade agreements that are in this country's interests. I have threatened, from time to time, to introduce a piece of legislation in Congress that says: When our trade ne-gotiators go to negotiate, they must wear a jersey that says ''USA,'' just so that they can look down, from time to time, and see who they are negotiating for. ''I am from the United States. I have the United States's best interests at heart. When we negotiate with you, Japan, China, Mexico, Canada, or oth-ers, we insist on fair trade.'' Yes, our producers will compete. We are not afraid of competition. But we are not going to compete with one hand tied behind our back. Our nego-tiators negotiated GATT with Europe, and they said to the Europeans: You know what\u2014my colleague, Senator C ONRAD , talks about this a lot\u2014we will have a deal with you. You can have 6, 8, or 10 times greater subsidies on your sales of grain to other countries than we will have. And we will have a deal where we will agree to limit our sup-port payments to family farmers to a fraction of what yours are. So once we have done that, we have tied both of our hands behind our back, and then said let's go ahead and compete. That is what our negotiators have done virtually every time they have negotiated a trade agreement. They did it in GATT to family farmers and did it with Japan to our ranchers. I should say, our ranchers were pleased with the agreement with Japan. I would say to them: How can you be pleased? How can you call that success? It is because they have such low expectations in our trade negotiations. We give away ev-erything. We expect little, get almost nothing, and then we are so pleased. When you have roughly $1 billion a day in the merchandise trade imbal-ance, it is time to wonder whether your policy is working. When you have a $1- billion-a-day deficit\u2014every single day\u2014in merchandise trade, it is time to ask whether this is a policy that works. The answer is no. I think it would behoove this Con- gress to say: Good for all the wonderful things that are happening in this coun-try. Everybody deserves a little credit for all of that. Good for all the good things happening in our economy. But it is important for all of us to look at the storm clouds as well, and evaluate what is wrong, and try to fix that. If we did that, it would behoove us to bring to the floor of the Senate a debate and full discussion about America's trade policy. Every time I come and talk about this issue, there is someone watching or someone listening, or somebody later will say: That guy sounds like a protectionist. There is this caricature: You are either for free trade or you are some isolationist, xenophobic stooge. You are either for free trade or you don't get it. You either see the horizon or you are nearsighted. That is the way it all works. Even the largest newspapers do that. Try to get an op-ed piece in the Wash-ington Post on trade issues. If you hap-pen to believe we ought to stand up for our economic interests in trade, you can't do it. It is not my intention to say this country should not be a leader in ex-panding trade. This country ought to be a leader in promoting an expanded free and fair opportunity for inter-national trade. This country ought to be a leader. We ought to expect that other countries would be involved in saying the things that we fought for for 75 to 100 years. This country will be part of the discussions about trade. We had people dying in the streets in this country, fighting for the right to organize in labor unions, fighting for the right to create labor unions. We had people die on the streets of Amer- ica. Some will say: We can avoid all that, having labor unions, having to worry about dumping chemicals into the water and the air, having to have a safe workplace, having to be prohibited from hiring kids; we can avoid all of that. We have debated it for 75 or 100 years in this country. We have made a lot of progress. We can avoid it all by moving our plant to some other Third World country where they don't have those inconveniences, where you can hire 12-year-old kids and work them 12 hours a day and pay them 12 cents an hour and everybody calls it free trade. This country has a responsibility also to lead on the issues of what are the fair rules for international trade\u2014 not protectionism, what are the fair rules for trade that establish fair com-petition. That is something this coun-try has a responsibility to be involved with as well. Talking about trade in the context of the Customs Service and our responsi-bility to keep track of what is hap-pening around the world, it is true that my frustration from time to time boils over on the issue. I come to the floor and talk about it without much effect because there are not sufficient votes in the Senate to require a very robust debate on trade policy. It is coming. We ought to make it happen. If I can digress\u2014because I have the time this morning, and I don't see any-one else waiting to speak\u2014I want to mention something that happened some years ago that made a profound impact on me. I mentioned a moment ago that we struggled in this country to establish the right to form labor unions and establish collective bar-gaining. There are plenty of countries where, if you try to form labor unions, try to get workers together to see if they can't get a better deal, they can be thrown in jail. As I said, we had peo-ple who died in the streets in this coun-try fighting for that opportunity. We now understand the consequences of that. We have labor unions, and we have management and labor, collective bargaining. It is a better country be-cause of that. There are some areas of the world where we don't have the op-portunity to do that. People who try to demonstrate for those rights are thrown in jail. Let me describe something that hap- pened in Congress a long while ago re-lated to that point. We had a fellow who spoke to a joint session of Con-gress. Normally, a speaker to a joint session of Congress is a President. The pageantry is quite wonderful when there is a joint session. It is normally in the House Chamber because that is the larger Chamber. The Senators come in and are seated in the House Chamber, Cabinet officials come in, the Supreme Court comes in. The Amer-ican people see this. That is when the network television cameras come on. Then the Doorkeeper says: Mr. Speaker, the President of the United VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7595 July 26, 2000 States. And the President marches in and gives a State of the Union speech. We occasionally have other speakers who are invited to give an address to a joint session of Congress. On rare occa-sions, it has been a head of state. Many will remember other circumstances: General Douglas MacArthur coming back from Korea, when he was relieved of his command by President Truman, was invited to address a joint session of Congress; Winston Churchill addressed a joint session of Congress. One day about 10 or 12 years ago, I was a Member of the U.S. House, it was a joint session of Congress. In the back of the room, the Doorkeeper announced the visitor. The Doorkeeper said: Mr. Speaker, Lech Walesa from Poland. And this fellow walked in, a rather short man with a mustache. He had red cheeks and probably a few extra pounds, an ordinary looking fellow who walked into the Chamber of the House, walked up to the microphone. The joint session stood and applauded and didn't stop. This applause continued to create waves, and it went on for some min-utes. Then this man began to speak. Most of us, of course, knew the history. But in a very powerful way this ordi-nary man told an extraordinary tale. He said 10 years before, he was in a shipyard in Gdansk, Poland on a Satur-day leading a strike for workers to be able to chart their own destiny, leading a strike for a free labor movement in Poland against a Communist govern-ment. On that day, he had already been fired from his job as an electrician at a shipyard for his activities to fight for a free labor movement in Poland. The Communist government had him fired from his shipyard. So this unemployed electrician, on a Saturday morning, was leading a strike, leading a parade inside this shipyard for a free labor movement. He was grabbed by some Communist thugs and beaten and beat-en badly. As they beat him, they took him to the edge of the shipyard, hoist-ed him up and unceremoniously dumped him over the barbed-wire fence outside the shipyard face down in the dirt. He lay there bleeding, wondering what to do next. Of course, we know what he did next. Ten years later, he was introduced to a joint session of Congress as the Presi-dent of the country of Poland. This man went to the microphone and said the following to us: We didn't have any guns; the Communists had all the guns. We didn't have any bullets; the Com-munists had all the bullets. We were armed only with an idea. What he did next that Saturday morning, from lying on the ground bleeding from the beating he had re-ceived from the Communist agents of that Government of Poland, the his-tory books record. He pulled himself back up and climbed back over the fence and climbed back into the ship-yard. This unemployed electrician showed up in the Chamber of the U.S. House to speak to a joint session of Congress 10 years later as the President of his country\u2014not a diplomat, not a politi-cian, not an intellectual, not a scholar, an unemployed electrician who showed up in this country 10 years later as the President of his country. He said: We didn't break a window- pane in Poland. We didn't have guns. We didn't have bullets. We were armed with an idea and that idea simply was that free people ought to be free to choose their own destiny. I have never forgotten that moment, understanding the power of ideas and understanding that common people can do uncommon things. Ordinary people can do extraordinary things. Won-dering where did Lech Walesa get the courage to pull himself up that Satur-day morning in a shipyard in Gdansk, an unemployed electrician, believing so strongly in the need to provoke change in this Communist country that this man and his followers toppled a Com-munist government and lit the fuse, caused a spark that lit the fuse that began to topple Communist govern-ments all through Eastern Europe. That is the power of an idea. What are the ideas that exist in this country that will make a better Amer-ica and create a better future? We know from our history that in two cen-turies, a series of ideas by some re-markable men and women have created the best country in the world. It is the freest. I know there are a lot of blem-ishes, but there is no country that has freedoms like ours. There is no country that has accomplished what we have accomplished in every area. Find an area where we have had difficulty, we have confronted it. We have had dif-ficult times, but we have solved the issues. We survived a civil war. We sur-vived a great depression. When you think of what this country has done, it is quite remarkable. We stand today at the edge of a new century, the year 2000, with a lot of challenges in front of us. Some say we are just sort of content to be where we are and to kind of nick around the edges. No person, no country, no orga-nization ever does well by resting. There are challenges in front of us. We have talked about some of them. Some of them will be in this legislation when we bring it to the floor. Some will be in other legislation. I was on the floor yesterday and Senator D UR- BIN, who is on the floor at the moment, talked about the challenge of making our health care system work; the chal-lenge of passing a Patients' Bill of Rights, and one that is a real Patients' Bill of Rights; the challenge of putting a prescription drug benefit in the Medi-care program. Those are ideas\u2014ideas with power and resonance, ideas which ought to relate to the public policy this Congress embraces. I talked, a lit-tle bit ago, about trade policy, the idea that we need to change trade policy to make it a policy that is effective for our country, to reduce the trade defi-cits and continue to expand markets, and to have fair rules of trade. There are so many things we need to do. Yesterday, I showed some of the challenges that we ought to address now in the coming weeks. For instance, gun safety. This is a wonderful coun-try, but when you read the newspapers and read of the killings, and then you understand that we have a right to own weapons\u2014and nobody is changing that right; it is a constitutional right. But we have said it makes sense for us to keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons. How do we do that? We have a computer base with the names of felons on it. When you want to buy a gun, your name has to be run against the computer base. At the gun store, they run your name to find out if you are a convicted felon. If you are, you don't get a gun. But guess what. You can go to a gun show on a Satur-day someplace and buy a gun or a weapon, and nobody is going to run your name through an instant check. We say let's close that loophole. Are those who don't want to close it saying they don't want to keep guns out of their hands? I hope not. So join us in fixing this problem. That is an idea. That has some power. How many Americans will that save? How many children will it save by keeping the gun out of the hands of a convicted felon? We are not talking about law-abiding citizens. We are not going to disadvan-tage them. Let's keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons. Close the gun show loophole. It is a simple idea; yet one we can't get through the Con-gress because people are blocking the door on this issue. The Patients' Bill of Rights: We talked about that yesterday. We talked about putting a drug benefit in the Medicare program. We talked about school modernization. I will conclude by talking for a moment about school modernization. Our future is education. I have told my colleagues many times about walk-ing into the late-Congressman Claude Pepper's office and seeing two pictures, both autographed, behind his chair. One was a picture of Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane flight. It was autographed by Orville Wright, saying, ''To Congressman Pep-per, with deep admiration, Orville Wright.'' Then, the first person to stand on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, gave him an autographed picture. I thought to my-self, this is really something. Here is a living American who has an auto-graphed picture of the first person to leave the ground in powered flight, and also the person who flew all the way to the Moon. What was the in between? What was the difference between just leaving the ground and arriving on the Moon? Education, schools, learning; it is our future\u2014allowing every young boy and girl in this country to become the very best they can be; universal education, saying that every young boy or girl, no matter what their back-ground or circumstances are, can walk through a schoolroom door and be VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7596 July 26, 2000 whatever they want to be in life, uni- versal opportunity in education. In the middle part of this past cen- tury, those who came back fighting for liberty in the Second World War, fight-ing for freedom, built schools all across our country as they went to school on the GI bill, got married, and had chil-dren. They built schools all across America. Now those schools, in many cases, are 45, 50 years old and in des-perate need of repair and renovation. This country, as good as it is, can send our kids to the schoolroom doors of the best schools in the world. And we should. That ought to be our policy. So before this Congress ends, let's em-brace our ideas and policies of saying let's modernize our schools, renovate our schools, and connect our schools to the Internet. Let's reduce the size of classes and make sure every student has the opportunity to go through a schoolroom door that we as parents are proud of. Let's make sure we keep the finest teachers, the best teachers in our classrooms and pay them a fair wage. These are ideas that we have that we can't get through this Con-gress. It doesn't make any sense to me. So we are prepared to bring the Treasury-general government appro-priations bill to the floor. In that legis-lation there will be several of the ideas I have talked about, and other appro-priations bills, and other pieces of leg-islation. We will continue to pound away at this Congress to say: Accept some of these ideas. Accept some progress. Join us. This isn't partisan. Our kids and our schools don't rep-resent a partisan issue. Keeping guns out of the hands of felons surely can't be a Republican or Democratic issue. Surely, every American should em-brace that goal. Putting the prescrip-tion drug benefit in the Medicare pro-gram so senior citizens who have reached their declining income years have the opportunity and can afford to buy life-saving drugs surely can't be a Republican or Democratic approach. There can't be differences here in terms of goals. So let's resolve to join together to meet these goals, to do our work and embrace ideas\u2014yes, big ideas\u2014that recognize, yes, this country is doing very well in a lot of areas, but we are at the first stage of a new cen-tury, and we need to embrace new ideas to advance this country's interests and prepare for this country's future. No-where is that preparation more nec-essary than with our children and our schools. Mr. President, I have spoken at some length. I know others on the floor have comments about these and other issues. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from California is recognized. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I understand that we are running out the clock on a motion to bring to the floor the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. So I think my comments are perti-nent to that bill and to the situation in which we find ourselves. Mr. President, about 14 months ago, those of us in this Chamber passed a ju-venile justice bill. Prior to its passage, many of us on this side of the aisle came together to say if we want to really achieve some limited improve-ments in targeted gun measures, what should they be? We decided on a few, and the Republican side had a few. So some targeted measures were added to that bill. One of them was that guns should not be sold without trigger locks. That was made from our side of the aisle. One from the Republican side of the aisle was that children should not be per-mitted to buy assault weapons\u2014a no- brainer. That was accepted by this body. A third vote was to close the gun show loophole which enabled the two youngsters from Columbine, 16 years old, to go to a gun show and buy two assault weapons with no questions asked. The final one was one I offered on the floor, which was to plug a hole in the assault weapons legislation. Under the assault weapons legisla- tion, it is illegal to manufacture, pos-sess, sell, or to transfer a large-capac-ity ammunition feeding device in this country. So, in other words, nobody can manufacture one domestically in this country now. The loophole is that they can come in, if manufactured in foreign countries, and be sold. So since the passage of the original assault weapons legislation, about 18 million large-capacity ammunition feeding de-vices have come into the country. But just in the last 14 months, since the passage of the juvenile justice bill, 6.3 million of these clips have come into this country, many of them 250 rounds, but most 30 rounds. What is the use of these clips? You can't hunt with them. You can't carry a clip with more than 10 bullets in vir-tually any State if you are going to hunt. You don't use them for self-pro-tection. The street price of them has dropped. You can buy them, no ques-tions asked, over the Internet for $7, $8, $9. The only reason for them is to turn a weapon into a major killing machine. They are used by drive-by shooters, by the gangs, and by the grievance killer who has a grievance and wants to walk into his place of business and kill a large number of people. Well, this body passed that, and the other body actu-ally passed it by unanimous consent. So those are measures that have held up a whole huge juvenile justice bill for that period of time. So in 14 months, we have gone no- where in achieving safety regulations, prudent targeted gun regulations to protect people. A million women\u2014now 240 new orga- nizations\u2014in the Million Mom March, went to the streets of their cities and to the Capitol on Mother's Day to say they wanted prudent gun regulations. But what has happened since then is we have actually back slipped. The back-sliding is taking place right in this very bill which time is running on. An amendment was put in the bill that says this: None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to implement a preference for the acquisition of a firearm or ammuni-tion based on whether the manufacturer or vendor of the firearm or ammunition is a party of an agreement with a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States regarding codes of conduct, operating practices, or product design specifically re-lated to the business of importing, manufac-turing, or dealing in firearms or ammunition under chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code. This amendment is essentially meant to prohibit the U.S. Government from giving any preference to any respon-sible gun manufacturer. I believe this measure is simply the worst possible public policy. I would rather not have a Treasury-Postal appropriations bill that has this kind of disincentive to good conduct in a manufacturer of weapons in this country. When this bill comes to the floor, the first amendment from our side will be the amendment to strip this verbiage from the bill. I am pleased to say I am joined in co- sponsoring this by the Senator from Il-linois, Mr. D URBIN , and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. L AUTENBERG . First, it is important to point out that no such preferences have been given. The thrust of this provision is based on a hypothetical. But it is based to be a deterrent. It is based to send a message. The message is to every man-ufacturer of weapons that there can be no reward in government if you manu-facture safe guns. If you put trigger locks, if you have good, safe marketing practices, if you manufacture guns and see they are sold and distributed in a way to keep them out of the hands of children, people who are mentally defi-cient, or criminals\u2014that is the thrust of this amendment\u2014to reduce the gun industry to its lowest possible common denominator all across the United States of America, that is the worst possible public policy. Members on both sides of this aisle should stand to-gether and refute it. At least one company, Smith & Wesson, has agreed to adopt certain reasonable, responsible marketing practices. While this agreement was made under the threat of litigation, it is important to note that no dealer has to comply, and no measures have been forced on Smith & Wesson. Smith & Wesson has decided to take a respon-sible path to produce responsible pol-icy, and for that this body would slap them on the hand. As a result of their effort, Smith & Wesson has allegedly been targeted by others in the gun industry that are un-happy with the agreement who say you can't march ahead of us; you can't do something right; we all want to be able to do something wrong. There has been talk of boycotts and anticompetitive behavior. In fact, I recently joined a number of my colleagues in writing to the Federal Trade Commission, asking them to look into these allegations. Given the determination of the Na- tional Rifle Association and its allies VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7597 July 26, 2000 to stop any and all reasonable control of the flow of guns to criminals and children, I believe it would be dreadful to prevent the administration from en-couraging agreements such as this one. Let me be clear. No one is saying that law enforcement should buy infe-rior weapons simply because the manu-facturer has agreed to act responsibly. The fact is, Smith & Wesson produces very good weapons. I have certainly never been one to argue that we should leave law enforcement without ade-quate weaponry. But where technology and safety of guns are similar, it makes eminent sense to give pref-erence to the manufacturer that has agreed to certain commonsense stand-ards. I wish to take a few moments and go over a few of the details in the Smith & Wesson settlement document. This is what it looks like. First, under the agreement, all hand- guns and pistols will be shipped from Smith & Wesson with child-safety de-vices. Again, the juvenile justice bill would have made this provision unnec-essary. But, again, that bill has gone nowhere. What would that do? In Memphis, TN, not too long ago, a 5-year-old took a weapon off of his grandfather's dresser. It was loaded. He took it to kindergarten to kill the kin-dergarten teacher because that young-ster had been given a ''time out'' the day before. The gun was discovered be-cause a bullet dropped out of his back-pack\u2014a 5-year-old child toting in his backpack a loaded pistol with no safety lock to kill the teacher because he had been given a ''time out'' the day before. With the safety lock, the gun would have been inoperable to that child. Another child in Michigan, a 6-year- old, has an argument with a child, brings a gun to school, and actually kills another 6-year-old. These may not be everyday events. But they would be prevented from hap-pening if guns were made with smart technology and, prior to that, with safety locks. Also in the agreement, every hand- gun would be designed with a second hidden serial number. Why that? Be-cause it prevents criminals from easily eradicating a serial number to impede tracing. How can we not support that? New Smith & Wesson models will be no longer able to accept any large-ca-pacity magazine. What is important about that? That immediately limits the kill power of that weapon. The weapon can still be used for defense. But the drums of 250 or 75 rounds with clips of 30 rounds, which are there for one reason\u2014to kill large numbers of people\u2014would not be accepted into that gun. Within 2 years, every Smith & Wesson model would have a built-in, on-board locking system by which the firearm could only be operated with the key, or combination, or other mechanism unique to that gun. Two percent of Smith & Wesson's firearms revenue would be devoted to developing smart gun technology for all future gun models. What a good thing to have happen. Next, within a year of the agreement, each firearm would be designed so it could not be readily operated by a child under the age of six. This might in-clude increasing the trigger-pull resist-ance, designing the gun so a small hand could not operate it, or perhaps requir-ing a sequence of actions to fire the gun that could not be easily accom-plished by a 5-year-old. Who believes the Federal Government should not en-courage manufacturers to make weap-ons so five- and six-year-olds cannot fire them? The agreement includes safety in manufacturing tests, such as minimum barrel length and firing tests to ensure that misfires, explosions, and cracks such as those found in Saturday night specials do not occur. A drop test is also included. I remember very well a major rob- bery in San Francisco where a police officer with a semiautomatic handgun went into the robbery, pulled out his weapon, and the clip dropped out. He was shot and killed. And I remember another incident where the gun was dropped and fired accidentally. Another provision: each pistol would have a clearly visible chamber load in-dicator, so that the user can see wheth-er there is a round in the chamber. No new pistol design would be able to accept large-capacity ammunition clips. The packaging of new guns will in- clude a safety warning regarding the list of unsafe storage and use. What a good thing, a gun manufacturer that will put a warning with the gun that says to the prospective gun owner: Un-derstand this is a lethal weapon. Here is how to keep it safely. Put it in a cab-inet which is secure and locked. Keep the ammunition separate from the gun. And we are going to prevent anyone who provides this from gaining any kind of preference? We give preference with merit pay. There are all kinds of preferences in Federal law. Yet we are to deny this to anybody who does the right thing and manufactures safe guns, smart guns, better guns. Under the agreement, any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson fire-arms would comply with a series of commonsense measures. Let me state what they are. Any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson firearms first agrees not to sell at any gun show un-less all the sellers in the gun show pro-vide background checks. What a re-sponsible thing to do. Again, this pro-vision would be unnecessary if Con-gress had simply passed the juvenile justice bill and sent it to the President for his signature because all sellers at all gun shows would already be per-forming background checks. That bill is stalled in conference, and this provi-sion of the agreement is a small step in the right direction. Again, under the agreement, any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson firearms must carry insurance against liability for damage to property or in-jury to persons resulting in firearm sales. The same thing would apply if you had a swimming pool. You would have some liability insurance if a neighbor fell into the pool and drowned. This isn't asking too much. Any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson firearms must maintain an up- to-date and accurate set of records and must keep track of all inventory at all times. Any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson firearms must agree to keep all firearms within the dealership safe from loss or theft, including locking display cases and keeping guns safely locked during off hours. Ammunition must be stored separate from firearms. Any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson must stop selling large-capac-ity ammunition feeding devices and as-sault weapons. This gun company has set itself in the vanguard of reform in the gun in-dustry, and the Treasury-Postal bill coming before the Senate penalizes them for doing so. What kind of public policy is that? It simply says we are going to try, by law, to lower safety, regulation, careful record keeping, and all the things that are positive to the lowest possible denominator. We are not going to commend anybody who does the right thing. We are going to see they are not given preference. We are going to provide a disincentive to gun companies that want to do the right thing. More than any other piece of legisla- tion I have seen, this shows the dis-ingenuousness of those who say they are for some targeted gun regulations. This speaks to what this is all about, that there should remain one, and one industry only, without regulation, without any kinds of standards, and that is the gun industry. I think there is no better time to join this debate than in the upcoming Treasury-Postal bill. The amendment to strip this language from Treasury- Postal will be the first item of business of this side. Mr. President, I will make this agree- ment available to anyone from either side of this aisle who wants to inspect it. Mr. President, Senator K ENNEDY is a cosponsor of the amendment. I thank him, as well. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. B URNS ). The Senator from Delaware. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Sen- ate will soon be considering the Treas-ury and general government appropria-tions bill. This is one of the important funding bills we will have to pass this year to keep the Government open and running. In addition to the Department of the Treasury, this is the bill that provides moneys for the operation of the White House, the Executive Office of the President, and it also provides funds VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7598 July 26, 2000 for the construction of new court- houses, reflecting the priorities of the administrative offices of the courts. It is this third branch of our Government that I will take a few minutes to talk about. In 1994, the Senate and the House passed the Violence Against Women Act which President Clinton then signed into law. As the author of that legislation, securing its passage had been my highest priority for three ses-sions of Congress. The cause of elimi-nating violence against women re-mains my highest priority. I have watched the progress of the implemen-tation of my Violence Against Women Act. In that act we included a provi-sion giving anyone who had been the victim of a crime of violence motivated by gender the right to bring a lawsuit seeking damages from the assailant. On May 15 of this year, in a case called United States v. Morrison, the Supreme Court struck down this provi-sion. The Court said that addressing the problems of violence against women in this way was beyond the con-stitutional authority of the elected representatives of the United States. Flat out, they said it was an unconsti-tutional act we engaged in. In ruling it was beyond the constitu- tional authority of the Congress, the Court said that it does not matter how great an effect such acts of violence have on interstate commerce. They said gender-based violence could be crippling large segments of our na-tional economy, but, nonetheless, even if that were proven\u2014according to the Court\u2014the Congress is powerless to enact a law to deter such active vio-lence because although we have acted this way under the commerce clause of the Constitution before, the Court ruled violence in and of itself is not commerce. I believe this is a constitutionally wrong decision. It is true that it does not strike a fatal blow against the struggle to end violence against women in this country. The other parts of the Violence Against Women Act are unaf-fected by this decision. I am pleased to report that these other provisions, to-gether with changing attitudes in this country, are beginning to make a dif-ference in this struggle in the lives of women who have been victimized. I have introduced a bill with, now, I think over 60 cosponsors, to enhance the provisions of my Violence Against Women Act so that we can continue to make progress. Nonetheless, the deci-sion in Morrison is a wrongheaded deci-sion. It is not just an isolated error. No, it is part of a growing body of deci-sions in which this Supreme Court is seizing the power to make important social decisions that, under our con-stitutional system of government, are properly made by elected representa-tives who answer to the people, unlike the Court. I said at the time that the case came down, striking down the provisions of the Violence Against Women Act, that the decision does more damage to our constitutional jurisprudence than it does to the fight against gender-based violence. Since I said that, a number of people have asked me to explain what I mean by that. Today, since we have the time, I am beginning a series of speech-es to do just that by placing the Morri-son decision in a larger context of what an increasingly out-of-touch Supreme Court has been doing in recent years. I plan on making two additional speeches on this subject over the next several weeks and months. It is crucial, in my view, that the American people understand the larger pattern of the Supreme Court's recent decisions and, to me, the disturbing direction in which the Supreme Court is moving be-cause the consequences of these cases may well impact upon the ability of American citizens to ask their elected representatives in Congress to help them solve national problems that have national impact. Many of the Court's decisions are written in the name of protecting pre-rogatives of the State governments and speak in the time honored language of federalism and States rights. But as my grandmother would say, they have stood federalism on its head. Make no mistake, what is at issue here is the question of power, who wants it, who has it, and who controls it\u2014basically, whether power will be exercised by an insulated judiciary or by the elected representatives of the people. In our separation of powers doctrine, upon which our Government rests, that power is being wrestled by the Court from the elected representatives, for in every case in which the Court has struck down a Federal statute, it has invalidated a statute that the people of the United States have wanted. As a matter of fact, in many of the cases of statutes that have been struck down, the numerous attorneys general of the various States have sided with the Fed-eral Government in briefs filed with the Court, saying that they supported the decision taken by the Congress and the President. Let's give the emerging pattern of Supreme Court decisions a name. In a speech I gave before the New Hamp-shire Supreme Court last year, I re-ferred to this pattern as an emerging pattern of an imperial judiciary. I meant to describe the judiciary that is making decisions and seizing power in areas in which the judgment of elected branches of government ought to be the controlling judgment, not the Court's. With increasing frequency, the Supreme Court is taking over the role of government for itself. The imperial judging might also be called a kind of judicial activism. ''Ju-dicial activism'' is an overworked ex-pression, one that has often been used by conservatives to criticize liberal judges. Under this Supreme Court, however, the shoe is plainly on the other foot. It is now conservative judges who are supplanting the judg-ment of the people's representatives and substituting their own for that of the Congress and the President. This is not just J OEBIDEN talking. The Violence Against Women Act case came to the Supreme Court through the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson is the chief judge. Judge Wilkinson has been on many so-called short lists for pos-sible Supreme Court nominees of Gov-ernor Bush and is a well recognized conservative. In the opinion he wrote, agreeing that the civil rights remedy in the Violence Against Women Act was unconstitutional, Judge Wilkinson praised the result as an example of ''this century's third and final era of judicial activism.'' He, Judge Wilkinson, acknowledges that the decision represents the ''third and,'' he says, ''final era of judicial ac-tivism.'' And he said he hoped this new activism would be enduring presence in our Federal courts. That was in Brzonkala v. VPI, 169 F.3d 820, 892-893. Or consider Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, another well recognized conservative. Judge Ginsburg has quite explicitly criticized the interpretation of the Constitution that has prevailed through the better part of this entire century and, indeed, throughout most of our country's history, an interpreta-tion which correctly recognizes the broad capacity and competence of the people to govern themselves through their elected officials, not through the court system. According to Judge Ginsburg, the correct interpretation of the Constitu-tion produces results that severely re-strict the power of elected government. He calls the Constitution ''the Con-stitution in Exile.'' Under that Con-stitution, the one that he thinks con-trols, unelected Federal judges would wield enormous power to second-guess legislative bodies on both the State and the Federal levels. When Judge Ginsburg wrote about these ideas in a magazine article in 1995, he was eagerly awaiting signs that the Supreme Court would begin to em-brace his notion of a Constitution in exile. Five short years later, much has changed. As Linda Greenhouse recently put it in a New York Times column, Judge Ginsburg's hopes: . . . sound decidedly less out of context today than they did even 5 years ago, just be-fore the court began issuing a series of deci-sions reviving a limited vision of federal power. By taking a closer look at these se- ries of decisions referred to in the New York Times, the pattern I have been referring to will become quite evident. The first clear step toward an impe- rial judiciary was taken in the case called Lopez v. United States, which invalidated a Federal law making it a crime to possess a gun in a school zone. The Supreme Court held that it was not obvious ''to the naked eye'' that the nationwide problem of school vio-lence has a substantial effect on the VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7599 July 26, 2000 national economy and interstate com- merce, the predicate we have to show to have jurisdiction under the com-merce clause to pass such a law. In our desire to respond quickly to the epidemic of school violence, which we all talk about here on the floor, we in the Congress did not make find-ings\u2014that is, we did not have hearings that said ''we find that the following actions have the following impact on commerce''\u2014we did not make findings to relate school violence to interstate commerce. Subsequently, however, we did make such findings and pointed to the voluminous evidence that was be-fore the Congress at the time we passed Senator K OHL's Gun-Free School Zone Act. Nonetheless, the Court, this new im- perial judiciary, ignored our findings and the raft of supporting evidence, and drew its own conclusions. They concluded\u2014the Court concluded\u2014that the threat of school violence to na-tional commerce is not substantial enough to justify a legislative response on the part of those of us elected to the Congress. The Lopez case startled many people. Numerous law schools sponsored con-ferences to discuss the meaning of this case. Constitutional scholars debated how great a departure this case sig-naled from the settled approach to con-gressional power that has been taken over the 20th century, at least the last two-thirds of the 20th century, by all previous Supreme Courts. Immediately after the decision, no consensus emerged. Many scholars plausibly concluded that Lopez was, as one put it, just an ''island in the stream,'' a decision that breaks the flow of the river of cases before it, but which will have no lasting effect of any significance on those that follow it. How wrong he was. It now turns out that if Lopez is an island, it is one the size of Australia. The Court soon fol-lowed Lopez by striking down the Reli-gious Freedom and Restoration Act that Senator H ATCH and I had worked so hard to craft and the Senate and House passed and the President signed. In Boerne v. Flores\u2014that is the name of the case that struck down the Reli-gious Freedom Act we passed\u2014the Con-gress of the United States enacted the Religious Freedom Act in response to an earlier Supreme Court decision. In 1990, the Court ruled in Employ- ment Decision v. Smith that the con-stitutional freedom of religion is not offended by a State law that signifi-cantly burdens the ability of members of that religion to practice their reli-gion, so long as that law applies across the board, without singling out reli-gious practices of any one denomina-tion in any way. For example, under the Smith deci- sion, a dry county which prohibits the consumption of all alcohol could pro-hibit a church from using sacramental wine when they give communion, as they do in my church; I am a Roman Catholic; and they do so in other churches as well. Smith broke with the prior line of de- cisions holding that such laws needed to make reasonable accommodations for religion unless the Government had a very good reason for applying the law when it offended someone's sincere re-ligious practices to do so. In other words, unless the Government had an overwhelming reason why in a Catholic Church they could not serve, when they give communion, a sip of wine with the host, prior decisions said you cannot pass a law to stop that. The overwhelming majority of both Houses of Congress thought the Smith decision was incorrect as a matter of constitutional interpretation and as a matter of policy. We concluded that be-cause section 5 of the 14th amendment authorized the Congress to protect fun-damental civil liberties by appropriate legislation, we could enact a statute providing greater protection than the Smith decision did to accepted reli-gious practices. After extensive hearings under the leadership of Senator H ATCH and Sen- ator K ENNEDY , the so-called RFRA, Re- ligious Freedom and Restoration Act, was drafted to require that the applica-tion of neutral laws had to make rea-sonable accommodation to bona fide religious objections. The Supreme Court struck down our effort to extend reasonable protections to religious practices. It held that the 14th amendment does not authorize the Congress to confer civil rights by stat-ute or to give judicially recognized rights a greater scope than the Court has set forth. In the Court's view, the power of sec- tion 5 of the 14th amendment gives the Congress the power to ''enforce'' the rights established in that amendment, but it only amounts to a power to pro-vide remedies for the violations of the rights that the Court has recognized\u2014 not the Congress, the Court has recog-nized\u2014not to protect any broader con-ception of civil rights than the Court has already recognized. In the Flores case, it was another sign that we are on the road to judicial imperialism. Recognizing the implica-tions of the decision, the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution in the House held a hearing on the Court's refusal to defer to Congress' factual findings and the policy determinations it based on those findings. Judicial deference to congressional findings and congressional authority to enforce civil rights are obviously im-portant questions standing alone, but the Supreme Court raised the stakes even higher in two decisions relating to what we call State sovereign immu-nity. In those cases, Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida and Alden v. Maine, the Court declared the Congress may not use its commerce clause powers to abrogate State sovereign immunity. What this means, translated, is that when Congress acts under its broad power to improve the national econ-omy, a power granted to it by the Con-stitution, the Congress, in the Court's view, cannot authorize an individual to sue a State even if they are suing over a purely commercial transaction with that State. For example, as the Court held in the Alden case, an employee of a State now cannot sue his or her em-ployer for failing to comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act just because the employer happens to be a State. If it is a business person, a corpora- tion, and they violate the Fair Labor Standards Act, which we passed to pro-tect all people who work, they can be held accountable under that act. The Supreme Court came along and said: But, Congress, you can't pass a law that holds a State accountable. The Seminole Tribe and Alden cases highlight the importance of the issue of congressional power under the 14th amendment because the Court con-tinues to recognize that Congress can authorize individuals to sue States if our legislation is authorized by the 14th amendment rather than by the commerce clause. By limiting Congress' 14th amend- ment powers, therefore, the Boerne de-cision, which is the Religious Freedom Act decision, draws into question our capacity to meaningfully protect civil rights at all whenever remedies di-rectly against a State are being consid-ered. Viewed in its historical context, this is a remarkable development in and of itself. The text of the 14th amendment was drafted immediately after the Civil War, and it grants powers to only one branch of the Government, the only one named in the amendment: the Con-gress, not the Court. Specifically, the amendment sought to grant the Con-gress ample power to enforce civil rights against the States. That is what the Civil War was about. That is why the Civil War amendments were passed: to put it in stone. Developments in these recent cases I have cited are in profound tension with the sentiments and concerns of the drafters of the 14th amendment. Still, after that case, some might continue to say it is not clear where the Court was really headed. It was possible to say in the Flores case that it was simply articulating the standard governing the nature of Congress' power; namely, that it was purely re-medial and not substantive. Because the legislative record was designed to support an exercise of sub-stantive power, that record did not so clearly support the exercise of the re-medial power. On this reading, the Court did not second-guess the congressional find-ings. It just saw them as answering the wrong question. Subsequent events, however, have confirmed that the Sub-committee on the Constitution had a right to be worried about Boerne be-cause Boerne was much more ominous than that. In one of the last cases decided in the 1998 term, the Court laid down yet an-other marker, perhaps the most bold VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7600 July 26, 2000 decision yet in the trend of the Court usurping democratic authority. In that decision, the Court held un- constitutional a Federal statute, the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act. That act provided a remedy for patent holders against any State that infringes on the patent holder's patent. That was in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Edu-cation Expense Board v. College Sav-ings Bank. Before enacting this remedial legisla- tion, the Congress had developed a spe-cific legislative record detailing spe-cific cases where States had infringed a federally conferred patent and evidence suggested the possibility of a future in-crease in the frequency of State in-fringements of patents held by individ-uals. Unlike Lopez, the Patent Protection Act did not lack findings or legislative record. Unlike Boerne, the legislative record demonstrated that the statute was remedial and not substantive. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court de-cided, independently, that the facts be-fore the Congress, as it, the Court, in-terpreted them, provided, in the Court's words, ''little support'' for the need for a remedy. Get this: We, up here, concluded, on the record, that States have, in fact, infringed upon the patents held by in-dividuals. We laid out why we thought\u2014Democrat and Republican, House, Senate, and President\u2014we should protect individuals from that and why we thought the problem would get worse. We set that out in the record when we passed the legislation. But the Supreme Court comes along and says: We don't think there is a problem. Who are they to determine whether or not there is a problem? It is theirs to determine whether our action is constitutional, not whether or not there is a problem. But they said they found little support for our concern\u2014 the concern of 535 elected Members of the Congress and the President of the United States. The Court was not substituting a constitutional principle here. The Court was substituting its own policy views for those of this body that de-scribed the problem of State infringe-ment on Federal patents as being of na-tional import. They concluded it is not that big of a deal. We need to be clear about what the Court did in the patent remedy case. For a long time, it has been accepted constitutional law that once a piece of legislation has been found to be de-signed to cover a subject over which the Constitution gives the Congress the power to act\u2014let me say that again\u2014 this has been accepted constitutional theory and law that once a piece of leg-islation has been found to be designed by the Congress to cover a subject over which the Congress has constitutional authority, that it then becomes wholly within the sphere of Congress to decide whether any particular action is wise or is prudent. This has been constitutional law going all the way back as far as M'Culloch v. Maryland, written by the then-Chief Justice John Marshall, in 1819. There Chief Justice Marshall wrote that the ''government which has the right to act, and has imposed on it the duty of performing that act, must, according to the dictates of reason, be allowed to select the means [by which to act].'' In the patent remedy case, the Court quite clearly usurped the constitu-tional authority of Congress to select the means it thinks appropriate to remedy a problem that is admittedly within the authority of Congress to ad-dress. In the patent remedy case, the Court did not hold that Congress has exer-cised a power in an area outside its constitutional authority. Instead, it disagreed with our substantive judg-ment as to whether the Federal remedy was warranted. In short, the Court struck down the remedy just because it did not think the remedy was a good idea. Who are they to make that judgment? Talk about judicial activism. The cases I have reviewed today\u2014Lopez, Boerne, Seminole Tribe, Alden, and Florida Prepaid\u2014bring us up to this term just completed by the Supreme Court. In the next series of speeches, I will show how the trend of judicial impe-rialism continued, and was extended by several cases decided this past year, in-cluding the Violence Against Women Act, which I began with today. The bottom line here is, in the opin- ion of many scholars and observers of the Court, we are witnessing the emer-gence of what I referred to a year ago as the ''imperial judiciary.'' I just dis-cussed five cases leading up to the just completed term. Now I would like to discuss two sig- nificant decisions of this term. I will also begin the task of trying to place these decisions in a broader framework of the Constitution's allocation of re-sponsibility between the elected branches of Government and the judici-ary. It is a framework that this ''impe-rial judiciary'' is disregarding. Last December, the Court focused its sight on the Age Discrimination in Em-ployment Act. That is the act that pro-tects Americans against discrimina-tion based on age and is amply justified under our Constitution. Not only does it protect the basic civil rights of equal protection and nondiscriminatory treatment\u2014with bipartisan support, I might add\u2014it also promotes the na-tional economy, by ensuring that the labor pool is not artificially limited by mandatory requirements to retire. So the Congress had ample constitu- tional authority to enact the Age Dis-crimination Act. And the Court did not deny that. Nonetheless, the Court, this last term, gutted the enforcement of the act as the act applied to all State government employees. Building on its earlier decisions in the Seminole Tribe and Alden cases, which I discussed a moment ago, the Court ruled that the Constitution pre-vents us from authorizing State em-ployees to sue their employers for vio-lation of the Federal Age Discrimina-tion Act. The Court also said, however, that the Constitution does not prevent the Congress from applying the law to the States. Now, you have to listen to this care- fully. In a thoroughly bizarre manner, in my view, the Supreme Court has now held that the Constitution allows the Age Discrimination Act to apply to State employers, but it denies the em-ployees the right to sue the State em-ployers when their rights under the Federal law are violated. We learned in law school that a right without a rem-edy can hardly be called a right. As a result of this case, called Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, over 27,000 State employees in my State of Dela-ware are left without an effective judi-cial remedy for a violation of a Federal law that protects them against age dis-crimination. Across the Nation, nearly 5 million State employees no longer have the full protection of Federal law. Recall that in the Boerne decision\u2014 the case that invalidated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which I dis-cussed a moment ago\u2014the Court had begun the process of undermining the ability of the Congress under section 5 of the 14th amendment to enact legisla-tion protecting civil rights. In Kimel, they continued that process. In Kimel, the Court held that Con- gress' 14th amendment power to en-force civil rights refers only to the en-forcement of those rights that the Court itself has declared and not to rights that exist by virtue of valid statutes. Because the Court decided that the Age Discrimination Act goes beyond the general protection the Con-stitution provides when it says that all citizens are entitled to ''equal protec-tion under the law,'' the Court ruled that the right to sue an employer for violations of the act was not ''appro-priate'' and so ruled the act unconsti-tutional. After Kimel, the pattern of the impe- rial judiciary now emerges with some clarity. First, the Court has repudiated over 175 years of nearly unanimous agreement that Congress, not the Court, will decide what constitutes ''necessary and proper'' legislation under any of its, Congress', enumerated powers. Then in a parallel maneuver, the Court has announced that it, not the Congress, will decide what con-stitutes ''appropriate'' remedial legis-lation to enforce civil rights and civil liberties. Let me return for a moment to the Violence Against Women Act, which I began earlier in my speech. Prior to the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act, I held extensive hearings in the Judiciary Committee when I was chairman, compiling voluminous evi-dence on the pattern of violence against women in America. The mas-sive legislative record Congress gen-erated over a 4-year period of those VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec SENATE S7601 July 26, 2000 hearings supported Congress' explicit findings that gender-motivated vio-lence does substantially and directly affect interstate commerce. How? By preventing a discrete group of Ameri-cans, i.e., women, from participating fully in the day-to-day commerce of this country. These are the types of findings, I might add, that were absent when the Congress first enacted the Gun-Free School Zone Act, struck down in the Lopez case. Let me remind you that Congress, when we enacted the civil rights provi-sion invalidated in Morrison, found: [C]rimes of violence motivated by gender have a substantial adverse impact upon interstate commerce by deterring potential victims of violence from traveling inter-state, from engaging in employment in interstate business, from transacting with businesses and in places involved in inter-state commerce. Crimes of violence moti-vated by gender have a substantial adverse effect on interstate commerce by dimin-ishing national productivity, increasing medical and other costs, and decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate products . . . I cannot emphasize enough the seri- ousness of the toll that we found gen-der-motivated violence exacts on inter-state commerce. Such violence denies women an equal opportunity to com-pete in the job market, imposing a heavy burden on our national economy. Witness after witness at the hearing testified that as a result of rape, sexual assault, or domestic abuse, she was fired from, forced to quit, or abandoned her job. As a result of such interference with the ability of women to work, do-mestic violence was estimated to cost employers billions of dollars annually because of absenteeism in the work-place. Indeed, estimates suggested that we spend between $5 and $10 billion a year on health care, criminal justice, and other social costs merely and to-tally as a consequence of violence against women in America. In response to this important na- tional problem, one to which we found the States did not or could not ade-quately respond, Congress enacted my Violence Against Women Act in 1994, which included provisions authorizing women to sue their attackers in Fed-eral court. This statute reflected the legislative branch's judgment that State laws and practices had failed to provide equal and adequate protection to women victimized by domestic vio-lence and sexual assault and that the lawsuit would provide an adequate means of remedying these deficiencies. This was no knee-jerk response to a problem. Congress specifically found that State and Federal laws failed to ''adequately provide victims of gender- motivated crimes the opportunity to vindicate their interests'' and that: . . . existing bias and discrimination in the criminal justice system often deprives vic-tims of crimes of violence motivated by gen-der of equal protection of the laws and the redress to which they are entitled. The funny thing about these explicit congressional findings and this moun-tain of data, as Justice Souter in his dissent called it, showing the effects of violence against women on interstate commerce\u2014the funny thing about this is that the Supreme Court acknowl-edged all of it. They said: We don't challenge that. This is the new height in their impe- rial judicial thinking. That is right. The Court acknowledged all of the find-ings of my committee. In Morrison, the Supreme Court recognized that in con-trast to the lack of findings in the leg-islation on the Gun-Free School Zone case, Lopez, that the civil rights provi-sions of the Violence Against Women Act were supported by ''numerous fac-tual findings'' about the impact of gen-der-motivated violence on interstate commerce. But the Court also acknowledged the failure of the States to address this problem\u2014they acknowledged the States had not addressed it before we did\u2014noting that the assertion that there was a pervasive bias in State jus-tice systems against victims of gender- motivated violence was supported by a ''voluminous congressional record.'' They acknowledged that there was this great impact on interstate commerce. They acknowledged\u2014because I had my staff, over 4 years, survey the laws and the outcomes in all 50 States\u2014that many State courts had a bias against women. So they acknowledged both those predicates. Instead of according the deference typically given to congressional fac-tual findings, supported by, as they said, a voluminous record, and without even the pretense of applying what we lawyers call the ''traditional rational basis test''\u2014that is, if the Congress has a rational basis upon which to make its finding, then we are not going to sec-ond-guess it; that is what we mean by ''rational basis''\u2014the Court simply thought it knew better. This marks the first occasion in more than 60 years that the Supreme Court has rejected explicit factual findings by Congress that a given activity sub-stantially affects interstate commerce. The Court justified this abandonment of deference to Congress by declaring that whether a particular activity sub-stantially affects interstate commerce ''is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question.'' You got this? For the first time in 60 years, since back in the days of the Lochner era, the Supreme Court has come along and said they acknowledge that the Congress has these volumi-nous findings that interstate commerce is affected and the States aren't doing anything to deal with this national problem of violence against women; they are not doing sufficiently enough. There is a bias in their courts. We ac- knowledge that. But they said, not-withstanding that, the question of whether a specific activity substan-tially affects interstate commerce ''is ultimately a judicial rather than a leg-islative question.'' Hang on, here we go back to 1925. As Justice Souter said in his dissent, this has it exactly backwards, for ''the fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for the courts in the first in-stance, but for the Congress, whose in-stitutional capacity for gathering evi-dence and taking testimony far exceeds ours.'' In short, in a decision that reads more like one written in 1930 than in 2000, the Court held that the judicial, not the legislative, branch of the Gov-ernment was better suited to making these decisions on behalf of the Amer-ican people\u2014a conclusion that cer-tainly would have surprised Chief Jus-tice Marshall, the author of the sem-inal commerce clause decision in Gib-bons v. Ogden in the early 1800s. The judgments that the Congress made in enacting the Violence Against Women Act were, in my view, the cor-rect ones. Even if you disagree with me, though, they were the Congress' judgments to make, not the Court's judgments to make. When it struck down the Violence Against Women Act, the Court left lit-tle doubt that it was acting outside its proper judicial role. They said that the commerce clause did not justify the statute because the act of inflicting vi-olence on women is not a ''commer-cial'' act. It said that section 5 of the 14th amendment also did not justify this act because creating a cause of ac-tion against the private perpetrators of violence is not an ''appropriate'' rem-edy for the denial of equal protection that occurs when State law enforce-ment fails vigorously to enforce laws that ought to protect women against such violence. Over the course of this speech today, I have discussed seven significant deci-sions since 1995: Lopez, the gun-free school zones case; Boerne against Flo-res, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act case; Seminole Tribe and Alden, the two decisions prohibiting us from creating judicial enforceable economic rights for State employees; Florida Prepaid, the patent remedy case; Kimel, the Age Discrimination Act case; and finally, Morrison, the Vio-lence Against Women Act case. None of them deal fatal blows to our ability to address these significant na-tional problems, but they each, in varying degrees, make it much more difficult for us to be able to do so. There are two even more important points to make about these cases. First, together, these cases are estab- lishing a pattern of decisions founded on constitutional error\u2014an error that allocates far too much authority to the Federal courts and thereby denies to the elected branches of the Federal Government the legitimate authority vested in it by the Constitution to ad-dress national problems. Second, this is a trend that is fully capable of growing until it does deal telling blows to our ability to address significant national problems. This is not only my assessment; it is shared, for example, by Justice John Paul Ste-vens, who was appointed to the Court VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7602 July 26, 2000 by Gerald Ford. Dissenting in the Kimel case, Justice Stevens has writ-ten that ''the kind of judicial activism manifested in [these cases] represents such a radical departure from the prop-er role of this Court that it should be opposed whenever the opportunity arises.'' That is not J OEBIDEN speaking; that is a sitting member of the Supreme Court appointed by a Republican Presi-dent. It is also shared by Justice David Souter, who was appointed by Presi-dent Bush. Dissenting in the Lopez case, Justice Souter has written that ''it seems fair to ask whether the step taken by the Court today does any-thing but portend a return to the un-tenable jurisprudence from which the Court extricated itself almost 60 years ago.'' He was referring to the Lochner era. It is shared by Justice Breyer, a Clin- ton appointee. Dissenting in College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid, Jus-tice Breyer has written that the Court's decisions on State sovereign immunity ''threaten the Nation's abil-ity to enact economic legislation need-ed for the future in much the way Lochner v. New York threatened the Nation's ability to enact social legisla-tion over 90 years ago.'' Significantly, this imperialist trend can continue to grow and flower in two different places. The Supreme Court itself can continue to write more and more aggressive decisions, cutting deeper and deeper into the people's ca-pacity to govern themselves effectively at a national level. In the short term, perhaps the odds are that this will not occur. Many of the decisions in this pattern have been decided by votes of five Justices to four Justices, and it may be that one or more of the conservative majority has gone about as far as he or she is pre-pared to go at this time. In the longer term, however, we can quite reasonably expect two or three appointments to the Court in the next 4 to 8 years, and if those appointments result in replacing moderate conserv-atives on the Court with activist con-servatives, we have every reason to ex-pect that this trend I have outlined for the last 45 minutes would gain momen-tum. It can also bloom in the lower courts. This may, to some extent, be by design of the Justices who are taking the lead in the Court today. Certainly, many people have remarked on the proclivity of Justice Scalia to author opinions containing sweeping language that cre-ates new ambiguities in the law and which then often provide a hook on which lower court judges can hang their judicial activism. Already, opinions have been written by lower court judges overturning the Superfund legislation, challenging the constitutionality of the Endangered Species Act, calling into doubt Federal protection of wetlands, and evis-cerating the False Claims Act, among others. Not all of these judicial exer- cises can be corrected by the Supreme Court, even if it were inclined to do so, because the Court decides only 80 or so cases a year from the entire Federal system. In concluding, I wish to describe in the most basic terms why the impe-rialist course upon which the Court has embarked constitutes a danger to our established system of government. In case after case, the Court has strayed from its job of interpreting the Constitution and has instead begun to second guess the Congress about the wisdom or necessity of enacted laws. Its opinions declare straightforwardly its new approach: The Court deter-mines whether legislation is ''appro-priate,'' or whether it is proportional to the problem we have validly sought to address, or whether there is enough reason for us to enact legislation that all agree is within our constitutionally defined legislative power. If in the Court's view legislation is not appropriate, or proportional, or grounded in a sufficient sense of ur-gency, it is unconstitutional\u2014even though the subject matter is within Congress' power, and even though Con-gress made extensive findings to sup-port the measure. More significant than the invalida- tion of any specific piece of legislation, this approach annexes to the judiciary vast tracts of what are properly under-stood as the legislative powers. If al-lowed to take root, this expanded version of judicial power will under-mine the project of the American peo-ple, and that project is self-govern-ment, as set forth in the Constitution. To understand the alarm that Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and others have sounded about the Court's pattern of activism, we must understand the way the Constitution structures the Federal Government and the reasons behind that structure. We must also understand the history and the prac-tice that have made the Constitution's blueprint a reality and provide a scale to measure when the balance of power has gone dangerously awry. These con- siderations amply support Justice Ste-vens's assessment of ''a radical depar-ture from the proper role of this Court.'' The Constitution (supplemented by the Declaration of Independence) sets forth the great aspirations and objects of our nation. It does not, however, achieve them. That is the great project of American politics and government: to achieve the country envisioned in those founding documents. The way to meet our aspirations and establish our national identity and our character as a people is through the process of self- government. The Declaration of Independence pro- claims our fundamental commitment to liberty and equality. These commit-ments are by no means self-executing. The history of our nation is in no small part the history of a people struggling to comprehend these commitments and to put these high ideals into practice. The Constitution itself was con- cerned with a more complex function. Whereas the Declaration explained the reasons for splitting from Great Brit- ain, the Constitution was concerned with explaining why the former colo-nies should remain united as a single nation. It was also concerned with the task of providing a government that could fulfill the promise and purposes of union. The Framers who arrived in Philadel- phia to debate and draft the Constitu-tion were no longer immediately ani-mated by an overbearing and oppres-sive government. In fact, our first na-tional government, under the Articles of Confederation, was the precise oppo-site. The emergency that brought the leading citizens of the North American continent together in Philadelphia that Summer of 1787 was the inability of the national government to act in any effective way. These framers saw the vast potential of the new nation with its unparalleled natural and human resources. They saw as well the danger posed by foreign powers and domestic unrest. They realized too that the Confed-eration could never act credibly to ex-ploit the nation's potential or to quell domestic and foreign hostilities. As Alexander Hamilton put it, ''[w]e may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the last stage of na-tional humiliation. There is scarcely anything that can wound the pride or degrade the character of an inde-pendent nation which we do not experi-ence.'' Hamilton urged that the nation rat- ify the Constitution and throw off the ability of the states to constrain the national government: ''Here, my coun-trymen, impelled by every motive that ought to influence an enlightened peo-ple, let us make a firm stand for our safety, our tranquility, our dignity, our reputation. Let us at last break the fatal charm which has too long seduced us from the paths of felicity and pros-perity.'' Indeed, Hamilton may have been un- derstating the degree of the crisis. Gouverneur Morris, a leading delegate from Pennsylvania, warned that ''This country must be united. If persuasion does not unite it, the sword will . . . The scenes of horror attending civil commotion cannot be described . . . The stronger party will then make [traitors] of the weaker; and the Gal-lows & Halter will finish the word of the sword.'' The words of the Constitution's pre- amble are not idle rhetoric. The found-ing generation ratified the Constitu-tion in order to establish a government that could decisively and effectively act to ''provide for the common de-fense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty.'' This is a fundamental constitutional value that must always be brought to bear when construing the Constitution. Yet, it is precisely this constitu- tional value that the Supreme Court VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7603 July 26, 2000 has lost sight of. Consider, for example, Justice Kennedy's statement in the case striking down the Line Item Veto Act. ''A nation cannot plunder its own treasury without putting its Constitu-tion and its survival in peril. The statute before us then is of first importance, for it seems undeniable the Act will tend to restrain persistent excessive spending.'' Who is he to make that judgment? Yet, Justice Kennedy viewed this as completely irrelevant to the statute's constitutionality. He con-curred that the Line Item Veto Act violates separation of powers even though there was no obvious textual basis for this conclusion and no appar-ent threat to any person's liberty. Justice Kennedy is right about one thing. His statement is premised on the view that the Court is not particularly well-suited to make policy or political judgments. This is accurate and no mere happenstance. The Constitution itself structures the judiciary and the political branches differently by de-sign. The Judiciary is made independent of political forces. Judges hold life tenure and salaries that cannot be reduced. The purpose of the entire structure of the judiciary is to leave judges free to apply the technical skills of the legal profession to construe and develop the law, within the confines of what can be fairly deemed legal reasoning. Outside this realm is the realm of policy. Here Congress and the Presi-dent enjoy the superior place, again by constitutional design. The political branches are tied closely to the people, most obviously through popular elec-tions. Between elections, the political branches are properly subject to the public in a host of ways. Moreover, the political branches have wide-ranging access to information through hear-ings, through studies we commission, and through the statistics and data we routinely gather. This proximity to the people and to information makes Congress the most suitable repository of the legislative power; that is, the power to deliberate as agents of the public and to deter-mine what laws and structures will best ''promote the general welfare.'' It is much easier to describe the dis- tinction between the judicial and the legislative power in the abstract than it is to apply in practice. That is why so much of our constitutional history has been devoted to developing doc-trines and traditions that keep the ju-diciary within its proper sphere. After much upheaval, the mid-twen- tieth century yielded a stable and har-monious approach to questions relating to the scope of Congress's powers: these questions are largely for the political branches and the political process to resolve\u2014not the courts. To be sure, the Court has a role in po- licing the outer boundaries of this power, but it is to be extremely def-erential to the specific judgment of Congress that a given statute is a nec-essary and proper exercise of its con- stitutional powers. When the Court fails to defer, as it had during several periods prior to the New Deal, it inevi-tably finds itself making judgments that are far outside the sphere of the judicial power. This is the point of Justice Stevens' warning. The Court is departing from its proper role in scope of power cases. What was initially uncertain, even after Lopez and Boerne, is now inescap-able: This imperial Court, in case after case, is freely imposing its own view of what constitutes sound public policy. This violates a basic theory of govern-ment so carefully set forth in our Con-stitution. In theory, therefore, there is ample reason to expect that the Su-preme Court's recent imperialism will undermine the fundamental value ani-mating the Constitution, and that is the ability of the American people to govern themselves effectively and democratically. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. H AGEL ). The Senator from Michigan. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Missouri up to 7 min-utes for a statement he wishes to make, and I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to do that without losing my right to the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Missouri. Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his kindness to me. I certainly am not the one to object to that unanimous consent. I appreciate that very much. I express my unequivocal support, and I rise to do so for the many efforts that we are making in this Congress to reform U.S. policy on embargoes of food and medicine. Now is the time to reevaluate the policies we have en-gaged in in the past that are perpet-uating losses to America. Food embargoes can be summed up as a big loss: a loss to the U.S. economy, a loss of jobs, a loss of markets. For ex-ample, embargoed countries buy 14 per-cent of the world's total rice, 10 per-cent of the world's total wheat pur-chases, and the list goes on. When we lose those markets for America, we should have a very good reason. There should be some benefit if we are going to give up access to 14 percent of the world's rice import mar-ket, 10 percent of the world's wheat market, for soybean farmers, cattle-men, hog farmers, poultry producers, cotton, and corn farmers. The nation of Cuba, for example, im- ports about 22 million pounds of pork a year. Someone says that is important to the livestock farmers. Feed that pig corn before exporting it, so it is impor-tant to the grain farmers, as well. The embargo causes a loss in Amer- ica's foreign policy. Often we think we will inflict some sort of pressure or in-jury on another country and, instead of hurting them, we help them. I don't think there was any more dramatic case of that than the Soviet grain em- bargo with 17 million tons of grain and those contracts were canceled. Instead of hurting the Soviet Union, they re-placed the contracts in the world mar-ketplace at a $250 million benefit to the Soviet Union. Instead of hurting the former Soviet Union, we helped the former Soviet Union. That particular weapon was dangerous. Using food and medicine as an embargo is dangerous because that weapon backfires. Instead of hurting our opponent, we helped our opponent. Who did we hurt? We hurt the Amer- ican farm agricultural community. We hurt the food processing community. We need to make a commitment to ourselves that we need to reform this area of embargoing food and medicine resources. The provision the Senator from Kan- sas and I and others will likely offer today simply reaffirms what we have been trying to do for some time; that is, to get real reform of humanitarian sanctions. I will cosponsor Senator R OBERTS ' and Senator B AUCUS ' amend- ment. I support it fully. However, the amendment should not be necessary. Twice we have passed sanctions reform for food and medicine in the Senate. Why is it necessary to do this a third time? My clear preference is to pass sanctions reform for all countries, not only for Cuba. We should reform the sanctions regime for all countries, not only Cuba, and we should ensure that future sanctions will not be imposed arbitrarily. Last year, the Senate accepted over- whelmingly, by a vote of 70-28, accept-ed an amendment that I and many of my colleagues offered. That amend-ment lifts food and medicine sanctions across the board, not only applying the lifting of the sanctions to Cuba. When we went to the House-Senate conference, the democratic process was derailed. We were not voted down. The conference was shut down because the votes were there to affect what the Senate had clearly voted in favor of. That is, the reformulation of our policy in regard to food and medicine embar-goes. The conference was shut down by a select few individuals in the Congress who were outside of the conference committee. This reform proposal was then adopt- ed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I am pleased the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has em-braced the concept, which the Senate voted 70-28 in favor of, in spite of the fact this was shot down when the com-mittee was shut down in the conference last year. Once again, this provision passed the Senate this year. Senators D ORGAN and GORTON offered it as an amendment in the agricultural appropriations mark-up, and it was accepted overwhelm-ingly. Once again, we are faced with a House-Senate conference. It would be very troublesome to me if the demo-cratic process is not allowed to work, VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7604 July 26, 2000 especially after we have seen the will of Congress and the American people. That will is clearly expressed as a will to reform and embrace the reform of sanctions imposed by the President. It has passed the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, and it has passed the Sen-ate twice. Some version of this effort has now passed the House of Represent-atives and is broadly supported all across America. I hold in my hand a list of about 50 organizations, dozens and dozens and dozens of organizations, including the American Farm Bureau, the National Farmers Union, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Gulf Ports of the Americas Association, the AFL-CIO. That is a pretty broad set of groups that want to reform this practice of embargoes. I ask unanimous consent to have this list printed in the R ECORD .

Mr. ASHCROFT. We are today offer- ing yet another amendment because there is concern that the democratic process in the agricultural appropria-tions House-Senate conference will not be respected. Let me be clear. We would not have to be here today offering this amend-ment that says ''don't enforce the law,'' if we in the Congress were al-lowed to change the law, which is the purpose of Congress. If you don't want to change the law, you don't need a Congress. You can have the same laws all the time. We found a law that is not working; we should change the law. This amend-ment will be a ''don't enforce the law'' amendment, but the truth is, our prior expressions on this are clear. We ought to change the law so we won't have to talk about withdrawing funding for en-forcement. My preference is to get this issue re- solved in the agricultural appropria-tions conference and pass embargo re-form for all countries and for future sanctions. We need to send real embar-go reform to the President's desk this year. That should be our objective. I will support this amendment today which I am cosponsor of, but real re-form, and reforming the regime, the framework in which these sanctions are proposed, is what we ought to do. It is what we have done. I believe, ulti-mately, it is what we will do for the benefit of not only those who work in agriculture and who respect foreign policy but for future generations and the relations of the United States with other countries. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Michigan. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Treas- ury-Postal appropriations bill includes a provision to establish a special post-age stamp called the semipostal, in-tended to raise funds for programs to reduce domestic violence. I am a very strong supporter of pro- grams to reduce domestic violence\u2014I believe Congress should fully fund those programs\u2014but I do not agree that another semipostal issue should be mandated by the Congress. Semipostals are stamps that are sold with a surcharge on top of the regular first-class postage rate, with the extra revenue earmarked for a designated cause. Those causes are invariably causes which I think most, if not all, support. They are very appealing causes that come to Congress and ask to require the Postal Service to issue a stamp that has an amount for first- class postage more than the regular 33 cents amount, with the difference going to their cause. The one and only time that we ever did that was for an extraordinarily worthy cause\u2014breast cancer research. The question now is whether we are going to continue down that road and, as a Congress, mandate the Postal Service to issue those stamps for a whole bunch of causes that are com-peting with each other for us to man-date the Postal Service to issue such a stamp. Section 414 of this bill says: In order to afford the public a convenient way to contribute to funding for domestic vi-olence programs, the Postal Service shall es-tablish a special rate of postage for first- class mail under this section. It then goes on to describe what that rate shall be. It says in part of this sec-tion that: It is the sense of the Congress that nothing in this section should directly or indirectly cause a net decrease in total funds received by the Department of Justice or any other agency of the Government, or any compo-nent or program thereof below the level that would otherwise have been received but for the enactment of this section. I am not sure how this can possibly be enforced. But that is just one of the problems, not the basic problem, with this language. As I indicated, the first and only ex- ample in American history of a semipostal stamp being issued was the breast cancer research stamp which re-quired the Postal Service to turn over extra revenue, less administrative costs, to the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense for its breast cancer research pro-grams. That stamp broke tradition in Congress, not just because it was the first semipostal in our Nation's history but also because it was the first time that Congress mandated the issuance of any stamp in 40 years. I think our tradition of keeping Congress out of the stamp selection process has worked with respect to commemorative stamps, and I believe we should follow that with respect to semipostals as well. For the last 40 years, Congress has deferred to the Postal Service and to an advisory board which it has set up, nonpartisan, out of politics, objective. That Citizens' Stamp Advisory Com-mittee recommends subjects for the commemorative stamp program. That committee, the Citizens' Stamp Advi-sory Committee, was created more than four decades ago to take politics out of the stamp selection process. Committee members review thousands of stamp subjects each year and select only a small number that they believe will be educational and interesting to the public and meet the goals of the Postal Service. Although Congress advises that advi- sory committee on stamp subjects by making recommendations through let-ters that we send or through sense-of- Congress resolutions, until now, for the last 40 years, Congress has left the de-cisionmaking on stamp issuance up to the Postal Service. This is what the Postal Service says about the role of the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee: The U.S. Postal Service is proud of its role in portraying the American experience to a world audience through the issuance of post-age stamps and postal stationery. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7605 July 26, 2000 Almost all subjects chosen to appear on U.S. stamps and postal stationery are sug-gested by the public. Each year, Americans submit proposals to the Postal Service on literally thousands of different topics. Every stamp suggestion is considered, regardless of who makes it or how it is presented. On behalf of the Postmaster General, the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee (CSAC) is tasked with evaluating the merits of all stamp proposals. Established in 1957, the Committee provides the Postal Service with a ''breadth of judgment and depth of experi-ence in various areas that influence subject matter, character and beauty of postage stamps.'' The Committee's primary goal is to select subjects for recommendation to the Post-master General that are both interesting and educational. In addition to Postal Service's extensive line of regular stamps, approxi-mately 25 to 30 new subjects for commemora-tive stamps are recommended each year. Stamp selections are made with all postal customers in mind, not just stamp collec-tors. A good mix of subjects, both interesting and educational, is essential. Committee members are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Postmaster Gen-eral. The Committee is composed of 15 mem-bers whose backgrounds reflect a wide range of educational, artistic, historical and pro- fessional expertise. All share an interest in philately and the needs of the mailing pub-lic. The Committee itself employs no staff. The Postal Service's Stamp Development group handles Committee administrative matters, maintains Committee records and responds to as many as 50,000 letters received annually recommending stamp subjects and designs. The Committee meets four times yearly in Washington, D.C. At the meetings, the mem-bers review all proposals that have been re-ceived since the previous meeting. No in-per-son appeals by stamp proponents are per-mitted. The members also review and pro-vide guidance on artwork and designs for stamp subjects that are scheduled to be issued. The criteria established by this inde-pendent group ensure that stamp subjects have stood the test of time, are consistent with public opinion and have broad national interest. Ideas for stamp subjects that meet the CSAC criteria may be addressed to the Citi-zens' Stamp Advisory Committee, c/o Stamp Development, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza, SW, Room 4474E, Wash-ington, D.C. 20260-2437. Subjects should be submitted at least three years in advance of the proposed date of issue to allow sufficient time for consideration and for design and production, if the subject is approved. The Postal Service has no formal proce- dures for submitting stamp proposals. This allows everyone the same opportunity to suggest a new postage stamp. All proposals are reviewed by the Citizens' Stamp Advi-sory Committee regardless of how they are submitted, i.e., postal cards, letters or peti-tions. Afer a proposal is determined not to vio- late the criteria set by CSAC, research is done on the proposed stamp subject. Each new proposed subject is listed on the CSAC's agenda for its next meeting. The CSAC con-siders all new proposals and takes one of sev-eral actions: it may reject the new proposal, it may set it aside for consideration for fu-ture issue or it may request additional infor-mation and consider the subject at its next meeting. If set aside for consideration, the subject remains ''under consideration'' in a file maintained for the Committee. What is important about all that is that there are very clear procedures where every citizen of this country can make a recommendation to the com-mittee which has certain basic criteria to determine the eligibility of subjects for commemoration on U.S. stamps. These criteria are set forth for the gen-eral public to see\u201412 major areas guide the selection. It is a general policy that U.S. postage stamps and stationery primarily will feature American or American-related subjects. No living person shall be honored by por- trayal on U.S. postage. Commemorative stamps or postal sta- tionery items honoring individuals usually will be issued on, or in conjunction with sig-nificant anniversaries of their birth, but no postal item will be issued sooner than ten years after the individual's death. The only exception to the ten-year rule is the issuance of stamps honoring deceased U.S. presidents. They may be honored with a memorial stamp on the first birth anniversary fol-lowing death. Events of historical significance shall be considered for commemoration only on anni-versaries in multiples of 50 years. Only events and themes of widespread na- tional appeal and significance will be consid-ered for commemoration. Events or themes of local or regional significance may be rec-ognized by a philatelic or special postal can-cellation, which may be arranged through the local postmaster. Stamps or stationery items shall not be issued to honor fraternal, political, sec-tarian, or service/charitable organizations that exist primarily to solicit and/or dis-tribute funds. Nor shall stamps be issued to honor commercial enterprises or products. These criteria\u2014I have just read six of them; there are a total of 12\u2014are set forth for the public to see and for ev-erybody to have a fair chance, accord-ing to certain criteria set forth in ad-vance to have a recommendation con-sidered. The stamp advisory committee, how- ever, does not issue semipostals. One of the questions we need to face as a Con-gress is whether or not, given the fact we now are beginning to authorize semipostage such as the breast cancer research, semipostal, it would not be better for us to authorize the advisory committee of the Postal Service to be performing this important function. The problem is that since the breast cancer research stamp has been author-ized, we have had dozens of requests for a semipostal stamp. This is a list of some of the bills that have been intro-duced. These are just the bills that have been introduced for semipostal: AIDS research and education; diabetes research; Alzheimer's disease research; prostate cancer research; emergency food relief in the United States; organ and tissue donation awareness; World War II memorial; the American Battle Monuments Commission; domestic vio-lence programs; vanishing pro-tection safety; domestic violence pro-grams\u2014a second bill; another bill on organ and tissue donation awareness; childhood literacy. There are not too many of us, I be- lieve, who are about to vote against a stamp that could raise\u2014could raise, I emphasize\u2014some funds because the cost of these issues are supposed to be deducted from the receipts, but I do not believe there are too many of us who are in a position where we would want to vote against a stamp or any-thing else that could assist AIDS re-search, diabetes research, Alzheimer's disease, prostate cancer research, or organ and tissue donation. Many of us have devoted a great deal of our lives to those and other causes such as the World War II memorial and the Na-tional Battle Monuments Commission. When the breast cancer research stamp was approved, I voted against it. I was one of the few who did. That cre-ated for me, and for others who voted no, the prospect that somebody would then say I opposed funds for breast can-cer research, which obviously I do not. In a split second, I would have voted to increase the appropriation for breast cancer research by the amount of money which might have been raised by this stamp so we could give to NIH an amount of money at least equal to what might be raised by such a stamp. Obviously, I am not opposed to addi-tional funds. Indeed, the opposite is true. What does trouble me, however, is that we are now beginning a course which will politicize the issuance of stamps again in this country. We had taken politics out of it by the creation of an advisory committee. For 40 years this advisory committee, and this advi-sory committee alone, has decided and made the recommendation to the Post-al Service what commemoratives will be issued. They have not issued any semipostals nor were any issued by this country until the breast cancer re-search stamp was approved. Now in this bill we have another good cause, money which would go to pro-grams aimed at reducing domestic vio-lence. There is no doubt about the va-lidity of the cause. The problem is that we have no criteria, that we do this ad hoc, helter-skelter. We have already authorized one stamp, which I will get to in a moment, that relates to grade crossing safety. This is on the calendar, approved by the Governmental Affairs Committee, not yet approved by the Senate. This is going to unleash a politicization proc-ess of the issuance of stamps which I do not believe will benefit this Nation. I think it will be incredibly difficult for the Postal Service, which does not want us to require the issuance of semipostals. They are still sorting through the breast cancer research stamp costs. We should reauthorize the breast cancer research stamp because we have already authorized the stamp and it has been printed, and unless we reauthorize it, then this program will run out. This is a very different issue from voting for an additional issue, and the next, and the next. I will spend a couple of minutes this afternoon talking about what happened with another semipostal stamp which was proposed in a bill and was approved by the committee. I did not vote for it VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7606 July 26, 2000 in the Governmental Affairs Com- mittee, not because I oppose its cause, but, again, for what this is going to un-leash upon us in terms of politics\u2014 issuance of stamps and using the issuance of stamps to raise money for causes which will then be vying against each other. I do not think that is in anybody's interest. The one example on which I want to focus for a few moments is a proposal which has already been approved by the Governmental Affairs Committee, and that is what is called the Look, Listen, and Live Stamp Act. That bill requires the Postal Service to issue a semipostal stamp for an organization called Operation Lifesaver. Operation Lifesaver is a nonprofit or- ganization which is dedicated to high-way and rail safety through education. Operation Lifesaver seems to be a fine organization, but it is not the only or-ganization which is committed to pre-venting railroad casualties. As a mat-ter of fact, railway safety advocates are split on the issue of grade crossing safety and the best method to prevent rail-related injuries. Operation Life-saver, for example, emphasizes safety through education, while other railway safety advocates promote safety by funding automatic lights and gates at railway crossings. After the Governmental Affairs Com- mittee reported this stamp proposal, railroad safety organizations contacted my office to represent their disagree-ment with the ''look, listen, and live stamp'' primarily because of the em-phasis that one organization, Oper-ation Lifesaver, puts on education and education only. The president of a group called the Coalition for Safer Crossings wrote me the following letter: Dear Senator L EVIN: I personally find Oper- ation Lifesaver spin on education appalling. Three and a half years ago, I lost a very dear and close friend of mine at an unprotected crossing in southwestern Illinois. Eric was nineteen. I fought to close the crossing where Eric was killed and since helped many families after the loss of a loved one through my organization, the Coalition for Safer Crossings. And now today, we are moving forward with other smaller organizations to form a national organization to combat cer-tain types of education being put out by other groups and to help victims' families and help change the trend of escalating colli-sions. The National Railroad Safety Coali-tion is comprised of families and friends of victims of railroad car collisions, unlike Op-eration Lifesaver. Again, Operation Lifesaver is the group that is going to receive the net dollars that will be raised by the issuance of this ''look, listen, and live stamp.'' Then the head of this competing group says: I personally and professionally oppose this measure. If the United States Congress is truly concerned about this issue of railroad crossing safety and is dead set on making stamps, then you should make a railroad safety stamp not a Operation Lifesaver stamp. And rather than have the money go to their type of education, have it go to-wards the States funds for grade crossing up- grades in that State. A matching dollar scheme comes to mind from the State. He concludes: I am currently 23 years old. When I was in high school, I received the same driver safety training regarding grade crossings safety as my best friend Eric did. Eric is now gone. The funds from this proposed stamp would not have helped him. Now if this stamp would have been around prior to 1996 and funds were allocated to the State of Illinois for hardware and a set of automatic lights and gates were installed at this crossing in question I wouldn't be writing you this let-ter today. I hope you understand the dif-ference. Mr. President, at the time that this stamp was approved in the Govern-mental Affairs Committee, I submitted minority views on this issue. In part, this is what I wrote just about a year ago this month: For over 40 years, the U.S. Postal Service has relied on the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee to review and select stamp sub-jects that are interesting and educational. The committee chooses the subjects of U.S. stamps using as its criteria, 12 major guide-lines, established about the time of the Post-al Reorganization Act. [They] have guided the committee in its decisionmaking func-tion for decades. The tenth criteria guiding [their] selection makes reference to semi-postal stamps, the type of stamp that the Postal Service would be required to issue if the Look, Listen, and Live Stamp Act were enacted. With respect to semi-postals, the guidelines state, ''Stamps or postal stationery items with added values, referred to as 'semi-postals,' shall not be issued. Due to the vast majority of worthy fund-raising organizations in ex-istence, it would be difficult to single out specific ones to receive such revenue. There is also a strong U.S. tradition of private fund-raising for charities, and the adminis-trative costs involved in accounting for sales would tend to negate the revenues derived.'' This position was also reflected in a . . . let-ter from Postmaster General William Hen-derson. He has also cautioned and urged our committee not to mandate the issuance of specific semipostals. So I do not believe that we can and should be in the business of deciding to promote one worthy charity over an-other, one specific organization over another. This stamp, the one that is now on the calendar\u2014not the one in this bill; the one on the calendar\u2014for safety at railway crossings is, it seems to me, an example of a stamp that may not be workable, and yet the full Gov-ernmental Affairs Committee has re-ported this bill out. Then what are we to do? We are going to be presented with a number of proposals relative to semipostals. Many of our colleagues have intro-duced bills. The bill before us has such a provision. I believe the answer comes from Representative M CHUGHand Rep- resentative F ATTAH , who are the chair- man and the ranking member of the House Government Reform Sub- committee on the Postal Service. They put their views in a bill, H.R. 4437, which passed the House of Representa-tives on July 17. It gives the Postal Service the au- thority to issue semipostals. It re-quires the Postal Service to establish regulations, before issuing any stamp, relating to, first, which office within the Postal Service shall be responsible for making decisions with respect to semipostals; two, what criteria and procedures shall be applied in making those decisions; and, three, what limi-tations shall apply, such as whether more than one semipostal will be of-fered at any one time. The McHugh bill also requires the Postal Service to establish how the costs incurred by the Postal Service as a result of any semipostal are to be computed, recovered, and kept to a minimum. One thing we learned from the breast cancer semipostal is that the Postal Service did not establish an accurate accounting system for track-ing the cost of semipostals. According to a recently released GAO report, ''Breast Cancer Research Stamp, Millions Raised for Research, But Better Cost Recovery Criteria Needed''\u2014that is the title of the re-port\u2014the Postal Service did not track all monetary or other resources used in developing and selling the breast can-cer research stamp. They kept track of some costs but were not able to deter-mine the full costs of developing and selling the stamp. Postal officials obvi-ously should keep track of both reve-nues and their full costs so that the ap-propriate net can be determined for de-livery to that particular cause. The McHugh bill is before this body. The McHugh bill, in addition to au-thorizing the issuance of semipostals by the stamp advisory committee, also reauthorizes the breast cancer research stamp. It does both things. I hope this body will take up this bill and adopt this kind of procedure in order to at-tempt to take this issue out of politics and not put us in a position where we have to vote between a stamp raising money for AIDS research or diabetes research or Alzheimer's research or prostate cancer research, organ and tissue donation research, the World War II Memorial, domestic violence, and on and on. I doubt very much that we would want to vote no to any of those. Yet we cannot possibly have all of them at once. The Postal Service cannot pos-sibly handle the accounting, the deliv-ery, the sale of all those stamps. They have urged us very strongly not to be authorizing and mandating the issuance of those stamps. So I hope that when the bill comes before us, which I hope will be any time, we will reauthorize the breast cancer research stamp. Again, even though I voted against it, for the rea-sons I have given here this afternoon, nonetheless I think, given the fact that the stamps have been printed and that effort is already underway, and the huge number of people who have al-ready been involved in promoting the sale, and the women and men from around this country who have gone out of their way to use that stamp are in VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, S7607 July 26, 2000 place\u2014they have been operating; they have been very successful, very produc-tive with millions of dollars that will be raised, the pluses of continuing to reauthorize that stamp, once it has been issued, and once that effort is un-derway, outweigh the negatives, which I have outlined this afternoon. At the same time, I hope that the rest of the McHugh bill will be adopted by us so that we can put into place cri-teria which will make it a lot easier for us to have a sensible system for the issuance of semipostals. Mr. President, on a matter that re- lates directly to this bill, because it is a Treasury bill, I want to just spend a few minutes talking about the issue of the budget surplus, and the response of the Congress to that budget surplus. I want to use, as my text, and then intersperse some comments into it, a memorandum that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jacob Lew, wrote on the effect of con-gressional legislative action on the budget surplus. This is what the OMB Director wrote: This memo is in response to your request that OMB assess the effect of legislative ac-tion on the budget surplus. Over the past six months, Congress has passed nine major tax cuts resulting in a cost of $712 billion over ten years. Draining this sum from the United States Treasury reduces the amount of debt reduction we can accomplish, thereby in-creasing debt service costs by $201 billion over ten years. Therefore, the Congressional tax cuts passed to date will draw a total of $913 billion from the projected surplus. In addition, the Congressional majority has stated clearly that its tax cuts to date represent only a ''down payment'' in a long series of tax cuts it intends to realize. While there has been little specificity about the size and nature of the entire program, the full range of action taken by the 106th Con-gress, both last year and this, provides an in-dication of the total impact of the Congres-sional tax cut proposals on the surplus. In the first session of the 106th Congress, the majority passed one large measure, which included a variety of tax cuts totaling $792 billion. Excluding certain individual tax cuts which passed this year as well as last year (such as elimination of the estate tax and the marriage penalty), the cost of tax cuts passed last year amounts to $737 billion, and the additional debt service amounts to $148 billion for a total of $885 billion. Jacob Lew goes on as follows: The bill-by-bill approach to tax cuts in the absence of an overall framework masks the full impact and risks of the cumulative cost. I will repeat that because that is the heart of the matter. The bill-by-bill approach to tax cuts in the absence of an overall framework masks the full impact and the risks of the cumulative cost. In the absence of more specific indica-tions about the content and number of fu-ture tax cuts the congressional majority has stated it plans to produce, we have used the total costs associated with tax cuts from the 106th Congress as an illustration of Repub-lican plans. If their plans remain consistent with the past activity, the full cost of this program would be: \u2014tax cuts of $1.44 trillion \u2014additional debt service of $349 billion \u2014for a total of $1.796 trillion. The effect of such tax cuts would be to completely eliminate the projected non-So-cial Security/Medicare budget surplus at the end of ten years. Even by the more opti-mistic projections the entire surplus would be drained. The most recent CBO projections issued earlier this week estimate a ten-year non-Social Security/Medicare surplus of $1.8 ten-year non-Social Security/Medicare sur-plus of $1.5 trillion. In either case, because the costs of the tax cuts match or exceed the projected budget surplus, there would be no funds available for any of the nation's other pressing needs, including our proposals to es-tablish a new voluntary Medicare prescrip-tion drug benefit, pay an additional $150 bil-lion in debt reduction to pay down the debt by 2012, expand health coverage to more fam-ilies, provide targeted tax cuts that help America's working families with the cost of college education, long-term care, child care and other needs, or extend the life of Social Security and Medicare. Those are the options we are going to be faced with in the next few months, whether or not we want to take this projected surplus of either $1.5 trillion or $1.8 trillion\u2014we are only talking about the non-Social Security, non- Medicare surplus\u2014whether we want to take that surplus, which the CBO esti-mates is $1.8 trillion and the OMB esti-mates is $1.5 trillion, and use that al-most exclusively or exclusively for the tax cuts which have been proposed, or whether we want to use a significant part of that surplus to pay down the national debt faster, to establish a new voluntary prescription drug benefit, to expand health coverage, to expand op-portunity for college education, and to extend the life of Social Security and Medicare. I want to put in the R ECORD in a mo- ment the list of the pending tax cuts in the 106th Congress which Jack Lew makes reference to, the $934 billion, ap-proximately, in the 10-year cost. These are bills which have been passed by one body or another or one committee or another in one body: Marriage Penalty Conference Committee, $293 billion; So-cial Security tier 2 repeal, $117 billion; estate tax in the House $105 billion; the Patients' Bill of Rights in the House, $69 billion; the communications excise tax, $55 billion; the Taxpayers Bill of Rights, $7 billion; then the subtraction for provisions in multiple bills and so forth. Then you have to add the inter-est costs of these tax cuts. That comes out to be about $900 billion. I ask unanimous consent to print this list in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: PENDING TAX CUTS IN THE 106TH CONGRESS [10-year cost, in billions of dollars] Tax Legislation (Body Passed): Marriage Penalty (Conf.

Mr. President, there are problems with each of the major tax bills. I may spend a moment on each of those problems. On the estate tax bill, it has problems. There is an alternative which is a better alternative, which would help more people. For those rel-atively few people who do pay an estate tax, the alternative Democratic plan would provide immediate relief\u2014100 percent relief to people who have less than $8 million per couple for family farms and small businesses; total and immediate relief for those people in the alternative plan. The bill which has been adopted has a major problem in that it favors upper income individuals, the wealthiest among us, and most of its benefits go to those people rather than the people who need this the most, which are indi-viduals and married couples who have estates that might be, in the case of a family farm or small business, $8 mil-lion or less. But there is a bigger prob-lem, whether we are talking about re-peal of the estate tax or the marriage penalty tax. And there\u2014regarding the marriage penalty, we have an alter-native as well which would benefit a larger number of low and moderate in-come people with a greater benefit in-stead of a group of people who are at the upper end of the income level. The major problem I have with these tax bills is that when you put them all to-gether, what it means is that we would not be able to apply this surplus to re-duction of the national debt. I am out there, as all of us are, in our home States. I talk to people and ask people in all the meetings I have: What do you primarily want us to spend the surplus on? Do you want tax cuts\u2014put-ting aside for the moment whether they benefit upper income folks or ben-efit working families, put aside that issue for the moment; that is a major issue\u2014do you basically want us to take this $1.8 trillion and pay down the na-tional debt? Or do you want that to go in tax cuts? Overwhelmingly, repeatedly, I hear back from people, they want us to pay down the national debt. Whether we are talking about younger people, mid-dle-age people, older people, they all come to the same conclusion: No. 1, we can't be sure the surplus will be that large so don't spend it all on anything, be it tax cuts or other programs. Spend most of it on protecting the future economy of the United States. Spend most of it on that $6 trillion debt that has been rung up\u2014to reduce the amount of that debt, to try to assure that the economy, which we now have humming, will stay humming; that an economy which we finally have at a VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7608 July 26, 2000 point where we don't add to the na- tional debt with annual deficits each year, that is healthy in terms of inter-est rates and job creation and in low inflation, that that economy will be there for us next year, next decade, next generation. I believe that is what the American people overwhelmingly want us to do. We can argue, and we should, and we can debate, and we should, which es-tate tax proposal is a better estate tax proposal. That is a legitimate debate. We obviously have an alternative to the one that was adopted which is tar-geted to the people who need it the most, people who have farms and small businesses and estates worth up to $8 million, people who are still paying an estate tax even though it might mean in some cases that they could lose that family farm. Our alternative provides total relief to those families and imme-diate relief to those families, unlike the one that was passed by the Repub-lican majority which gives most of its cuts to the people who need it the least, people who are in the higher brackets, higher asset levels, and phases it in and then only does it par-tially. We should, and we do, debate those issues: Which alternative plans on the estate tax or on the marriage penalty tax provide the fairest kind of tax re-lief to the people who need it the most. But the underlying issue, which is one I hope we will keep in mind, is whether or not we want to commit this pro-jected surplus of almost $2 trillion in 10 years to any of these proposals to the extent that we have. Be it tax cuts or be it efforts to improve education or health care or what have you, it is my hope and belief that the greatest con-tribution we can make to our children and to their children is to protect this economy, to try to keep an economy, which is now doing so well, healthy in future years, as it has been in the past few years. That means we need to pro-tect that surplus, not spend it; not use it for tax cuts on the assumption that there is going to be $1.8 trillion or $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, because there is too much uncertainty in that, because our people sense\u2014and cor-rectly\u2014that we do not know for cer-tain that that budget surplus will in fact be there. There has been recent public opinion polling which seems to me illu-minating on this subject. When people are asked whether or not they want to protect Social Security and Medicare and pay down the debt, or whether or not they think passing a tax cut is the better way to go, 75 percent believe protecting Social Security and paying down the debt is the most important priority we have right now. Only 23 percent favor passing tax cuts as an al-ternative. When asked the question of whether or not the trillion-dollar tax cut package that was passed last year, without a penny for Medicare, and whether or not the tax cuts that are being added this year to the same amount, still without a penny for Medicare, is the better way to go, 63 percent say no, 32 percent say yes. So the public senses that with the surplus we have, the proportion we project, the best thing we can do to protect our economy and the best thing we can do with that projected surplus is in fact to pay down the debt, protect Medicare, and to target our efforts on some of the needs we have as a coun-try, rather than to provide for the kind of tax cuts that we have seen the Re-publicans enact. What I have said about the estate tax is also true relative to the marriage penalty bill. We have two alter-natives\u2014the one that passed, but we also have an alternative that did not pass, which provides targeted, com-prehensive relief and is fiscally more responsible because it leaves more for debt reduction and, therefore, overall is a better value for the American tax-payer. The alternative completely eliminates the penalty in all of its forms, not just in a few, as the mar-riage tax penalty legislation we passed does. The Democratic alternative eliminates it for couples earning up to $100,000, which is 80 percent of all mar-ried couples, and it costs $29 billion per year when fully phased in. The plan that was adopted, the Re- publican plan, confers 40 percent of its benefits on taxpayers who currently suffer a penalty. In other words, only 40 percent of the benefits of the Repub-lican plan go to taxpayers who cur-rently actually suffer a penalty. The rest of the people who get a benefit in the Republican plan either don't suffer a penalty\u2014indeed they received a bonus when they got married\u2014or are left untouched one way or another. And the Republican plan addresses only 3 of the 65 instances of the penalty in the Tax Code, whereas the Demo-cratic alternative plan addresses every place in the Tax Code where the mar-riage penalty exists. And the Repub-lican plan costs $40 billion when fully phased in as compared to $29 billion per year for the alternative Democratic plan. So, again, it seems to me it is a pret- ty clear choice that we have: Do we want a plan that is targeted to people who earn under $100,000, that confers benefits on people who are truly penal-ized when they are married, in terms of the taxes they pay, and a plan that does so at a cost significantly less than in the Republican plan that was adopt-ed? Or do we want to adopt the more costly plan, most of the benefits of which go to people who are in the upper income brackets, and then do not address totally the problem that exists for those people who do suffer a tax penalty upon marriage? The same thing is true with the over- all tax cut that has been proposed. We have basically two alternatives that have been set forth to the American people, not yet put in the legislative form, but which have been proposed by Governor Bush and Vice President G ORE. According to the Citizens For Tax Justice, the distribution of bene-fits of the Bush plan basically provides that 10 percent of the taxpayers get 60 percent\u2014the upper 10 percent, the top 10 percent of taxpayers, get 60 percent of the benefits; the bottom 60 percent of the taxpayers get 12 percent of the benefits. That is the tax plan that has been proposed by Governor Bush. It would reduce revenues by $460 bil- lion over the first 5 fiscal years, and by $1.3 trillion over 9 fiscal years, plus an additional $265 billion in associated in-terest costs. That is an extraordinarily expensive plan. We haven't seen that yet in legislative form, and I am not sure we will. Nonetheless, the Amer-ican people are again going to be pre-sented with very different approaches as to how we should use the surplus. Some people say, ''Senator, that is our money you are talking about; what is wrong with the tax cut?'' My answer is that it is our money, your money. It is also our economy. It is also our So-cial Security program. It is also our Medicare program. It is also our edu-cation program. It is our health care program. So the argument that this money be- longs to the people of the United States is clearly true. I think it is un-deniable. I can't imagine anybody sug-gesting that anything in the Treasury is anything but the property of the people of the United States. But the other half of that, which is too often left out, is that the economy, which is now healthy, belongs to the people of the United States. They have made it possible, through their work, for us to have a strong economy. Keeping that economy healthy is also the job of this Congress, as well as the job of the peo-ple of the United States. The Social Security system, which has made such a difference for so many that the poverty rate among seniors is now 5 percent, compared to the poverty rate among children, which is 20 per-cent, mainly because of the existence of Social Security\u2014that program be-longs to the people of the United States. Protecting that program is also our responsibility. So to say that, yes, the surplus belongs to the people is true. But the Medicare program, Social Security program, health care pro-gram, education program also belong to the people of the United States. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Wisconsin. Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss mov-ing to the Treasury-Postal appropria-tions bill. I agree with the Majority Leader and others who have come to the floor this year to insist that we do the people's business, and that the people's business means completing all of the appropria-tions bills. There are several very important amendments that will be proposed to this legislation, and we must give them the time and consideration they de-serve. I may well vote against the VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, SENATE S7609 July 26, 2000 Treasury-Postal appropriations bill in the end, but I recognize the importance of taking it up, considering it, and get-ting it done. We have got to take care of the un- finished business. We have more appropriations bills to consider, and we have other business as well, as my colleagues are well aware. I find it interesting to look at some of the other measures we have consid-ered, and still might consider, this year. I am talking about priorities\u2014what we get done on this floor, and what gets ignored. As I said, it is essential that we pass these appropriations bills\u2014they are the core of the people's business, because they keep the government up and run-ning. But beyond bills like Treasury-Post- al, what are we choosing to do? Recently, we chose to consider a re- peal of the estate tax. As I said during that debate, the estate tax affects only the wealthiest property-holders. In 1997, only 42,901 estates paid the tax. That's the wealthiest 1.9 percent. Peo-ple are already exempt from the tax in 98 out of 100 cases. Let me repeat that: Already, under current law, 98 out of 100 do not pay any estate tax. The Republican estate tax repeal would give the wealthiest 2,400 es-tates\u2014the ones that pay now half the estate tax\u2014an average tax cut of $3.4 million each. And remember, 98 out of 100 people would get zero, nothing, from this estate tax cut. Now, this doesn't sound like some- thing most Americans are clamoring for. It is of no use to most Americans, in fact. But it is of use to a very small\u2014 but wealthy\u2014group of people. Those who are wealthy enough to be subject to estate taxes have great po-litical power. They can make unlimited political contributions, and they are represented in Washington by influential lobbyists that have pushed hard to get the estate tax bill to the floor. The estate tax is one of those issues where political money seems to have an impact on the legislative outcome. That's why I recently Called the Bank-roll on some of the interests behind that bill, to give my colleagues and the public a sense of the huge amount of money at stake\u2014not taxes, but polit-ical contributions. We considered that bill not because it affected the vast majority of Ameri-cans, but because it directly affected the pocketbooks of a wealthy few. A similar point can be made about another piece of legislation, the H-1B bill. We haven't considered it yet, but we may well yet, and so far a terrific ef-fort has been made by both sides to see it taken up. Why? Why, when we have more ap- propriations bills to consider, when we have the real people's business to do, are we pushing so hard to take up H- 1B? Because the high-tech industry wants this bill to get done. In the case of H-1B, I'm not address- ing the merits of the legislation\u2014 I am not necessarily opposed to raising the level of H-1B visas. Instead I want to point out what is on our agenda and why? Why is it that we have this set of legislation as part of our agenda? The high tech industry wants to get this bill passed, and they have the po-litical contributions to back it up. American Business for Legal Immi- gration, a coalition which formed to fight for an increase in H-1B visas, of-fers a glimpse of the financial might behind proponents of H-1Bs. ABLI is chock full of big political donors, and not just from one industry, but from several different industries that have an interest in bringing more high-tech workers into the U.S. Price Waterhouse Coopers, pharma- ceutical company Eli Lilly, tele-communications giant and former Baby Bell BellSouth, and software company Oracle, to name just a few. All have given hundreds of thousands of dollars in this election cycle alone, and they want us to pass H-1B. We all know this. This is standard procedure these days for wealthy interests \u2014you have got to pay to play on the field of politics. You've got to pony up for quarter-mil-lion dollar soft money contributions and half-million dollar issue ad cam-paigns, and anyone who can't afford the price of admission is going to be left out in the cold. I Call the Bankroll to point out what goes on behind the scenes on various bills\u2014the millions in PAC and soft money that wealthy donors give, and what they expect to get in return. And yet we don't do anything about it. We took a small but important step toward better disclosure of the activity of wealthy donors earlier this summer when we passed the 527 disclosure bill. But there is a great deal more to do. We are going to keep pushing until we address the other gaping loopholes in the campaign finance law. Right now, wealthy interests have the power to help set the political agenda. Wealthy interests spend unlimited amounts of money to push for bills which serve the interests of the wealthy few at the expense of most Americans. We have got to question why consider some bills on this floor while we ignore so many crucial issues the American people care about\u2014like increasing the minimum wage and supporting work-ing families. But instead we are left with an agen- da that looks like wealthy America's ''to do'' list. How does it happen, Mr. President?\u2014 It's all about access, and access is all about money. Both parties openly promise, and even advertise, that big donors get big access to party leaders. Weekend retreats and other ''special events'' where wealthy individuals have the chance to talk about what they want done\u2014whether that might be a repeal of the estate tax, or that their company wants to see the H-1B bill passed this year. Needless to say, that is the kind of access most Americans can't even dream of. And I have to wonder why we aren't doing anything about that. I am all for the doing people's busi- ness, and right now the people's busi-ness should be the Treasury-Postal Ap-propriations bill, and that's why I sup-port the motion to proceed, even though I may well vote against the un-derlying bill in the end. But I don't think that an issue like the repeal of the estate tax is the peo-ple's business\u2014not 98 out of every hun-dred people, anyway. We need to get at the heart of what is wrong here. Our priorities are warped by the undue influence of money in this cham-ber. We have got to change our priorities, and do it now, by putting campaign fi-nance reform back on the agenda. Because the best way to loosen the grip of wealthy interests is to close the loophole that swallowed the law: soft money. Soft money has exploded over the past few years. Soft money is the culprit that brought us the scandals of 1996\u2014the selling of access and influence in the White House and to the Congress. The auction of the Lincoln Bedroom, of Air Force One. The White House coffees. All of this came from soft money be-cause without soft money, the parties would not have to come up with ever more enticing offers to get the big con-tributors to open their checkbooks. Soft money also brings us, time and time again, questions about the integ-rity and the impartiality of the legisla-tive process. Everything we do is under scrutiny and subject to question be-cause major industries and labor orga-nizations are giving our political par-ties such large amounts of money. Whether it is telecommunications leg-islation, the bankruptcy bill, defense spending, or health care, someone out there is telling the public, often with justification in my view, that the Con-gress cannot be trusted to do what is best for the public interest because the major affected industries are giving us money. For more than a year now, I have highlighted the influence of money on the legislative process through the Calling of the Bankroll. And the really big money, that many believe has a really big influence here, is soft money. We have to clean our campaign finance house and the best place to start is by getting rid of soft money. Let's play by the rules again in this country. With soft money there are no rules, no limits. But we can restore some sanity to our campaign finance VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7610 July 26, 2000 system. When I came to the Senate, I will confess, I didn't even really know what soft money was. After a tough race against a very well financed oppo-nent who spent twice as much as I did, I was mostly concerned with the dif-ficulties that people who are not wealthy have in running for office. My interest in campaign finance reform derived from that experience. Soft money has exploded since I arrived here, with far reaching consequences for our elections and the functioning of the Congress. Now I truly believe that if we can do nothing else on campaign finance reform, we must stop this can-cerous growth of soft money before it consumes us. I will take a few minutes to describe to my colleagues the growth of soft money in recent years. It is a fright-ening story. Soft money first arrived on the scene of our national elections in the 1980 elections, after a 1978 FEC ruling opened the door for parties to accept contributions from corporations and unions, who are barred from con-tributing to federal elections. The best available estimate is that the parties raised under $20 million in soft money in that cycle. By the 1992 election, the year I was elected to this body, soft money fundraising by the two major parties had risen to $86 million. Eighty-six million dollars is clearly a lot of money; it was nearly as much as the $110 million that the two presi-dential candidates were given in 1992 in public financing from the U.S. Treas-ury. And there was real concern about how that money was spent. Despite the FEC's decision that soft money could be used for activities such as get out the vote and voter registration cam-paigns without violating the federal election law's prohibition on corporate and union contributions in connection with federal elections, the parties sent much of their soft money to be spent in states where the Presidential election between George Bush and Bill Clinton was close, or where there were key con-tested Senate races. Still, even then, even with that tre- mendous increase in the use of soft money, soft money was far from the central issue in our debate over cam-paign finance reform in 1993 and 1994. In 1995, when Senator M CCAINand I first introduced the McCain-Feingold bill, our bill included a ban on soft money, but it was not particularly con-troversial and no one paid that much attention to it at that time. Then came the 1996 election, and the enormous explosion of soft money, fueled by the parties' decision to use the money on phony issue ads sup-porting their presidential candidates. Remember those ads that everyone thought were Clinton and Dole ads but were actually run by the parties? That was the public debut of soft money on the national scene. The total soft money fundraising skyrocketed as a re-sult. Three times as much soft money was raised in 1996 as in 1992. Let me say that again\u2014soft money tripled in one election cycle. The reason was the in- satiable desire of the parties for money to run phony issue ads, and that desire has only increased since 1996. Both po-litical parties are raising unprece-dented amounts of soft money for ad campaigns that are already underway this year. Soft money is financing our presidential campaigns, and this Con-gress stands by doing nothing about it. Fred Wertheimer, a long time advo- cate of campaign finance reform said it well in an op-ed in the Washington Post on Monday: He wrote, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush and their presidential campaigns are living a lie. The lie is this: that the TV ads now being run in presidential battleground states across America are political party ''issue ads.'' In fact, everyone\u2014and I mean everyone\u2014knows that these ads are presi-dential campaign ads being run for the un-equivocal purpose of directly influencing the presidential election. Wertheimer goes on to say: The ''issue ad'' campaigns now underway blatantly promote and feature Gore and Bush, are designed and controlled by the Gore and Bush presidential campaigns and are targeted to run in key battleground states. The political parties are merely con-duits for the scheme and cover for the lie. He continues: What's the significance of all of this? Well, for starters we are living this lie in the elec-tion for the most important office in the world's oldest democracy. The lie will result in some $100 million or more in huge cor-rupting contributions being illegally used by Gore and Bush in the 2000 presidential elec-tion. (Many millions more will be illegally used in the 2000 congressional races.) Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the full text of Mr. Wertheimer's article, ''Gore, Bush, and the Big Lie'' be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: [From the Washington Post, July 24, 2000] GORE, BUSH, AND THE BIGLIE (By Fred Wertheimer) Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush and their presidential campaigns are living a lie. The lie is this: that the TV ads now being run in presidential battleground states across America are political party ''issue ads.'' In fact, everyone\u2014and I mean everyone\u2014knows that these ads are presi-dential campaign ads being run for the un-equivocal purpose of directly influencing the presidential election. The presidential campaigns and political parties know it, the media know it and so do the viewers of the ads, which are indistin-guishable from other presidential campaign ads being run. As such, the ''issue ads'' are illegal, be- cause, among other things, they are being fi-nanced with tens of millions of dollars of soft-money contributions that the law says cannot be used to influence a federal elec-tion. The ''issue ad'' campaigns now under-way blatantly promote and feature Gore and Bush, are designed and controlled by the Gore and Bush presidential campaigns are targeted to run in key battleground states. The political parties are merely conduits for the scheme and cover for the lie. What's the significance of all of this? Well, for starters we are living this lie in the elec-tion for the most important office in the world's oldest democracy. The lie will result in some $100 million or more in huge cor-rupting contributions being illegally used by Gore and Bush in the 2000 presidential elec-tion. (Many millions more will be illegally used in the 2000 congressional races.) The lie makes a mockery of the common- sense intelligence of voters and the honesty of the presidential race. And, to date, no one in authority is prepared to do anything about it. How did it happen that this lie came to rest at the core of our national elections? Well, in good part we have Presidential Clin-ton to thank. It was Clinton who, more than anyone else, developed and ''perfected'' the lie, and the legal fiction on which it is based. Soft money had been a problem prior to 1995, but no presidential candidate had ever tried to use soft money to finance a TV ad campaign promoting his candidacy. That's not because politicians weren't clever enough to think of this, but because every-one understood it was illegal. Then President Clinton and his staff in- vented a scam for the 1996 election: They would use the Democratic Party as a front for running a ''second'' presidential cam-paign. This $50 million second campaign would use soft money\u2014funds that the law does not allow in a presidential campaign\u2014 to finance Clinton campaign ads that would be labeled Democratic Party ''issue ads.'' It didn't take long for the Republican pres- idential candidate, Bob Dole, to follow suit. Today, four years later, the ''issue ads'' lie is standard political practice in presidential and congressional races. The lie is built on the legal fiction that under Supreme Court rulings, political party ads are not covered by federal campaign fi-nance laws unless they contain such magic words as ''vote for'' or ''vote against'' a spe-cific federal candidate. That's supposed to be true even if the party ads promote a specific federal candidate and even if the ads are co-ordinated with or controlled by the can-didate. But the reality is that neither the Su- preme Court nor any other federal court has ever said anything of the kind regarding po-litical party ads. When the Supreme Court established the ''magic words'' test in Buck- ley v. Valeo , it made explicit that it was for outside groups and non-candidates only and did not apply to communications by can-didates or political parties. And in any case, the ''magic words'' test is not applicable when an ad campaign is conducted in coordi-nation with a federal candidate, as a Wash-ington federal district court confirmed last year. The Justice Department, in its failure to pursue the 1996 Clinton soft-money ads, never found the ads to be legal. Instead, At-torney General Reno closed the case based on the Clinton campaign's reliance on its lawyers' advice, which she said was ''suffi-cient to negate any criminal intent on their part.'' The general counsel of the Federal Elec- tion Commission did find that the 1996 soft- money ads were illegal. The commission, however, by a 3 to 3 tie vote, refused to pro-ceed with an enforcement action. Thus we are left today with enforcement authorities that refuse to act against these soft money ads and, at the same time, refuse to say they are legal. And the lie goes on. Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the big lie led to the transformation of our two great political parties into soft money machines. And what was the ef-fect of this explosion of soft money, other than the millions of dollars available for ads supporting presi-dential candidates who had agreed to VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7611 July 26, 2000 run their campaigns on equal and lim- ited grants from the federal taxpayers? Soft money is raised primarily from corporate interests who have a legisla-tive axe to grind. And so the explosion of soft money brought an explosion of influence and access in this Congress and in the Administration. Here are some of the companies in this exclusive group. We know they have a big interest in what the Con-gress does\u2014Philip Morris, Joseph Sea-gram & Sons, RJR Nabisco, Walt Dis-ney, Atlantic Richfield, AT&T, Federal Express, MCI, the Association of Trial Lawyers, the NEA, Lazard Freres & Co., Anheuser Busch, Eli Lilly, Time Warner, Chevron Corp., Archer Daniel's Midland, NYNEX, Textron Inc., North-west Airlines. It's a who's who of cor-porate America, Mr. President. They are investors in the United States Con-gress and no one can convince the American people that these companies get no return on their investment. They have a say, much too big a say, in what we do. It's that simple, and it's that disturbing. That's why our prior-ities are so out of whack, Mr. Presi-dent. We should be going to the Treas-ury-Postal appropriations bill, and that's why I support the motion to pro-ceed, despite the fact that I may vote against it when all is said and done. I recognize we have to focus on what people want, not what wealthy inter-ests want. As I said when I first began Calling the Bankroll last year, we know, if we are honest with ourselves, that cam-paign contributions are involved in vir-tually everything that this body does. Campaign money is the 800-pound go-rilla in this chamber every day that nobody talks about, but that cannot be ignored. All around us, and all across the country, people notice the gorilla. Studies come out on a weekly basis from a variety of research organiza-tions and groups that lobby for cam-paign finance reform that show what we all know: The agenda of the Con-gress seems to be influenced by cam-paign money. But in our debates here, we are silent about that influence, and how it corrodes our system of govern-ment. I have chosen not to remain silent, but I know there are those who wish that I would stop putting the spotlight on facts that reflect poorly on our sys-tem, and in turn on the Senate, and on both the major political parties. I wish our campaign finance system wasn't such an embarrassment. I wish wealthy interests with busi- ness before this body didn't have un-limited ability to give money to our political parties through the soft money loophole, but they do. I wish these big donors weren't able to buy special access to our political leaders through meetings and weekend retreats set up by the parties, but they can. I wish fundraising skills and personal wealth weren't some of the most sought-after qualities in a candidate for Congress today, but everyone knows that they are. Most of all I wish that these facts didn't paint a picture of Government so corrupt and so awash in the influence of money that the American people, es-pecially young people, have turned away from their government in dis-gust, but every one of us knows that they have. It is our unwillingness to discuss it or even acknowledge the influence of this money in this body that makes it even worse. It goes on and on, and it just gets worse. Last year was another record-breaker in the annals of soft money fund-raising\u2014the national political party committees raised a record $107.2 mil-lion during the 1999 calendar year\u201481 percent more than they raised during the last comparable presidential elec-tion period in 1995, according to Com-mon Cause. An 81 percent increase is astounding, especially considering that the year it's compared with\u20141995, the last off- election year preceding a presidential election\u2014which was itself a record- breaking year for soft money fund-raising. This year one of the most notable fundraising trends hits very close to home, or to the dome, as the case may be: Congressional campaign commit-tees raised more than three times as much soft money during 1999 as they raised during 1995\u2014$62 million com-pared to $19.4 million. That is a huge increase, Mr. Presi- dent. Three times as much soft money\u2014 much of it raised by members of Con-gress. Now the latest news reports show record-breaking soft money figures for the first quarter of this year as well. How should the public view this? What can we expect them to think as Members of Congress ask for these un-limited contributions from corpora-tions, unions and wealthy individuals, and then turn around and vote on legis-lation that directly affects those do-nors that they just asked for all this money? Frankly, it is all the more reason for Americans to question our integrity, whether those donations have an im-pact on our decisions or not. They question our integrity, and we give them reason. Why aren't we get-ting their business done? I say let's get the business done\u2014let's agree to move to Treasury-Postal, whether we'll sup-port that bill in the end or not. And then let's move on to the other press-ing issues before us\u2014not tax cuts for the wealthy, but real priorities like campaign finance reform. Let's put a stop to the soft money arms race that escalates every day, and involves more and more Members of Congress. I do not know how many of my col- leagues are actually picking up the phones across the street in our party committee headquarters to ask cor- porate CEOs for soft money contribu-tions. But no one here can deny that our parties are asking us to do this. It is now part of the parties' expectations that a United States Senator will be a big solicitor of soft money. Consider the soft money raised in re- cent off-year elections. In 1994, the par-ties raised a total of $101.7 million. Only about $18.5 million of that amount was raised by the congres-sional and senatorial campaign com-mittees. In 1998, the most recent elec-tion, soft money fundraising more than doubled to $224.4 million. And $107 mil-lion of that total was raised by the congressional and senatorial campaign committees. That's nearly half of the total soft money raised by the parties. Half the soft money that the parties raised in the last election went to the campaign committees for members of Congress, as opposed to the national party committees. And I and many of my colleagues know from painful expe-rience that much of that money ended up being spent on phony issue ads in Senate races. The corporate money that has been banned in federal elec-tions since 1907 is being raised by Sen-ators and spent to try to influence the election of Senators. This has to stop. The growth of soft money has made a mockery of our campaign finance laws. It has turned Senators into pan-handlers for huge contributions from corporate patrons. And it has multi-plied the number of corporate interests who have a claim on the attention of members and the work of this institu-tion. I truly believe that we must do much more than ban soft money to fix our campaign finance system. But if there is one thing more than any other that must be done now it is to ban soft money. Otherwise the soft money loop-hole will completely obliterate the Presidential public funding system, and lead to scandals that will make what we saw in 1996 seem quaint. Vir-tually no one in this body has stepped up to defend soft money. So let's get rid of it once and for all. Now is the time. Let's move to the Treasury-Post-al Appropriations bill, vote yes or no, and then let's do what we have to get done. When we define what we need to get done this year, let's get serious. It is not the estate tax, and it's not the H- 1B bill. It's banning soft money. Now there is more support for ban- ning soft money than ever before. I think it is important to talk on this floor about just who those Americans are who want to clean up this cam-paign finance system, because today calls for reform are coming from an in-credible range of people in this coun-try, including some very unlikely places. One of the most interesting places you can find demands for reform is cor- porate America, where one group of corporate executives, tired of being shaken down for bigger and bigger con-tributions, has said enough is enough. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7612 July 26, 2000 This organization, called the Com- mittee for Economic Development, issued a report and proposal urging re-form, including the elimination of soft money. One might guess that this group of people, who are in the position to use the soft money system to their advan-tage, would not dream of calling for re-form. But the soft money system cuts both ways\u2014it not only allows for legalized bribery of the political parties, it also allows legalized extortion of soft money donors, who are being asked to give more and more money every elec-tion cycle to fuel the parties' bottom-less appetite for soft money. But it isn't just weariness at being shaken down that led CED members to call for reform of our broken campaign finance system. Let me quote from the CED report, which stated their concern so well: Given the size and source of most soft money contributions, the public cannot help but believe that these donors enjoy special influence and receive special favors. The sus-picion of corruption diminishes public con-fidence in government. The bigger soft money contributions get\u2014and the amounts are truly sky-rocketing\u2014the more damaging the ef-fect on the public's perception of our democracy. I applaud CED for its commitment to restoring the public's faith in govern-ment by calling for a soft money ban. And CED is just one part of a growing movement to call on this body to clean up our campaign finance system. One of the most inspiring leaders of the movement for reform is not any business leader, or political figure for that matter. She is a great grand-mother from Dublin, New Hampshire named Doris Haddock. Doris, known af-fectionately as Granny D, walked clear across the United States at age 90 to insist that Congress pay attention to reform issues. She walked across mountains and desert, in sweltering heat and freezing cold, to make her point. And along the way she inspired thousands of others to speak up about the corrupting influ-ence of money in politics, and demand action from Congress. I was proud to have her support for the McCain-Fein-gold bill, and I am thrilled to have such a devoted ally on this issue. The fight for reform is also gaining tremendous strength from religious or-ganizations that are reaching out to educate and mobilize their congrega-tions about the issue. Support from religious organizations includes: The Episcopal Church, Church Women United, the Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Amer-ica, the Church of the Brethren's Wash-ington Office, the Mennonite Central Committee's Washington Office, the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, the Union of Amer-ican Hebrew Congregations, the United Church of Christ's Office for Church in Society, the United Methodist Church's General Board of Church and Society, and NETWORK\u2014a national Catholic social justice lobby. Reform has the vital support of envi- ronmental groups like the Environ-mental Defense Fund, Friends of the Earth and The Sierra Club, and the backing of seniors groups like AARP and the Gray Panthers. The support for reform in this coun- try is strong, it is vocal, and is truly broad-based. We also have the support of consumer watchdogs like the Con-sumer Federation of America, health organizations like the American Heart Association, children's groups such as the Children's Defense Fund, and of course the support of groups like Com-mon Cause and Public Citizen, which have been fighting a terrific fight against the undue influence of money in politics for decades. And I could go on. We are talking about people from every walk of life, every income level and every political affiliation. But they all have one sim-ple thing in common: They are de-manding an end to the soft money sys-tem that has made a mockery of our campaign finance laws, has deepened public cynicism about this body, and darkened the public perception of our democracy. The public is watching us right now. That is why I want us to move to the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, whether we support it or not\u2014so that they can have faith that we are doing what we should be doing. Not serving wealthy interests, but doing their busi-ness, and doing it responsibly. And being responsible means acting on campaign finance reform. That is what people want\u2014their voices can be heard loud and clear in polls on the campaign finance issue: Two out of three Americans think money has an ''excessive influence'' on elections and government policy, ac-cording to Committee for Economic Development's March 1999 report on campaign finance reform. Another CED poll question revealed that two-thirds of the public think ''their own representative in Congress would listen to the views of outsiders who made large political contributions before a constituent's views''; 74.5 percent of respondents believe the Government is pretty much run by a few big interests looking out for themselves, according to a poll from the Center for Policy Attitudes; 78 percent of respondents believe ''the current set of laws that control congressional campaign funding needs reform,'' in a Hotline poll. These numbers are even more dis- turbing than the numbers of the soft money donations themselves. These numbers tell us that it's a given today that people think the worst of us and the work we do\u2014they believe that we are on the take, and who could possibly blame them? What is it that they do not under- stand, that they are misinterpreting about this system and how it affects us? Nothing; the public has not missed a thing. The public has got it exactly right. It is this body that has it wrong every time a minority of my colleagues block the majority of the Senate and will of the American people by trying to kill reform. The public deserves a Congress that can respond to the concerns of all Americans, not a wealthy few. The public deserves a responsible Congress that does its job by moving to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, whether we choose to vote yes or no, and the same goes for the other re-maining approps bills that deserve our attention. Most of all, the public deserves a Congress that can set priorities that represent the concerns of the American people, and not just soft money donors, not just those who can afford to attend weekend getaways with party leader-ship, and not just those who have es-tates of more than $100 million dollars. That is our challenge. Let's address the people's real priorities. Let's do the people's business, and let's get started right now. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to call the roll. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C RAPO ). Without objection, it is so or- dered. Is there further debate on the mo- tion? Several Senators addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from West Virginia. Mr. BYRD. Under the rules, once a quorum is called off, if nobody seeks the floor, is it the requirement that the Chair put the question? The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have the floor? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from West Virginia has the floor. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I simply cannot understand what is going on here. I wish someone would tell me. I think we had a unanimous vote a little earlier here on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the consideration of the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. Why don't we vote? Why don't we vote? As the ranking member on the Ap- propriations Committee, I can say to my colleagues that Senator T EDSTE- VENS and I\u2014the chairman and I\u2014and the various chairmen and ranking members of the subcommittees on Ap-propriations have worked hard\u2014have worked hard\u2014to bring these appropria-tions bills to the Senate floor. We need VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7613 July 26, 2000 to get on with acting on these appro- priations bills so that we can send them to the President. I can tell you what is going to hap- pen. I have seen it happen all too often in recent years. We don't get the appro-priations bills down to the President one by one, so that he can sign them or veto them, which he has a right to do. What we do is delay and delay and delay. As a result, when the time comes that the leaders and Senators have their backs to the wall, and there is a big rush on to finalize the work so Senators can go home and the Senate can adjourn sine die, then everything is crammed into one big bill, one omnibus bill. I am telling you, you would be amazed at what happens in the con-ferences. You would be amazed to see what occurs in those conferences. En-tire bills are sometimes put into the conference report\u2014entire bills, bills that may or may not have passed ei-ther House. And the administration is there also. The executive branch has its representatives there. They are there for the purpose of getting admin-istration measures or items that the executive branch wants put into those conference reports. The items may not have had a word of debate in either House. Neither House will have had an opportunity to offer amendments on bills or to debate measures, and yet those measures will be put, lock, stock, and barrel, into the conference reports. Then the conference report comes back to the Senate, where Senators cannot vote on amendments to that conference report. So Senators, as a re-sult, have no opportunity to debate these matters that are crammed into the conference reports in those con-ferences. They will have had no oppor-tunity to debate them. They will have had no opportunity to amend them. They will have had no opportunity to vote on parts thereof. Yet Senators in this Chamber are confronted, then, with one package, and you take it or you leave it. You vote for it or you vote against it. We have experienced that on a num- ber of occasions. When we were consid-ering the fiscal year 1997 appropria-tions, we had a conference report on the Defense Appropriations Bill and five additional appropriations bills were crammed into that conference re-port in conference, five appropriations bills. I believe two of them had never been taken up in the Senate. I believe two of them had had some debate, had been brought up, but had not been fi-nally acted upon. I intend at a future time to have all of this material researched so I can speak to it. Today, I recall there were five appropriations bills crammed into that conference report on the DOD Ap-propriations Bill. It was brought back to the Senate where Senators were un-able to amend it and have votes on parts of it. And if Senators think that was bad, in fiscal year 1999, eight dif-ferent appropriations bills were put into the final omnibus package. In ad- dition thereto, a tax bill was put into that package in the conference. I be-lieve that tax bill involved about $9.2 billion. That was put into the con-ference report. It had never had a day, an hour, or a minute of debate in this Senate. There were no amendments of-fered to it. Eight appropriations bills and a tax bill were all wrapped into one conference report in FY 1999, tied with a little ribbon, and Senators were con-fronted with having to vote for or against, that conference report\u2014take it or leave it! That was right at the end of the ses- sion when many Senators wanted to go home. They had town meetings sched-uled; they wanted to go home. When that kind of circumstance arises, we are faced with a situation of having to vote on a bill that may contain thou-sands of pages which we have not had an opportunity to read. As I remember, there were 3,980 pages in that con-ference report. Imagine that. If the people back home knew what we were doing to them, they would run us all out of town on a rail. And we would be entitled to that honor, the way we do business here. All we do is carry on continual war in this body, continual war, each side trying to get the ups on the other side. It isn't the people's business we are concerned with. It is who can get the best of whom in the partisan battles that go on in this Chamber. A lot of new Members come over from the House where they are accus-tomed, I suppose, to being told by their leaders what to do and how to do. Oth-ers come here fresh from the stump. I suppose they feel this is the way it has always been done. They don't know how it used to be done. They don't know that there was a day when we used to have conferences, and it was the rule that only items could be dis-cussed in conference which had passed one or the other of the two bodies. Nothing could be put into a conference report that had not had action in one or the other of the two bodies. Other-wise, a point of order would lie against it. I can assure you, those of you who are not on the Appropriations Com-mittee, you ought to see what goes on in the conferences. Bills that have never passed either body, measures that have never passed either body, measures, in many instances, which are only wanted by the administration, are brought to that conference and are crammed into that conference report. The conference report comes back to the Senate. It is unamendable, and we have to take it or leave it. That is no way to do business. I regret that it has come to this, and we are getting ready to do it again. I see the handwriting on the wall. Those of you who have read the book of Daniel will remember Belshazzar having a feast with 1,000 of his lords. They drank out of the vessels that had been taken from the temple in Jeru-salem and brought to Babylon. And as they were eating and drinking and hav-ing fun, Belshazzar saw a hand appear over on the wall near the candlestick. And he saw the handwriting: mene, mene, tekel, upharsin. So he sent for his wise men, his astrologers, and wanted them to tell him what this writing meant. They couldn't do it. But the Queen told Belshazzar that there was a young man in the kingdom who could indeed unravel this mystery. As a result, Daniel was sent for. He told the King what was meant by the handwriting on the wall: ''God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. Thy kingdom is di-vided, and given to the Medes and the Persians.'' And that night, Belshazzar was slain and the Medes and the Per-sians took the kingdom. I see the handwriting on the wall: mene, mene, tekel, upharsin. I see the handwriting. We have voted unani-mously in this body today to proceed to take up the appropriations bill mak-ing appropriations for the Department of Treasury-Postal Service and so forth, but we are not going to vote on that. I have asked questions around: When are we going to vote? There is no intention to vote on that today. We have another cloture vote coming up within a few minutes. If that cloture motion is approved, the Senate will then take on that subject, and the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill will go back to the calendar. We are not going to take it up. There is no in-tention of voting on that bill, no inten-tion. It will go back on the calendar. Then what will happen? I see the handwriting on the wall. We will go to conference one day when we get back from the August recess. We will go to conference one day on another appro-priations bill, and everything will go on that appropriations bill. I wish Dan-iel were here today so he could tell me exactly what the handwriting on this wall really means, but I think I know what it means. It means this bill isn't going to see the light of day until after the recess, and probably not then. In all likelihood, the Treasury-Postal Service bill will be put on a conference report, maybe on the legislative appro-priations bill. This bill will go on that. As time passes, more and more appro-priations bills will likely go on that in conference. So we will get another conference re- port back here that is loaded\u2014loaded\u2014 with appropriations bills. We won't know what is in them. We Senators won't know what is in those bills. We didn't know what was in the 3,980-page conference report in fiscal year 1999. We voted for it or against it blindly. I voted against it. I didn't know what was in it. That is what we are con-fronted with. The American people, I think, are going to write us off as being irrele-vant. We don't mean anything. We just stay here and fight one another and try to get the partisan best of one another. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, S7614 July 26, 2000 Democrats versus Republicans, Repub- licans versus Democrats. Who can get the ups on the other side. The people will say we can go to hell. That is the attitude here. Hell is not such a bad word. I have seen it in the Bible, so I perhaps will not be accused of using bad language here. But that is what we are in for. That is the handwriting on the wall. We are going to replay the same old record and have these monu-mental conference reports come back here, unamendable, and we take them hook, line, and sinker, one vote. No amendments. We won't know what is in the bill. How is that for grown up men and women? We won't know what is in the bill because we are playing politics all the time. We are playing politics. That is why we are not getting our work done. I am not blaming that side or this side. I am just blaming both sides. We are all caught in this. I am sure the American people can't look at this body, or this Congress, and get much hope because we play politics all the time. I am sorry that things have come to this. But Congress doesn't work by the rules; the Senate doesn't operate under the rules it operated under when I came here and that existed up until a few years ago. This game has been going on and it is getting worse. It is getting worse. Mr. President, I don't intend to hold the floor any longer. I will have more to say about this. If you want to know the truth, what is said is exactly the truth. We are absolutely working a fraud on the American people. They look to this body and expect us to leg-islate on the problems of the country, and we are just tied in knots. We only seem to think about partisanship. I am sick and tired of that. I am sure we have to have a little of that as we go along, but it has become all partisan politics. Who can win this? If they come up with something, we have to come up with an alternative. I don't think the American people want that. I think they know more than we think they know, and I believe they are pretty aware of what is going on. We are just playing politics. That is exactly why we can't get this Treas-ury-Postal Service Appropriations Bill up and get it passed and send it to con-ference. Mark my words; we are going to play the same old game over and over again that we have played all too many times now, not passing appro-priations bills, but having them all in conference put into one monumental, colossal conference report, and it is sent back here and we will vote on it and we won't know what is in the con-ference report. Shame! Shame on us! I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Rhode Island is recognized. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the current posture of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill on the floor. It seems to me that we are in the doldrums. Our sails are unfurled, the crew is at their positions, but the ship is not moving. There are many reasons for that. But I suggest one of the principal reasons is that over the last several months\u2014indeed, through-out this entire Congress\u2014the leader-ship has taken it upon themselves to essentially try to nullify the Presi-dent's constitutional authority to ap-point judges to the Federal courts. Article II, section 2 of the Constitu- tion is quite clear that the President has the right to appoint Federal judges, subject to the advice and con-sent of the Senate. But what has hap-pened with increasing enthusiasm is that these appointments arrive here and then languish month after month after month after month. At some point, this type of nullification, this avoidance of responsibility under the Constitution, subverts what I believe the Founding Fathers saw as a rel-atively routine aspect of Government: Presidential appointment and consider-ation within a reasonable time by the Senate of these appointments. It has not been a reasonable time in so many cases. Repeatedly, appoint-ments to the Federal bench have been made by the President. They have come to the Senate and have been vir-tually ignored month after month. At some point, we have to be responsible not only to the Constitution, but to the people of the country and act on these appointments. Now, that doesn't mean confirm every appointment. But it cer-tainly, in my mind, means to have a reasonable deliberation, a hearing, and then bring it to a vote. It is far better, both constitutionally and in terms of the lives of individual Americans, to decide their fate, decide whether or not they will serve on the bench in a rea-sonable period of time than to let them twist slowly in the wind\u2014some for up-wards of a year or more. That is what has been happening. It is a reflection of a deeper paralysis within the system. The Senate is not operating as it tra- ditionally has, as a forum for vigorous debate, amendment, and discussion, and after a vigorous debate, a vote. We have seen a situation in which meas-ures are brought to the floor only after concessions are made about the num-ber of amendments, the scope of amendments, and the type of amend-ments. That is operational procedure that is frequently associated with the other body but which defies the tradi-tion of this body, where we pride our-selves on our ability to debate and amend, to be a place in which serious discussions about public policy take place routinely and just as often deci-sions are made by the votes of this body. We haven't seen that. We introduced on this floor for con- sideration\u2014and it has been the pending business now since May\u2014the Elemen-tary and Secondary Education Act. Every 5 years, we reauthorize the edu-cation policy of the Federal Govern-ment\u2014the education policy with re-spect to elementary and secondary schools throughout this country: the title I program, Professional Develop-ment Program, and the Eisenhower Program that assists professional de-velopment. Yet this major piece of leg-islation has come to this floor and then, like judges, has been languishing in the shadows for months now. Why? Well, some suggest it is because the majority doesn't want to consider amendments with respect to school safety and gun violence. Those amend-ments might cause difficult votes. But in any case, we are likely, this year, not to discharge our routine duty of every 5 years reauthorizing the Ele-mentary and Secondary Education Act. We are going to\u2014using a sports meta-phor\u2014punt. All of these things together have caused us to stop and essentially ask why can't we refocus our operations, refocus our emphasis, and begin to renew the tradition in this body of de-bate, wide-open amendment leading to votes with respect to substantive legis-lation and with respect to appoint-ments by the President to the judiciary and other appointments. That is why I believe we are here in these doldrums. The lights are on. We are assembled, but we are not moving forward. I think we have to begin to look at what we are doing and why we are doing it. Perhaps that is the most useful aspect of this discussion this afternoon\u2014because I hope that eventu-ally we can emerge from these dol-drums and begin to, once again, take up the people's business in a reasonable and timely fashion leading to votes after debate. Some may go the way we want. Some may not. But in the grand scheme of things, when we are debating and bringing the principles of the de-bate to conclusion by voting, we are discharging the responsibility that the American people entrusted to us when they elected us to the Senate. There are many examples of what we could be doing if we adopted this ap-proach. For example, I have an amend-ment which I would like to introduce with respect to this Treasury-Postal bill regarding the enforcement of our firearms laws in the United States. We hear time and time again\u2014par- ticularly by the opponents of increased gun safety legislation\u2014that all we have to do is enforce the laws. Yet in the past we have seen the erosion of funds going to the ATF for their en-forcement policies. I must say that this year's Treasury-Postal appropriations bill has moved the bar upwards in terms of funding appropriate gun safe-ty programs, and I commend the Chair-man and Ranking Member for their ef-fort. But there are two areas in which they have failed to respond. One is the youth crime gun interdiction initiative by the ATF. I would request in my amendment an additional $6.4 million, which would bring it up to the funding requested by the President. This, to me, is an abso-lutely critical issue\u2014not only in the sense of making sound public policy, but critical because in every commu-nity in this country we are astonished VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7615 July 26, 2000 by the ease of access to firearms by youngsters. We are horrified by the re-sults of this access to firearms. A few weeks ago in Providence, RI, we were absolutely devastated by the murder of two young people. They had been in Providence on Thursday evening at a night club. They left. One youngster was working and the other was a college student. They were chat-ting by their car, waiting to go to their homes that evening when they were carjacked by five or six young men. They were driven to a golf course on the outskirts of Providence. Then they were brutally killed with firearms. Where did these accused murderers get these firearms? It is a confused story. But there was an adult, appar-ently, who had lots of weapons. Either they were stolen from this individual, or he lent the firearms to one of these young men. But, in any case, this is one of those searing examples of young people having firearms being desperate, being homicidal, and using those weap-ons to kill two innocent people. The program, which is underfunded in this appropriations bill, would au-thorize the ATF to work with local po-lice departments to develop tracing re-ports to determine the source of fire-arms in juvenile crimes. There was some suggestion initially and anecdotally that most of these firearms were stolen, but then prelimi-nary research suggested not; that, in fact, there is an illegal market for fire-arms and that too many weapons used by juveniles in these heinous crimes are obtained in this illegal firearms market. This type of information is extremely useful in terms of designing strategies to interdict access to firearms by youth perpetrators. We need this kind of intelligence in the Nation, if we are going to construct appropriate pro-grams that are going to deal with this problem. This, again, is a reflection of what I sense happened in Providence. It is un-clear precisely what happened. But here you have the possibility that the individual with the firearms either sold them or lent them, got them into the hands of young people who, in turn, used them to kill other young people. It would be extremely useful if we knew collectively and not only individ-ually how these weapons moved through our society, because without this knowledge it is very hard to create counterstrategies. That is one important aspect\u2014these trace reports\u2014for appropriations that I will seek to move today with respect to appropriations. Indeed, the Senate Appropriations Committee report emphasizes the im-portance of the partnerships that are underlying this initiative, and under-lying also the ability to deal with the incidents of youth firearm crimes. In their words: The partnership between ATF and local law enforcement agencies in these commu-nities\u2014 The communities that are already participating in this program\u2014 is invaluable to the mutual effort to reduce gun-related crimes. The tracing information provided by ATF not only allows local juris-dictions to target scarce resources to inves-tigations likely to achieve results, but also gives ATF the raw data to be able to inves-tigate and prosecute the illegal source of these crime guns. The Committee continues to believe that there are significant disrup-tions in these illegal firearms markets di-rectly due to investigative leads arising from this regional initiative. Frankly, the committee recognizes that this is a useful initiative. I would like to see it fully funded. That is something we could be talking about. Indeed, I hope we can move to incor-porate that within the appropriations bill that is before us. There is another important firearms enforcement measure that was not funded by the committee which I would like to see funded, and that is the na-tional integrated ballistics information network. I would like to see that ap-propriation moved up by $11.68 million to meet the President's request. This would integrate two systems that try to identify bullets based upon their ballistic characteristics so they can be more useful in investigating crimes. The ATF has an integrated ballistics identification system, which is called in shorthand IBIS. The FBI has what they call the ''drugfire'' ballistic sys-tem. I have seen demonstrations of these systems. They are remarkable. They recover a slug at a crime scene. They take it to a lab, which has the computer equipment that is designed to run this system. They are able to identify the characteristics of the par-ticular slug that is being examined and then, through their data banks, match it up with a known group of slugs, make a positive identification, and the positive identification leads, in many cases, to the arrest, or certainly to the identification of the weapon that was used. It is very similar to fingerprinting, with which we are all familiar. We have these two systems. They work very well independently. But they would work much better if their databases were combined; if the source was engineered to cooperate and work interdependently. That is what this ap-propriation would do. We have seen success already. Both of these systems, working independ-ently, have produced more than 8,000 matches and 16,000 cases. For the first time we can take a slug from a crime scene, match it up with known weap-ons, leading, hopefully, to arrests and ultimately conviction. In a way, it is not only like fingerprints, it is like DNA, like all the scientific break-throughs we are able to use to more ef-fectively enforce the laws and bring lawbreakers to justice. I hope we can use this system more effectively by integrating the two pro-grams, the ATF program and also the FBI program. One of the reasons I am offering this amendment is to ensure we have the money this year. There is a 24-month proposed schedule for the deployment of this system. The work has been done, the plans have been done, but if we do not appropriate sufficient money in fiscal years 2001 and 2002, then we will fall short of this scheduled deploy-ment. We will create a situation in which, again, when we ask why the American people get so frustrated with government, the situation in which we have been planning, we have been ex-pending money, we are all ready to move forward on an initiative that will materially aid law enforcement au-thority, and then we stop short and go into a hiatus for a year, and maybe at the end of the year start again. But, more than likely, it will be more ex-pensive, and we have lost months or years in terms of having effective tools for our law enforcement authorities. That is one of the frustrations. It is frustration based upon our inability to be able to move efficiently and prompt-ly to do the people's business. I hope we can deal with this issue of both the youth crime gun interdiction initiative and the national integrated ballistics information network. These are the types of appropriations meas-ures we should not only be talking about, but we should be voting for. Again, we are in this predicament be-cause there has been such a conscious, overt effort on the part of the leader-ship to deflect consideration, delibera-tion, and decision on so many impor-tant issues that are critical to the fu-ture of America. Lifetime tenure on Federal courts is being withheld be-cause there is a hope, an expectation on one side, that these judges will go away, these nominees will go away, in 6 or 9 months. I don't think that is what the Amer- ican people want Congress to do. They want Congress to either approve or dis-approve, but they want Congress to act. Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield? Mr. REED. I am happy to yield to the Senator. Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator has talked about the present situation we are in. Is the Senator aware that the majority leader tried to move the Senate toward consideration of this bill as long ago as last Friday and it was objected to by the minority? Mr. REED. I am aware of that. It is one of the situations where, after months and months of cooperating, of trying to accommodate, mutually, the desire and the recognition of getting things done, at some point when we see no movement with respect to our con-stitutional obligation to confirm judges, no real movement, when we see the elementary and secondary edu-cation bill that has been put out to languish and perhaps not to see the light of day for the rest of the year, when we see a process in which the price of bringing a bill to the floor is an agreement to surrender the rights of individual Senators to amend that leg-islation, to make that amendment VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7616 July 26, 2000 process subject to the approval of the majority leader, when we see all those things, what I think we have to do and what we must do is insist that we get back, away from that process of major-ity oppression. Perhaps that is too melodramatic. We have to get back to the rules of the Senate, the spirit of the Senate, which, I believe, is open de-bate, open amendment, and a vote. Frankly, if that were the rule that was forthcoming from the majority leader, if the majority leader said, bring ESEA back, open up the amend-ment process, vote; when we finish the amendments, if the debate goes too long, in my prerogative, after long de-bate, I will enter a cloture motion\u2014 that is the way the Senate should oper-ate. I suggest that is not the way this Senate is operating. That is why we are here today. There is responsibility for every indi- vidual Senator for what happens on the floor of the Senate. Certainly the man-agement of the Senate is within the grasp and the control immediately of the majority leader and the majority. That control has been deliberately, I think, to thwart the nomination and the confirmation of judges and delib-erately to frustrate legislation impor-tant to the American people because there might be amendments that are uncomfortable for consideration by some in this body. Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield? Mr. REED. I am happy to yield to the Senator. Mr. BENNETT. Is the Senator aware the majority leader has an agreement with the minority leader whereby a number of judges would, in fact, be confirmed and that the agreement was accepted by both sides, only to have the minority leader come forward and say that he wanted to identify the spe-cific judges, and the numbers were not acceptable? The minority leader want-ed to pick specific people, in contradic-tion of the normal pattern of the Judi-ciary Committee. Is the Senator aware of the fact the minority leader has taken that stand? Mr. REED. Reclaiming my time, es- sentially what the Senator is arguing, by implication, is that the majority leader has the sole responsibility and sole prerogative to pick who will come to this floor for consideration as a judge. I am amazed at this whole process. Look at judges who have been pending for almost a year and their names are not coming to the surface. That is something more at work than the breaks of the game. That is a delib-erate attempt by the majority to sup-press the nomination of individual judges. Frankly, an offer to bring some judges to the floor is, in my view, in-sufficient unless that offer was trans-parent, saying we will begin to work down the judges who have been pending longest, with perhaps other criteria, such as districts or circuits that need judges. But that is not how it is working. These magnanimous offers of bringing up a couple of judges\u2014I believe I saw yesterday where three judges from Ari-zona were just nominated by the Presi-dent, and they already have hearings scheduled. We have other judges who were nominated over a year ago, and they have not even had a hearing, a year later. Some magnanimous ges-tures by the majority leader are self- serving and ultimately had to be re-jected by the minority. I respect the Senator, but I will con- tinue my discussion on some other points. Mr. BENNETT. I will respond at a later time. Mr. REED. The youth crime gun interdiction initiative and the national integrative ballistics information net-work are important issues. Those are the issues we are talking about. They are a subset of what I argue is the larg-er issue. The larger issue: Is the Senate going to be the Senate? Or is it some type of smaller House of Representatives where the leadership dictates what is coming to the floor, what judge's name might come up, what bill might come up, what amendment might come up, when it all comes about? That, I think, is the key point. Let me take up another key point in terms of the demonstration of why we are not doing our duty. We have before the Senate a very difficult vote on ex-tending permanent normal trade rela-tions to China. It is a very difficult vote. We know that. It is a vote that bedeviled the House of Representa-tives. It was controversial. It was dif-ficult. But after intense pressure and vigorous debate, the House of Rep-resentatives brought it to a conclusion and voted. Now that measure is before the Sen- ate. It is controversial. It is, like so many other things, languishing. It could have been accomplished weeks ago. The business community would argue vociferously it should have been accomplished weeks ago. It has been couched in many terms, but one term I think is most compelling is that it is a critical national security vote. It is a critical national security vote. Yes, it is about trade. Yes, it is about eco-nomic impacts within the United States and around the world. But it is also about whether or not we will con-tinue to maintain a relationship of en-gagement with China, or if we reject it, or if we delay it indefinitely and open up the distinct possibility of confronta-tion and competition with China. Yet this critical national security vote, this critical vote which is prob-ably the No. 1 objective of the business community in this country, again lan-guishes. Some would say there are reasons. We want to talk about Senator T HOMP - SON's and Senator T ORRICELLI 's amend- ment about proliferation. But, again, it is symptomatic of a situation in which the Senate is not responding as it should to its constitutional and to its public responsibilities because of the political calculus. Our side is not immune to political calculation. But the leadership of this body has created a situation in which avoidance of difficult issues, nullifica-tion of constitutional responsibilities and obligations to confirm judges, and deferment of critical national security issues for short-run advantages, is the standard of performance. I believe that is not the role the Senate should play and that is the heart of this discussion today. Let me suggest one other point with respect to the business of the body. We confront a range of issues that deal with those world-shaking, momentous issues like China trade policy; issues with respect to domestic tranquility; the safety of our streets; the funding of the appropriations bills for law en-forcement when it comes to firearms. Then there are issues that are not important to the vast number of Amer-icans in the sense it doesn't affect them directly but are critically impor-tant to many Americans. One is a measure I have been trying to find the opportunity to bring to the floor, and that is to somehow help the Liberian community in this country who came here in 1990, in the midst of their vio-lent civil war, and who for the last dec-ade have been in the United States. They have been residing here. They have been contributing to our commu-nities. Many of them have children who are American citizens. Yet they are in a position where they face deportation October 1. The clock is ticking. This is not an issue that is going to galvanize parades through every Main Street in America. But for these rough-ly 10,000 people who are caught up in this twilight zone while they are here, they want to remain here with their children, many of whom, as I said, are Americans, but they face a prospect of being deported back to a country that is still tumultuous, still dangerous, still threatening to them and many others. This is legislation that has been sup- ported by Senator C HAFEE , my col- league from Rhode Island, Senator H AGEL , Senator W ELLSTONE , Senator KENNEDY , Senator , Senator KERRY , and Senator D URBIN , legislation that will materially assist these indi-viduals. But, once again, we are not moving with the kind of rapidity that allows for the easy accommodation of this type of legislation on the floor. I hope it does come up soon, but I think it represents the cost of this overcon-trol and this inflexibility, perhaps, that we are seeing as the management leadership style here today. Let me just briefly set the stage about the need for this legislation. Li-beria is a country that has the closest ties of any African nation to the United States\u2014it was founded by freed slaves in the middle 1800s. Its capital is Monrovia, named after President Mon-roe. It is a country that did its utmost VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7617 July 26, 2000 throughout its existence in the 1800s and the 1900s, to emulate American Government structure, at least. But it erupted into tremendous violence in 1989 and 1990. Over the next several years, 150,000 people fled to sur-rounding countries. Many of them came to the United States\u2014many being about 14,000. In March 1991, the Attorney General recognized that these individuals needed to be sheltered, so he granted temporary protected status, or TPS. Under TPS, the nationals of a coun- try may stay in the United States without fear of deportation because of the armed conflict or extraordinary conditions in their homeland. People who register for TPS receive work au-thorizations, they are required to pay taxes\u2014and this is precisely what the Liberian community has done in the United States. They went to work. They paid taxes. However, they do not qualify for benefits such as welfare and food stamps. Not a single day spent in TPS counts towards the residence re-quirement for permanent residency. So they are in this gray area, this twilight zone. They have stayed there now for 10 years because the situation did not materially change for many years. Each year, the Attorney General must conduct a review. The Attorney General did conduct such a review and continued to grant TPS until a few years ago, until the fall of 1999, when the determination was made that the situation in Liberia had stabilized enough that TPS was no longer forth-coming. At that, many of us leaped to the fore and said the situation has changed. The situation has changed in Liberia, but it has also changed with respect to these individuals here in the United States. They have established themselves in the community. They have become part of the community. Their expectations of a speedy return to Liberia long ago evaporated and they started to accommodate them-selves\u2014indeed many of them enthu-siastically\u2014to joining the greater American community. The situation changed in Liberia. The change there was more procedural than substantive. What happened was the situation in which there was an election, which was monitored by out-siders, which elected a President, the former warlord, Charles Taylor. Based upon this procedural process change, the State Department and oth-ers ruled, essentially, that the situa-tion was now ripe for the return of Li-berians from the United States and surrounding countries to Liberia. But at the heart, the chaos, the economic disruption, the violence within Liberia did not subside substantially. As a re-sult, Liberians here in the United States have genuine concerns about their return to Liberia. What has hap-pened most recently, because this is an evolving situation, is that Charles Tay-lor, the President, again, duly elected President, has not renounced all of his prior behaviors because it is strongly suggested that he has been one of the key forces who is creating the havoc in the adjoining nation of Sierra Leone. All of us have seen horrific photo- graphs of the violence there, of chil-dren whose arms and hands have been cut off by warring factions in Sierra Leone. The Revolutionary United Front is one of the key combatants in that country. Part of this is an unholy alliance between Taylor and the Revo-lutionary United Front for the purpose of creating, not only mischief, but also for exploiting diamond resources with-in Sierra Leone for the benefit of Tay-lor and the benefit of others. But all of this, this turmoil, once again, suggests that Liberia is not a place that is a sta-ble working democracy where someone, after 10 years of living in the United States, could return easily and grace-fully and immediately. Last year at this time, after being approached by myself and others, the Attorney General determined that she could not grant TPS again under the law. But she did grant Deferred En-forced Departure, or DED, to Liberians, which meant the Liberians could re-main in the United States for another year but essentially they are being de-ported. It is just stayed, delayed for a while. They have been living in this further uncertainty for the last year. My legislation would allow them to begin to adjust to a permanent resi-dency status here in the United States, and hopefully, ultimately, after pass-ing all of the hurdles, to become citi-zens of this country. They arrived here, as I said, about 10 years ago. They came here with the ex-pectation that they would have a short stay and would be home, back in their communities, back in Liberia, but that expectation was frustrated, not by them but by the violence that contin-ued to break out throughout Liberia. Now they have established them- selves here. They are part and parcel of the community, and they are ex-tremely good neighbors in my State of Rhode Island, as well as in other parts of this country. I believe equity, fair-ness, and justice require that we offer these individuals the opportunity to become permanent resident aliens and ultimately, as I said, I hope they will take the opportunity to become citi-zens of this country. Our immigration policy is an inter- esting one, idiosyncratic in many cases, but it is important to point out there are several other countries around the globe that have already dealt with a problem like this: Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, and Great Britain. After a certain length of time, even if you are there tempo-rarily\u2014certainly 10 years is a sufficient time\u2014you can, in fact, adjust your sta-tus to something akin to permanent resident of the United States and pur-sue citizenship. We have done this before. We have made these types of adjustments for other national groups that have been here and for many of the same reasons: Simple justice, length of stay, connec-tions to the community of America, continued turmoil in their own coun-tries. For example, in 1988 we passed a law to allow the Attorney General to adjust to permanent status 4,996 Polish individuals who had been here for 4 years, 387 Ugandans who had been here for 10 years, 565 Afghanis who had been here for 8 years, and 1,180 Ethiopians who had been here for 11 years. The 102nd Congress passed a law which allowed Chinese nationals who had been granted deferred enforced de-parture after Tiananmen Square to ad-just to permanent residency. Over the next 4 years, 52,968 Chinese changed their status. In the last Congress, we passed legis- lation known as NACARA. Under this law, 150,000 Nicaraguans, 5,000 Cubans, 200,000 El Salvadorans, and 50,000 Gua-temalans who had been living in the United States since the eighties were eligible to adjust to permanent resi-dency status. A separate law allows Haitians who were granted DED to ad-just to permanent residency. As one can see, we are not setting a precedent. We are doing what we have done before in response to similar mo-tivations: fairness, length of stay here, turmoil in the homeland to which we propose to deport these individuals. Another important point is why we believe we have a special obligation to Liberia. As my colleagues know\u2014and I have mentioned before\u2014this is a coun-try that shares so much with the United States. In 1822, a group of freed slaves in the United States began to settle the coast of western Africa with the assistance of private American philanthropic groups and at the behest of the U.S. Govern-ment. In 1847, these settlers established the Republic of Liberia, the first inde-pendent country in Africa. Five per-cent of the population of Liberia traces their ancestry to former American slaves. They modeled their constitu-tion after ours. And they used the dol-lar as their currency. Before the 1990 civil war, the United States was Liberia's leading trading partner and major donor of assistance. When Liberia was torn apart by civil war, they turned to the United States for help. We recognized that special re-lationship, and we offered aid to Libe-ria. We offered it, as I said, to assist those who were fleeing destruction and devastation. We should continue to do that. We have had a special relation-ship with Liberia over history, and we have formed a special relationship throughout this country with those communities of Liberians who have been here for a decade and who seek to stay. Again, this is some of the legislation we could be considering, some of the legislation with which we could be dealing if we had a process that al-lowed that free flow of legislation to the floor. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that two letters be printed in the VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7618 July 26, 2000 RECORD : A letter from Bill Gray, Presi- dent of the College Fund, and a letter from the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: THECOLLEGE FUND, Fairfax, VA, April 19, 2000. Hon. J ACKREED, U.S. Senator, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC. DEAR SENATOR REED: I write to let you know of the great importance I attach to the passage of legislation that would allow Libe-rian nationals already in the U.S. for almost ten years to become permanent residents. Your legislation, S. 656, the Liberian Immi-gration Fairness Act, would accomplish this important goal. The United States has always shared a spe- cial relationship with Liberia, a country cre-ated in 1822 by private American philan-thropic organizations for freed American slaves. In December 1989, civil war erupted in Liberia and continued to rage for seven years. USAID estimates that of Liberia's 2.1 million inhabitants, 150,000 were killed, 700,000 were internally displaced and 480,000 became refugees. To date, very little of the destroyed infrastructure has been rebuilt and sporadic violence continues. When the civil war began in 1989, thou- sands of Liberians fled to the United States. In 1991, the Attorney General granted Tem-porary Protected Status (TPS) to these Libe- rians, providing temporary relief from depor-tation since ongoing armed conflict pre-vented their safe return home. For the next seven years, the Attorney General annually renewed this TPS status. Last summer, At-torney General Reno announced that this TPS designation would end on September 28, 1999. Throughout 1999, Liberians faced the prospect that they would be uprooted and forced to return to a country still ravaged by violence and repression. However, on Sep-tember 27, 1999, President Clinton granted non-citizen Liberians living in the United States a reprieve, allowing them to remain in the country and work for one additional year. The Department of Justice estimates that approximately 10,000 Liberians are living in the United States under protection of our immigration laws. There are significant Li-berian populations in Illinois, Ohio, Michi-gan, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Georgia, Minnesota, Rhode Is-land, and North Carolina. For the past dec-ade, while ineligible for government benefits, Liberians have been authorized to work and are required to pay taxes. They married, bought homes, and placed their children, many of whom were born in this country, in school. Despite their positive contributions to our communities, their immigration sta-tus does not offer Liberians the opportunity to share fully in our society by becoming citizens. When they first arrived, these nationals of Liberia hoped that their stay in this country would indeed be temporary. But ten years have passed and they have moved on with their lives. Liberians have lived in this im-migration limbo longer than any other group in the United States. More importantly, other immigrant groups who were given tem-porary haven in the United States for much shorter periods have been allowed to adjust to permanent residency: Afghans, Ethio-pians, Poles and Ugandans after five yeas and 53,000 Chinese after just three years. It is time to end the uncertainty that Liberians have lived with for so long. It is time to allow them the opportunity to adjust to per-manent residency as our nation has allowed others before them. Following our Nation's tradition of fair- ness and decency, I am pleased to add my personal support to S. 656 in order to offer Liberians the protection they deserve. Sincerely, W ILLIAM H. G RAYIII. LUTHERAN IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE SERVICE , Washington, DC, March 7, 2000. Hon. J ACKREED, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEARSENATOR REED: On behalf of the un- dersigned organizations, we urge your sup-port of the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1999 (S. 656). This Act would provide relief and protection for some 15,000 Liberian civil war refugees and their families now residing in the United States. Since March of 1991, over 10,000 Liberian civil war refugees have resided in the United States. Recently, they were granted an ex-tension of their temporary exclusion from deportation when President Clinton ordered the Attorney General to defer their enforced departure. Granted for one year, the order is set to expire in September of this year. Against this general background, legislation has been introduced by Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) to adjust the status of certain Libe-rian nationals to that of lawful permanent residence. We strongly support Senator Reed's proposed legislation, S. 656. We view this bill as being vital to the basic protec-tion of and fairness towards Liberian civil war refugees. JUSTIFICATIONS The Liberian Refugee Immigration Fair- ness Act of 1999 would protect Liberian refu-gees and their families from being forcibly returned to a nation where their life and freedom may still be threatened. Even the Human Rights reports from the U.S. Depart-ment of State and Amnesty International have called attention to the continuing pat-tern of abuses against citizens by the Libe-rian government. Additionally, the legisla-tion would protect against the dissolution of families as Liberian parents are forced to choose between leaving their American born children in the U.S. or taking them back to Liberia if they are deported. Further, after nearly a decade of living in the U.S., Libe-rians have established real ties in their local communities and as such, forced deportation would simply be wrong. Finally, it is impera-tive that Liberian civil war refugees be ac-corded the same favorable treatment as other refugee groups seeking relief in the United States. We remain appreciative to Congress for its continued attention paid to the general issue of immigration relief for those in need, and we trust the same will be devoted to the Li-berians. We appreciate your consideration of these comments. Sincerely, R ALSTON H. D EFFENBAUGH , President. On behalf of: Nancy Schestack, Director, Catholic Char- ities Immigration Legal Services Program.

These two letters are strong statements on behalf of the leg-islation, the Liberian Refugee Immi-gration Fairness Act, which I have spo-ken about and which I ardently desire to see acted upon in this session in the next few weeks. Bill Gray, as many know, is a former distinguished Congressman from Phila-delphia, PA. He is now President of the College Fund, which was formerly known as the United Negro College Fund. He points out in his letter the long association between the United States and Liberia and urges that we act quickly and decisively to pass this leg-islation. The letter from the Lutheran Immi- gration and Refugee Service also makes that same plea for prompt and sympathetic action on this legislation. It is signed also on behalf of numerous organizations: the Catholic Charities Immigration Legal Services Program; the Episcopal Migration Ministries; the National Ministries of American Bap-tist Churches USA; the Lutheran So-cial Services of Minnesota; the Union of American Hebrew Congregations; the United Methodist Church, General Board of Church and Society; and it goes on and on. Again, this is the heartfelt plea by the church community and the reli-gious community in general of this country for a favorable and immediate response to the plight of these Libe-rians who are here with us. f VISIT TO THE SENATE BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES RECESS Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess for 6 minutes while Sen-ators and others have an opportunity to meet a distinguished guest, the President of the Philippines, the Hon-orable Joseph Estrada. There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:57 p.m., recessed until 4:03 p.m.; VerDate Mar 15 2010 SENATE S7619 July 26, 2000 whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. S ESSIONS ). The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Rhode Island has the floor. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I extend my welcome to President Estrada of the Philippines. The Philippines and the United States are allies. We have a special relationship with them, as we have a special relationship with the country I have been speaking about; that is, the country of Liberia. f TREASURY AND GENERAL GOV- ERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 2001\u2014MOTION TO PROCEED\u2014 Continued Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me con- clude my overall remarks by saying, as I began, that we are in the doldrums. We are here but we are not moving. I do not think it is sufficient to simply, on a day-by-day basis, make a little concession here and a little concession there. I think to get this Senate under full sail again, moving forward, proudly, purposefully, is to once again summon up the spirit which I always thought was inherent in this body, the spirit of vigorous and free and open debate, of vigorous and wide-ranging amendment, unfettered by the individual procliv-ities of the leader, whoever the leader may be, and then, ultimately, doing our job, which is to vote. This afternoon, I have tried to sug- gest several areas where we have ne-glected that obligation. With respect to Federal judges, it seems to me that there has been an attitude adopted here that our advice and consent is sort of an optional thing. If we do not choose to do it, then no judges will be confirmed. In a way, it is very subver-sive to the Constitution. Frankly, I don't think anyone would object if judges were brought to this floor and voted down. That is a polit-ical judgment, a policy judgment, a judgment based upon their jurispru-dence, their character, a host of issues. But what is so objectionable is this no-tion of stymying the Constitution by simple nonaction, by pushing it off into the shadows, allowing individual nomi-nees to languish, hoping that no one pays attention to it, and that at the end of the day these judges will go away and more favorable judges will be appointed. I do not think that is the way to operate this Senate. We have legislation, such as the ESEA, which has been permanently\u2014or apparently permanently\u2014shelved, not because there is something inherently wrong with the bill as it has been pre-sented\u2014we can debate the merits of that\u2014but because to bring it back to the floor would invite amendments that might be uncomfortable. I think that is also wrong. Then I think we have a measure which everyone claims is critical to our economy, critical to our future na-tional security, critical to our relation-ships with Asia and China, particu- larly, over the next several decades. That, too, has been shunted aside, not because of substance, but because of political calculation. Once again, I think that is wrong. In return, what has been suggested, is: Why don't you take a little of this and a little of that, and we will give you an amendment here, and we just might bring up two judges, but we don't know who they are. That, in com-parison, is not an appropriate response to the basic question of: Will the Sen-ate be the Senate? I would hope that we would return to that spirit, that spirit which I think drew us all here initially, with the hope and the expectation that we would debate and we would vote\u2014we would win some; we would lose some\u2014 but ultimately, by debating and by vot-ing, and by shouldering our responsibil-ities\u2014not avoiding them\u2014the Amer-ican people would ultimately be the great victors in this Democratic proc-ess. I hope we return to that spirit. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Utah. Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ap- preciate the comments from the Sen-ator from Rhode Island. I will have some responses to them in a moment. f MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\u2014S. 2912 Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I un- derstand there is a bill at the desk due for its second reading. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill for the second time. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 2912) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to remove certain limi-tations on the eligibility of aliens residing in the United States to obtain lawful perma-nent residency status. Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ob- ject to further proceedings on this bill at this time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be placed on the calendar. The Senator from Utah has the floor. f PROVIDING FOR NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE CREATION OF A TRUST FUND TO COMBAT THE AIDS EPI-DEMIC Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3519, and the Senate then proceed to its im-mediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the bill by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 3519) to provide for negotia- tions for the creation of a trust fund to be administered by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development of the International Development Association to combat the AIDS epidemic. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill. AMENDMENT NO . 4018 (Purpose: To authorize additional assistance to countries with large populations having HIV/AIDS, to provide for the establishment of the World Bank AIDS Trust Fund, to au-thorize assistance for tuberculosis preven-tion, treatment, control, and elimination, and for other purposes) Mr. BENNETT. Senator H ELMS , for himself and others, has a substitute amendment at the desk, and I ask for its consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Utah [Mr. B ENNETT ] for Mr. H ELMS , for himself, Mr. B IDEN, Mr. FRIST, Mr. K ERRY , Mr. S MITH of Oregon, Mrs. BOXER , and Mr. F EINGOLD proposes an amendment numbered 4018. (The text of the amendment is print- ed in today's R ECORD under ''Amend- ments Submitted.'') Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amend-ment be agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 4018) was agreed to. Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, passage of the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act is a priority for this Admin-istration, but that is not why I support it. I am aware of the calamity inflicted by HIV/AIDS on many Third World countries, particularly in Africa. Children are the hardest hit and they, Mr. President, are the innocent victims of this sexually transmitted disease. In fact, the official estimate of 28 million children orphaned in Africa alone could easily prove to be a low es-timate. This is among the reasons why Senator B ILLFRIST wrote the pending amendment, which is based on S. 2845, with solid advice from and by Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan's Purse and son of Billy and Ruth. That is why I support it. Several items in the pending bill should be carefully noted. First, au-thorization for appropriations for the World Bank Trust Fund is scaled back from the House proposal of five years to two years. There is no obligation for the U.S. Government to support the trust fund beyond two years. If the trust fund performs as ex- pected, Congress may decide at that time to make additional funds avail-able. However, if the Trust Fund is not transparent, if there is not strict ac-countability\u2014and if money is squan-dered on second rate or politicized projects\u2014I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that Congress does not provide another farthing. The pending bill requires that twenty percent of U.S. bilateral funding for HIV/AIDS programs be spent to support orphans in Africa. That could be as much as $60 million. This is one of the provisions on which I insisted, and I wish it could have been an even higher percentage. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, SENATE S7620 July 26, 2000 I suggest that A.I.D. get together with Nyumbani Orphanage in Nairobi, Kenya, Samaritan's Purse, and the other groups working in the field to de-velop a plan to address the crisis. Finally, I insisted that the lions share of bilateral funding, specifically, 65 percent\u2014or as much as $195 million, be available to faith-based groups and I am gratified that my colleagues have consented to this. At last, it has dawned on Senators that HIV/AIDS legislation and programs designed to address the spread of AIDS are worth-less unless they recognize and address seriously the moral and behavioral fac-tors associated with the transmission of the disease. There is only one 100 percent effec- tive way to stop the spread of AIDS, and that, of course, is abstinence and faithfulness to one's spouse. And it is through churches that this message will be effectively promoted and ac-cepted, not through government bu-reaucracies. It is no exaggeration to say that policymakers refusing to face up to this obvious fact will be culpable in the deaths of millions. Mr. President, approval of this bill will be an important accomplishment, and if its provisions are properly imple-mented it will save lives. The Foreign Relations Committee will work dili-gently over the next two years to en-sure that the intent of Congress is un-derstood and carried out. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I cannot tell you how pleased I am that the Sen-ate will finally pass the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act. HIV/AIDS has been acknowledged as the 21st cen-tury's bubonic plague. It is having a devastating impact in Sub-Saharan Af-rica, destroying the very fabric of Afri-can societies. And while Africa is the present day epicenter, there is no guar-antee that the disease will not spread throughout the world in a manner that is just as devastating. No corner of the globe is immune. HIV/AIDS is the only health related issue that has ever been the subject of a meeting of the United Nations Secu-rity Council, and the only one that has been the subject of a Security Council Resolution. Why? Because it poses a se-vere risk to every nation in the inter-national community, but most espe-cially to developing nations which do not have the means to either treat those living with the disease, or to edu-cate those at risk of contracting the disease about how to avoid infection. I believe that it is past time for the United States to step forward and lead the way in efforts aimed at stopping the spread of the HIV/AIDS. This bill does just that. The funding levels this bill authorizes significantly increase the level of U.S. assistance to combat HIV/AIDS. One of the key elements of this legislation is an authorization for the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into negotiations with the World Bank to create a Trust Fund, the purpose of which is the eradication and preven-tion of the spread of the virus. The Trust Fund will allow donations and contributions from governments\u2014 the bill authorizes $150 million as the U.S. contribution\u2014as well as the pri-vate sector, so that all sectors in soci-ety are working together at an inter-national level to address this crisis. It is truly the best way to do so. The sta-tistics are grim. According to UNAIDS, in 1999 alone 5.4 million people were in-fected with HIV/AIDS, bringing the total to 34.4 million infections world wide. 2.8 million people died of the dis-ease last year. This does not have to be. We know how to prevent the spread of the disease. We have the means to treat the virus and the opportunistic diseases that kill those infected with HIV/AIDS. Millions of lives can be saved through both treatment and pre-vention. Through cooperation we can be successful. We must challenge other donors to dedicate the necessary re-sources to achieve our aim. The bill also authorizes $300 million in bilateral assistance to stop the spread of the disease, and to treat it. While I strongly believe that a multi-lateral approach must be developed to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, I also believe that the United States should do all it can right now to de-liver targeted assistance to specific re-gions and specific treatment programs. The problem of HIV/AIDS is urgent. Bi-lateral assistance programs can be funded and programs carried out right away, and they should be. Assistance is desperately needed, for example, in Africa. The countries in the sub-Saharan region cannot wait for the negotiation of a Would Bank Trust Fund; they must have help now. The news which came out of the Inter-national AIDS Conference in Durban was grim. Gross Domestic Product could be cut by as much as 20% due to the impact of HIV/AIDS in some Afri-can countries, according to a study re-leased at the conference. African coun-tries are among the poorest in the world. They cannot afford to have their incomes diminished to such a degree. According to the World Bank, AIDS is now the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa. At all levels, the impact of AIDS in Africa is staggering: At the regional level, more than 13 million Africans have already died, and another 23 million are now living with HIV/AIDS. That is two-thirds of all cases on earth. At the na-tional level, the 21 countries with the high-est HIV prevalence in the world are in Afri-ca. In Botswana and Zimbabwe, one in four adults is infected. In at least 10 other Afri-can countries, adult prevalence rates exceed 10 percent. At the individual level, a child born in Zambia or Zimbabwe today is more likely than not to die of AIDS at some point in her lifetime. In many other African coun-tries, the lifetime risk of dying of AIDS is greater than one in three. The HIV/AIDS epi-demic is not only an unparalleled public health problem affecting large parts of Sub- Saharan Africa, it is an unprecedented threat to the region's development. In many countries, the disease is reversing decades of hard-won development progress. We cannot ignore these facts. The time to act is now. The sooner we ad-dress this crisis in Africa as well as the rest of the developing world, the bet-ter. The directives in this bill represent the best of the current proposals to do so. The World Bank and the Export-Im-port Bank of the United States both re-cently announced that they would make funds available for loans to Afri-can countries to help them purchase drugs to treat HIV/AIDS. While I wel-come any efforts to procure drugs for this purpose, I do not believe that ex-tending more loans to nations cur-rently facing crippling debt burdens will, in the long run, prove to be the most useful strategy. Grants and no strings attached assistance, the aid provided in this bill, are what is need- ed. I want to make it clear that this bill represents only the beginning of the United States' commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS. Sustained dedication of re-sources will be needed to continue the fight, and we in the Senate must en-sure that such resources continue to be channeled towards eliminating the threat of HIV/AIDS. This bill is a good first step in our efforts. Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a bipar- tisan group of members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have today sent to the Senate for consider-ation a landmark legislative initiative to combat one of the great human trag-edies of our time, the HIV/AIDS epi-demic. The Global AIDS and Tuber-culosis Relief Act of 2000 reflects the combination of many initiatives pro-posed by members of the Foreign Rela-tions Committee. All initiatives share a common purpose of arresting the progress of the disaster and caring for the victims so far. The initiative cannot come too soon. The cost in human life and produc-tivity, as well as the potential societal and economic disruptions AID has and will cause assure us of one distinct pos-sibility: All goals of the United States in Africa and the developing world\u2014 goals we share with them\u2014will be seri-ously compromised, if not completely undermined, by AIDS. Growing trade, better education and health, stronger democracies, efforts toward peace\u2014all will be undermined by a disease that is positioned to sap the life from the most promising and productive generations. Two characteristics of this pandemic that distinguish it from the other great killers have impressed me the most and shaped the Senate's recent initia-tive to support the efforts to combat HIV/AIDS worldwide. The first is the fact that AIDS affects the younger members of a community in their most productive years. It thus contorts and eventually turns on its head the already strained economic equation by effectively reversing the proposition of dependants to produc-tive members of a family. In short, it has struck at the heart of the extended families, changing the breadwinners from a source of needed food or income to a burden. That is to say nothing of the grief, personal loss and often shame associated with death from AIDS. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7621 July 26, 2000 The second is that the estimated number of orphans from AIDS in Afri-ca, for example, already exceeds 10 mil-lion, and is expected to approach 40 million in coming years. Many of those children will themselves be HIV-posi-tive. The prospect of 40 million chil-dren without hope, health and often without any support whatsoever is as dangerous as it is tragic. These chil-dren are susceptible to substance abuse, prostitution, banditry or, as we have seen so often on the continent, child soldiery. It will be an economic strain on weakening or completely bro-ken economies, and an extremely vola-tile element in strained societies. The human cost of AIDS is already alarmingly high, and the trends are in-creasingly terrifying\u2014even apoca-lyptic. Sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely affected by AIDS than any other part of the world. It is our greatest challenge. I have seen the ef-fects of its ravages on the people of that continent firsthand. The potential is clearly written in the appalling sta-tistics of the disease today. According to December 1999 United Nations data, some 23.3 million adults and children are infected with the HIV virus in the region, which has about 10 percent of the world's population but nearly 70 percent of the worldwide total of infected people. In Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwean es-timated 20 percent to 26 percent of adults are infected with HIV, and 13 percent of adults in South Africa were infected as the end of 1997. An estimated 13.7 million Africans have lost their lives to AIDS, including 2.2 million who died in 1998. The overall rate of infection among adults in sub- Saharan Africa is about 8 percent com-pared with a 1.1 percent infection rate worldwide. AIDS has surpassed malaria as the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, and it kills many times more people than Africa's armed conflicts. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only re- gion in which women are infected with HIV at a higher rate than men. Accord-ing to UNAIDS, women make up an es-timated 55 percent of the HIV-positive adult population in sub-Saharan Afri-ca, as compared with 35 percent in the Caribbean, the next highest-ranking re-gion, and 20 percent in North America. Young women are particularly at risk. A U.N. study found girls aged 15-19 to be infected at a rate of 15 percent to 23 percent, while infection rates among boys of the same age were 3 percent to 4 percent. The African AIDS epidemic is having a much greater impact on children than is the case in other parts of the world. An estimated 600,000 African in-fants become infected with HIV each year through mother to child trans-mission, either at birth or through breast-feeding. At least 7.8 million African children have lost either their mother or both parents to AIDS, and thus are regarded by UNAIDS as ''AIDS orphans.'' South Africa is expected to have one million AIDS orphans by 2004. An estimated 10 million or more African children will have lost either their mother or both parents to AIDS by the end of the year 2000. In some urban areas of Africa, or-phans comprise up to 15 percent of all children. Many of these children are themselves infected with HIV/AIDS and often face rejection from their ex-tended families and from their commu-nities. In its January 17, 2000 issue. News- week projected that there will be 10.4 million African AIDS orphans by the end of 2000. UNAIDS reports that AIDS orphans, suspected of carrying the dis-ease, generally run a greater risk of being malnourished and of being denied an education. At current infection and growth rates for HIV/AIDS, the National Intel-ligence Council estimates that the number of AIDS orphans worldwide will increase dramatically, potentially increasing three-fold or more in the next ten years, contributing to eco-nomic decay, social fragmentation, and political destabilization in already volatile and strained societies. Chil-dren without care or hope are often drawn into prostitution, crime, sub-stance abuse or child soldiery. The majority of governments in areas of sub-Saharan Africa facing the greatest burden of AIDS orphans are largely ill-prepared to adequately ad-dress the rapid growth in the number of children who have no means of sup-port, no education nor access to other opportunities. Donors must focus on adequate prep- arations for the explosion in the num-ber of orphans and the burden they will place on families, communities, econo-mies, and governments. Support struc-tures and incentives for families, com-munities and institutions which will provide care for children orphaned by HIV/AIDS, or for the children who are themselves infected by HIV/AIDS, will become increasingly important as the number of AIDS orphans increases dra-matically. By providing a knowledge, skills, and hope orphaned children might not oth-erwise have, education is an especially critical part of a long term strategy. Education is the key to providing op-portunity and fighting poverty, and education is essential to winning the battle against the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The legislation does not focus solely on Africa, but reflects the fact that the grip of the disease is tightening around the developing world. Some of the mechanisms are new and yet untested. But in their design, their potential for being the most effective tools at our disposal is clear. We need to be mindful that the United States can be a great force for good in the world. Certainly, Ameri-cans are very charitable and compas-sionate people, and the political will exists to take a more aggressive pos-ture toward combating AIDS. However, our job is to determine how best to use our limited resources to maximize their potential for good on the African continent. These are life and death decisions which cannot be addressed simply by allocating more funds, confident that we have thus done our part. How we direct or allo-cate those resources has the potential to significantly affect the situation. Questions and issues involved in life and death decisions are not easy. They are decisions based on the under-standing that you cannot help or save all in need in a situation, but must make decisions based on the best infor-mation and understanding of your strengths and limitations. Over the next two years, the legisla- tion authorizes $300 million per year for ongoing HIV/AIDS programs world-wide. That represents a significant in-crease in our commitment and is well above the President's request. The United States has been a leader in AIDS prevention programs and in AIDS treatment and programs to mitigate the devastating societal and economic effects of the epidemic. We should con-tinue that leadership and even strengthen it. Additionally, the legislation author- izes $100 million to the Global Alliance for Vaccines Initiative, know by its ac-ronym, GAVI, which receives both pub-lic and private funding to provide ex-isting vaccines to children worldwide, and to provide incentives for the devel-opment of new vaccines. Often, compa-nies determine that it is not possible to commit the capital to research and de-velopment toward developing vaccines for diseases such as malaria. While the potential number of recipients is great, the potential number of purchasers is very small. By providing a clear pur-chaser for the future, GAVI addresses much of the questions involving the risks of investing in such research. The legislation goes beyond incen- tives alone. Over two years, it commits $20 million to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, or IAVI, a group which is committed to developing the ultimate weapon against the continued spread of HIV: a vaccine. The legislation does not seek to act unilaterally, but has two critical ele-ments which will help use our leader-ship position to leverage greater co-operation to combat the epidemic. First, it seeks to establish a global trust for programs to combat the transmission of HIV and to respond to the devastation of AIDS. Under the leg-islation, the United States can con-tribute up to $150 million per year for two years to capitalize the fund. Of that, $50 million annually is specifi-cally targeted to address the great human tragedy and most daunting challenge of AIDS orphans. Undoubt-edly, the initial generous contribution of the United States will spur many more commitments from other nations. The legislation does not leave the question of orphans to the trust fund alone. It also directs the United States VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7622 July 26, 2000 to begin coordinating a global strategy to address the orphans crisis, espe-cially in caring for them and educating them. This is in addition to the specific focus on education and care of orphans in Africa mandated in the initial au-thorization of ongoing programs and in the trust fund. Only education can pro-vide the tools for these children to es-cape the poverty, violence and exploi-tation that they will often face. The strong emphasis on this explosive and frightening problem is one of the most forward looking approaches to inter-national health yet considered by Con-gress. I cannot overemphasize the im-portance of these provisions. The legislation also addresses the in- creasing threat of tuberculosis world-wide. The diseases' resurgence is a clear and direct threat to the United States' public health. Astonishingly, the World Health Organization esti-mates that one third of the world's population is infected with tuber-culosis. With the increasingly drug re-sistant strains of the disease emerging yearly, the urgency of the initiative is critical. The legislation authorizes $60 million each year for two years for pro-grams to combat the disease. That fig-ure represents a substantial increase in our efforts to ensure our own safety and health and to combat the scourge worldwide. Overall, this legislation represents a clear recognition of the importance to our own health and security to com-bating infectious disease worldwide. More significantly, though, it is a mon-umental new commitment by the United States to combat the death and suffering of our fellow humans. It is a great demonstration of America's gen-erosity and our hope to improve the lives and potential of all people. Mr. KERRY. I am pleased to join the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. H ELMS , and the Chairman of the Africa Sub-committee, Dr. F RIST, in bringing this very important bill to the Senate. Mr. President, the human toll of the AIDS crisis in Africa is stupefying. More than 30 million people now live with AIDS and annual AIDS-related fa-talities hit a record 2.6 million last year. Ninety-five percent of all cases are found in the developing world. AIDS is now the leading cause of death in Africa and the fourth leading cause of death in the world. In at least 5 Afri-cans countries, more than 20 percent of adults are HIV-positive. The AIDS epidemic is more dev- astating than wars: in 1998 in Africa, 200,000 people died from armed conflict; 2.2 million died from AIDS\u2014more than 5,000 Africans died every day from the disease. This week, the U.S. Census Bureau announced new demographic findings for Africa. Because of AIDS, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa will expe-rience negative population growth in the next five years. Without AIDS, these countries would have experienced a 2-3 percent increase in population. Children born within the past 5 years in Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe can expect to die before the age of 35. Without AIDS, their life expectancy would have been 70. In addition, a new and very troubling statistic was an-nounced this week: UNAIDS reported that 55 percent of all HIV-infections were in women. So AIDS is not only robbing societies of young women but also of the child they might have had. It is not hyperbole to say that this is Africa's worst social catastrophe since slavery, and the world's worst health crisis since the bubonic plague. Other parts of the world are going down the same path as Africa. Infec-tion rates in Asia are climbing rapidly, with several countries, especially India, on the brink of large-scale ex-pansion of the epidemic. When I was in India in December, epidemiologist from our government as well as Indian offi-cials admitted that the number of cases in Asia could surpass those of Af-rica by the year 2010. In addition, countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are especially vulnerable, as Russia is ex-periencing one of the highest increases in infection rates of any single country in the world last year. Is this the kind of world we want for the 21st century? In this age of remarkable biotechnical and biomedical breakthroughs, when we have cures of impotence and treat-ments for depression, do we want to ig-nore a public health crisis of biblical proportions? When we're talking about the democratization of the developing world, when we're talking about the triumph of capitalism and open mar-kets, when we're talking about the benefits of globalization, we cannot re-main silent\u2014as rich as we are in tal-ent, technology and money\u2014about the threat AIDS poses to our national se-curity. Mr. President, last week, the 13th an- nual International Conference on AIDS was taking place in Durban, South Af-rica. It was the first time this inter-national conference is being held in a country in the epicenter of the AIDS pandemic in the developing world. A number of important break- throughs have been announced from the Conference and the Senate should be aware of them: Pharmaceutical companies have an- nounced that they are prepared to offer their life-extending therapies to the de-veloping world at no cost or at a very discounted rate. Merck will provide Botswana with $100 million in medicine over the next five years. Abbott Lab-oratories confirmed that it will ini-tiate a charitable program in Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Romania and India. Boehringer Ingelheim will give away one of the most important drugs in pre-venting the transmission of HIV from mother to child\u2014Viramune\u2014to devel-oping countries over the next 5 years. Similarly, Pfizer recently promised to give South Africa its effective prod-uct\u2014Diflucan\u2014which is used for treat-ing a deadly brain infection associated with AIDS. These are all important develop- ments. Access to these pharmaceutical products has historically been pre-vented by high price, and these compa-nies should continue to work with gov-ernments and philanthropies like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2014 which today is announcing another $90 million in grants to combat AIDS in the developing world. The contribution made by Bill and Melinda Gates to fighting infectious diseases cannot be overstated. Through their philan-thropy, they have given countries which are being ravaged by disease a fighting chance. Fighting and winning the war against AIDS is more than just giving away medicine. We must continue to bolster the research into a cure. To this end, a number of significant bio-medical breakthroughs have come out of Durban. The most significant is the announcement by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative of human trials of a new vaccine candidate against AIDS. Development of an effec-tive AIDS vaccine is critical especially in Africa where preventive measures\u2014 such as encouraging change in high- risk behaviors and debunking deadly myths\u2014will do little to slow the spread of HIV in countries which have a 20 or 25 percent infection rate. It is clear that the only hope for these countries is a cure: that means, developing an ef-fective vaccine and assuring its afford-able distribution. And, we have a responsibility to act in this increasingly intertwined world because, together with all the benefits associated with globalization, we also now are facing a range of new threats that know no borders and move with-out prejudice\u2014international crime, cyber-terrorism, drug-trafficking and infectious diseases. We are seeing a rise in the number of previously unknown lethal and potent disease agents identified since 1973\u2014 the ebola virus, hepatitis C, drug-re-sistant tuberculosis, West Nile virus and HIV. These diseases affect all of us, including American citizens. New Yorkers know the scare associated with these heretofore unknown dis-eases\u2014last summer New York City was held captive by an encephalitis scare and new outbreaks this year have al-ready been spotted in pigeons. There was a shock in the scientific commu-nity when it was discovered that out-break of the mosquito-borne disease in New York was not, as scientists had be-lieved, St Louis encephalitis: instead, it was a deadly variant of West Nile virus, a disease hitherto found only in Africa, the Middle East and parts of West Asia. United States health offi-cials now fear that the disease may now become prevalent in the Ameri-cans. Similarly, it is foolhardly and dangerous to believe that any infec-tious disease can be adequately con-tained in one region. We are all at-risk. Militaries are not immune; in fact, they are in some cases even more sus-ceptible to upheaval and instability VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7623 July 26, 2000 from infectious diseases, especially AIDS. Some militaries in Africa have HIV-infection rates which top 40 per-cent. These military forces could be part of the solution for democratiza-tion in Africa in terms of peacekeeping and conflict prevention; instead, Afri-can armed services are losing their military effectiveness and adding to the social instability. It is projected that Africa will be home to 40 million children, orphaned by AIDS, by the year 2010. Zambia is a country of 11 million people\u2014half a million of them will be AIDS orphans. We know from other regions of the world\u2014like Cambodia and Burma\u2014that exploited children are common targets by rogue militias and narco- and other criminal organizations. It is clearly in our interest to stem this activity. Likewise, economies are not im- mune. In fact, development of the last 20 years is being reversed in the coun-tries hardest-hit by AIDS. AIDS cost Namibia almost 8 percent of its GDP in 1996. Tanzania will experience a 15 to 25 percent drop in its GDP because of AIDS over the next decade. Over the next few years, Kenya's GDP will be 14.5 percent less than it would have been absent AIDS. AIDS consumes more than 50 percent of already meager health budgets. In many African coun-tries, the total annual per capita health-care budget is $10. 80 percent of the urban hospital beds in Malawi are filled with AIDS patients\u2014all is a di-rect threat on evolving democratic de-velopment and free-market transition. Mozambique and Botswana have two of the world's fastest growing economies but this economic growth cannot be maintained when those countries' workforces are being decimated with the daily deaths of hundreds of people in their most productive years. In the Cote d'Ivoire, a teacher dies of com-plications associated with AIDS every school day. In South Africa, businesses owners often hire and train two em-ployees for one job, knowing that one will probably die from AIDS. As we celebrated the passage this year of the Africa Trade bill, how can we seriously think that a vibrant mar-ket for products or investment can be formed on a continent which will lose up to 20 percent of its population in the next decade? To lure investors, the continent has already had to battle underdevelopment and racism, but now, some people in the developed world will see Africa as only as a place of disease. This is wrong and it is a di-rect threat to our national economic interests. Governments are not immune. This epidemic is causing leadership crises in some African countries. President Ben-jamin Mkapa of Tanzania reported last week that ''some ministries lose about 20 employees each month to AIDS.'' African governments are grappling with the devastation wrought by HIV on their economies and their societies. It is difficult to fathom the challenges they face with this public health crisis, and some of the actions sometimes baf- fle western observers. Some critics have recently pointed to the questions raised by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa as to the origins of AIDS and as to the proper course of treat-ment. When it comes to dealing with AIDS, there are moral questions, there are budgetary constraints, there are political decisions. But there are also some biomedical truths. Senator F RIST and I have discussed these issues with the distinguished ambassador from South Africa and followed up with President Mbeki when he came to Washington on a state visit. Leader-ship is necessary from both the United States and from Africa\u2014this issue can-not be solved by one nation alone. But no one country can ignore it either. President Mbeki has focused his atten-tion on fighting the AIDS epidemic by fighting poverty. In his remarks in Durban, he missed an opportunity by refusing to state unequivocally that HIV causes AIDS. And, I fear, his ques-tions will allow those who engaged in risky and unsafe practices to continue. Only bashing pharmaceutical compa-nies is not helpful in the fight against AIDS, and the participants at the International Conference on AIDS rightly passed a resolution in support of the tested science of AIDS. One can argue\u2014and I do not at all subscribe to that argument\u2014that Afri-ca does not matter to the security in-terests of the United States. Some even mock the suggestion. I believe that this is not an issue of which any decent rational human being can be dismissive. One humanitarian terms, on political terms, on cultural terms, on economic terms, on historical terms, no one should dare be dismissive. We are linked to everything that is happening in Africa, starting back to our nation's and civilization's earliest history, and we are now tied by the new forces of globalization and technology. And I hope that we will al-ways be tied by who we are and what we are as nation. This really tests the fiber of our country, in a sense, and questions whether we are prepared to deal with this threat. But even if you subscribe to the view that the AIDS disaster in Africa is not a threat to our national security, you have to at least recognize that unfet-tered spread of this horrendous virus to other regions of the world\u2014including North America\u2014is certainly a threat. As goes Africa, so goes India and China\u2014and no one in this Senate can make the argument that an India or a China, destabilized by a public health catastrophe, can be ignored in terms of our national security interests. The window of opportunity is now open to making a real difference in Af-rica and improving global health, and that is why I am so pleased that the Senate is acting with all dispatch to make a significant contribution to fighting the epidemic in Africa. This bill builds upon the work of many of our most thoughtful and distinguished colleagues. It includes initiatives that Congresswoman N ANCY PELOSI , Senator FRIST and I began many months ago to speed vaccine development, to deal with AIDS orphans and to alleviate the suffering of those infected with HIV on the African continent. It also incor-porates the plan Senator F RIST, Con- gressman L EACH and I have devised to inaugurate AIDS prevention grants from the World Bank. Senator D URBIN and I proposed a plan to assist AIDS orphans, and the spirit of that legisla-tion is found throughout this bill. Sen-ator B OXER and Senator G ORDON SMITH have called for funding increases to AIDS prevention programs in Africa; Senator M OYNIHAN and Senator F EIN- GOLD have a proposal to target money to prevent further infection among in-fants. Their contributions can be seen in this bill. The work of the appropriators has been and will continue to be vital in funding programs to assist Africa. I commend Senator L EAHY and Senator MCCONNELL for increasing funding for the existing appropriations accounts on global health in the Foreign Oper-ations bill and I am very grateful that they have agreed to fund the Global Al-liance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) which I have been urging for a year now. I would also like to acknowledge the significant contribution of the distin-guished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. H ELMS . I commend the Chairman and our ranking member, Senator B IDEN, for their leadership. They have ensured that this session will not close until we have passed the largest single response by our Nation to the global AIDS epidemic. It is my hope that the other body will move to pass these vital proposals with all necessary speed. It is clearly in our national interests\u2014security, economic, political, health and moral\u2014 to do all we can to solve this crisis. Let me be clear on this, Mr. President, my commitment to this issue is not transi-tory. I will not rest on this legislative victory. I will be back next year and every year after that until this public health disaster is over. Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Global AIDS and Tu-berculosis Relief Act of 2000. This bill recognizes the awesome and terrible scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and responds with what is truly required to address it\u2014a program far more com-prehensive and substantial than what is entailed in the status quo. The numbers one must use to de- scribe the crisis are numbing. More than 70 percent of all people living with AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa, and as the ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, I have seen firsthand the devastating toll that the disease has taken in the region. In Af-rica alone, 15,900,000 people have died because of AIDS, and the World Bank has identified the disease as the fast-est-growing threat to development in the region. Life expectancies are drop-ping dramatically, and the social fall- VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7624 July 26, 2000 out from this horrific upheaval has forced us to confront the disease not just as an epidemiological threat, but as a security threat as well. Nearly 4,500,000 children have HIV and more are being infected at the rate of one child every minute. According to UNAIDS, by the end of 1999, AIDS had left 13,200,000 orphaned children in its wake. This bill is a serious effort to con- front this monstrous crisis. It will pro-vide hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to strengthen prevention ef-forts, to combat mother-to-child trans-mission, to improve access to testing, counseling, and care, and to assist the orphans left in the wake of the disease. Through a new AIDS trust fund, it will leverage U.S. assistance with a multi-lateral approach and through innova-tive partnerships with the private sec-tor. The bill provides support to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Im-munizations and to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, so that even as we address the urgent needs of the present, we work toward a solution in the future. The bill insists that AIDS education be provided to troops trained under the auspices of the African Crisis Response Initiative. It recognizes the inextricable link between HIV/AIDS and the resurgence of tuberculosis. It goes beyond the President's request and beyond anything that this Con-gress has contemplated since the epi-demic began. The bill is not perfect, of course. The needs are great and the problem multi- faceted. I would still like to see this Congress address the important issue of access to pharmaceuticals, and to put strong language into statute that would prohibit the executive branch from pressuring countries in crisis to revoke or change laws aimed at in-creasing access to HIV/AIDS drugs, so long as the laws in question adhere to existing international regulations gov-erning trade. This bill does not absolve this Senate of a continued responsi-bility to address the global AIDS crisis. But it is remarkable, all the same. This bill has the unanimous support of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-mittee. Senators H ELMS , BOXER , FRIST, KERRY , and B IDEN have worked on it tirelessly. It includes provisions origi-nally drafted in the Mother-to-Child HIV Prevention Act, a bill authored by Senator M OYNIHAN of which I was proud to be an original co-sponsor. It reflects the admirable work of the House and in particular of Congress-woman B ARBARA LEEand Congressman LEACH , and it should reach the Presi- dent's desk quite quickly. Rarely does such a substantive, ground-breaking bill enjoy this degree of bipartisan con-sensus. It is a tribute to my colleagues and a testimony to the undeniable magnitude and urgency of the crisis that the Senate stands ready to pass this legislation today. Just days ago, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke testified before the Senate Foreign Re-lations Committee. When he was speaking about the AIDS crisis, he spoke of its impact and of the place the epidemic has already taken in history, and said, ''All of us will have to ask ourselves, when our careers are done, did we address this problem?'' This bill is an important part of the answer to that question. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today the Senate is taking a big step forward in the fight against international AIDS and Tuberculosis. Today's passage of H.R. 3519, the Global AIDS and Tuber-culosis Relief Act of 2000, will help those throughout the world who are suffering from these deadly infectious diseases. I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes two bills that I in-troduced earlier in the 106th Congress. In February, I introduced the Global AIDS Prevention Act (S. 2026). This legislation authorizes $300 million in bilateral aid for those nations most se-verely affected by HIV and AIDS. It calls on the United States Agency for International Development to make HIV and AIDS a priority in its foreign assistance program and undertake a comprehensive, coordinated effort to combat HIV and AIDS. This assistance will include primary prevention and education, voluntary testing and coun-seling, medications to prevent the transmission of HIV and AIDS from mother to child, and care for those liv-ing with HIV or AIDS. H.R. 3519 also includes legislation I introduced last year, the International Tuberculosis Control Act (S. 1497). This bill authorizes $60 million in aid to fight the growing international prob-lem of tuberculosis. With this legisla-tion, the United States Agency for International Development will coordi-nate with the World Health Organiza-tion, the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, and other organizations toward the devel-opment and implementation of a com-prehensive tuberculosis control pro-gram. This bill also sets as a goal the detection of at least 70 percent of the cases of infectious tuberculosis and the cure of at least 85 percent of the cases detected by 2010. H.R. 3519 has other important provi- sions as well. The bill includes a $10 million contribution to the Inter-national AIDS Vaccine Initiative and a $50 million contribution to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immuniza-tions. It also contains provisions call-ing for the establishment of a World Bank AIDS Trust Fund with the Sec-retary of the Treasury authorized to provide $150 million for payment to the fund. I want to thank all of the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-mittee for their work on this legisla-tion. I am particularly grateful for the efforts of Chairman H ELMS in pushing this bill forward. This is an important step in the fight against AIDS and TB. I have no doubt that greater resources will be needed in future years to continue this effort. I am hopeful that the Senate will con-tinue to treat the issue of infectious diseases with the seriousness it de-serves. There are 34 million people today liv- ing with HIV/AIDS, and one-third of the world's population is infected with tuberculosis. Much more needs to be done, and I am proud of the Senate for taking this action today. Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, as amend-ed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any state-ments relating to the bill be printed in the R ECORD . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The bill (H.R. 3519), as amended, was read the third time and passed. f TREASURY AND GENERAL GOV- ERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 2001\u2014MOTION TO PROCEED\u2014 Continued Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will now turn to the subject that has been raised today and yesterday and last week and repeatedly in the last few weeks. That is the subject of why the Senate is not proceeding on the pace and with the vigor we all think it should. We have heard from the Sen-ator from Rhode Island and others today about how the majority leader has somehow dictatorially brought ev-erything to a terrible halt and wouldn't it be wonderful if we went back to the great spirit of cooperation and comity that allows us to get things done. I agree absolutely that it would be wonderful to return to the spirit of cooperation and comity that would allow things to be done, but I think it is pointing the finger in the wrong place to attack the majority leader. Let me share with you my experience this last week. Monday of this week was July 24, which in my home State is the biggest day of the year. July 24 happens to be the day that Brigham Young and the first group of Mormon pioneers entered Salt Lake Valley and put down roots that have now become not only Salt Lake Valley but the State of Utah. Every year we celebrate that historic event with a major pa-rade. It is one of the requirements for a politician to be in that parade. Sen-ator H ATCH and I always confer about whether or not we will be able to make the parade because we don't want to miss votes. There have been times when we have had to miss the parade to be here to do our appropriate duty. On Friday of last week, I went to the staff of the leadership and said: What is going to happen on Monday? I was told: We will be on energy and water. There will be amendments and there will be votes. I then went to the subcommittee chairman of the Appropriations Com-mittee and said to him\u2014this being Sen-ator D OMENICI \u2014how important will the votes be and how many will there be? VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec S7625 July 26, 2000 Senator D OMENICI said: Well, there will be several votes, but I think they will be relatively unimportant ones. They will not be close. I said: Well, Senator, I think under those circumstances, I will go to Utah and ride in the July 24 parade. If you can assure me that it will not create an undue hardship for you with respect to passing important amendments that my vote would not be absolutely essen-tial, I think I will go to Utah. He told me: Senator, you can go to Utah. I will see to it that the amend-ments that we vote on on Monday will not be so close that your vote would have made that much of a difference. So I went to Utah. When I got back, I said to my staff: How many votes did I miss and how important were they? I found out I didn't miss any votes. The Senate didn't vote. Why? The Senate didn't take up the bill. Why? Because the minority objected to the motion to proceed, and the majority leader was required to file a cloture motion on the motion to proceed to consider the bill. I have made the statement in this Chamber before that based on my expe-rience, I can remember a time when no one ever objected to a motion to pro-ceed. A filibuster on the issue of the motion to proceed was something that was unheard of from either side. We have been told this afternoon ''couldn't we go back to the time when people got along with each other'' from the same side of the aisle that has said: We will filibuster the motion to proceed. So the majority leader had to file a cloture petition. He filed the cloture petition. We voted on it. When we voted on it, it was passed overwhelm-ingly, if not unanimously. That raises the question: Why did we go through this exercise? Why couldn't we have been on the bill at the time we were scheduled to be on the bill? Why are we in this situation now when we are under a cloture situation running off 30 hours on the clock so we can then fi-nally get around to voting on the bill, knowing that as soon as we get through with this one, there will be an-other one where there will be objection to the motion to proceed, the require-ment that a cloture petition be filed, and the running off the clock again? There are various ways to defeat leg- islation. One of them is to delay it. I said once before, I worry this Chamber has started to move from being the world's greatest deliberative body to being the world's greatest campaign forum. I am distressed by reports in the popular press that say that the Vice President and his party intend to run against a do-nothing Congress. We are doing everything we can to make this a do-something Congress, but there are forces at work to try to cre-ate the prophecy of a do-nothing Con-gress into a self-fulfilling prophecy. It can be done in such a way that the public at large doesn't understand what is going on. The public at large doesn't know what cloture means. I go home to my constituents and I try to explain what is going on. They don't understand what the motion to proceed is. They don't understand the rules of the Senate. You talk to them about unanimous consent agreements that are not being agreed to, agreements that are made between the two leaders that then get set aside and cloture pe-titions, their eyes glaze over when you start talking like that. They come back to you\u2014these are my constitu-ents\u2014and they say: Why aren't you getting your work done? When you have to make these kinds of explanations, the public gets impa-tient, which plays into the hands of those whose electoral strategy is run against a do-nothing Congress. I have started to use that language, as I ex-plain to my constituents why we are not getting the people's work done. I say to them very deliberately\u2014and it pains me because I do not want to cast clouds over this institution, but I be-lieve I have to say it anyway\u2014there are those who want to run against a do- nothing Congress who are determined to create a do-nothing Congress. And in the Senate, the rules are such that you can do that. The rules are such that even if you are in the minority, if you want to bring this place to its knees and bring it to a halt, you can do that. I have been in the minority. I have heard some of my fellow party mem-bers in the minority say: We have to bring this place to a halt; we have to shut it down. I am glad I didn't partici-pate in the attempts on the part of the minority to shut this place down when George Mitchell was the majority lead-er; when George Mitchell did many of the things that T RENT LOTT is now being accused of doing; when George Mitchell said: We have to do the peo-ple's business, even if it means, as ma-jority leader, I exercise something of an iron fist to make sure we do the people's business; I will do it and we will get the people's business done. Those on this side of the aisle who said in my hearing, ''let's shut this place down,'' did not prevail. I did not participate with them, and I am proud of that fact, that we did not attempt to shut this place down. Were we frustrated? Absolutely. Were we upset? Absolutely. Did we engage in filibusters, yes, straight up. My as-signed time was from 1 to 2 o'clock in the morning in a filibuster, when George Mitchell said: If the Repub-licans are going to filibuster us, let's go around the clock. I was very up front about it. I believed the bill that we were talking about was sufficiently bad that I was willing to take my turn from 1 to 2 o'clock in the morning to see to it that the bill didn't pass. That is part of the game around here. That is the way the rules are struc-tured. I have no problem with that. But objecting to the rule to proceed, which is the kind of thing the public doesn't understand, but that all of us under-stand, is a stealth filibuster. It is an attempt to slip under the public aware-ness, shut this place down, and create a situation where you can then run against a do-nothing Congress. I remember the first person to run against a do-nothing Congress\u2014Harry Truman. I remember what Harry Tru-man did. It was very different from what is being done here. Let's get a lit-tle history here. Harry Truman was President of the United States by virtue of Franklin Roosevelt's death. He had not run for President, he had not been elected, and he was not very popular in the country. The Republicans controlled both Houses of Congress as a result of Harry Truman's lack of popularity, and they were absolutely sure they were going to win the 1948 election. So they were determined they were not going to pass any legislation that Harry Truman could veto. They were going to wait until Thomas Dewey became President of the United States, and then they were going to pass their legislation for a President who would sign it. They held the Republican National Convention, and in the convention they outlined all of the things they were going to do, once they were in power, in both the Congress and the executive branch. Well, Harry Truman called their bluff. Harry Truman said: If that's what the Republicans really will do when they are in charge, let them do it now. He called the Congress back into session after the Republican con-vention and said to them: Here is your opportunity. Here is your platform. Pass your platform. Well, Robert Taft, who was the domi- nant Republican\u2014the man whose pic-ture graces the outer lobby here as one of the five greatest Senators who ever lived\u2014made what I think was a mis-calculation. He thought Harry Truman was so unpopular in the country at large that the Congress could thumb its nose at the President of the United States, and he said: We are not going to do anything in this special session that the President has called us into. We are not going to play his game. So the Republican Congress ad- journed after that special session with-out having done anything\u2014delib-erately, without having done anything. Harry Truman then went out and ran against the do-nothing 80th Congress and got himself elected in his own right as President of the United States. It was one of the great political moves of this century. That is not what we are dealing with here. We are not dealing with a Repub-lican Party that doesn't want to act. We are not dealing with a Republican Party that doesn't want to solve the people's problems. We are dealing with a Republican Party that is trying des-perately to perform the one absolutely required constitutional function that the Congress has, which is to fund the Government. We are trying to pass ap-propriations bills to fund the Govern-ment, so that there will not be a Gov-ernment shutdown, there will not be a continuing resolution, there will not be a crisis at the end of the fiscal year. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7626 July 26, 2000 When we try to move to the bills that will fund the Government, we run into procedural roadblocks on the part of those who are then talking about run-ning against a do-nothing Congress. That is what is going on here. If we have to say it again and again and again, so that our constituents fi- nally begin to understand it, I am will-ing to say it again and again and again. We have discovered that one of the strategies being played out in this great campaign forum is to take an amendment that is seen as a tough po-litical vote, bring it up, see it defeated, and then the next week bring it up again, and then complain when the Re-publicans say we have already voted on that; we don't need to vote on it again. Oh, yes, you do, says the leadership on the other side; let's vote on it again. If we vote on it again and defeat it, thinking, OK, we have had a debate and we have taken our tough political votes and we have made it clear where we stand on this issue, let's move for-ward, no, we are told somehow when you want to move forward without bringing up this amendment again: You are thwarting the will of the Sen-ate; you are turning the Senate into another version of the House of Rep-resentatives if you won't let us vote on this controversial amendment a third time. If it gets voted on a third time, then it comes up a fourth time. If it gets voted on a fourth time, it comes up a fifth time. Every time the majority leader says: We have done that, we have debated that, we have voted on that, he is told: No, if you take a posi-tion that prevents us from voting on it again, you are destroying the sanctity of this institution. Well, now we are being told we are interfering with the President's con-stitutional right to appoint judges. I find that very interesting because this Congress has confirmed more judges in an election year than previous Con-gresses. Quoting from my colleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee, and therefore in a position to have the statistics, there are fewer va-cancies in the Federal judiciary now than when the Democrats controlled the Congress and the Republicans con-trolled the White House in an election year. If I may quote from Senator H ATCH : Democrats contend that things were much better when they controlled the Senate. Much better for them, perhaps. It was cer-tainly not better for many of the nominees of Presidents Reagan and Bush. At the end of the Bush administration, for example, the vacancy rate stood at nearly 12 percent. By contrast, as the Clinton administration draws to a close, the vacancy rate stands at just 7 percent. Well, turning it around, the vacancy rate we are facing now is roughly half that which a Democratic Senate gave to President Bush as he was facing re-election. Oh, but we are being told: No, there are judges who have languished for a long time; therefore, we should have a vote on the judges whose names have been before us the longest before we have a vote on the judges who may have been nominated more recently, and it is terrible to hold a judge or any nominee for a long period of time. We need to give him or her a vote. We need to bring the names to the floor of the Senate, and the minority leader should decide which name is brought to the floor of the Senate. I remember when I first came to this body, I was assigned to the Banking Committee. There was a nominee sent forward by President Clinton whom the chairman of the Banking Committee didn't like. The chairman of the Bank-ing Committee at the time was, of course, a member of President Clin-ton's own party. But his objection, as I understood it\u2014and I may be wrong\u2014 was that this particular nominee had too much Republican background on his resume, that this particular nomi-nee had not been ideologically pure enough for the chairman of the Bank-ing Committee. As I say, that is my memory, and I could be wrong. But that was the very strong position on the part of the chairman of the Banking Committee. That nominee didn't come up for a hearing before the Banking Committee for the entire 2 years that the Demo-crats controlled the Banking Com-mittee and that man was the chair-man. Any attempt on the part of any-body else to get that particular nomi-nation moving was thwarted by the chairman. Now, what if the then-minority lead- er, Senator Dole, had come to the floor and said we will not allow anything to go forward until this nominee comes to the floor for a vote? How would people have reacted to that kind of action on the part of the minority leader if the entire minority had gathered around him, and said: We will stand with you, we will filibuster the motion to proceed, and we will do everything we can to bring the Senate to a complete halt until this nominee that has languished in the Banking Committee for almost 2 years is brought forward? I am pretty sure I know what George Mitchell would have told Bob Dole. I am pretty sure I know what the majority leader would have said under those circumstances. It probably would not be as mild as the comments T RENT LOTT is currently making about the present demands that are being made with respect to specific judges by name\u2014not the agree-ment that the minority leader and the majority leader made where the major-ity leader said: All right, we will move forward on judges; we will bring a de-termined number of judges forward\u2014 but to say, no, we are now changing, and we are demanding a specific name be brought forward or we will shut the whole place down, and then come to the floor and say somehow the work of the people is not getting done. I am willing to take the tough votes that are being referred to on the floor. I have taken the votes on guns. I have taken the votes on abortion. I have taken the votes on minimum wage. I have taken the votes on Patients' Bill of Rights. I have taken the votes on prescription drugs for seniors. I have a record now that I will have to stand and defend before my constituents. Those votes have been taken because the minority has had the right to bring up every one of those issues and de-mand a rollcall vote. I don't apologize for the fact that I backed the majority leader in his posi-tion that we don't need to take those votes again. While we are in the proc-ess of trying to fund the Government and discharge our constitutional re-sponsibility, we don't need to sidetrack that business to go over old ground. If there is an election that has come up so that there are new people here and the electoral balance has shifted, it ob-viously makes sense to take those votes against. But to have the same people in the same Chamber in the same Congress in the same session re-peat the votes again and again and again doesn't make any sense when the process of debating each one of those votes again and again and again delays the whole legislative process to the point that we get to what I sadly have come to the conclusion is the goal here, which is to create a do-nothing Congress so that some people can run against a do-nothing Congress. If it means the majority leader has to get as tough as George Mitchell, if it means the majority leader has to be as firm as his predecessors, who were Democrats who were firm in order to move the people's business, I support the majority leader. It does not dis-grace this body. It does not take this body away from its traditions. It is in the tradition of the body to move legis-lation forward and get the people's business done. I applaud Senator L OTTfor his cour- age and his leadership in moving us in that direction. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oregon is recognized. Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a leadership mo-tion? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oregon has the floor. Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I yield to the Senator to make a request. UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 5 p.m. the Senate proceed to adopt the motion to proceed to the Treasury/ Postal appropriations bill; that imme-diately after that the Senate vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to the intelligence authorization bill; that immediately after that vote, regardless of the outcome, the Senate proceed to a period for morning business until the Senate completes its business today, and that the preceding all occur with-out any intervening action or debate. I announce that the cloture vote re- garding the motion to proceed to the VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7627 July 26, 2000 intelligence authorization bill which will occur at 5 p.m. this evening will be the last vote today. We would then go into a period for morning business and conclude the session for the day with the exception of any conference reports or wrap-up items that may be cleared for action. I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today it stand in adjournment until the hour of 9:30 a.m. tomorrow; that the call of the calendar be waived and the morning hour be deemed to have expired; that there then be a period for eulogies for our former colleague Sen-ator Coverdell as previously ordered; that following the swearing in of our new colleague, Z ELLMILLER , at 11 a.m. and his eulogy of Senator Coverdell, the Senate adopt the motion to proceed to the intelligence authorization bill, if its pending, and then vote on the clo-ture vote on the motion to proceed to the energy/water appropriations bill, and that the preceding all occur with-out any intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is their objection? Mr. REID. Reserving the right to ob- ject, Mr. President, I want to say to my friend from Utah, for whom I have the highest regard, he is a great Sen-ator. I have personal feelings toward him that he understands. But I want to just say a couple of things before we settle this little bit here. I served under George Mitchell. Never did Senator Mitchell prevent the minority from offering amendments. That is our biggest complaint in this body\u2014that the majority will not allow the minority to offer amendments. We believe the Senate should be treated as it has for over 200 years. If that were the case, we wouldn't be in the situa-tion we are in now. I also say to my friend that the per- centage on the judges doesn't work be-cause we are dealing with a larger number. Of course, if you have a larger number of judges, which has occurred since President Reagan was President, you could have a smaller percentage. That means a lot more judges. As we know, you can prove anything with numbers. I also say that one of the problems we have with judges is my friend from Michigan has one judge who has waited 1,300 days. That is much shorter than the 2 years my friend talked about in regards to the Banking Committee. In fact, I think the majority is protesting too much. I withdraw my objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, a rollcall vote will occur at 5 p.m. today on the mo-tion to proceed to the intelligence au-thorization bill. Another rollcall vote will occur at approximately 11:30 a.m. on Thursday on the motion to proceed to the energy and water appropriations bill. I thank the Senator from Oregon. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oregon has the floor. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request? Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I would be happy to yield for a unanimous consent request. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Sen-ator from Oregon finishes his remarks, the Senator from Iowa be recognized to make some remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank you for the time. I am here today at the request of my leader. I am here today to talk to the people of Or-egon and to the American people. I am often asked in townhall meet- ings why it is that we don't seem to be getting much done. Every time people turn on C-SPAN they see Republicans and Democrats bickering. I have said to them: I know it is frustrating. I know you do not like it. I know it sometimes isn't pleasant. But, frankly, rather than criticize it, we ought to celebrate it because this is the way we go about the business of government of a free people\u2014of exchanging ideas, and using words as our weapons and not ac- tually bullets. This contest between Republicans and Democrats is not an unhealthy thing. But I must admit to the Amer-ican people and to the people of Oregon that what I see happening on the Sen-ate floor right now is nothing to be celebrated. I came to the Senate looking for so- lutions\u2014not looking for a fight. I don't mind a good debate. I don't mind dif-ferences of opinion. I don't mind taking tough votes. Frankly, I have learned that the tough votes are sometimes the most memorable because they are dif-ficult. They set you apart. They make you come to a choice. Like Senator B ENNETT said, I have taken all of these tough votes that my Democratic friends have wanted me to take, and they have taken some that we wanted them to take. However, I have to say that now is not a moment to be cele-brated because of what I have been hearing since I came back from this last weekend. I have heard from colleagues on both sides of the aisle that this session of Congress is essentially over, that right now politics is going to prevail over policy, and that there will be gridlock until the election so that the greatest political advantage can be made out of the Congress. I am disappointed in that. I didn't come here for that. I didn't fight as hard as I did to win a seat in this body to just play that kind of a game. I find on the Democratic side people of honor and good will. I hope they find that in Republicans. Frankly, I think we are allowing the worst of our na-tures to take over right now. I am dis-appointed. I am very disappointed. I understand that the White House is now telling our leaders that unless we accede to every one of the President's demands, that we will be blamed for shutting the Government down because he won't sign any tax cut, he won't sign any appropriations bill. We are just going to be made the victims of this. I say to my friends in the White House, this is an overreach. This goes too far. The American people will judge this for what it is. I think we owe the American people something better than that. I think we owe them the truth. I think we owe them our best ef-forts. I think the politics shouldn't be so blatantly transparent that it brings shame upon the Senate. I am here with a heavy heart because I want to get something done. I have sat in the chair many times and begun to see this filibuster mentality build up among the minority that rails against these tax cuts that we have passed, to eliminate estate taxes, to eliminate the marriage penalty. They don't have to like it, they voted against it. I will say why I voted for them. There is an overarching reason why I vote for tax cuts. I believe in times of surplus and prosperity there is a point when we can say we are taking too much and we believe it can do more good in the general economy and we will put some back. Tax cuts go to tax-payers. When it comes to specific taxes, for example, the estate tax, I will state why I voted to change the nature of that tax, to eliminate the in-cidence of debt as the tax, and to shift it over to the sale of an asset as the in-cidence of taxation. I don't believe it is any of the Government's business how my heirs receive my estate. I think that is about freedom. I think that is about people saying: I am going to work hard and I will accumulate what I can, and I want to determine how my sons and my daughters receive my es-tate. Then if my heirs are unwise, the marketplace will redistribute that in-come because of poor choices. I don't think it is the Government's business to say we are going to deter-mine how this money is redistributed. It is a difference of who you trust. Do you trust Government? Or do you trust freedom? Do you trust people? Or do you trust central planning? That is why I am on this side of the aisle\u2014 not because I think there are bad people over there; I know otherwise. There are good people there. But we have a dif-ference of belief in how the public is best served. I think they want more equality. I think we want more liberty. That is the context of the debate here. I want the American people to know I will defend my vote to my own grave to eliminate the estate tax. I believe the way we have shifted it to a capital gains as the incidence of taxation is far more consistent with notions of free-dom than reaching into somebody's grave and saying we are going to dis-tribute it a new way, a Government way. That is not the America that I be-lieve in. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7628 July 26, 2000 When it comes to the marriage pen- alty tax cut, they are complaining again that too few people will benefit. You say it affects people disproportion-ately. But many married people will benefit. Again, it is hard to give tax cuts to those who don't pay taxes. I am not ashamed of voting to cut taxes for married people. Some people say that is unfair. However, I think we ought to incentivize marriage. It is a corner-stone of our society. Take religion out of it. Sociologists and psychologists will say for a child to have the best chance in life they need a mom, they need a dad. Those are the kinds of things we ought to be incentivizing\u2014 not penalizing. Without any embarrassment, I am proud to have voted to end the mar-riage tax penalty and the death tax penalty. These are bad tax policies. We have voted to end them. If they don't like the distribution of them, fine. But we have cast these votes. They voted one way; we voted another. We have taken their tough votes. As Senator B ENNETT said, we have taken the gun votes. We have taken the votes on abortion. We have taken a whole range of votes. We have taken a vote against their prescription drug plan. Let me go to prescription drugs for a minute. I am a member of the Budget Committee. I have sensed in the people of Oregon a real desire for a prescrip-tion drug benefit. I want to deliver for that. Because of that, I went into the Budget Committee when we created this template in the U.S. budget, deter-mined to stand with my colleague, R ON WYDEN , to accede the President's re- quest for a prescription drug benefit. The President requested $39 billion. R ON, OLYMPIA SNOWE , and I decided to- gether we have a majority if the Demo-crats will vote with us. We felt strong-ly that we should deliver on this prom-ise and this need. We got the Budget Committee to ex- ceed the President's request of $39 bil-lion. We went to $40 billion. However, I was a little bit discouraged\u2014even felt somewhat betrayed\u2014when a few months later the President says, just kidding, we need $80 billion. Double? From where did the original $39 billion come? Why all of a sudden, $80 billion? Don't the American people want Con-gress to be responsible for this? I put everyone on notice, I am being told in the Budget Committee that $80 billion won't even begin to cover this. Now what we are looking at under the President's program, is a one size fits all plan. A Government bureaucrat will be in your medicine cabinet and mak-ing choices for your health. A plan, by the way, that doesn't even take effect when we pass it\u20143 years hence. How is that keeping faith with the American people? They cannot even begin to tell you what it costs. This is not the way we should make these fundamental decisions about the health of the American people and the health of our Government's budgets. I hope everybody understands that. I am being told that come October 6, when we are supposed to sine die, if we haven't passed the President's version we are going to be put in a position that we are made to look as if we are shutting the Government down. People of America, you do not want Congress making these fundamental ir-reversible decisions on such a basis. These are important issues. We should not be giving in to this kind of polit-ical pressure for expediency, for an election. We should do it carefully. We should do it right. When it comes to prescription drugs, I will spend what I have to make sure you have a choice, that it is voluntary, and that it is af-fordable. Under the President's plan, I bet there is better than half of the Amer-ican people who would be eligible for it, who would not pay less for prescrip-tion drugs, yet would be forced to pay more. Is that what we want? That is not voluntary. That is about Govern-ment central planning. That is about a bureaucrat in your medicine cabinet. That is a plan for which I will not vote. I believe in the marketplace. I be- lieve in freedom. I believe Government has a role. I believe we ought to have a safety net. But I don't believe we ought to be going to a system that says the Government knows best and a bureau-crat can tell you what pill you need to take. I have talked about taxes. I have talked about the budget. I have talked about prescription drugs. Let me end by talking a little bit about this other great frustration I hear from the people of Oregon and that is the cost of gas, the cost of en-ergy. There is plenty of blame to go around, I am sure. I am not defending big oil. I am not defending the Govern-ment, either. But what I am telling you is our country has an enormous trade deficit because we are spending over $100 billion per year on foreign oil. When President Carter was the Presi-dent, we had gas lines and we had shortages. I remember waiting over an hour every time I went to get gasoline. When that occurred, our country was 36-percent dependent on foreign oil. We are 56-percent dependent now. Do you know why? Because in the life of this administration we have had over 30 oil refineries close; we have had leases canceled; we have had no development; and we have had an increasing depend-ence\u2014not less\u2014on foreign oil. I tell the American people, that is why you are paying too much. That is why you are paying more than you need to, because we are being held hostage to a cartel of foreign nations\u2014many that wish us ill, many that would like to put us over an oil barrel and push us over. I am saying I don't like drilling for oil. Every one of us drives a car and for a lot of us, the oil that drives that car is refined in Texas. Everyone of us likes the freedom of an automobile. Frankly, I would rather say to the American people: Let your sons and daughters drill for oil so they do not have to die for oil. We are setting them up to die for oil if we do not figure out some better balance between produc-tion and conservation. Conservation is important. I vote for conservation initiatives. But it is not the whole answer. You have to produce something. A third of our trade deficit is due to foreign oil. If you want an independent country, if you want an independent foreign policy, you cannot be totally dependent, as we are becom-ing, on foreign oil. But there you have it. That has been the policy of this ad-ministration. Finally, our Vice President said he wants to outlaw or get rid of the inter-nal combustion engine. In my neck of the woods, we have the incredible ben-efit of hydroelectric power. We have low energy rates because of hydro-electric power. But, guess what, they are talking about tearing them down. They want to tear out the most clean, most renewable, most affordable en-ergy supply that we have. Guess what happens when you do that. You lose\u2014 the recreation is gone, but, more im-portantly, you lose the irrigation for farmers, you lose the transportation of goods from the interior all the way from Montana, Idaho, Washington, Or-egon to the Port of Portland and around the Pacific rim. You lose the ability to use this system of locks to move vast quantities of agricultural and other commodities. I don't think we want to do that. I think it is very unwise. If you want to get rid of the internal combustion en-gine \u2014let's examine this briefly. Right now, to move about a half a million bushels of grain, you need four barges that move through these locks. Four barges use very little energy. It just floats and makes its way to the Port of Portland. Get rid of the locks or dams, guess what, you have to truck them or rail them. How many railcars does it take to replace the four barges? It takes 140 jumbo railcars to move the same volume. The tracks, the infrastructure is not there to do all the railing. So then you go to trucks, internal combustion en-gines. Guess how many trucks it takes: Four barges versus 539 large ''semi'' trucks. Guess what creates pollution. Guess what creates damage to your roads. That will do it. I want to be fair about this. When we are becoming so dependent on foreign oil, so dependent upon foreign energy, so dependent as a superpower on oth-ers, I think it is very imprudent to begin tearing out our energy infra-structure. So I will close, and I say again with a heavy heart, I think right now poli-tics is prevailing over good policy. I think that is too bad. But let me tell you, the real losers will be the Amer-ican people if the Republican majority caves in to the kind of tactics that say if you don't take everything we want we are going to make you look like you shut the Government down. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7629 July 26, 2000 There are a lot of us who are ear- nestly striving to do our duty, as is in-cumbent upon the majority, to move the business of the people while at the same time being fair to the minority. But how many times do we have to cast the same votes? Please, help us here. I plead with the President. Let's get something done. Let's deal in good faith. We don't have to let politics pre-vail. Because if we do, the legacy of this President and this Congress will be the words ''it might have been.'' It ought to be better than that. But I, for one, believe in our Republic. I be-lieve in our separation of powers. I will be very disappointed in my leaders if we cave in to a King. We cannot do that. We are not going to cave in to a King. We need to stand up for our insti-tution. Moreover, we need to pay at-tention to the details of our policy. Be-cause if we work it out with civility, we will work it out right for the Amer-ican people. I yield the floor. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the pending business? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate is now in morning business. f EMBARGO ON CUBA Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this morning we voted on cloture on the motion to proceed to the Treasury- Postal appropriations bill. I rise to ad-dress an issue that will certainly arise in the debate. The issue is the U.S. em-bargo on Cuba as it relates to food and medicine. Earlier this month, I traveled to Ha- vana along with Senators R OBERTS and AKAKA . It was a brief trip, but it gave us an opportunity to meet with a wide range of people. We met with Cuban Cabinet Ministers and dissidents, with the head of the largest NGO in Cuba, and also with a good number of foreign ambassadors, and with President Fidel Castro himself. I might say that was a marathon 10-hour session, about half of it dining. I left those meetings more convinced than ever that it is time to end our cold war policy towards Cuba. We should have normal trade relations with Cuba. Let me explain why. First, this is a unilateral sanction. Nobody else in the world supports it. Not even our closest allies. Unilateral economic sanctions, don't make sense unless our national security is at stake. Forty years ago Cuba threat-ened our national security. The Soviet Union planted nuclear missiles in Cuba and aimed them at the United States. Twenty years ago, Cuba was still act-ing as a force to destabilize Central America. Those days are gone. The missiles are gone. The Soviet Union is gone. Cuban military and guerilla forces are gone from Central America. The security threat is gone. But the embargo re-mains. My reason for my opposing unilateral sanctions is entirely pragmatic. They don't work. They never worked in the past and they will not work in the fu-ture. Whenever we stop our farmers and business people from exporting, our Japanese, European, and Canadian competitors rush in to fill the gap. Uni-lateral sanctions are a hopelessly inef-fective tool. The second reason for ending the em- bargo is that the US embargo actually helps Castro. How does it help Castro? I saw it for myself in Havana. The Cuban economy is in shambles. The people's rights are repressed. Fidel Castro blames it all on the embargo. He uses the embargo as the scapegoat for Cuba's misery. With-out the embargo, he would have no one to blame. For the past ten years I have worked towards normalizing our trade with China. My operating guideline has been ''Engagement Without Illusions.'' Trade rules don't automatically and in-stantly yield trade results. We have to push hard every day to see that coun-tries follow the rules. That's certainly the case with China. I have the same attitude towards Cuba. Yes, we should lift the embargo. We should do it without preconditions and without demanding any quid pro quo from Cuba. We should engage them economically. But we should do so without illusions. Once we lift the em-bargo, Cuba will not become a major buyer of our farm goods or manufac-tured products overnight. We need to be realistic. With Cuba's failed economy and low income, ending the embargo won't cause a huge surge of U.S. products to Cuba. Instead, it will start sales of some goods, such as food, medicine, some manufactures, and some telecom and Internet serv-ices. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7630 July 26, 2000 In addition, ending the embargo will increase Cuban exposure to the United States. It will bring Cubans into con-tact with our tourists, business people, students, and scholars. It will bring Americans into contact with those who will be part of the post-Castro Cuba. It will spur more investment in Cuba's tourist infrastructure, helping, even if only a little, to further develop a pri-vate sector in the economy. In May of this year, I introduced bi- partisan legislation that would repeal all of the Cuba- specific statutes that create the embargo. That includes the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act and the 1996 Helms-Burton Act. I look forward to the day when that legislation will pass and we have a normal economic rela-tionship with Cuba. Until that day, I support measures such as this amendment which dis-mantle the embargo brick by brick. The sanctions on sales of food and med-icine to Cuba are especially offensive. Last year, legislation to end unilat- eral sanctions on food and medicine passed the Senate by a vote of 70 to 28. That legislation was hijacked by the House in conference. This year we passed similar legislation again as part of the Agriculture appropriations bill. I hope our conferees stand firm and en-sure its passage this year, with one correction. This year the sanctions provisions of the Agriculture appropriations bill contain a new requirement. The bill re-quires farmers who want to sell food to foreign governments of concern to get a specific license. That is needless red tape which will make it harder to ex-port. Last year the bill we passed had no such licensing requirement. We should strike that provision in the Ag-riculture appropriations conference this year. When we begin debate on the bill, one of my colleagues will offer an amend-ment to address unilateral sanctions on food and medicine from a different angle. The amendment will cut off funding to enforce and administer them. The House passed a similar measure by a substantial majority. We should do the same in the Senate. Mr. President, I hope that all of my colleagues will vote in favor of this amendment and will support the ulti-mate lifting of the entire Cuba trade embargo. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Arizona is recognized. Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request? Mr. M CCAIN. Yes. Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, the Balkans, with Gavrilo Princip's assas-sination of Austrian Archduke Francis Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Bosnia in 1914, started the devastation of World War I. World War II had deep ties to the re-gion as well. The Truman doctrine, the basis of American policy throughout the cold war, began with President Truman's decision to support anti- Communist forces in Greece and Tur-key, again, in the Balkans. To deal with the historic threat to peace, secu-rity and prosperity the Balkans poses, the United States and Europe made a commitment in the aftermath of the Kosovo crisis to integrate the region into the broader European community. This commitment is consistent with the pillar that has bound the United States and Europe since the end of World War II\u2014a belief in the peaceful influence of stable democracies based on the rule of law, respect for human rights and support for a market econ-omy in Europe. However, the Balkans continue to be unstable. Slobodan Milosevic con-stantly stirs trouble in Kosovo and Montenegro. The minority commu-nities of Kosovo are suffering under a systematic effort by extremist ethnic Albanians to force them out. Moderate Albanians in Kosovo are threatened for simply selling bread to a member of the Serb community. As long as this instability remains, the shared Euro-pean and American goal of a whole and free Europe will not become a reality. Inclusion of the Balkans in the Euro- pean community of democracies would promote our Nation's strategic inter-ests. By providing a series of friendly nations south from Hungary to Greece and east from Italy to the Black Sea, we would be in a much better position to deter regional crises and respond to them should they occur. The link to the Black Sea would also provide a link into central Asia in the event that the protection of our national security in-terests were ever threatened in this area. The U.S. and the EU account for more than 30 percent of world trade. The EU receives nearly 25 percent of our total exports and is our largest ex-port market for agricultural products. The nations of the Balkans, due to their proximity to the EU's common market, have tremendous potential for American investors and businesses to expand these trading ties. Addition-ally, many in the Balkans have excel-lent educational backgrounds and work experience that would be invaluable to an American investor. Many nations currently being considered for EU membership began their transition from command economies in a much worse position than the nations of southeastern Europe. If these nations can make enough progress to be consid-ered for EU membership in the short- term, surely Croatia, Macedonia, Ro-mania, and Bulgaria can as well. While we have done much as a coun- try to respond to human suffering around the world in recent years, these efforts are made after the fact. This is a mistake that reflects the Clinton ad-ministration's lack of foresight. In Kosovo, for example, our lack of prepa-ration for the refugees created by Milosevic's aggression was inexcusable. To prevent this type of tragedy in the Balkans again\u2014the refugees, the home-lessness, the starvation\u2014we must re-main involved in the region. I believe that the following steps should be taken to advance our goal of an integrated, whole, and free Europe: NATO and EU membership\u2014The na- tions of southeastern Europe must be VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7631 July 26, 2000 involved in these institutions to ensure their long-term peace, security, and prosperity. However, invitations for membership should only be offered once the nations have met the estab-lished membership criteria; Implementation of the Stability Pact\u2014The Pact, initiated by the Euro-peans to encourage democracy, secu-rity, and economic development in the region, must be fully implemented. There has been much talk and promises made about the Pact. Now is the time for action. The Europeans must begin to build the infrastructure projects they have promised in the region. Open European markets\u2014The Euro- peans have made a commitment to in-tegrate the region into the broader Eu-ropean community. Lowering tariffs on the import of goods from the region would do much to encourage needed foreign investment. Investment, in turn, would speed development which would lead to the integration for which the Europeans have called. To make these initiatives work, the Clinton administration must show more leadership than they have since the Kosovo crisis began. With the deba-cle of Bosnia in its background, cou-pled with the failed policies for the re-gion over the last 18 months, our record in the region has been dismal. Implementing the above plan will begin to better this record. THE SITUATION IN THE BALKANS Mr. President, over the Fourth of July recess, I traveled with a delega-tion of my House and Senate col-leagues to Southeast Europe where I attended the annual Parliamentary as-sembly Meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Bucharest, Romania. In addition, while I was in Southeast Europe, I joined several of my House colleagues on a trip to Kosovo and Cro-atia to get an update on the situation there. I met with UN officials, Serb and Albanian leaders, KFOR commanders, and our American troops, and particu-larly soldiers from Ohio who are sta-tioned in Kosovo. I have traveled to the Balkans region three times this year to assess the situ-ation in the region from a political, military and humanitarian point of view. Besides my most recent trip, I trav- eled to Croatia, Macedonia, Kosovo and Brussels, Belgium in February and in May, I attended the annual meeting of the NATO Parliament Conference in Budapest, Hungary, and visited Slo-venia as well. Based on the observa-tions that I made, I would like to bring the Senate up to date on the current situation in southeastern Europe, par-ticularly in Croatia and Kosovo. While I was in Croatia this past Feb- ruary, I had the privilege to be the first Member of the United States Congress to personally congratulate Mr. Stipe Mesic on his being elected President of Croatia. During my trip earlier this month, I had a chance to spend time with President Mesic, along with my colleagues from the House of Rep- resentatives, and, again, hear his vi-sion for the future of Croatia. We also had an opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Racan, who along with President Mesic, is committed to providing to the Croatian people, a government that abides by the rule of law; respects human rights\u2014particu-larly minority rights; adheres to the goals of a market economy; seeks the ultimate entrance into the European Union and NATO; and pledges to return minority refugees that were ethnically cleansed out of Croatia. This commit-ment was supported by members of the Croatian Parliament and acknowledged by members of the Serb minority, who are anxious to see the commitment carried out. I am optimistic about the future of Croatia with its new leadership. Fol-lowing the December, 1999 death of Cro-atia's ultra-nationalist President, Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's future was uncertain as far as the West was con-cerned. However, the changes that have oc- curred since the establishment of a new government less than six months ago are stunning. I believe that the new government of President Mesic and Prime Minister Racan will ultimately be successful in guiding Croatia to EU and NATO membership. However, the legancy of Tudjman and his ruling elite\u2014who we are just now learning were a bunch of thieves\u2014poses some se-rious challenges for the ''new'' Croatia. Tudjman drove Croatia deep into debt to a variety of international fi-nancial institutions while he and his henchmen ''cleaned-out'' the national treasury for their own personal gain. Because of Tudjman's mismanagement, President Mesic and Prime Minister Racan are facing a situation where their nation's economy is struggling, and they have little help available from outside creditors because of Tudjman's action. These economic problems have an impact on another major challenge the new government is facing\u2014the return of refugees. As my colleagues may re-member, the Balkan wars of the 1990s created hundreds of thousands of refu-gees. These refugees left their homes, abandoned nearly all of their posses-sions and took to the roads to avoid the bloodshed of ethnic hatred. In order for these people to go back and reclaim their homes and get on with their lives, there must be something to go back to\u2014jobs, especially. There are few areas of Croatia today where jobs are plentiful enough to absorb thousands of returning refugees, which underscores the importance of reinvigorating the Croatian economy. Despite these problems, I am very op- timistic about the future of Croatia if President Mesic and Prime Minister Racan continue to lead their nation to-wards European integration. I am pleased that the United States is sup-porting the new Croatian leadership with financial, diplomatic and military assistance. I am also pleased that NATO has invited Croatia to become a member of the ''Partnership for Peace'' program. Mr. President, as I think back to last year, to the time when this nation was engaged in an air war over Kosovo, the President, the Secretary of State, world leaders and the international media all brought to our attention the ethnic cleansing that was being per-petrated by Slododan Milosevic's Ser-bian military and paramilitary forces against the Albanian people in Kosovo. During the height of the air war, President Clinton, in the Times of Lon-don, was quoted as saying ''we are in Kosovo because Europe's worst dema-gogue has once again moved from angry words to unspeakable violence.'' Further, the President stated, ''the re-gion cannot be secure with a bellig-erent tyrant in its midst.'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee claimed ''there is a butcher in NATO's backyard, and we have committed ourselves to stopping him. History will judge us harshly if we fail.'' Words such as these were meant to back-up our actions in Kosovo and ex-plain to the American people the moral imperative of engaging in a U.S.-led NATO air war over Kosovo. In this effort to protect the innocent civilian Kosovo Albanian community from the devastation of Slobodan Milosevic and his Serb forces, few real-ized at the time that the United States had stumbled across a civil war in progress. A minority of Kosovo Alba-nians, under the leadership and flag of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the KLA, were pursuing their dream of an eth-nically pure Kosovo, dominated by Al-banians and independent from Serbia. These extremists were willing to resort to violence to achieve this dream. On the other hand, Serbia and Slobodan Milosevic did not want to let this province break away, because Kosovo is very important to their his-tory, culture, and religion. Let me be clear on this. None of these circumstances in any way ex-cuses the devastation the Serb forces brought to the ethnic Albanian com-munity of Kosovo. The systematic plan, hatched by Milosevic, his wife and their inner circle of thugs, to in-still fear through rape, torture, and murder was designed to drive the eth-nic Albanian community out of Kosovo. Their plan was evil in its in-ception and execution. The United States and our NATO al- lies vowed to put an end to this trag-edy. Through our combined military strength, we were able to force Milosevic to withdraw his troops from Kosovo, making it safe for Kosovar Al-banians to return to their homes. And now that the air war in the Bal- kans has been over for a little more than a year, most Americans assume that the situation in Yugoslavia is now VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7632 July 26, 2000 under control and that Serbs and Alba- nians in Kosovo have put aside their differences, declared peace and are working towards establishing a cooper-ative society. How I wish that was true. In fact, the reason I have come to the floor today is to make my colleagues and this nation aware what many in the European community already know, and that is, ethnic cleansing is being carried out in Kosovo today. In the wake of the air war, a back- lash of violence is now being per-petrated against minority groups in Kosovo, including Serbs, Romas, and moderate Albanians who are now try-ing to rebuild Kosovo. They have been attacked and killed by more radical, revenge-driven elements in the Alba-nian community, their homes and busi-nesses have been burned and Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries\u2014 some hundreds of years old\u2014have been desecrated and destroyed. I ask unanimous consent to print in the R ECORD a document which summa- rizes the incidents of arson and murder that have occurred in recent months in Kosovo. These numbers were prepared by the OSCE, which is known for its independence. There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: A report released on June 9, 2000 provides recent numbers associated with violent crime that continues to threaten peace and reconciliation efforts in Kosovo. The report, UNHCR/OSCE Update on the Situation of Ethnic Minorities in Kosovo, provides details on the three most prevalent crimes affecting minorities in Kosovo since January 2000. They are as follows: ARSON , AGAINST Serbs, 105 cases Roma, 20 Muslim Slavs, 5 Albanians, 73 Persons of unknown ethnicity, 40 AGGRAVATED ASSAULT , AGAINST Serbs, 49 cases Roma, 2 Muslim Slavs, 2 Albanians, 90 Persons of unknown ethnicity, 9 MURDER , AGAINST Serbs, 26 cases Roma, 7 Muslim Slavs, 2 Albanians, 52 persons of unknown ethnicity, 8 According to the report, lack of security and freedom of movement remain the funda-mental problems affecting minority commu-nities in Kosovo. Though the Serbian popu-lation has been the minority group most af-fected by criminal activity, the ethnic Alba-nian community continues to be subject to serious violent attacks on a regular basis. Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in addition, Bishop Kyr Artemije, a leader of the Kosovar Serbs, presented similar statistics documenting the violence and bloodshed that has been carried out in Kosovo since the end of the war in testimony he gave before the Hel-sinki Commission this past February. His statistics were updated and verified at a recent meeting that I and several of my House colleagues had with the Bishop over the Fourth of July recess in Kosovo. I ask unanimous consent that Bishop Artemije's February testimony be printed in the R ECORD following my re- marks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibit 1.) Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in addition, a July 3 article written by Steven Erlanger for the New York Times, discusses the observations Den-nis McNamara, the U.N. special envoy for humanitarian affairs in Kosovo, had regarding the status of the situation in Kosovo today, particularly how minori-ties have been treated since the end of the air war and how minorities are being pushed out of Kosovo in a contin-uous and organized manner. McNamara is quoted as saying that: (this) violence against the minorities has been too prolonged and too widespread not to be systematic. McNamara goes on to say; We can't easily say who's behind it, but we can say we have not seen any organized ef-fort to stop it or any effort to back up the rhetoric of tolerance from Albanian leaders with any meaningful action. The genocide that was inflicted upon thousands of Albanians is absolutely inexcusable and totally reprehensible. Crimes that are perpetrated against in-nocent civilians must always be con-demned and those who carry out such acts must be prosecuted. That is why I do not understand why the President, the Secretary of State, and others in this administration have not been as vocal about the ethnic cleansing that is now being perpetrated as they were last year. In fact, the condemnation for the ethnic cleansing that is now occurring in Kosovo is virtually nonexistent on the part of this administration. I am deeply troubled by their silence. Because I have been following this matter so closely since the conclusion of the air campaign, I have had the op-portunity to have a number of off-the- record, informal conversations with people both inside and outside of our Government. While I am reluctant to share this with my colleagues, I feel that I must. There is a feeling by many who are following the ongoing ethnic cleansing in Kosovo that there are some in our Administration who be-lieve that the Serb community in Kosovo is simply getting what they are due. In other words, the murders, arson, harassment and intimidation that ex-tremist members of the Kosovo Alba-nian community are committing against the Kosovo Serb community should be expected and accepted given what the Serbs did to the Albanians. A July 17 article written by Steven Erlanger of the New York Times makes this point as well. It describes how U.N. director of Kosovo administra-tion, Bernard Kouchner, has been working to foster peace and stability among Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo. He points out that no one is paying much attention now that the tables have turned. Kouchner says: I'm angry that world opinion has changed so quickly. They were aware before of the beatings and the killings of Albanians, but now they say, ''There is ethnic cleansing of the Serbs.'' But it is not the same\u2014it's re-venge. And McNamara makes the same point. He says: There was from the start an environment of tolerance for intolerance and revenge. There was no real effort or interest in trying to deter or stop it. There was an implicit en-dorsement of it by everybody\u2014by the silence of the Albanian political leadership and by the lack of active discouragement of it by the West. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that these two New York Times articles be printed in the R ECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibit 2.) Mr. VOINOVICH. The United States must not now\u2014nor ever\u2014condone this revenge approach in Kosovo in either thought, word or deed. We must main-tain and promote our values as a na-tion\u2014a respect for human rights, free-dom of religion, freedom from harass-ment, intimidation or violence. If this administration, and the next, does not acknowledge and seriously ad-dress the plight of Kosovo Serbs and other minorities in Kosovo, then I think that within a year's time there will not be any minorities still in Kosovo. To prevent this, I believe we should be more aggressive towards pro-tecting minority rights in Kosovo im-mediately. If we do not, I am concerned that the extremist members of the Kosovo Alba-nian community will continue to push out all minority groups until they have achieved their dream of an Albanian- only Kosovo. In other words, if we do nothing, there will be many who will argue that the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo was tacitly endorsed by the lack of leadership in the international community. It is important to note that the prob- lem does not rest with our KFOR troops, for they have been restricted in what they can and cannot do. These men and women are doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances. I know what they're going through because, last February, I walked through the village of Gnjilane with some of our soldiers, and saw first-hand the restric-tions they were under. While I was in Kosovo over the 4th of July recess, I had the opportunity to visit our troops at Camp Bondsteel. Every soldier that I spoke with talked of their commitment to their mission and ensuring the safety of the citizens of Kosovo. I fully believe that it is be-cause of these troops that there is not further violence. I do have hope that we can bring an end to the bloodshed in Southeastern VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7633 July 26, 2000 Europe, and I believe that there are some within the Kosovo Albanian com-munity who can prevail upon the bet-ter instincts of their fellow man in a commitment towards peace. Earlier this year, at the headquarters of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, in Pristina, Kosovo, I had the opportunity to sit down and meet with several key leaders of the Kosovo Albanian community and rep-resentatives on the Interim Adminis-trative Council\u2014Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, Mr. Hashim Thaci, and Dr. Rexhep Qosja. All three leaders made a very clear promise to me that they were com-mitted to a multi-ethnic, democratic Kosovo, one that would respect the rights of all ethnic minorities. I was heartened to hear these comments. This commitment could serve as the basis for long-term peace and stability in Kosovo. I said that they could go down in his- tory as truly great men were they to make this commitment a reality. I ex-plained that the historic cycle of vio-lence in Kosovo must end and minority rights must be respected\u2014including the sanctity of churches and mon-asteries. I also point out to them that ''re- venge begets revenge'' and unless Alba-nians and Serbs learned to live in peace with one another, violence would con-tinue to plague their children, their grandchildren and generations yet un-born. It is my hope that they will realize that they and their actions will be keys to the future of Kosovo. We all want peace to prevail in the Balkans, but we have a long way to go for that to happen. I believe we should listen to the words of His Holiness, Pa-triarch Pavle, the head of the Serbian Orthodox church, who states, ''in Kosovo and Metohija there will be no victory of humanity and justice while revenge and disorder prevail. No one has a moral right to celebrate victory complacently for as long as one kind of evil replaces another, and the freedom of one people rests upon the slavery of another.'' The Patriarch's call for leadership in protecting all citizens in Kosovo is one that this nation should heed if peace and stability in Kosovo is our goal. At the OSCE meeting in Bucharest, I introduced a resolution on South-eastern Europe that had the support of several of my legislative colleagues from the U.S. The main point of the resolution that I offered was to call to the attention of the OSCE's Parliamen-tary Assembly the current situation in Kosovo and Serbia, and made clear the importance of removing Slobodan Milosevic from power. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the entire text of the resolu-tion, as passed by the OSCE Parliamen-tary Assembly, be printed in the R ECORD at the conclusion of my re- marks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibit 3.) Mr. VOINOVICH. My resolution put the OSCE, as a body, on record as con-demning the Milosevic regime and in-sisting on the restoration of human rights, the rule of law, free press and respect for ethnic minorities in Serbia. I was pleased that the resolution passed\u2014despite strong opposition by the delegation from the Russian Fed-eration\u2014and I am hopeful that it will help re-focus the attention of the inter-national community on the situation in the Balkans. In conclusion, Mr. President, I be- lieve that we are approaching a cross-roads in Kosovo with two very different directions that we can choose. The first direction\u2014the wrong direc- tion\u2014involves more of the same of what we have seen in recent months. More bloodshed, more grenade attacks on elderly minorities as they sit on their porch. More land-mines on roads traveled by parents taking their chil-dren to school. More intimidation, threats and harassment of minorities walking the streets in mixed villages and towns. All this would lead to the continued fleeing of minorities from Kosovo and the establishment of an Al-banian-only Kosovo. Again, ethnic cleansing carried-out under the nose of NATO and the U.N. The second direction\u2014the right di- rection\u2014involves the international community, led by the United States, protecting the human rights of the mi-nority communities of Kosovo. With this protection, the minority groups would feel safe in their homes and be comfortable enough to be involved in UNMIK municipal elections this fall, a key priority for UNMIK. Places of his-torical significance, especially Serbian Orthodox monasteries, would be safe from destruction from extremists. Minorities would be safe to travel to the market in their own communities without needing KFOR protection, something that does not happen today. Kosovo Albanians who sell goods to mi-norities would not be threatened, harmed or killed, again, something that does not happen today. In short, bloodshed would stop under the watch of the international community. And there is encouraging news. Just this last weekend, at Airlie House in Virginia, leaders of Kosovo's Serb and Albania communities met under the auspices of the United States Institute for Peace. Among other provisions, the rep- resentatives agreed to launch a new initiative\u2014a Campaign Against Vio-lence\u2014whereby the representatives of both communities agreed to a Pact Against Violence to promote tolerance, condemn violence, prevent negative ex-ploitation of ethnic issues, and enable physical integration and political par-ticipation by all. In addition, the com-munities agreed on two key provisions to help reduce the power of extremist elements by calling on KFOR and UNMIK to guard and control more ef-fectively all entry into Kosovo, and re-questing that UNMIK move imme- diately to start-up a functioning court and prison system. Also, the Serb and Albanian rep- resentatives agreed on several items regarding the return of displaced per-sons and refugees to their homes, in-cluding the recognition that the return of such individuals is a fundamental right and essential to the future of Kosovo. In order to facilitate such re-turns, the parties insist that UNMIK and KFOR pursue fresh efforts to pro-vide greater security for individuals to return to their homes, and to expand aid for reconstruction and economic re-vitalization in those communities. They further agreed that a new model of security and law enforcement is needed, and that the international community must overcome its dif-ferences to that UNMIK and KFOR can take much stronger measures to carry out their security and law enforcement responsibilities. Last but not least, the representa- tives recognize that the international community will not support a Kosovo cleansed of some of its ethnic commu-nities. Rather, all these communities must work together to build a multi- ethnic Kosovo respecting the rights of all its citizens. I say ''Amen and Hallelujah'' to the fact that these two communities can come together and develop such an out-line for peace. There should be a loud voice coming out from this administraiton\u2014the same loud voice that we heard last year\u2014to the United Nations, to the UNMIK, and to our NATO Allies that we cannot allow ethnic cleansing of any kind to continue. And I just want the administration to know that I am holding them re-sponsible to make the same commit-ment to Kosovo now that they made during the war, specifically, to go in and make sure that NATO, UNMIK, and KFOR give the same priority to protecting minority rights today. It is up to the United States to pro- vide the leadership to make sure that the items that the representatives at Airlie House identified as important are actually carried out by the UNMIK and by KFOR in cooperation with the Serb and Albanian communities in Kosovo. Individually, none of these entities can guarantee peace and stability in Kosovo. It is only by working together that peace will occur, and it is the pri-mary reason that the U.S. needs to re- commit itself to Kosovo. We, the United States, with our strength and commitment to the pro-tection of human rights, can largely determine which direction is taken in Kosovo. It is in our hands to live up to that potential. It is in our national security inter- est. It is in our economic interest in Europe. It is in the interest of peace in the world that we make that commit-ment. I yield the floor. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7634 July 26, 2000 EXHIBIT 1 STATEMENT OF BISHOP ARTEMIJE , HELSINKI COMMISSION , HEARING , FEBRUARY 28, 2000, WASHINGTON , DC Mr. Chairman, respected members of Con- gress, ladies and gentlemen. It is my distinct pleasure and privilege to be here with you today and speak about the latest develop-ments in Kosovo. The last time I spoke here was in February 1998, just before the war in Kosovo began and on that occasion I strong-ly condemned both Milosevic's regime and Albanian extremists for leading the country into the war. Unfortunately the war came and so many innocent Albanians and Serbs suffered in it. Many times we have strongly condemned the crimes of Milosevic's regime in Kosovo while our Church in Kosovo sup-ported suffering Albanian civilians and saved some of them from the hands of Milosevic's paramilitaries. After the end of Kosovo war and return of Albanian refugees the repression of Milosevic's undemocratic regime was sup-planted by the repression of extremist Kosovo Albanians against Serbs and other non-Albanian communities in full view of international troops. Freedom in Kosovo has not come for all equally. Therefore Kosovo remains a troubled region even after 8 months of international peace. Kosovo Serbs and other non-Albanian groups in Kosovo live in ghettos, without se-curity; deprived of basic human rights\u2014the rights of life, free movement and work. Their private property is being usurped; their homes burned and looted even 8 months after the deployment of KFOR. Although Kosovo remained more or less multiethnic during the ten years of Milosevic's repressive rule, today there is hardly any multiethnicity at all\u2014in fact the reverse is true. Ethnic seg-regation is greater now than almost at any other time in Kosovo's turbulent history. Not only are Serbs being driven out from the Province but also the Romas, Slav Moslems, Croats, Serb speaking Jews and Turks. More than 80 Orthodox churches have been either completely destroyed or severely damaged since the end of the war. The ancient church-es, many of which had survived 500 years of Ottoman Moslem rule, could not survive 8 months of the internationally guaranteed peace. Regretfully, all this happens in the presence of KFOR and UN. Kosovo more and more becomes ethnically clean while orga-nized crime and discrimination against the non-Albanians is epidemic. Two thirds of the pre-war Serb population (200,000 people) fled the province under Alba-nian pressure. In addition more than 50,000 Romas, Slav Moslems, Croat Catholics and others have also been cleansed from Kosovo. More than 400 Serbs have been killed and nearly 600 abducted by Albanian extremists during this same period of peace. Tragically, this suffering of Serbs and other non-Alba-nians proportionally (with respect to popu-lation) represents more extensive suffering in peacetime than the Albanian suffering during the war. This is a tragic record for any post war peace mission, especially for this mission in which the Western Govern-ments and NATO have invested so much of their credibility and authority. Despite the sympathy for all of the suf- fering of Kosovo Albanians during the war, retaliation against innocent civilians cannot be justified in any way. It is becoming more and more a well-orchestrated nationalist ide-ology directed towards achieving the com-plete ethnic cleansing of the Province. The extremists believe that without Serbs and their holy sites in Kosovo independence would then become a fait accompli. The present repression against non-Albanians is carried out with the full knowledge of the Albanian leaders. Sometimes these leaders formally condemn repressive actions but in reality have not done anything to stop the ongoing ethnic violence and discrimination. Even more, some of them are instigating rage against Serbs developing the idea of col-lective Serb guilt and branding all remaining Serb civilians as criminals. There is much evidence that the KLA leaders bear direct re-sponsibility for the most of the post-war crimes and acts of violence committed in Kosovo. As soon as KFOR entered the Prov-ince KLA gunmen took over the power in majority of cities and towns and imme-diately organized illegal detention centers for Serbs, Romas and Albanian ''collabo-rators.'' They began killing people listed as alleged criminals and seized a large amount of property previously owned by Serbs and other non-Albanians. KLA groups and their leaders are directly linked with Albanian mafia clans and have developed a very so-phisticated network of organized crime, drug smuggling, prostitution, white slavery, and weapons trading. According to the inter-national press Kosovo has become Colombia of Europe and a main heroin gateway for Western Europe. The strategy behind the KLA purge of Serbs was very simple\u2014quar-ter by quarter of a city would be cleansed of Serbs and their property would be either burned or sold for a high price to Albanian refugees (including Albanians from Albania and Macedonia who flowed into the province through unprotected borders along with the hundreds of thousands of Kosovo refugees). The KLA, although officially disbanded is still active and their secret police are con-tinuing their intimidation and executions. Now more and more of their victims are dis-obedient Kosovo Albanians who refuse to pay their ''taxes'' and ''protection money'' to ex-tremists. The Albanization of Kosovo is pro-ceeding in a way many ordinary Albanians did not want. The gangsters have stepped into the vacuum left by the slowness of the West to adequately instill full control over the Province. Kosovo is becoming more like Albania: corrupt, anarchic, and ruled by the gun and the gang. Serbs and many non-Albanians still do not have access to hospitals, the University and public services, simply because they cannot even freely walk in the street. They are un-employed and confined to life in poverty of their rural enclaves out of which they can move only under the KFOR military escort. The Serbian language is completely banished from the public life. All Serb inscriptions, road signs and advertisements have been sys-tematically removed and the usage of Ser-bian language in Albanian dominated areas is reason enough for anyone to be shot right on the spot. Thousands of Serb books in pub-lic libraries have been systematically burned while all unguarded Serb cultural monu-ments and statues have been torn down and destroyed. The Serbs who remain in major cities are in the worst situation of all. Out of 40,000 pre-war Serb population in Pristina today there remain only 300 elderly people who live in a kind of house arrest. They cannot go into the street without military protection and only thanks to KFOR soldiers and hu-manitarian organizations do they receive food and medicines, which they are not al-lowed to buy in Albanian shops. Almost all Serb shops are now in Albanian hands. In other areas Albanians are greatly pressuring Serbs to sell their property under threats and extortion. Those who refuse usually have their houses torched or are killed as an ex-ample to other Serbs. Grenade attacks on Serb houses; on few remaining Serb shops and restaurants force more and more Serbs to leave Kosovo. If this repression and perse-cution is continued unabated it is likely that soon most of the remaining Serbs will also be forced to flee Kosovo. On one hand, KFOR's presence in Kosovo has given Albanian extremists free hands to do what that want because one of KFOR pri-orities has been so far to avoid direct con-frontation with the extremists in order to es-cape possible casualties. On the other hand we cannot but say that if KFOR had not been in Kosovo during this rampage of hatred, not a single Serb or Serb church would have sur-vived. We sincerely appreciate the efforts of many men and women from all over the world who are trying to bring peace to Kosovo even with in a rather narrow polit-ical framework in which KFOR must act. An especially volatile situation is in Kosovska Mitrovica the only major city where a substantial number of Serbs remain. During the most intensive wave of ethnic cleansing in June and July many Serb inter-nally displaced persons from the south found refuge in the north of the province in the Mitrovica area. In order to survive they or- ganized a kind of self-protection network and prevented the KLA and mafia to enter the northern fifth of the city together with civilian Albanian returnees. KFOR, aware that the free access of Albanian extremist groups of Mitrovica would cause a Serb exo-dus, blocked the bridge connecting the southern and northern part of the city. Alba-nian extremists have since then made many attempts to make their way into the north-ern part of Mitrovica saying that they want-ed undivided and free city. Serbs on the other hand state that they are ready for a united city only if Serbs would be allowed to go back to their homes in the south and else-where in Kosovo. Serbs also hold that only Kosovo residents be allowed to return to their homes. A few weeks ago, after two ter-rorist attacks against a UNHCR bus and a Serb cafe \u00b4, in which a number of Serbs were killed and injured, radicalized Serbs began retaliatory actions against Albanians in the northern part of the city causing the death of several Albanian innocent citizens and served to broaden the crisis. The Mitrovica crisis is not playing out in a void by itself and must be approached only in the context of the overall Kosovo situa-tion. The fact remains that after the war ex-tremists Albanians have not been fully dis-armed and have continued their repression and ethnic cleansing of Serbs and other non- Albanians wherever and whenever they have had opportunity to do so. Unfortunately, such a situation as we have now in Kosovo has opened a door for the Belgrade regime, which is ow trying to profit from this situa-tion and consolidate the division of Mitrovica for their own reasons. Each Serb victim in Kosovo strengthens Milosevic's po-sition in Serbia. Albanian extremists on the other hand want to disrupt the only remain-ing Serb stronghold in the city in order to drive the Serbs completely out of Kosovo. Regretfully, the international community seems not to be fully aware of the com-plexity of the Mitrovica problem and has de-spite all Albanian crimes and terror in the last 8 months one-sidedly condemned Serbs for this violence. This skewed view of the problem will only serve to encourage Albanian extremism, con-firm Milosevic's theory of anti-Serb conspir-acies that he uses to solidify his hold on power and will eventually lead to final exo-dus of the Serb community in Kosovo. Milosevic obviously remains at the core of the problem but he is not the greatest cause of the current round of violence and purges\u2014 the international community must find ways for controlling Albanian extremists. We maintain our belief that the present tragedy in Kosovo is not what Americans wanted when they supported the policy of VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7635 July 26, 2000 the Administration to intervene on behalf of suffering Albanians. In fact international community now faces a serious failure in Kosovo because it has not managed to marginalize extremist Albanians while at the same time Milosevic has been politically strengthened by the bombing and sanctions (which ordinary Serbs understand as being directed against innocent civilians). There-fore we expect now from the international community and primarily from United States to show more determination in pro-tecting and supporting Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups who suffer under ethnic Albanian extremists. A way must be found to fully implement UNSC Resolution 1244 in its whole. We have a few practical proposals for im- proving the situation in Kosovo: 1. KFOR should be more robust in sup- pressing violence, organized crime and should more effectively protect the non-Al-banian population from extremists. This is required by the UNSC Resolution. 2. More International Police should be de- ployed in Kosovo. Borders with Macedonia and Albania must be better secured, and UNMIK should establish local administra-tion with Serbs in areas where they live as compact population. Judicial system must become operational as soon as possible. International judges must be recruited at this stage when Kosovo judges cannot act impartially due to political pressures. 3. International community must build a strategy to return displaced Kosovo Serbs and others to their homes soon while pro-viding better security for them and their re-ligious and cultural shrines. Post war ethnic cleansing must not be legalized nor accept-ed\u2014private and Church property has to be restored to rightful owners. Law and order must be established and fully enforced. With-out at least an initial repatriation of Serbs, Romas, Slav Moslems and others Kosovo elections would be unfair and unacceptable. 4. The International Community, espe- cially, US, should make clear to Kosovo Al-banian leaders that they cannot continue with the ethnic cleansing under the protec-torate of Western democratic governments. Investment policy and political support must be conditioned to full compliance by ethnic Albanian leaders with the UNSC Resolution 1244. KLA militants must be fully disarmed. The ICTY should launch impartial investiga-tions on all criminal acts committed both by Serbs and Albanians. 5. The international community should also support moderate Serbs in regaining their leading role in the Kosovo Serb com-munity and thus provide for the conditions for their participation in the Interim Admin-istrative Kosovo Structure. Since the co-operation of moderate Serb leaders with KFOR and UNMIK has not brought visible improvement to the lives of Serbs in their remaining enclaves, Milosevic's supporters are gaining more confidence among besieged and frightened Serbs, which can seriously ob-struct the peace process. Moderate Serbs gathered around Serb National Council need their own independent media; better commu-nication between enclaves and other forms of support to make their voice better heard and understood within their own community. International humanitarian aid distribution in Serb inhabited areas currently being dis-tributed more or less through Milosevic's people who have used this to impose them-selves as local leaders, has to be channeled through the Church and the Serb National Council humanitarian network. 6. The last but not least, the issue of status must remain frozen until there is genuine and stable progress in eliminating violence and introducing democratization not only in Kosovo but also in Serbia proper and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is our firm belief that the question of the future status of Kosovo must not be discussed be-tween Kosovo's Albanians and Serbs only, but also with the participation of the inter-national community and the future demo-cratic governments of Serbia and FRY and in accordance with international law and the Helsinki Final Act. We believe in God and in His providence but we hope that US Congress and Adminis-tration will support our suffering people, which want to remain where we have been living for centuries, in the land of our ances-tors. E XHIBIT 2 U.N. O FFICIAL WARNS OF LOSING THE PEACE IN KOSOVO (By Steven Erlanger) As the humane ''pillar'' of the United Na- tions administration in Kosovo prepares to shut down, its job of emergency relief deemed to be over, its director has some ad-vice for the next great international mission to rebuild a country: be prepared to invest as much money and effort in winning the peace as in fighting the war. Dennis McNamara, the United Nations spe- cial envoy for humanitarian affairs, regional director for the United Nations high commis-sioner for refugees and a deputy to the United Nations chief administrator in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, leaves Kosovo proud of the way the international commu-nity saved lives here after the war, which ended a year ago. Mr. McNamara helped to coordinate nearly 300 private and government organizations to provide emergency shelter, food, health care and transport to nearly one million Kosovo Albanian refugees who have returned. Despite delays in aid and reconstruction, including severe shortages of electricity and running water, no one is known to have died here last winter from exposure or hunger. Up to half of the population\u2014900,000 people a day\u2014was fed by international agencies last winter and spring, and a program to clear land mines and unexploded NATO ordnance is proceeding apace. But Mr. McNamara, 54, a New Zealander who began his United Nations refugee work in 1975 with the exodus of the Vietnamese boat people, is caustic about the continuing and worsening violence against non-Albanian minorities in Kosovo, especially the remain-ing Serbs and Roma, or Gypsies. He says the United Nations, Western governments and NATO have been too slow and timid in their response. ''There was from the start an environment of tolerance for intolerance and revenge,'' he said. ''There was no real effort or interest in trying to deter or stop it. There was an im-plicit endorsement of it by everybody\u2014by the silence of the Albanian political leader-ship and by the lack of active discourage-ment of it by the West.'' Action was needed, he said, in the first days and weeks, when the old images of Al-banians forced out of Kosovo on their trac-tors were replaced by Serbs fleeing Kosovo on their tractors, and as it became clear that the effort to push minorities out of Kosovo was continuing and organized. ''This is not why we fought the war,'' Mr. McNamara said. He noted that in recent weeks there had been a new spate of com-ments by Western leaders, including Presi-dent Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the NATO secretary general, Lord Robertson, warning the Albanians that the West would not continue its support for Kosovo if violence against minorities contin-ued at such a pace and in organized fashion. But previous warnings and admonitions have not been followed by any action, Mr. McNamara noted. In general, he and others suggested, there is simply a tendency to put an optimistic gloss on events here and to avoid confrontation with former guerrillas who fought for independence for Kosovo or with increasingly active gangs of organized criminals. ''This violence against the minorities has been too prolonged and too widespread not to be systematic,'' Mr. McNamara said, giving voice to views that he has made known throughout his time here. ''We can't easily say who's behind it, but we can say we have not seen any organized effort to stop it or any effort to back up the rhetoric of toler-ance from Albanian leaders with any mean-ingful action.'' In the year since NATO took over complete control of Kosovo and Serbian troops and po-licemen left the province, there have been some 500 killings, a disproportionate number of them committed against Serbs and other minorities. But there has not been a single conviction. The judicial system is still not functioning, and local and international officials here say that witnesses are intimidated or killed and are afraid to come forward, pressure has been put on some judges to quit and many of those arrested for murder and other serious crimes have been released, either because of lack of prison space or the inability to bring them to trial. Only recently has the United Nations de- cided to bring in international prosecutors and judges, but finding them and persuading them to come to Kosovo has not been easy. And foreign governments have been very slow to send the police officers they prom-ised to patrol the streets. Now, some 3,100 of a promised 4,800 have ar- rived, although Mr. Kouchner wanted 6,000. The big problem, Mr. McNamara said, is the generally poor quality of the police officers who have come, some of whom have had to be sent home because they could neither drive nor handle their weapons. And coordi-nation between the police and the military has been haphazard and slow. ''The West should have started to build up institutions of a civil society from Day 1,'' Mr. McNamara said. ''And there should have been a wide use of emergency powers by the military at the beginning to prevent the growth of this culture of impunity, where no one is punished. I'm a human rights lawyer, but I'd break the rules to establish order and security at the start, to get the word out that it's not for free.'' Similarly, the NATO troops that form the backbone of the United Nations peace-keeping force here were too cautious about breaking down the artificial barrier created by the Serbs in the northern Kosovo town of Mitrovica, Mr. McNamara said. Northern Mitrovica is now inhabited al- most entirely by Serbs, marking an informal partition of Kosovo that extends up to the province's border with the rest of Serbia, creating a zone where the Yugoslav govern-ment of President Slobodan Milosevic exer-cises significant control, infuriating Kosovo's Albanian majority. ''Having allowed Mitrovica to slip away in the first days and weeks, it's very hard to re-gain it now,'' Mr. McNamara said. ''Why wasn't there strong action to take control of Mitrovica from the outset? We're living with the consequences of that now.'' In the last two months, as attacks on Serbs have increased again in Kosovo, Serbs in northern Mitrovica have attacked United Nations aid workers, equipment of offices, causing Mr. McNamara to pull aid workers temporarily out of the town. After promises from the effective leader of the northern Mitrovica Serbs, Oliver Ivanovic, those workers returned. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7636 July 26, 2000 Another significant problem has been the lack of a ''unified command'' of the peace-keeping troops, Mr. McNamara said. Their overall commander, currently a Spanish gen-eral, cannot order around the troops of con-stituent countries. Washington controls the American troops, Paris the French ones and so on. And there are no common rules of engage- ment or behavior in the various countries' military sectors of Kosovo. ''The disparities in the sectors are real,'' Mr. McNamara said. And after American troops were stoned as they tried to aid French troops in Mitrovica last spring, the Pentagon ordered the American commander here not to send his troops out of the Amer-ican sector of Kosovo. While the Pentagon denies a blanket ban, officers in the Kosovo peacekeeping oper-ation support Mr. McNamara's assertion. They say no commanders here want to risk their troops in the kind of significant con-frontation required to break down the ethnic barriers of Mitrovica. The United Nations has had difficulties of organization and financing, Mr. McNamara readily acknowledges. ''but governments must bear the main responsibility,'' he said, ''Governments decide what the United Na-tions will be, and what resources govern-ments commit to the conflict they won't commit to the peace.'' Governments want to dump problems like Kosovo onto the United Nations to avoid re-sponsibility, he said. The United Nations should develop ''a serious checklist'' of re-quirements and commitments from govern-ments before it agrees to another Kosovo, Mr. McNamara said, ''and the U.N. should be able to say no.'' U.N. C HIEF IN KOSOVO TAKES STOCK OF TOUGH YEAR (By Steven Erlanger) Bernard Kouchner, the emotional chief of the United Nations administration in Kosovo, has made it through a tumultuous year. Last November, when the province's water and power were almost nonexistent, the West was not providing the money or personnel it promised and the cold was as profound and bitter as the ethnic hatred, Mr. Kouchner was in a depression so deep that his staff thought he might quit. He spoke darkly then of ''how hard it is to change the human soul,'' of the quick fatigue of Western leaders who prosecuted the war with Serbia over Kosovo and had no interest in hearing about its problematic aftermath, of the impenetrability of the local Serbs and Albanians, with their tribal, feudal passions. ''I've never heard an Albanian joke,'' he said sadly, looking around his dreary office, the former seat of the Serbian power here. ''Do they have a sense of humor?'' Now, in a blistering summer, Mr. Kouchner's mood has improved. A French physician who founded Doctors Without Bor-ders because he became fed up with inter-national bureaucracy, he is not an inter-national bureaucrat, sometimes uneasy in his skin. He still goes up and down with the vagaries of this broken province, with its ramshackle infrastructure, chaotic traffic and lack of real law or justice. And without question, he admits, some of those problems can be laid at his door. ''Of course I'm not the perfect model of a bureaucrat and an administrator,'' he said. ''But we have succeeded in the main thing'': stopping the oppression of Kosovo's Alba-nians by Belgrade, bringing them home and letting them restart their lives in freedom. And yet, he said, ''I have not succeeded in human terms'' with a traumatized popu-lation. ''They still hate one another deeply.'' He paused, and added: ''Here I discovered hatred deeper than anywhere in the world, more than in Cambodia or Vietnam or Bos-nia. Usually someone, a doctor or a jour-nalist, will say, 'I know someone on the other side.' But here, no. They had no real relationship with the other community.'' The hatred, he suggested, can be daunting and has plunged him and his colleagues into despair. ''Sometimes we got tired and ex-hausted, and we didn't want a reward, not like that, but just a little smile,'' he said wanly. ''I'm looking for moments of real happiness, but you know just now I'm a bit dry.'' But he is proud that everyone has per-sisted nonetheless. As for himself, he said, ''my only real suc- cess is to set up this administration,'' per-suading Albanian and some Serbian leaders to cooperate with foreign officials and begin to share some executive responsibility. When the head of the local Serbian Ortho- dox Church, Bishop Kyr Artemije, and the leaders of perhaps half of Kosovo's Serbs de-cided to join as observers, ''we were very happy then,'' he said. ''We were jumping in the air. We believed then that we were reach-ing the point of no return. But even those Serbs left the executive council set up by Mr. Kouchner, only to re-turn after securing written promises for bet-ter security that have prompted the Alba-nian Hashim Thaci, former leader of the sep-aratist Kosovo Liberation Army, to suspend his own participation. Bishop Artemije's chief aide, the Rev. Sava Janjic, said carefully: ''Kouchner has not been serious in his promises, and the efforts to demilitarize the Kosovo Liberation Army are very inefficient. But he is sincere, and this written document is important on its own.'' A senior Albanian politician said Mr. Kouchner was ''the wrong man for the job,'' which he said required more forcefulness and less empathy. ''After a year, you still can't talk of the rule of law.'' Still, the politician said, ''Kouchner's instincts are good\u2014he knew he had to co-opt the Albanians, that the U.N. couldn't run the place alone.'' Less successful, most officials and analysts interviewed here said, is Mr. Kouchner's sometimes flighty, sometimes secretive management of the clumsy international bu-reaucracy itself in the year since Secretary General Kofi Annan sent him here to run the United Nations administration in Kosovo. Alongside the bureaucrats are the 45,000 troops of the NATO-led Kosovo Force, known as KFOR, responsible to their home govern-ments, not to Mr. Kouchner or even to the force's commander. And while Mr. Kouchner was able to persuade the former commander, Gen. Klause Reinhardt of Germany, to do more to help the civilian side, they were both less successful with Washington, Paris, Bonn, Rome and London. The affliction known here as ''Bosnian dis- ease''\u2014with well-armed troops unwilling to take risks that might cause them harm\u2014has settled into Kosovo, say Mr. Kouchner's aids and even some senior officers of the United Nations force. Consequently, some serious problems\u2014like the division of the northern town of Mitrovica into Serbian and Albanian halves that also marks the informal partition of Kosovo\u2014appear likely not to be solved but simply ''managed,'' no matter how much they embolden Belgrade or undermine the confidence of Kosovo Albanians in the good will be of their saviors. It was on the bridge dividing Mitrovica\u2014not in Paris\u2014that Mr. Kouchner chose to spend his New Year's Eve, making a hopeful toast, so far in vain, to reconciliation. Nor will the peacekeeping troops do much to stop organized crime or confront, in a se-rious fashion, organized, Albanian efforts to drive the remaining Serbs out of Kosovo and prevent the return of those who fled, the offi-cials say. The discovery last month of some 70 tons of arms, hidden away by the former Kosovo Liberation Army and not handed over as promised to the peacekeepers, took no one here by surprise. ''It was a success,'' Mr. Kouchner said, ''not a surprise.'' In fact, senior United Nations and NATO officials say, the existence of the arms cache was known and the timing of the discovery was a message to the former rebels, who had recently used some of the weapons, to stop their organized attacks on Serbs and mod-erate Albanian politicians. But few here expect the arrest of former rebel commanders who are widely suspected of involvement in corruption or political vio- lence. The reaction may be volatile, officials say: troops could be attacked and the shaky political cooperation with the Albanians un-dermined. Is the United Nations peacekeeping force too timid? Mr. Kouchner paused and shrugged. ''Of course,'' he finally said. ''But what can we do? Everything in the inter-national community works by compromise.'' Foreign policemen are also too timid and take too long with investigations that never seem to be finished, Mr. Kouchner says. But at least now, more than 3,100 of the 4,800 international police officers he has been promised\u2014even if not the 6,000 he wanted\u2014 are here, and a Kosovo police academy is turning out graduates. One of Mr. Kouchner's biggest regrets is the slow arrival of the police, which bred a culture of impunity. More than 500 murders have taken place in the year since the United Nations force took complete control of the province, and no one has yet been con-victed. There are still only four international judges and prosecutors in a province where violence and intimidation mean neither Serbs nor Albanians can administer fair jus-tice. What depresses him most, Mr. Kouchner says, is the persistence of ethnic violence even against the innocent and the care-givers. One of his worst moments came last winter, he said, when a Serbian obstetrician who cared for women of all ethnic groups was murdered by Albanians in Gnjilane, in the sector of Kosovo patrolled by American units of the United Nations force. ''He was a doctor!'' Mr. Kouchner ex- claimed, still appalled. ''It was the reverse of everything we did with Doctors Without Bor-ders.'' While Mr. Kouchner says he has put him- self alongside ''the new victims,'' the minor-ity Serbs, he carries with him his visit to the mass graves of slain Albanians. ''I'm angry that world opinion has changed so quickly,'' he said. ''They were aware be-fore of the beatings and the killings of Alba-nians, but now they say, 'There is ethnic cleansing of the Serbs.' But it is not the same\u2014it's revenge.'' He does savor the international military intervention on moral and humane grounds. ''I don't know if we will succeed in Kosovo,'' he said. ''But already we've won. We stopped the oppression of the Albanians of Kosovo.'' Mr. Kouchner paused, lost in thought and memory. ''It was my dream,'' he said softly. ''My grandparents died in Auschwitz,'' he said, opening a normally closed door. ''If only the international community was brave enough just to bomb the railways there,'' which took the Nazis' victims to the death camp. ''But all the opportunities were missed.'' That, he said, is why he became involved, early on, in Biafra, the region whose seces-sion touched off the Nigerian civil war of VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, SENATE S7637 July 26, 2000 1967-70, in which perhaps one million people died. And it was what drives him in Kosovo. Mr. Kouchner, now 60, holds to the healing power of time. He points to the reconcili-ation now of Germany and Israel, and of France and Germany. ''Working with Klaus Reinhardt is a good memory,'' he said. ''He called me his twin brother.'' They both came of age in the Eu-rope of 1968. ''I'm a Frenchman and he's a German,'' and 50 years ago, he said, ''no one could imagine this.'' ''It's much easier to make war than peace,'' Mr. Kouchner said. ''To make peace takes generations, a deep movement and a change of the spirit.'' He smiled, looked away. ''It's why I sometimes want to believe in God.''

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Iowa. f TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERI- CANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of the Senate to do something that I did 10 years ago; that is, to recognize the 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act by doing what I did on the floor 10 years ago. I will do a little bit of sign lan-guage with respect to that. (Signing.) Mr. President, what I just said in sign language was that 10 years ago I stood on the floor of the Senate and spoke in sign language when we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act. The reason I did that was because my brother Frank was my inspiration for all of my work here in Congress on dis-ability law. That was the reason that I became the chief sponsor of the Americans With Disabilities Act. I further said that I was sorry to say that my brother passed away last month. Over the last 10 years, he always said me that he was sorry the ADA was not there for him when he was growing up, but that he was happy that it was here now for young people so they would have a bet-ter future. Mr. President, we do cele-brate today the tenth anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, which has taken its place as one of the greatest civil rights laws in our his-tory. When you think about it, ten years ago, on July 25, 1990, a person with a disability saw an ad in the paper for a job for which that person was qualified, and went down to the business to inter-view for the job. The prospective em-ployer could look at that person and say: we don't hire people like you, get out of here. On July 25, 1990, that per-son was alone. The courthouse door was closed. There was no recourse for that person because there was no ban on discrimination because of disability. We banned it on the basis of race, sex, religion, national origin, but not dis-ability. So on July 25, 1990, a person VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7638 July 26, 2000 with a disability held the short end of the stick. But one day later, on July 26, 1990, the courthouse doors were opened. A person with a disability could now go down to that courthouse and enforce his or her civil rights. On July 26th, that one person who was alone the day before became 54 million people, and now that short end of the stick became a powerful club by which a disabled American could defend his or her rights. Ten years ago, we as a Nation com- mitted ourselves to the principle that a disability does not eliminate a person's right to participate in the cultural, economic, educational, political and social mainstream. Ten years ago, we said no to exclusion, no to dependence, no to segregation. We said yes to inclu-sion, yes to independence, and yes to integration in our society to people with disabilities. That is what the ADA is all about. For me, the ADA, as I have just said, was a lot about my brother Frank. He lost his hearing at an early age. Then he was taken from his home, his family and his community and sent across the State to the Iowa State school for the deaf. People often referred to it as the school for the ''deaf and dumb.'' I re-member one time my brother telling me, ''I may be deaf, but I am not dumb.'' While at school, Frank was told he could be one of three things: a cobbler, a printers assistant, or a baker. When he said he didn't want to be any one of those things. They said, OK, you are a baker. So after he got out of school, he became a baker. But that is not what he wanted to do. So he went on to do other things, obviously. Everyday tasks were always hard. I remember, as a young boy, going with my older brother Frank to a store and how the sales person, when she found out that he was deaf, looked through him like he was invisible and turned to me to ask me what he wanted; or how when he wanted to get a driver's li-cense, he was told that ''deaf people don't drive.'' So his life was not easy because the deck was stacked against him. He truly held the short end of the stick. I remember when my brother finally changed jobs. He got out of baking and got a job at a plant in Des Moines. He had a good job at Delavan's. Mr. Delavan decided he wanted to hire peo-ple with disabilities, and so my brother went to work there. He had a great job. He became a drill press operator mak-ing jet nozzles for jet engines. He was very proud of his work. Later on, I was in the Navy, in the military. I remem-ber when I came home on leave for Christmas, and I was unmarried at the time. I came home to spend it with my brother Frank, who was also unmar-ried, and the company he worked for had a Christmas dinner. So I went with my brother to it, not knowing that anything special was going to happen. It turned out that they were honoring Frank that night, because in 10 years of working there he had not missed one day of work and hadn't been late once. Mr. President, that is during Iowa win-ters. So, again, that is an indication of just how hard-working and dedicated people with disabilities are when they do get a job. He worked at that plant for 23 years, and in 23 years he missed 3 days of work. And that was because of an unusual blizzard. Another little funny aside. In ADA, we mandated a nationwide relay sys-tem for the deaf, so that a deaf person could call a hearing person, and a hear-ing person could call a deaf person without having to use the TTY. One of the first calls made on the nationwide relay system was from the White House in 1993, when President Clinton put in a call to my brother Frank. We had it all set up. President Clinton called the number, and the line was busy. All the national press was there and every-thing. He waited a few seconds and the line was busy again. It was busy three or four times. Finally, I called my neighbor in Cumming, Iowa, and I said, ''Go over and find out what is going on.'' My brother was so excited that he had been on the phone talking to his friends. He forgot that the President was going to call him. President Clin-ton related that story at the FDR me-morial this morning in celebration of the Americans With Disabilities Act and reminded me again of what the ADA was all about. As President Clin-ton so eloquently said this morning, it is about ensuring that every American can just do ordinary things, such as use the phone, go shopping, use public transportation. It is also about ensur-ing that every American has access to resources as fundamental as health in-surance, a job, an education\u2014things that we take for granted. The ADA is about designing our poli- cies and physical environment so that we as a Nation can benefit from the talent of every citizen. It is about ac-knowledging that it costs much more to squander the potential of millions of people than to make the modest ac-commodations that let all Americans contribute fully. It is about tearing down the false dichotomy of abled and disabled, and realizing that each of us has a unique set of abilities. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, in anticipation of this tenth anniversary celebration of ADA, I announced ''A Day in the Life of the ADA Campaign.'' I asked people from across America to send stories about how their lives are different because of ADA. I wanted to find out just what the ADA meant to other people in ordinary life. Based on these stories, I have learned that the ADA is truly changing the face of America. A woman from Vinton, Iowa who uses a wheelchair wrote to tell me that be-cause of the ADA, she now can travel around the country. She said: You can't understand until you've been there, searching for a hotel room, a restroom to stop in, a room to accommodate you, your spouse and your wheelchair. Oh, the joy of now knowing there are rest areas where we can stop, enter in without great difficulty, and then travel on to a waiting accessible motel room! What a good feeling to call ahead, make reservations and know that when we arrive there we'd find a clean room, ready to accommodate my needs. A man from St. Paul, Minnesota who is visually-impaired wrote to say that because of accommodations required by the ADA, he can use city buses with dignity, hear the audible traffic sig-nals, and work. He said that the ADA also enables him to enjoy cultural ac-tivities, because he can listen to narra-tions of plays through earphones and basketball games through special radio receivers. In his words: [The ADA] has made my life 1000 times bet- ter than my father's who was also totally blind. And, a woman from Corpus Christi, Texas, whose daughter is hearing im-paired told me that her daughter is able to join her schoolmates in classes and activities because of relay services and interpreters. The mother also told me that because of the ADA-required relay services, her daughter was able to speak with her father for the first time. When my daughter was just 4 years old, she got to call her real father for the first time. I wish you could have seen the sparkle in her eyes and the tears in mine as she 'talked' with her daddy. It took forever (she couldn't type) but the relay service was friendly and patient. I believe that Relay has played a part in keeping their relationship strong. Every little girl needs her daddy. Mr. President, I have a whole stack of these stories. I will not ask permis-sion for all, but I ask unanimous con-sent to have some of the more poignant stories that I received from around the country be printed in the R ECORD . They are very short. There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: SUCCESS STORIES FROM U.S. S ENATOR TOM HARKIN 'S''A D AY IN THE LIFE OF THE AMER- ICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT'' CAMPAIGN NEW YORK Summary: According to a man in New York with cerebral palsy, the ADA-required ramps, elevators, automatic doors, curb cuts, and accessible transportation have allowed him to be more independent in his life. Thanks to the ADA, he is now able to do his own banking, go to the post office or shop by himself, or enjoy a meal at a restaurant. Reasonable accommodation requirements have allowed him to work as an advocate for people with disabilities and earn money to contribute to his household expenses. In his words, the ADA has allowed him to ''show my community that I am willing and able to be like anyone else in ways like getting a job and being independent.'' Quotation: [Prior to the ADA,] I felt that I was not a real human being because people with disabilities . . . were not supposed to be seen or heard . . . [The ADA] opened the door to freedom people with all types of dis-abilities . . . The ADA is a step toward reaching equal ground for EVERYONE! . . . Doing things on my own makes me feel like I am a PERSON and gives me a lot of con-fidence in myself''. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 SENATE S7639 July 26, 2000 TENNESSEE Summary: A man from Tennessee has been quadriplegic since an automobile accident in 1990, the very year that the ADA was signed. According to him, the ADA has helped him pursue his academic, as well as employment, dreams. The ADA helped him to earn an un-dergraduate degree and was even the subject of his master's thesis during graduate school at a Tennessee state university. Quotation: [With the passage of the ADA], my physical impairments that had recently been introduced to a cold world now had a blanket. A blanket provided by my country . . . My disability and the ADA were born to-gether and this year we celebrate 10 years of success, for the both of us. MARYLAND Summary: A woman from Maryland is the mother of three autistic children\u2014all of whom have benefitted from the ADA. Be-cause of the ADA, she looks forward to her children graduating from school and working in the community when they grow up. Quotations: Ten years ago before the ADA my boys would have been wrenched with heart ache as they walked with their heads hung down in shame. They would feel the pain of having a disorder that would make them stand and learn apart from the other children at school. I am not sure what their future holds in store. I know that the sup-ports are in place. SACRAMENTO , CALIFORNIA Summary: A man with muscular dystrophy from Sacramento, California, cannot imag-ine what his life would be like without the ADA and celebrates July 26 as the ''Other Independence Day.'' He credits the ADA with making his life ''full and independent'' by re-quiring stores, restaurants, parks, and thea-ters to be accessible to all people. Quotation: The ADA embodies what people with disabilities really want, to be viewed as people first, not judged or excluded because of our disabilities. We want to earn a living, raise families, go to restaurants, churches and live our lives as independently as pos-sible with dignity and respect and not be ex-cluded because of barriers\u2014be they architec-tural, communication or attitudinal bar-riers. MOSS POINT , MISSISSIPPI Summary: A woman from Moss Point, Mis- sissippi has been in a wheelchair since 1997. The ADA makes it possible for her to do her own grocery shopping, attend events at her grandchildren's school, go to dinner ''any-where,'' travel, and stay in a handicapped room at a motel with the ''greatest shower [she has] ever seen''. Quotation: No one plans to become handi- capped, but I am grateful the ADA Program planned for me. ARROYO GRAND , CALIFORNIA Summary: A man from Arroyo Grand, Cali- fornia who uses a wheelchair says that he has benefitted from the ADA in a variety of ways. Because of the ADA, he is able to watch his nieces play basketball in an acces-sible gymnasium, to play chess in accessible recreation rooms, even to attend a Bob Dylan concert and to shut his own apart-ment door. Quotation: The success of the Americans with Disabilities Act over the last ten years was caused by its enormous power. Knowl-edge of its power brings improvement. The reason the ADA is powerful is that all busi-nesses know about it, and people with dis-abilities can communicate with that power-ful knowledge . . . Everywhere I go today I can seriously say ''ADA'' and get a response. SALEM , INDIANA Summary: A woman from Salem, Indiana, uses a wheelchair and has limited use of one arm. She credits the ADA for the construc- tion of buildings where her disability ''never occurs to [her]''\u2014with aisles wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair, bathrooms that are accessible, and drinking fountains at chair level. She writes of the joy of being al-lowed access, via outside elevators and ramps, to such historical sites as Thomas Jefferson's Monticello and the Lincoln Me-morial. Quotation: Dear ADA, Thank you for being there when we need you, the curb cuts, low- incline ramps, the grab bars and the list goes on and on . . . ADA, what life has done to us, you have equalized it, with accessibility. GREENBELT , MARYLAND Summary: A man who lives in Greenbelt, Maryland and is hearing impaired thanks the ADA for increasing public awareness of the abilities the ''disabled'' have. He praises the ADA for helping him become an attorney and allowing him to help other people with disabilities ''achieve their dreams.'' Accord-ing to him, the ADA has impacted almost every aspect of his daily life, from the time he turns on the television with closed-cap-tioning in the morning, to the time he at-tends a city advisory meeting with an inter-preter at night. Quotation: The impact of the ADA is felt throughout my daily life. When I turn on the TV in the morning, I can watch captions and public service announcements because of the ADA. When I go to work and make phone calls, I use the telecommunication relay services enacted by the ADA. I talk with my friends who are given accommodations on the job as required by the ADA. In the after-noon I go to the doctor's office and am able to communicate with my doctor because the ADA has required the presence of a sign lan-guage interpreter. After the doctor's office, I decide to go shopping and am able to find a TTY (as required by the ADA) in the mall to call my family and let them know that I will be a bit late arriving home. After dinner with my family, I go to [city meeting] . . . and am able to participate fully . . . because the ADA allows me to receive the services of a sign language interpreter. In short, the ADA has had a major impact on almost every facet of my life. WAUKEGAN , ILLINOIS Summary: A 25-year-old social worker who is sight impaired writes from Waukegan, Illi-nois. According to her, Title III of the ADA has allowed her to receive bank statements in Braille and to balance her checkbook. She is now able to enjoy a level of privacy that many Americans take for granted. Quotation: I now receive my statements in the mail every month, as do other bank cus-tomers. This might seem like a small victory to some. Obviously such people have never been denied the ability to read something so personal as a bank statement. LAS CRUCES , NEW MEXICO Summary: A woman from Las Cruces, New Mexico, uses a wheelchair and credits the ADA for allowing her to ''pick up and make a move across the country'' to a new home. She says that the ADA has given her her life back and made her a ''possibility-thinker'' again. Quotation: I know that things are made possible for the disabled now because IT'S THE LAW. We have greater options, self-re-spect and better public awareness because of the ADA . . . My independence and free will are intact. TEXAS Summary with Quotation: A woman from Texas is hearing-impaired and writes of how the ADA has allowed her to return to aca-demia. After teaching for 20 years, she was forced to quit teaching college-level English when she could no longer hear her students in the classroom. In her words ''it tore my heart out to give it up.'' Now, because of services for disabled students required by the ADA, she can attend literature courses at a university by wearing a headset that ampli-fies her professor's voice. In her words, ''[it] was sheer heaven to be in the classroom again.'' GLEN ELLYN , ILLINOIS Summary and Quotations: A man in Glen Ellyn, Illinois who is sight impaired regards the ADA as ''a necessary civil rights law.'' Because of the ADA's employment provi-sions, he has been able to ask his employer to make materials\u2014such as benefits infor-mation, texts for training courses, and time sheets\u2014in an alternative format. Because of the ADA's transportation provisions, he has been able to travel on public transportation, because bus drivers now call out individual stops. Because of the ADA's public accommo-dation requirements, he is able to order what he wants at restaurants and to attend hotels and movie theaters independently. BROOKLINE , MASSACHUSETTS Summary and Quotations: A hearing-im- paired man from Brookline, Massachusetts, writes to praise the ADA. Having grown up in Trinidad without the benefits of disability legislation, he appreciates being able to at-tend open-captioned movie theaters, use the Boston subways, which have visual displays announcing stops, and have access to inter-preting services for work-related meetings and training sessions. He writes of the ''growing respect'' people give to individuals with disabilities and ''awareness'' that is motivated by more than ''just a legal obliga-tion.'' ROCKY MOUNT , NORTH CAROLINA Summary: A man in Rocky Mount, North Carolina who has been a paraplegic all his life thanks the ADA for allowing him ''to be-come as independent as others.'' He now has access to a variety of school, shopping malls, and sports and entertainment events. Be-cause of the ADA, he has job opportunities that he never could have dreamed of growing up. Quotation: ''When I was growing up I had to go to certain schools and shopping malls that were accessible. Sports and entertain-ment was something you dreamed about, but was never able to participate in .... But now things are different, thanks to the [ADA] able to say, ''Don't look at my disability, but look at my ability.''' ARKADELPHIA , ARKANSAS Summary: A sight-impaired student in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, credits the ADA for making her first year at a state university a ''beautiful experience and resounding suc-cess.'' Because the ADA requires colleges to ensure equal access to educational informa-tion, she is able to get a quality college edu-cation. Quotation: [The ADA] has really helped the disabled people that are present on our campus to get as good an education as pos-sible and also to make their college career a beautiful experience and a resounding suc-cess. SOUTH AMBOY , NEW JERSEY Summary: A woman from South Amboy, New Jersey who has mental, behavioral, and learning disabilities says that the ADA has made her feel included in community life. Through her local independent living center, a psycho-social rehabilitation program, an anger management workshop, and other sup-port and advocacy groups, she has learned to accept her disabilities and ''welcome them as a dimension to [her life].'' VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 SENATE S7640 July 26, 2000 Quotation: Most importantly, I strongly believe that the ADA is breaking both phys-ical and attitudinal barriers in the commu-nity and society so citizens with all disabil-ities are able to live, inclusive, full, produc-tive, and independent lives. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the ADA, of course, ultimately is about our children. They will be the first genera-tion to grow up with the ADA\u2014the first generation in which children with and without disabilities play together on the playground, learn together in school, hang out together at the mall and the movie theater, and go out to-gether for pizza. These children who will grow up as classmates and friends and neighbors will now see each other as neighbors and coworkers\u2014no longer segregated. That is what the ADA is about. It has opened up new worlds for people with disabilities\u2014where people with disabilities are participating more and more in their communities, living fuller lives as students, as coworkers, as taxpayers, as consumers, voters, and neighbors. But we must never forget that pro- hibiting discrimination is not the same as ensuring equal opportunity. Presi-dent Johnson understood this when he said: ''[Y]ou cannot shackle men and women for centuries, then bring them to the starting line of a race and say, 'You see, we're giving you an equal chance.' That is why we all work so hard for the Ticket to Work and Work Incen-tives Improvement Act because we had to set the stage to change the employ-ment rate for people with disabilities. That is why we all work so hard to de-fend the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, because there is no equal opportunity without education. I am proud that this morning Presi- dent Clinton announced a new effort by the Federal Government to open up an additional 100,000 jobs in the Federal Government for people with disabil-ities. That is leadership. I thank Presi-dent Clinton for providing that leader-ship. Again, that is why we have to fight against genetic discrimination. That is why we have to add people with disabil-ities to the Hate Crimes Act that passed the Senate, and to make sure it becomes law. That is why we have to fight to make sure we don't lose in the Supreme Court what we gained in Congress. There is a case now pending before the Supreme Court in which a State has ar-gued that title II of the ADA which ap-plies to State governments should be held unconstitutional because the Fed-eral Government does not have the power to enforce the ADA against the States in the way other civil rights laws are. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, applies to all the States and State governments. Now a State is ar-guing that the ADA, a civil rights law for people with disabilities, should not apply to States. They are saying: Don't worry. The State says: Leave it to us. We will make sure that people aren't subject to employment discrimination. We will make sure that people aren't forced to live inside institutions or car-ried up the steps in order to get into the local courthouse. Some of us remember after the 1964 civil rights bill was passed that States were arguing the same thing: Leave it to the States; they will take care of civil rights; we don't need the Federal Government coming in. What I think we are forgetting is that this is a civil rights law that cov-ers the citizens of America. We are all in this together. We are talking about citizens'\u2014Federal, national\u2014constitu-tional rights to equal protection under the law. It is up to this Federal Con-gress to ensure that citizens with dis-abilities get that equal treatment. That is why we have title II of the ADA. In sign language, there is a wonderful sign for America. It is this: This is the sign for America, all of the fingers put together, joining the hands in a circle. That describes America for all. We are all together. We are not separated out. We are all within one circle; a family\u2014 the deaf sign. It is not separate and apart. It is not one State and another State when it comes to civil rights and ensuring equal protection of the law. We will not let the Supreme Court re-write history and erase civil rights\u2014 the national civil rights for people with disabilities. Finally, we have to close the digital divide to make sure that people with disabilities have full access to the new technologies. Last night, Vice President Gore held a reception at the Vice President's house for literally hundreds and hun-dreds of people with disabilities from all over America. It was a great event to celebrate the 10th anniversary. In one tent, they set up a wide variety of new technologies to assist people with disabilities. I was particularly taken with one new device that had a cathode ray tube, CRT. It was hooked up to a PC. There was a little device under the net, a CRT that looked up at your eyes. You sat there for a second and it cali-brated it. With your eye movement alone, you could turn on lights, turn off lights, make phone calls, talk to people, type letters, get on the Inter-net, only by moving your eyes. Think about what that means for people who have Lou Gehrig's disease or severe cerebral palsy. There are a lot of disabled people who can't do any-thing but move their eyes. But their mind is perfect. One perfect example that Vice Presi- dent Gore always uses is Stephen Haw-kins, perhaps the smartest individual in the world, who is fully immobile be-cause of his disability. Yet here is a machine that will allow him to more rapidly access information and to write his wonderful books about the uni-verse. That is what I mean when I say we ought to close the digital divide be-cause there is so much out there that can help people with disabilities. Lastly, I say that the next step we have to do is fight and win against the continued segregation of people with disabilities from their own commu-nities. That is why we have to move forward on the bill called MiCASSA, S. 1935, a bill that is pending in the Sen-ate right now\u2014the Medicaid Commu-nity Attendant Services and Supports Act\u2014a bipartisan bill that will elimi-nate institutional bias in the Federal Medicaid program and give people with disabilities and the elderly a real choice to live in their communities. Right now, Medicaid is biased toward institutionalization. Why shouldn't we give a person with a disability the right to decide where he or she wants to live and how they want to live? Let them live in their own home, in their own community settings. That is what S. 1935 is about. The disability community all over this country understands personal attend-ants are sorely needed. No individual should be forced into an institution just to receive reimbursement for serv-ices that can be effectively and effi-ciently delivered in the home of the community. Individuals must be em-powered to exercise real choice in se-lecting long-term services and supports that meet their unique needs and allow them to be independent. Federal and State Medicaid policies should be re-sponsive to and not impede an individ-ual's choice in selecting services and supports. This bill eliminates the bias toward institutional care. It would help deliver services and supports consistent with the principle that people with disabil-ities have the right to live in the most integrated setting appropriate to meet-ing that individual's unique needs. In last year's Olmstead decision, the Supreme Court found that to the ex-tent that Medicaid dollars are used to pay for a person's long-term care, that person has a civil right to receive those services in the most integrative set-tings. Therefore, we in Congress have a responsibility to help States meet the financial costs associated with serving people with disabilities who want to leave institutions and live in the com-munity. MiCASSA, as the bill is known, S. 1935, will provide that help. A lot of people say this will cost money. Actually, it will save money. Medicaid spending on long-term care in 1997 totaled $56 billion, but only $13.5 billion was spent on home and commu-nity-based services. That $13.5 billion paid for the care of almost 2 million people. In contrast, the $42.5 billion we spent on institutional care paid for just a lit-tle over 1 million people. The average annual cost of institu- tional care for people with disabilities is more than double the average annual cost of providing home and commu-nity-based services. Right now, all across the country, hundreds of thou-sands of people are providing unpaid VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7641 July 26, 2000 support to sons and daughters, moth- ers, fathers, sisters and brothers, to allow them to remain in the commu-nity. Yet when they turn to the cur-rent long-term care system for relief, all too often all they can do is add their name to a very long waiting list. That is not right. That is not just. That is not fair. These family care givers are sacrificing their own em-ployment opportunities and costing the country millions in taxable income. Lastly, I take a moment to remark on the surplus. Lately that is all we are hearing about is how much surplus we will have over the next 10 years. I hear now it is up to $2 trillion and counting. We have some very important decisions to make about what we do with the surplus. Everyone is lining up\u2014tax breaks here, tax cuts here, tax breaks here, for business, for corporations, for this group, for that group\u2014all lining up to get some of that surplus. I believe we have to make some im- portant decisions. I believe we have to use that money to pay down the debt, shore up Social Security, make sure that our seniors get what they need under Medicare. With all these groups lining up to get a piece of the action on the surplus, I am asking: What about the disability community? What about the Americans all over our country who want to live in their own commu-nities, who want supportive services in their homes, who want personal assist-ance services so they can go to work every day? I believe we should use some of that surplus to make sure that all Americans have the equal right to live in the community\u2014not just in spirit, but in reality. As I said, our present Medicaid policy has an institutional bias. We need to use some of this surplus to get people in their own homes and communities. There may be some transitional cost, but we know later on when these peo-ple start going to work, when their families and the family care givers who are at home now and underemployed, are employed, when they go to work they are working, making money, pay-ing taxes. Yes, when we are talking about what we are going to do with that surplus, let's not forget we have millions of Americans far too long segregated, far too long kept out of the main stream of society, far too long denied their rights as American citizens to full integration in our society. It is time we do the right thing. It is time when we make decisions about the surplus, we use some of that to make sure that people with disabilities are able to live and work and travel as they want. ADA may stand for the Americans with Disabilities Act, but it stands for more than that. It really stands for the American dream for all. In closing, as I said earlier, my brother, Frank, passed away last month. I miss him now and I will miss him forever. He was a wonderful broth-er to me. He was a great friend. He was my great inspiration. He was proud of what the ADA meant for people with disabilities. For 10 years he and mil-lions of people across our country lived out its possibilities. So I thank my brother, Frank. I thank everyone else in the entire disability community who was an inspiration for me, who worked so hard for the Americans with Disabil-ities Act. I include in that many of my fellow Senators and Representatives. This was never a partisan bill. It is not now a partisan bill. It will never be a par-tisan bill. Too many good people on both sides of the aisle worked hard. Senator Weicker, who led the charge early on, before I even got to the Sen-ate; Senator Dole, who worked so hard, so long, to make sure we got ADA through; Boyden Grey, Counsel to the President who worked with us every step of the way; Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, what a giant he was, hung in there, day after day, working to make sure we got it through. On our side of the aisle, Senator K ENNEDY , who made sure we had all the hearings, got the people there, made the record, to ensure that ADA was on solid ground; Tony Coehlo from the House of Rep-resentatives, and Representative S TENY HOYER in the House; Congressman Steve Bartlett, another great giant, Republican leader in the House at that time, later on became mayor of Dallas. He was there this morning, too. At that time, there weren't Demo- crat and there weren't Republicans. We were all in that same boat together, and we were all pulling together. We were, as I said earlier, Mr. President\u2014 the deaf sign for Americans is this (signing)\u2014all of us together, fingers intertwined, all of us in that same fam-ily circle. That is what ADA is about. It is about this deaf sign. We are all in this together. We want to make sure the ADA real- ly does stand for the American dream for all. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. B ROWNBACK ). Under the previous order, Senator D EWINEis recognized. Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I be- lieve the Senator from Ohio will yield to me, and I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for a few remarks in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f REMEMBERING SENATOR PAUL COVERDELL Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, all last week I deferred coming to the floor to speak about my friend, Paul Coverdell, on the ground that it might be easier to do so this week. It is not. It is not, but it is vitally important to memori-alize such a friend. Every Monday evening or Tuesday morning, Paul Coverdell and I sat at the end of the table during leadership meetings in the majority leader's of-fice, with an opportunity to comment on all of the issues that came before that group. Frequently, however, at the end of the table, we would ex-change whispered remarks on some of the other people or subject matter, ei-ther present or not present. Paul Coverdell had a wonderful sense of humor, there and elsewhere: Dry, gentle, always to the point. It was a de-lightful pleasure to share those mo-ments, sometimes stressful, sometimes marvelously relaxed, with such a man. If you sought advice on a matter of vitally important public policy, Paul Coverdell was one of the first you would seek out. You knew that any-thing he would discuss with you would be filled with wisdom and common sense, and that stacking your remarks against his would focus and sharpen your own thoughts and your own ideas. It hardly mattered what the subject was\u2014education, taxes, national secu-rity, a dozen others; the advice was al-ways good and always relevant. If you then sought tactics or advice on how to accomplish a shared goal, Paul Coverdell was a man whom you sought out. Particularly if there were an individual in your own party, or in the other party, whom you might be reluctant, for one reason or another, to approach, you could ask Paul Coverdell to do it for you, and he would. There was no task, there was no detail that was too small for him, none that he thought was beneath him, if it was con-structive, if it would help the cause in the long term. One way in which you can determine individuals' reactions to other individ-uals is in a group. At the Republican conference meeting immediately before the Fourth of July recess, Paul Cover-dell, as the Secretary of the con-ference, presented us a little plastic note card, the top of which read ''Re-publican Policy.'' I no longer remem-ber the particular subject, but I do re-member that first one or two people said, ''I don't agree with point 3.'' Pret-ty soon, everyone was piling on. Fi-nally, one of our colleagues wrote across the top of this, ''One Repub-lican's Policy,'' and handed it back to Paul Coverdell, who just went back to perfect his message. Whom you tease, you generally love. That in many respects was an expres-sion of the love and respect his Repub-lican colleagues had for Paul Coverdell. Paul Coverdell made us all proud of our profession, a profession often criti-cized, in fact a profession rarely praised. When a State sends a Paul Coverdell to the Senate, it is proof positive that our system works. And when the Senate of the United States listens to and respects and follows a Paul Coverdell, that, too, is proof that our system works. When, as was my privilege, you come to know and be be-friended by a Paul Coverdell, you are especially privileged and especially honored. I was so privileged. I was so honored. I will not know his like again. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Ohio. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec SENATE S7642 July 26, 2000 Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, I con- gratulate my colleague from Wash-ington State on very eloquent com-ments about our dear friend, Paul Coverdell. I had the chance a few days ago to make some more extensive com-ments than I will tonight about Sen-ator Coverdell. But I just want to add, I had the opportunity, as many Mem-bers of the Senate did, to travel to At-lanta this past weekend to participate in that very wonderful service for our dear friend. I don't think it really hit me that he was really gone until I got back this week to Washington and started contemplating this Senate body without Paul Coverdell and all that he meant to each and every one of us. He was our friend. We loved him very much. This body, this institution, is a poorer place because he is gone. Each one of us is richer because we were privileged to know this very gentle, this very kind, this very sweet, this very good man. f HONORING VIRGINIA ''GINNY'' GANO Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, on a happy note, I rise this evening to honor someone who has spent the last 30 years of her life serving the people of this country, of this Congress, of the State of Ohio; specifically, of the Sev-enth Congressional District in Ohio. I am talking about a dear friend of mine, Virginia ''Ginny'' Gano. I had the great pleasure and honor to work with her during my years as Congress-man from the Seventh Congressional District in Ohio. Ginny is now in her 31st year of service to the people. She is truly an ambassador for the Seventh district and for the entire State of Ohio. Ginny grew up in Springfield, OH. She started working for Congressman Bud Brown at a very young age in 1969. In 1982, when I was elected to the House of Representatives, I asked Ginny if she would come work with me. I be-came the Congressman. Ginny agreed to stay on and work in our office. Dur-ing that time, Ginny Gano was really invaluable to me and invaluable to our office and to the people of the district. She had and has an unbelievable wealth of knowledge and institutional memory. If you want something done, if you want to know something, you ask Ginny Gano. In 1991, she joined current Seventh District Congressman D AVID HOBSON 's team. This evening\u2014I am sure at this very moment\u2014knowing Ginny, she is still at work in the Longworth Build-ing serving the people in the district. Ginny is one of the hardest working people whom I have ever met. With her resources, her experience, and her knowledge, she can answer any ques-tion or just about any request made of her. She never says no. She is that good. She gets the job done. She just knows how to get it done. Whatever you want, Ginny will figure out a way of getting it done. One of the many things that Ginny has done over the years has been to work with interns in a Congressman's office. She goes to great lengths to make sure these young people who come out from Ohio to serve the people and to learn have meaningful experi-ences in Washington, that they feel at home, that they have someone to look out for them. Ginny has spent the last 30 years helping people in our district and has truly gotten to know the people of the Seventh District, and they know that she cares about them. She is the one constant in the office of the Congress-man from the Seventh Congressional District. Whether it was Bud Brown, M IKEDEWINE, or D AVEHOBSON , Ginny Gano has been there. Ginny Gano is making a difference. One of the things I appreciate about Ginny so much is that she has a way about her that makes everyone feel at ease. Whether it is a group of school-children from Greene County or maybe someone whom she bumps into in the Rotunda of the Capitol, a total strang-er, it does not matter; Ginny is there to help them and she makes everyone feel welcome in our Nation's Capitol. Ginny is a caring and compassionate human being. Being around Ginny Gano just makes you happy. She is that type of person. Her smile, her spir-it, her energy\u2014you just feel good when you are around Ginny Gano. Ginny has dedicated some of her free time\u2014the little free time she has\u2014to something she loves: music. For years she has participated with a great deal of enthusiasm in the Capitol Hill Cho-ral Society. She also has been a driving force behind the Ohio State society's selection of the cherry blossom prin-cess every spring. My wife Fran and I are just so proud to call Ginny Gano a friend. I thank her for over 30 years of dedicated serv-ice to the people of the Seventh Con-gressional District of the State of Ohio. Ginny, thank you. f P.L. 480 ASSISTANCE IN HAITI Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, I want to talk this evening about an issue about which I have spoken before on the floor of the Senate, and that is the situation with the children in the poor country of Haiti. I rise tonight to re-mind my colleagues of a very impor-tant feeding program that is crucial to these children. The program I am talk-ing about, of course, is the Public Law 480 title II Food Assistance Program which, according to the USAID mission in Port au Prince in Haiti, helps feed roughly 500,000 Haitian schoolchildren and almost 10,000 orphaned children through its Orphan Feeding Program. As we know, funding for the P.L. 480 title II program was included in the Senate fiscal year 2001 Agriculture ap-propriations bill, which we in the Sen-ate recently passed. I commend and thank the chairman and ranking mem-ber on the subcommittee, Senator C OCHRAN and Senator K OHL, and also the chairman and ranking member on the full committee, Senator S TEVENS and Senator B YRD, for their continuing ongoing support of Public Law 480. I am very pleased the committee in- cluded language in the Agriculture ap-propriations bill that will maintain the same level of USAID resources for the Orphan Feeding Program in Haiti as were provided for our current year. I urge my colleagues in conference to continue this language and continue this program. The reality is that the country of Haiti is a great human tragedy. The nation is in turmoil on a political, eco-nomic, and humanitarian level. Though the small island nation finally did hold its parliamentary elections in May after three previous postponements, and though voter turnout was certainly acceptable and the citizens were vot-ing, the openness of these elections re-mains in serious question. The violence against opposition party members and supporters leading up to the May elec-tion cast serious doubt on the legit-imacy of this election. Leon Manus, the president of the electoral council, resigned after the first round of elections and had to flee the country fearing for his life after having accused the Haitian Govern-ment of pressuring him to approve the questionable election results. The international community has se- verely and justifiably criticized both rounds of elections, with the European Union threatening economic sanctions. In spite of widespread criticism, in spite of OAS refusal to recognize the contested election results, Haitian offi-cials proceeded with the runoff elec-tions on July 9, and, as expected, a handful of Haitians turned out to vote, just a handful of people for the few leg-islative and local offices that were not already won by the ruling Lavalas Party. Prior to these elections, I spoke on the Senate floor about Haiti's dis-tressing political and economic situa-tion. I talked at that time about how it was incumbent upon the political elite and the ruling party in Haiti, the Fanmi Lavalas Party, to make and to take reforms seriously. As I said then, and I have said many times before, Haiti simply will not progress until its political leaders and the elite in that country take responsibility for their situation and commit to true demo-cratic reform. Regardless of the recent election out- come, Haiti can succeed as a democ-racy if and only if the leaders of the nation, the political elite, the ruling elite, the economic elite, resolve to de-velop a free market system, resolve to reduce corruption, resolve to improve Haiti's judicial system and its election process, resolve to respect human rights and develop a sustainable agri-cultural system that can feed its peo-ple, and especially the poor children of Haiti. Despite the success\u2014I have seen it; and there has been success\u2014of some VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec SENATE S7643 July 26, 2000 USAID programs to promote growth in Haiti's agricultural sector, past defor-estation and a lack of education about how best to use the land for both short- term and long-term economic gain have slowed, almost to a standstill, any improvement in the agricultural sector. Because of that, I firmly believe that the United States should continue ef-forts aimed at teaching Haitian farm-ers viable ways to farm\u2014agriculture that produces food for the Haitian peo-ple now and conserves the land for pro-duction in the future by generations to come\u2014agriculture that shows farmers how sustainable agriculture is really in their best economic interest, both in the short run and in the long run. Efforts to work directly with farmers provide the greatest hope of preventing Haitians from abandoning agriculture for urban areas, such as Port-au- Prince. One of the biggest problems in Haiti is that so many people who are not making it in agriculture at all, who can't feed their family, under-standably flee the countryside and go into one of Haiti's big cities, only to face worse poverty and create a more dire situation for their family. The only way that will stop is if Haiti can develop, with our assistance, with the assistance of the international commu-nity, a viable, sustainable agricultural program. As I have said, I have visited Haiti eight or nine times. My wife and I have seen many of these programs and have seen that they do, in fact, work. But until sustainable improvements are made in the Haitian agricultural sec-tor, I believe we have a responsibility\u2014 I believe we have an obligation\u2014to en-sure that humanitarian and food as-sistance continues to reach this tiny island nation and most particularly, most importantly, continues to reach these children. That is why it is vital that we main- tain current funding levels for the Pub-lic Law 480 title II assistance program for Haiti and other parts of the world as well. The simple fact is, this pro-gram is essential to the survival\u2014lit-erally the survival\u2014of many thousands of Haitian children, especially those living in overcrowded orphanages. There are currently 114 orphanages throughout Haiti receiving USAID funds and caring for a vast number of children. Quite candidly, these rep-resent just a small fraction of the total number of orphanages on this island. My wife Fran and I have traveled to Haiti repeatedly\u2014eight times in the past 5 years. We visited many of these orphanages. We have seen the dire and dismal conditions. We have held the children and felt their malnourished bodies. But we have also seen what can happen with these children, and how so many dedicated people working in these orphanages can literally nurse these children back to life. The orphanages of Haiti feed and take care of thousands upon thousands upon thousands of orphaned and aban-doned children. The flow of desperate children into these orphanages is con-stant, and these facilities face the in-creasing challenge of accommodating these children. It is these children who need our help the most. It is these children who are not capable of providing for them-selves. That is why I am convinced that the Public Law 480 title II feeding program is absolutely essential. This low-cost program guarantees one meal per day to orphan children who other-wise would not receive any food at all. The school feeding program is also essential because the title II assistance program\u2014the offer of a free meal to these children, and the parents who send their children to school\u2014helps keep Haitian children in school. I again thank the committee for its support for and its commitment to Public Law 480 title II assistance for these children in Haiti. I urge my colleagues on the con- ference committee\u2014and throughout this year, and into the next\u2014to con-tinue their support for this program. f COMMENDING AMBASSADOR TIM CARNEY Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, on an- other matter related to Haiti, I take this opportunity this evening to com-mend and thank my friend, Ambas-sador Tim Carney, for his 2-year serv-ice as U.S. Ambassador to Haiti. Tim and his wife Vicki proudly represented the United States. Day in and day out, they were committed to helping the people of Haiti overcome their dismal surroundings and their dire cir-cumstances. Tim and Vicki worked to alleviate hunger and poverty through-out the island and encouraged practical economic reforms. Through the support and cooperation of Ambassador Carney and Vicki, the conditions of several Haitian orphan-ages continue to improve. Although the Carneys' assignment in Haiti has concluded, their commitment con-tinues today. My wife Fran and I appreciate their friendship. We appreciate the support and help they have given to the chil-dren of Haiti. We look forward to con-tinuing our work with them to help the children of Haiti. f TRIBUTE TO ERV NUTTER Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to celebrate the life of a great man from my home State of Ohio, a true renaissance man. I am talking about Erv Nutter, who died on January 6 of this year at the age of 85. I am honored to have known Erv and am humbled to have the chance this evening to say just a few words about what his friendship has meant to me and my family, to my community, and to my State. Ervin John Nutter was born in Ham- ilton, OH, on June 26, 1914, to parents he described as ''a Kentucky school-teacher and a Wyoming cowboy.'' He was a running guard on the State championship Hamilton High School football team and later graduated from there. He attended Miami University in Oxford, OH, and then transferred to the University of Kentucky where, at the age of 21, he dropped out to take the Ohio examination for stationary engi-neers. Following that test, he became the youngest licensed engineer in Ohio, and then took a job at Proctor & Gam-ble in Cincinnati. In 1943, Erv returned to the Univer- sity of Kentucky to earn his degree in mechanical engineering. After gradua-tion, he took a job in the engineering division of the Air Force at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, where he was put in charge of aircraft environ-mental testing. Then in 1951, Erv Nutter founded the Elano Corporation, which fabricates metal parts for jet engines. He started the business in a Greene County, OH, garage. Elano grew and grew, and it grew ultimately into a multimillion- dollar business that has influenced aviation worldwide, through precision forming and bending of tubular assem-blies for fuel, and lubrication and hy-draulic systems for jet aircraft and missiles. I met Erv Nutter for the first time in 1973. I was right out of law school, on my first job, as an assistant county prosecutor in Greene County. I remem-ber Sheriff Russell Bradley and then- county prosecutor Nick Carrera, and I were conducting a major drug inves-tigation. It was going well. The only problem was, we had run out of money. So we went to some people in the community. One of the first people we went to was Erv Nutter. To keep that investigation going, we simply had to have some financial assistance. So we asked Erv if he would help. Without any hesitation, as Erv would always do\u2014he didn't ask anything\u2014he just said: Sure. If you boys think it's a good idea, if you think we need to do it, I'll do it. When it came to his community, Erv was always ready to lend a hand, whether with his financial resources or his time and energy. That was just Erv Nutter. Erv has been a role model for so many people throughout the years. Through his kindness and extreme gen-erosity, he has taught invaluable les-sons, such as the importance of giving back to our communities, the impor- tance of building and trusting our neighbors, and the economic future of our villages and our cities. Through the years, he donated mil- lions of dollars to the University of Kentucky and Wright State University. Today, two buildings at the Lexington campus bear Erv's name, as does Wright State University's indoor ath-letic complex. Erv Nutter was a blunt man. He was an open man. He was a man who would tell you what he thought, never afraid in any way to express his convictions or his strong beliefs. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7644 July 26, 2000 That is one of the things that made Erv Nutter so endearing. It has been said that the greatness of a man can be measured by the extent and the breadth of his interests and how he acts on those interests to make a dif-ference in this world. Surely by that test, Erv Nutter was a great man. He was so passionate about his interests, and what interests he had: agriculture, technology, wild game conservation, education, sports, history, aviation, or working for a better government. Whatever Erv was interested in, he cared passionately about and he acted upon. And in each area, he made a dif-ference. Sure, he helped financially but, more importantly, Erv gave his time and he gave his energy. He was a man of great passion. In 1981, Erv Nutter was named Greene County Man of the Year. He served as business chairman of the American Cancer Society, chairman of the Fel-low's Committee at the University of Kentucky, member of the President's Club at both Ohio State and Wright State University, past president and trustee of the Aviation Hall of Fame\u2014 one of his great passions and his won-derful wife, Zoe Dell's great passions; the work with Zoe Dell continues to this day\u2014as former chairman of the Ohio Republican Finance Committee, and former chairman of the Beavercreek Zoning Commission. In 1995, at the age of 80, Erv was in- ducted into the Ohio Senior Citizens Hall of Fame, an honor for outstanding contributions and exceptional achieve-ments begun or continued after the age of 60. Erv always was there for our community. Erv always was there for our State. In all that he did, he made a positive difference. Erv Nutter was a remarkable person, a person who af-fected countless lives for the better. His family knows that probably better than anyone else because there were so many things Erv Nutter did that he didn't tell anybody about. He just was there to be supportive and to make a difference. He just quietly helped out whenever his community asked. And many times when his community didn't ask, he did it anyway. The only thing Erv wanted was to make the world a better place for his children, his grandchildren, and for all of us. Erv Nutter took great pleasure in sharing his personal success with the whole community. I was particu-larly struck by Erv's humility. I re-member that he once told the Xenia Daily Gazette he was the luckiest man in the world. He was lucky because he had had the opportunity to do so many things he had never, ever, in his wildest dreams, thought he would be able to do. He told the paper: No one can achieve success by himself. I think this is one of the most important things for people to remember today. Erv didn't seek credit. Rather, he ap- preciated his success and understood that his community was a great part of that success. We all admired Erv Nut-ter. We all respected him. As Chesterton once said: Great men take up great space, even when they are gone. Erv Nutter will continue to take up great space on this Earth, not just in buildings but in lives touched and lives changed. Erv Nutter will continue to live on through the great work he has done. He also will live through his won-derful family: his wife Zoe Dell, Joe, Bob and Mary, Ken and Melinda, Katie and Jonathan. We pay tribute to Erv tonight for what he has meant to our community. f ROCCO SCOTTI\u2014A GREAT AMERICAN Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, I rise to recognize tonight Rocco Scotti, a tal-ented and patriotic singer from my home State of Ohio, who is a fixture in Cleveland and Cuyahoga County, northeast Ohio, a fixture at Cleveland Indians baseball games and just about any public event in our community that matters. Rocco, because of the countless times he has sung our national anthem at local, national, and international events, has truly earned the title of ''Star-Spangled Banner Singer of the Millennium.'' Rocco, an Italian American whose family is from Italy's east coast, grew up in Cleveland and started his vocal training in opera. He first performed the national anthem publicly in 1974 at an Indians-Orioles game. Since that time, he has become a reg- ularly featured national anthem singer for both American and National League baseball games, games played in Cincinnati, Cleveland, New York, for the Baltimore Orioles, Oakland A's, Kansas City Royals, Toronto Blue Jays, LA Dodgers. The list goes on and on. Rocco has also had the honor of performing the national anthem for Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. Rocco's list of accomplishments doesn't end there. He was awarded the United States civilian Purple Heart for inspiring patriotism for his exceptional performance of the national anthem, and he has performed the anthem on national television for events such as the NBC game of the week, an Amer-ican League playoff game, the 1981 All Star game, and countless other tele-vised sporting events. Dubbed by Peo-ple's magazine as one of the best an-them singers in America, he is the first singer to perform the national anthem for the Baseball Hall of Fame in Coop-erstown, NY. He is a featured singer for the Indians, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Cleveland Force, and he is the perma-nent singer of the anthem for the Foot-ball Hall of Fame ceremonies in Can-ton, OH. While Rocco is most known for his rendition of the national anthem, he is also a featured singer of other nations' anthems. He has sung the Polish na-tional anthem for Polish boxing team matches, the Hungarian national an-them for Hungarian basketball games, the Italian national anthem for Italian soccer team contests, and the Israeli national anthem for the appearance of the Assistant Prime Minister of Israel in Cleveland. Needless to say, Rocco Scotti is an American icon. His voice, indeed, is a national treasure. What impresses me most about Rocco isn't so much his beautiful voice, although it is beau-tiful, but his amazing attitude about his heritage, his life here in this great country. Rocco said the following to me once: I am very, very proud that with my Italian heritage, God has given me the honor of per-forming our country's greatest and most meaningful song. For that kind of patriotism, love of country, I wish to say thank you to Rocco. I am proud to call him the Star- Spangled Banner Singer of the Millen-nium. f TRIBUTE TO THE GENERAL DAN- IEL ''CHAPPIE'' JAMES AMER-ICAN LEGION AUXILIARY UNIT 776 Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, today I would like to honor a great volunteer organization from my home state of Ohio\u2014The General Daniel ''Chappie'' James American Legion Auxiliary Unit 776. Based in the city of Dayton, this organization and its members were rec-ognized recently by USA Weekend magazine for their participation in the ''Ninth Annual Make a Difference Day,'' which is the largest national day of helping and volunteerism. To be recognized by USA Weekend, an organization must demonstrate great efforts and achievements in the areas of volunteerism and community service. The General Daniel ''Chappie'' James American Legion Auxiliary Unit 776 certainly has done that. One of its members, Mrs. Ola Matthews, heard that foster children around the Dayton community must carry their belong-ings through the foster care system in plastic trash bags. This worried her greatly. So, she set about to help these children. Under her leadership, the members of Unit 776 conducted fund-raisers to buy luggage and collected luggage from community donors. On October 23, 1999, the members of Unit 776 delivered the fruits of their effort\u2014 over 1,000 pieces of luggage, plus toiletries, underclothes, and baby sup-plies\u2014to the Montgomery County Chil-dren's Services in Dayton. This is a re-markable achievement and one dem-onstrating great selflessness and gen-erosity. It is actions like these\u2014an or-ganization helping those in its commu-nity\u2014that makes Dayton such a great city. Mr. President, one young member of this organization, in particular, has made outstanding contributions to her community. Shatoya Hill, who has been involved in Unit 776 most her life, VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7645 July 26, 2000 has just been awarded a $6,000 scholar- ship for her community service and academic achievements. She has been Junior President of the organization for over 5 years. During this time, she has organized and participated in many fundraisers, from helping veterans to delivering food baskets to the needy during Christmas. The Dayton Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta, a public service so-rority, awarded the scholarship, which is presented to young women who have excellent academic records, possess high moral character, participate in their church and community, and have interest in higher education. Shatoya certainly exhibits all of these positive qualities. It is great to see Ohio youths working hard for their communities and being recognized for their achieve-ments. Congratulations Unit 776 and con- gratulations Shatoya! Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f EXPLANATION OF ABSENCE Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent today for roll-call vote No. 228, on the motion to in-voke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 2507, the intelligence authoriza-tion bill. I was in Minnesota visiting with my constituents in Granite Falls who were victims of a tornado which struck the city last night and caused severe damage and some loss of life. Had I been present, I would have voted aye on the motion. f MIDDLE EAST PEACE Mr. BROWNBACK. As recently as this morning, upon Chairman Arafat's arrival back in Gaza, Arafat said: There is an agreement between us and the Israeli government made in Sharm-El- Sheikh that we continue negotiations until Sept. 13th, the date for declaring our inde-pendent state, with Jerusalem as its capital, whether people like it or not. By itself, the threat undermines con- fidence in the Palestinians' commit-ment to the peace process and, in ef-fect, would abrogate the foundation of the Oslo accords that all outstanding final status issues will be resolved through negotiations. Allow me, for a moment, to review the history here. More than 50 years ago, the United Nations created two states: Israel and Palestine. The cre-ation of a homeland for the Jews in Israel was unacceptable to the Arabs, and five Arab states attacked the newly created state. When all was said and done, Israel was a reality, and the nominal Palestine ended up in the hands of Jordan. We never heard about Jerusalem then. In fact, when the PLO was created in 1964, Jerusalem was never even men-tioned. When Jordan lost the West Bank and Jerusalem in 1967, then the question of Palestine and Jerusalem became im-portant once again. In fact, we are told that the reason Yasser Arafat walked out of Camp David was because he did not get all of east Jerusalem and the Old City. In other words, when Arafat did not get through the peace process what he could not get through war, he decided to walk away from peace. One thing has become clear to me in the last few years. The Oslo agreement was nothing less than an admission on the part of the Palestinians and the PLO that Israel would never be de-feated in war. The Palestinians entered into a peace process because they had no other choice. Now I am forced to question just how committed they are to that process. If the aim is to win through negotiations what they could not through war, then what kind of a process is it? There are no ambiguities here: Either the Palestinians are committed to the process, and to a negotiated outcome, or they are not. Arafat's threat to de-clare a Palestinians state on Sep-tember 13, 2000 is an abrogation of the peace process, and as such, an abroga-tion of any understanding with the United States regarding the PLO and Mr. Arafat as negotiating partners. U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is predicated upon good faith negotia-tions in a peace process. Nothing else. Nothing. For those that have some doubt, I remind them that as far as U.S. law is concerned, the Palestine Liberation Organization is a terrorist organization. I and many of my colleagues have al- ways stood ready to accept the out-come of a negotiated peace between Israel and the Palestinians. We have done so reluctantly, because of fears about what a Palestinian state would do, how it would survive, about the commitment to democracy, and real fears about terrorism. We will not stand idly by and accept a non-negotiated solution, contrary to the Oslo Accords, contrary to the spirit of a peace process. Should Mr. Arafat go forward and declare a Palestinian state, the bill that Senator S CHUMER and I are offering today will preclude the expenditure of funds to recognize that state and preclude further assist-ance to any Palestinian governing enti-ty. It instructs the President to use the voice and vote of the United States in the United Nations bodies to stop rec-ognition or admission of a Palestinian state. I hope Chairman Arafat chooses the path of peace. However, if he does not, this legislation makes very clear that the relationship between the U.S. gov-ernment and the Palestine leadership will change. We will not recognize the unilater- ally declared Palestinian state and we will strongly urge all others not to do so. Either there is peace through a process or there can be no peace. If that is what Yasser Arafat wants, it is a terrible crime against the Palestin-ians, and a mistake that history will not forget. f CELEBRATING THE 10TH ANNIVER- SARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT: A DECADE OF PROGRESS Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, over the past month and a half, a brightly lit torch has made its journey through nineteen cities, carrying with it each step of the way the passionate and able spirit of the disability community. Today the torch arrives at its 20th stop along the way, our Nation's Capital, to mark the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabil-ities Act. It is indeed an important day in our Nation's long history. President Franklin Roosevelt once said, ''No country, no matter how rich, can afford to waste its human re-sources.'' I am proud to say that the Americans with Disabilities Act lives up to President Roosevelt's objective. For 10 years now, this momentous, landmark civil rights legislation has opened new doors to the disability community. It has, at long last, al-lowed handicapped individuals the op-portunity and the access to have their potential recognized both inside the workplace and outside in the commu-nity. It has brought the American dream within reach for the millions of American families with disabled mem-bers. Over the past decade of the ADA, we have seen dramatic changes through-out the nation in equal opportunity\u2014 from new and advanced technology al-lowing for greater public accommoda-tion at places of business and in com-mercial establishments, to state and local government services and activi-ties, to transportation and tele-communications technology for dis-abled Americans. Look around today\u2014 people with disabilities are partici-pating to a far greater extent in their communities and are living fuller, more productive lives as students, workers, family members, and neigh-bors. They are dining out; cheering at football games and other sporting events, often even playing sports them-selves; going to the movies; partici-pating in state, local, and Federal Gov-ernment; and raising families of their own. It is evident that that the capability of this community far outshines the challenges of a disability. I am proud that the ADA has been particularly in-strumental in removing many of the barriers that would otherwise impede the ability and success of the disability community. Take the example of Casey Martin, the professional golfer from Orgeon with a rare disability that sub-stantially limits one's ability to walk. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7646 July 26, 2000 Casey had long dreamed of playing in a PGA tour, but, because of his dis-ability, Casey encountered a huge bar-rier. In these tournaments in which Casey wanted to play, the tour would not allow the use of a golf cart. When a Federal trial court in Oregon found that the PGA tour is a ''public accom-modation'' and should modify their policy of no golf carts to accommodate Casey's disability, his vision became a reality. According to Casey, ''Without the ADA I never would have been able to pursue my dream of playing golf professionally.'' While for Casey Martin the ADA has meant achieving his most far-reaching goal, for other disabled Americans, the ADA has simply allowed them to live each new day with a little more ease and comfort. To name just a few areas in which the ADA has facilitated progress\u2014access to restaurants and public restrooms, modifications to the aisles and entrances of supermarkets, assistive listening systems at places like Disney World and many theaters for the deaf and hard of hearing, and large print financial statements for those with vision impairments. Mr. President, these are the kind of simplicities in life that those without disabilities expect and take for grant-ed, and because of the ADA, they have now come to be a part of the disability community's life too. Just as the barriers that continue to face each of us in life take many years to craft, they take many years to con-quer. Together, we must find the strength and the courage to pick our battles. I commend the disability com-munity today on their passion and their vigilance, and I celebrate with you on this 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act for all that this day has brought to your com-munity, and for all that it will con-tinue to bring in the years ahead. Let today recommit each of us to the ADA for all Americans. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 10 years ago today Congress passed land-mark civil rights legislation, based on the fundamental principle that people should be measured by what they can do, not what they can't do. With the passage of the Americans with Disabil-ities Act, America began a new era of opportunity for the 47 million disabled citizens who had been denied full and fair participation in society. We continue to build in Congress on the bipartisan achievements of the ADA. I'm gratified by President Clin-ton's strong endorsement today of the Grassley-Kennedy Family Opportunity Act now pending in Congress. The goal of our legislation is to remove as many of the remaining barriers as possible that prevent families raising children with disabilities and special health needs from leading full and productive lives. No family in this country should ever be put in a position of having to choose between a job and the healthcare their disabled child needs. The Family Opportunity Act ensures that no family raising a child with spe- cial needs would be left out and left be-hind. For generations, people with disabil- ities were viewed as citizens in need of charity. Through ignorance, the nation accepted discrimination and suc-cumbed to fear and prejudice. The pas-sage of the ADA finally moved the na-tion to shed these condescending and suffocating attitudes\u2014and widen the doors of opportunity for people with disabilities. Today we see many signs of the progress that mean so much in our on-going efforts to see that persons with disabilities are included\u2014the ramps be-side the stairs, the sidewalks with curbs to accommodate wheelchairs, the lifts for helping disabled people board buses. Whether they are family members, friend, neighbors, or co-workers, per-sons with disabilities are no longer sec-ond class citizens. They are dem-onstrating their abilities and making real contributions in schools, in the workplace, and in the community. Peo-ple with disabilities are no longer left out and left behind\u2014and because of that, America is a stronger, better and fairer country today. As the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the many disabled persons who worked so long and hard and well for its passage continue to remind us, equal opportunity under the law is not a privilege, but a fundamental birth-right of every American. f INFECTIOUS DISEASE SURVEILLANCE Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to briefly discuss a GAO report that was released earlier this week to be sure that other Senators are aware of. The report, entitled ''Global Health: Framework for Infectious Disease Sur-veillance,'' was commissioned by Sen-ator M CCONNELL and myself, and Sen- ators F RIST and F EINGOLD . It inves- tigates the existing global system, or network, of infectious disease surveil-lance, and will be followed by a second report which analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of this network and make recommendations for strength-ening it. We requested this report in response to a growing concern among public health officials about the inability of many countries to identify and track infectious diseases and respond promptly and effectively to disease outbreaks. In fact, the World Health Assembly determined in 1995 that the existing surveillance networks could not be considered adequate. By way of background, the term ''surveillance'' covers four types of ac-tivities: detecting and reporting dis-eases; analyzing and confirming re-ports; responding to epidemics; and re-assessing longer-term policies and pro-grams. I will touch on these categories in a bit more detail, as they illustrate the need for reform. In the detection and reporting phase, local health care providers diagnose diseases and then report the existence of pre-determined ''notifiable'' diseases to national or regional authorities. The accurate diagnosis of patients is obvi-ously crucial, but it can be very dif-ficult as many diseases share symp-toms. It is even more difficult in devel-oping countries, where public health professionals have less access to the newest information on diseases. In the next stage of surveillance, dis- ease patterns are analyzed and re-ported diseases are confirmed. This process occurs at a regional or national level, and usually involves lab work to confirm a doctor's diagnosis. From the resulting data, a response plan is de-vised. Officials must determine a num-ber of other factors as well, such as the capability of a doctor to make an accu-rate diagnosis. Unfortunately, in many developing countries this process can take weeks, while the disease con-tinues to spread. When an epidemic is identified, var- ious organizations must determine how to contain the disease, how to treat the infected persons, and how to inform the public about the problem without caus-ing panic. Forty-nine percent of inter-nationally significant epidemics occur in complex emergency situations, such as overcrowded refugee camps. Chal-lenges in responding to epidemics are mainly logistical\u2014getting the nec-essary treatment to those in need. Finally, in assessing the longer-term health policies and programs, surveil-lance teams can provide information on disease patterns, health care prior-ities, and the allocation of resources. However, information from developing countries is often unreliable. I want to emphasize two points. The first is that all the activities that I have just described are done by what WHO calls a ''network of networks.'' There is, in fact, no global system for infectious disease surveillance. Let me repeat, for anyone who thinks there is some centrally-managed, well-orga-nized global system, there is not. Rath-er, what exists is a loose network, a patch-work quilt of sorts, involving the UN, non-governmental organizations, national health facilities, military lab-oratories, and many other organiza-tions, all of which depend upon each other for information, but with no standardized procedures. The second point is that in countries where a tropical climate fosters many infectious diseases, one also finds the least amount of reliable data. If we as a country, or we as a global commu-nity, are committed to eradicating the deadliest diseases, building the capac-ity for effective surveillance in the de-veloping countries is where we need to focus our attention. The sequel to this report is due to be released by the GAO in a few months. It will assess the strengths and weak-nesses of this loosely-organized surveil-lance system, and make recommenda-tions for strengthening it. We need to VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7647 July 26, 2000 be able to accurately diagnose diseases, and quickly transmit the information to the global health community. I urge other Senators to read this first report. This is an issue that has received far too little attention, and which directly affects the health of every American. Any disease, whether HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, or others as yet unknown, which could infect and kill millions or tens of millions of peo-ple, is only an airplane flight away. Accurate surveillance, which is the first step to an effective response, is critical. Yet today we are relying on a haphazard network of public, private, official, and unofficial components of varying degrees of reliability, patched together over time. It is a lot better than nothing, but the world needs a uniformly reliable, coordinated system with effective procedures that apply the highest standards. I look forward to GAO's next report, and its rec-ommendations for action. f CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM Mr. M CCONNELL. As chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, which has jurisdiction over the campaign fi-nance issue, and one who has been rather closely identified with the spir-ited debate in this arena over the past decade, I wholeheartedly support put-ting S. 1816, the Hagel-Kerrey bill, on the Senate Calendar. That is not to say I would vote ''aye'' were there a rollcall vote on the bill as it is currently drafted. Senator H AGEL 's legislation was the backdrop for a comprehensive series of hearings held by the Senate Rules Committee between March and May of this year. The final hearing featured the testimony of Senator H AGEL , Sen- ator K and Senator L ANDRIEU . An impressive, to say the least, bipar-tisan lineup of Senators bravely step-ping into the breach separating those who persist in trotting out the old, bla-tantly unconstitutional campaign fi-nance schemes of the past, from others like myself who firmly believe that the first amendment is America's greatest political reform and must not be sac-rificed to appease a self-interested edi-torial board at the New York Times. The Senator from Nebraska has taken what for the past couple of years has been the biggest bone of contention in the campaign finance fight in the Senate\u2014party soft money\u2014and essen-tially split the difference between the opposing camps. Rather than an uncon-stitutional and destructive provision to entirely prohibit non-federal activity by the national political parties, Sen-ator H AGEL has crafted a middle ground in which the party so-called ''soft'' money contributions would be capped. Yet, even a cap raises serious constitutional questions and would surely be challenged were one to be en-acted into law. Nevertheless, the Hagel-Kerrey approach is more defen-sible and practicable than outright pro-hibition. Coupled with the party soft money cap in the Hagel-Kerrey bill is an ame-liorative and common sense provision to update the hard-money side of the equation by simply adjusting the myr-iad hard money limits to reflect a quarter-century of inflation. An infla-tion adjustment of the hard money limits is twenty-five years overdue. Candidates, especially political out-siders who are challenging entrenched incumbents, are put at a huge dis-advantage by hard money limits frozen in the 1970s. The lower the hard money limits are, the more that insiders with large con-tributor lists are advantaged. Incum-bents and celebrities who benefit from the outset of a race with high name recognition among the electorate also start way ahead of the unknown chal-lenger. The greatest beneficiary of low hard money limits are the millionaire and billionaire candidates who do not have to raise a dime for their cam-paigns because they can mortgage the family mansion, cash out part of their stock portfolio and write a personal check for the entire cost of a cam-paign. As hard money limits are eroded through inflation and non-wealthy can-didates are further hampered, election outcomes are ever more likely to be de-termined by outside groups whose inde-pendent expenditures and issue advo-cacy are completely unlimited. That is ''non-party soft money.'' Mr. President, absent from the at- tacks on party soft money is any ac-knowledgement by reformers that the proliferation is linked to antiquated hard money limits which control how much the parties can take from indi-viduals and PACs to pay for federal election activities. It stands to reason that hard money limits frozen in 1974 and thereby doomed to antiquity are going to spawn an explosion of activity on the soft money side of the party ledger. It also is not coincidence that in- creased soft money activity in the past decade corresponded to vastly in-creased competition in the political arena. We are amidst the third fierce battle for control of the White House in the past decade And every two years America has witnessed extremely spir-ited contests over control of the Con-gress. Democrats who had been exiled from the White House since Jimmy Carter's administration at long last got to spend some quality time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and are not keen to give that up. Republicans, after four decades in the minority, got to savor the view from the Speaker's office in the House of Representatives and would like very much to keep it. And we have seen more than a little action on the Senate-side of the Capitol. Reformers look upon all this activity over the past decade in abject horror, seeing only dollar signs and venal ''spe-cial interests.'' I survey the same era and see an extraordinary period in which every election cycle featured a tremendous and beneficial national war of ideas over the best course for our nation to pursue in the coming years and which party could best lead America on that path. All signs, Mr. President, of a com- petitive, healthy, and vibrant democ-racy. While I strongly support the hard money adjustments in the Hagel- Kerrey bill, I remain concerned by the bill's silence in an area sorely in need of reform: Big Labor soft money. The siphoning off of compulsory dues from union members for political activity with which many of them do not agree is a form of tyranny which must not be permitted to continue. Senate Repub-licans have fought hard, and unsuccess-fully, to protect union workers from this abuse. Democrats are understand-ably and predictably loathe to risk any diminution of Big Labor's contribu-tions which may result from freeing the rank-and-file union members from forced support of Democratic can-didates and causes, but the absence of reform in this area is unacceptable. Big Labor soft money and involuntary po-litical contributions must be part of any comprehensive reform package which ultimately passes Congress. With those provisos and a few others, I will close by again commending the Senator from Nebraska from his will-ingness to wade in a big way into one of the most contentious issues before Congress\u2014an issue in which all Mem-bers of Congress have a vested personal interest but that affects not just us but every American citizen and group that aspires to participate in the political process. That is why the U.S. Supreme Court will be the final arbiter of any campaign finance bill of consequence. And those are the reasons we should continue to be cautions and delibera-tive as the effort continues for a non-partisan, constitutional campaign re-form package. Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today we have moved a step closer to imple-menting comprehensive campaign fi-nance reform. With the help of Senator M ITCH MCCONNELL , Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, the Open and Accountable Campaign Financing Act of 2000 will soon be placed on the Sen-ate Calendar, ready for debate by the full Senate. I introduced the Open and Account- able Campaign Financing Act of 2000 along with Senators B OBKERREY , SPENCE ABRAHAM , MIKEDEWINE, SLADE GORTON CRAIG THOM- OHN BREAUX , K AY BAILEY HUTCHISON , and G ORDON SMITH as a bi- partisan approach to campaign finance reform because we felt it was a com-mon sense, relevant and realistic ap-proach. We offered it as a bipartisan compromise to break the deadlock on campaign finance reform and to bring forth a vehicle that could address the main holes in the net of our current system. The purpose of our legislation is to place more control and responsibility VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7648 July 26, 2000 for the conduct of campaigns directly in the hands of the candidates. Our leg-islation is not the solution for all of the problems now facing us, but I be-lieve it is a good solid beginning to ac-complish meaningful campaign finance reform. After a series of hearings in the Sen- ate Rules Committee this spring on campaign finance reform, we will now be able to put a bill on the Senate Cal-endar that has bipartisan support. If we are to accomplish comprehensive re-form this year, bipartisan support is essential and our bill has that support. While I was very pleased with the re- cent vote in Congress to require disclo-sure for the '527' organizations, that bill is not a substitute for more com-prehensive campaign finance reform. It is a solution for a small problem. We need to continue to fight for campaign finance reform that is broader and more comprehensive. I am hopeful that the full Senate will be able to debate comprehensive cam-paign finance reform legislation, in-cluding the Open and Accountable Campaign Financing Act of 2000, this year. We have an opportunity to achieve something reasonable and re-sponsible this year. Again, I would like to thank Senator M CCONNELL for holding hearings in the Rules Committee on campaign finance reform and helping move the process along. I look forward to working with him and all Senators interested in ad-vancing campaign finance reform. f VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Col-umbine tragedy, but still this Repub-lican Congress refuses to act on sen-sible gun legislation. Since Columbine, thousands of Amer- icans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. July 26: Frederick Branch, 17, Memphis, TN; Kenny Curry, 30, Chicago, IL; Mendell Jones, 17, Baltimore, MD; Eduardo Lezcano, FL; Andre Plaster, 52, Houston, TX; Mark Pringle, 18, Baltimore, MD; Carlton Valentine, 33, Baltimore, MD; Uniden-tified male, Detroit, MI. We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sen-sible gun legislation now. f RUSSIAN WARHEADS/DOMESTIC SECURITY Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two issues of great importance to our national secu- rity and our energy security\u2014the agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation which pro- vides for the conversion of Russian highly enriched uranium (HEU) derived from the warheads into fuel for civilian nuclear power plants, and the need for the United States to maintain a viable uranium enrichment capability. First, let me give you a bit of his- tory. In 1992, the Energy Policy Act estab- lished the United States Enrichment Corporation as a wholly-owned govern-ment corporation to take over the De-partment of Energy's uranium enrich-ment enterprise. The Corporation was to operate as a business enterprise on a profitable and efficient basis and maxi-mize the long-term valuation of the Corporation to the Treasury of the United States. The objective was to eventually privatize the Corporation as a viable business enterprise able to compete in world markets. Subse-quently, the Corporation was selected as Executive Agent for, and entrusted with, the responsibility for carrying out the Russian HEU Agreement. Enactment of the 1992 Act was the culmination of a decade of bipartisan effort spearheaded by Senators D OMEN - ICIand Ford. Extensive hearings were held in both the House and the Senate and the legislation garnered the strong support of the Bush Administration. Recognizing the complexity of pri- vatization and the national security implications of the Russian HEU Agreement, Congress enacted the USEC Privatization Act of 1996. The Act provided the mechanics for privat-ization, clarified the relationship be-tween a private USEC and the U.S. Government, and addressed concerns related to the implementation of the Russian HEU Agreement. The Corpora-tion was sold in July of 1998. Implementation of the Russian HEU Agreement has been important for the government and USEC. This govern-ment-to-government agreement facili-tates Russian conversion of highly en-riched uranium taken from their dis-mantled nuclear weapons into fuel pur-chased by USEC and resold for use in commercial nuclear power plants. The program is financed as a commercial transaction. Every day, new warnings are heard about the ability of one rogue state or some well-financed terrorist to obtain weapons-grade nuclear materials on the black market. The Russian HEU Agreement addresses those concerns by converting thousands of nuclear war-heads into fuel for electric power plants\u2014the quintessential swords to plowshares concept. In spite of some start-up problems, implementation of the Agreement has resulted in the con-version of the equivalent of nearly 4,000 nuclear warheads into fuel for U.S. commercial power plants. The process, as well as purchases and shipments to USEC, continues. From the outset, many felt there were built-in contradictions between the objectives of maintaining a viable domestic uranium enrichment capa-bility while controlling the disposal of former Soviet nuclear weapons. But, all things considered, the program to date has been a success. Without ques- tion our Nation's national security\u2014 our most important charge as law-makers\u2014has been enhanced by imple-mentation of this Agreement. Mr. President, the Russian HEU Agreement contributes to our Nation's security, but the Agreement also ad-versely affects the enterprise that makes this commercial solution to a national security problem possible. This difficulty was understood when the government adopted this program. Purchases of large quantities of Rus-sian weapons derived material result in growing effects on the companies in the private sector domestic nuclear fuel cycle. Our uranium mining, con-version, and enrichment industries have been affected. The result has been steadily declining market prices for all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle. USEC, its plant workers, and the communities dependent upon those plants are being hit especially hard. As Executive Agent, USEC has suffered substantial losses due to fixed price purchases from Russia as well as increased costs due to reduced levels of domestic production resulting from introduction of the Rus-sian material into the market. Earlier this year, and with the sup- port of the Administration, USEC had been negotiating with Russia to amend the Agreement to include market- based pricing. I have been advised that USEC closely coordinated its plans and intentions with the President's Inter-agency Enrichment Oversight Com-mittee at all phases of its discussions with the Russians. Yet, as USEC and the Russians were meeting in Moscow to sign the new Agreement, the Depart-ment of Energy, a member of the Over-sight Committee, prevented the signing at the last minute. I can not understand why the Energy Department would prevent the adop-tion of an amendment that would sta-bilize the Agreement through the re-maining thirteen years of the program. Reportedly the terms were acceptable to both parties. In addition, the Agree-ment would have protected the inter-ests of our own domestic nuclear fuel industry. As part of the Agreement, Russia wanted USEC to purchase com-mercially produced enrichment in addi-tion to the weapons derived enrich-ment. USEC negotiated terms con-sistent with a previous Administration approved program making it manda-tory that this additional quantity be matched with domestically produced enrichment. In addition, no additional natural uranium would be brought into the domestic market. The amendment to the Agreement was specifically crafted so that no damage would be in-flicted upon the domestic nuclear fuel cycle as a result of purchasing the ad-ditional material. The Department of Energy's action threatens to destabilize the agreement. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7649 July 26, 2000 Who knows how long the Russians will sit by without this Agreement. The Na-tional Security Council and the State Department and others on the Enrich-ment Oversight Committee have en-dorsed the signing of this Agreement. I strongly urge that it be completed. I suggest that those of us in the Con-gress who believe in the vital impor- tance of this Agreement express our concern to the Administration and de-mand that the Energy Department withdraw its objection and that the Agreement be speedily signed. As I mentioned, higher production costs, decreased demand, and lower world prices have hit USEC, our Na-tion's sole domestic uranium enricher, particularly hard. USEC's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the quarter ended March 31, 2000 noted that: ''In February 2000, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service revised their credit ratings of USEC's long-term debt to below investment grade. The revised rating gives USEC the ability to dis-continue its uranium enrichment oper-ations at a plant. USEC is evaluating its options; however, a decision has not been made as to whether to close a plant, which plant would be selected or the timing of any closure.'' Finally, on June 21, the Board of Directors of USEC Inc. voted to cease uranium en-richment operations in June 2001 at the Portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant in Piketon, Ohio, and to consolidate all enrichment operations at its Paducah, Kentucky production plant. USEC maintained that it could not sustain current operations at two production plants, each of which is currently oper-ating at only 25 percent of capacity. The company said that its production costs were too high and that the termi-nation of operations at Portsmouth would save upwards of $55 million in fixed costs annually. USEC's decision to close a plant comes as no surprise. For over a year, there has been speculation within the Clinton Administration, the energy in-dustry, the media and on Capitol Hill that USEC would be forced to consoli-date its uranium enrichment produc-tion. Mr. James R. Mellor, Chairman of USEC's Board of Directors was quoted in a news release as saying: ''The deci-sion to cease enrichment at one of our facilities was necessary given the busi-ness challenges facing the uranium en-richment industry . . . Mr. Mellor went on to say: ''Choosing to close the Portsmouth plant was an extremely difficult decision because of the impact it will have on the lives of many of our workers, their families and the com-munities surrounding the plant.'' USEC cited multiple factors in deter- mining which plant would close. Key elements in USEC's analysis included ''long-term and short-term power costs, operational performance and re-liability, design and material condition of the plants, risks associated with meeting customer orders on time, and other factors relating to assay levels, financial results, and new technology issues.'' I know that my colleagues from Ohio are deeply disturbed by USEC's deci-sion to close the Portsmouth plant. I also know that if the company had cho-sen to cease operations at Paducah, my friends from Kentucky would be equal-ly distraught. Plant closures are seri- ous matters, particularly when they are the mainstay of the local economy. The public record is clear that techno-logical advances in uranium enrich-ment were rapidly overtaking the gas-eous diffusion process as an economic method of enriching uranium. Make no mistake, the Portsmouth and Paducah gaseous diffusion plants were and con-tinue to be extraordinary engineering, design, and construction achieve-ments\u2014matched only by the dedication and skill of the men and women who have made the plants work\u2014work, 24 hours a day\u2014work, seven days a week\u2014work, continuously for over 45 years without a stop, without a break in service\u2014until now. It was inevitable that this would happen someday, but knowing that it will happen does not make it any easier. The only person who seemed to be caught by surprise and unprepared to deal with the closure was the Secretary of Energy. Certainly, he must have known that USEC was preparing to make an announcement. He must have been aware that, as part of the 1996 USEC Privatization Act, the Depart-ment of Energy\u2014not the company\u2014 would be responsible for decommis-sioning, decontamination and clean-up of the plants and the sites as well as for workforce disposition. In fact, in a June 19, 2000 letter to Mr. William H. Timbers, USEC's presi-dent and chief executive officer, the Secretary of Energy asked if the com-pany was planning to close either one of its uranium production facilities. In response, Mr. Timbers wrote on June 20, 2000, that ''during our last meeting, I indicated to you, and reiterated in subsequent meetings with your staff, that it is inevitable that USEC must close one of its enrichment facilities.'' Mr. Timbers added that ''During the last eight months, we have presented numerous proposals\u2014still pending be-fore you\u2014to accomplish [transition]. But, DOE has yet to make a decision. We have also engaged in discussions with PACE union leadership aimed at advancing these efforts. We are still ready and eager to translate these dis-cussions into actions and look forward to the prospect of working with DOE to adopt a program to minimize the em-ployment disruption associated with ensuring a financially sound USEC under today's market conditions.'' The next day, when USEC announced that its Board of Directors had voted to close the Portsmouth facility, the best the Nation's Secretary of Energy could come up with was the following statement: ''I am extremely dis-appointed by [USEC's] decision today to close the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth. First and foremost, I am very concerned about the effect this closure will have on USEC work-ers. Many of these men and women spent their entire working lives help-ing our nation win the Cold War. They deserve better treatment. . .'' For once, Secretary Richardson and I agree. The workers do deserve better. But rather than threatening USEC, as the Secretary of Energy did when he recommended ''serious consideration of replacing USEC as executive agent'' for the Russian HEU Agreement, he should have been drafting a plan to assist the workers in Portsmouth to make the transition from operating the Depart-ment of Energy owned gaseous diffu-sion plant to cleaning up the site. This is an environmental restoration mis-sion that is likely to take many years. We are all aware of the environmental contamination at the plants and the desperate need for action to restore them to reasonable environmental con- dition. When Congress created the United States Enrichment Corporation as part of the 1992 Energy Policy Act, and when we later passed the 1996 USEC Privatization Act, we recognized that a privately owned USEC could better re-spond to the needs of the marketplace and thereby sustain a viable domestic uranium enrichment capability. Now that USEC has taken what it believes is a necessary step to ensure that it can compete in the world uranium en-richment marketplace, the first re-sponse by the Secretary of Energy is to second-guess the company's intentions and actions. Apparently the Secretary would keep facilities open regardless of the fundamental laws of economics that are evident to even the most mod-est businesses. It has been suggested that the solu- tion is to nationalize USEC\u2014to have the government buy it back. I have no sympathy for such a proposal. While I am sympathetic to those who will be affected by the closure of Portsmouth, I do not believe that a return to the past is the remedy that will provide for a competitive domestic uranium en-richment capability in the future. I do not favor an appropriation of substan-tial sums, perhaps well over a billion dollars to buy USEC back, nor do I favor the then obligatory commitment to annually appropriate funds to make up for uneconomic operations. It has been only two years since we privatized USEC. On the one hand the Congress and the Administration made an extraordinary effort to provide a private USEC with a strong foundation for a successful private enterprise com-peting in world markets\u2014in the words of the '96 Act '' . . . in a manner that provides for the long-term viability of the Corporation . . .'' But at the same time, contradictory restraints imposed on the Corporation detract from its ability to compete. In retrospect, per-haps Congress and the Administration should not have placed so many bur-dens on USEC as it faced private sector VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7650 July 26, 2000 dynamics and demands. Ensuring that the vital national security interests of the United States are protected is paramount, but preserving the com-petitiveness of our domestic uranium enrichment capability\u2014at minimal costs to the federal government\u2014is im-portant too. We need to stop thinking of USEC as a Federal agency and re-spect it for what it is\u2014a private busi-ness enterprise. Challenges remain in the implemen- tation of the Russian HEU Agreement and the long-term viability of the do-mestic uranium enrichment enterprise. These have proven to be complex, and at times conflicting tasks, but I believe that the National interest more than justifies our continued efforts to see these programs through to a successful conclusion. As part of these efforts we should encourage the Clinton Adminis-tration to approve the market-based pricing amendment to the Russian HEU Agreement. Now is also the time to secure a future for the workers in Portsmouth who face plant closure. We need to help them achieve their third transition\u2014from Cold War patriots, to peacetime producers of fuel, to the task of environmental restoration Thank you, Mr. President. f OMNIBUS LONG-TERM CARE ACT OF 2000 Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the ''Omnibus Long-Term Care Act of 2000.'' This bill brings together very important initiatives for making long- term care more affordable for Ameri-cans. In particular, this bill contains a $3,000 tax credit for caregivers and a tax deduction for the purchase of long- term care insurance. There are over 22 million people pro- viding unpaid help with personal needs or household chores to a relative or friend who is at least 50 years old. In Indiana alone, there are 568,300 care-givers. The government spent approxi-mately $32 billion in formal home health care costs and $83 billion in nursing home costs. If you add up all the private sector and government spending on long-term care it is dwarfed by the amount families spend caring for loved ones in their homes. As a study published by the Alzheimers Association indicated, caregivers pro-vide $196 billion worth of care a year. As a member of the Special Com- mittee on Aging, I held a field hearing in Indiana on making long-term care more affordable. At this hearing, I learned first hand the importance of this tax credit. Jerry and Sue Cahee take care of Jerry's mother who has Alzheimers. At the hearing Jerry Cahee shared the following: ''Mother is a wonderful and friendly person to ev-eryone\u2014except her caregivers. We have discovered that life, aging, and illness are not fair. We have discovered that love is hard\u2014that love is not enough to make the difference. We know that memories are all that we have left of the happy times in Mother's life. To care for her, make her last days com-fortable, to meet her ever increasing medical needs, to offer her the security of a loving safe home, and to let her know that she is loved\u2014these things have become our purpose for living. The financial drain has been difficult, the emotional strains are enormous.'' Paul Severance, the Director of United Senior Action, a senior advo-cacy group in Indiana represented his constituency at the hearing when he stated ''The burden on families who are trying to provide long-term care at home is tremendous; they typically face substantial expenses for special care, such as nursing visits, they often have lost wages because of the demands of caring for a loved one; and there can be a great cost to their own health as a result of the constant demands of caregiving.'' In addition to the tax credit, a deduc- tion for the purchase of long-term care insurance makes it more affordable for Americans to purchase long-term care policies that can provide them with the coverage they will need. Congress needs to continue to explore ways in which to ensure long-term care options are available for all Americans. I am encouraged by the introduction of this bill and the bipartisan support it has received. It is my hope that we can work together to implement this legislation and make it more afford-able for seniors to receive long-term care. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. f FCC REGULATION OF PAY PHONES Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in the four years since the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, dra-matic changes have occurred in our telecommunications markets. We have seen competitive environments in such areas as wireless communication and long distance service. Advanced tele-communications services have great potential for deployment in the near term, if only the Federal Communica-tions Commission would more aggres-sively promote them. All of this change is occurring in the context of an explo-sion of information technologies and the Internet. Yet the '96 Act dealt with much more than the high tech changes we read so much about these days. The legislation was designed to transform the entire telecommunications industry under the leadership of the FCC, to the ben-efit of all consumers. And the Act was designed to ensure that all Americans could have access to the vast array of services the Act will stimulate. Today I would like to briefly address one aspect of the '96 Act that is often overlooked in the glamour of ''high- tech.'' Public payphones are a critical piece of this access. For millions of Americans, public payphones are the only access to the telecom network. And when the batteries or the signal for the wireless device fail, public payphones are a reliable source of inex- pensive access, in an emergency or oth-erwise. Public payphones are emerging as public information portals, true on- ramps to the information highway, available to anyone at anytime. In order to ensure that these instru- ments of public access would continue serving as gateways of last resort and continue evolving using new tech-nologies, the issue of adequate com-pensation for pay phone operators was addressed by the '96 Act. This require-ment of the '96 Act was designed to promote fair competition and benefit consumers by eliminating distorting subsidies and artificial barriers. How-ever, the law has not been successfully implemented, and I am calling on the FCC to act expeditiously to address this regulatory oversight. Payphones are an important segment of the tele-communications industry, especially in low income neighborhoods and in rural areas like those in my home state of Montana. Local telephone companies operated payphones as a legal monopoly until 1984, when an FCC ruling mandated that competitors' payphones be inter-connected to local networks. Still, local telephone companies were able to subsidize their payphone service in competition with independent payphones. The '96 Act was designed to change all of this. It was designed to create a level playing field between all competitors and to encourage the wide-spread deployment of payphones. It did this by requiring local telephone com-panies to phase out subsidies; by man-dating competitive safeguards to pre-vent discrimination by the ILECs and ensure fair treatment of competitors when they connect to local systems; and by assuring fair compensation for every call, including so-called ''dial around'' calls which bypass the pay phones' traditional payment mecha-nism. Yet the basic requirements of the '96 Act are not being implemented by the FCC to assure fair competition. Pay phone operators are not being com-pensated for an estimated one-third of all dial-around calls, particularly when more than one carrier is involved on long distance connections. An industry proposal to remedy this situation has been pending at the FCC for more than a year without any action being taken. And the FCC also needs to bring to a hasty resolution the issue of the appro-priate line rate structure for payphone providers. Today, there are about 2.3 million pay phones nationwide. While all payphones are threatened by the gaps in dial-around payments, 600,000 of them are independently owned and are under particularly intense pressure; many small payphone operators now find themselves being forced to pull payphones or go out of business alto-gether. They are also in need of cer-tainty regarding the rates they pay the telephone companies. This situation should not exist more than four years after the enactment of the 1996 legisla-tion. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7651 July 26, 2000 I hope the FCC will act quickly to as- sure adequate compensation for each call. I hope the FCC will take imme-diate steps to enforce the requirement for non-discriminatory and fair line rates. I hope the FCC will take those basic steps required by the 1996 law. Fair competition\u2014and the resulting benefits to consumers envisioned by Congress\u2014will not occur until these actions are taken. As Chairman of the Senate Communications Sub-committee, I will be carefully moni-toring actions taken by the FCC on these important issues in the weeks and months ahead. f THE BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT ACT OF 2000 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wanted to inform the Repubican leadership that the House of Representatives today passed the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, H.R. 4033, by an overwhelming vote of 413-3. I hope that the Senate will quickly fol-low suit and pass the House-passed bill and send it to the President. President Clinton has already endorsed this legis-lation to support our nation's law en-forcement officers and is eager to sign it into law. Senator C AMPBELL and I have intro- duced the Senate companion bill, S. 2413. Unfortunately, someone on the other side of the aisle has a hold on our bill. We have been working for the past week to urge the Senate to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, S. 2413. The Senate Judici-ary Committee passed our bill unani-mously on June 29. It has been cleared by all 45 Democratic Senators. But it still has not passed the full Senate. This is very disappointing to our nation's law enforcement officers who need life-saving bulletproof vests to protect themselves. Protecting and supporting our law enforcement com-munity should not be a partisan issue. Senator C AMPBELL and I worked to- gether closely and successfully with the Chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee in the last Congress to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 into law. Senator H ATCH is an original cosponsor this year's bill to reauthorize this grant program. Sen-ators S CHUMER , K OHL, T HURMOND , REED, J EFFORDS OBB, and ABRAHAM are also cosponsors of our bi- partisan bill. But for some reason a Republican senator has a hold on this bill to pro-vide protection to our nation's law en-forcement officers. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 40 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fa-tality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it. To better protect our nation's law enforcement officers, Senator C AMP- BELL and I introduced the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998. President Clinton signed our legisla-tion into law on June 16, 1998. Our law created a $25 million, 50 percent match-ing grant program within the Depart-ment of Justice to help state and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor for fiscal years 1999-2001. In its two years of operation, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program has funded more than 180,000 new bulletproof vests for police officers across the country. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the success of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million for fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by guaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receive the full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these smaller com-munities and by making the purchase of stab-proof vests eligible for grant awards to protect corrections officers in close quarters in local and county jails. More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the country face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during routine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential the we update this law so that many more of our officers who are risking their lives everyday are able to protect themselves. I hope this mysterious ''hold'' on the other side of the aisle will disappear. The Senate should pass without delay the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 and sent to the President for his signature into law. f THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, at the close of business yesterday, Tuesday, July 25, 2000, the Federal debt stood at $5,670,717,940,248.21 (Five trillion, six hundred seventy billion, seven hundred seventeen million, nine hundred forty thousand, two hundred forty-eight dol-lars and twenty-one cents). Five years ago, July 25, 1995, the Fed- eral debt stood at $4,940,346,000,000 (Four trillion, nine hundred forty bil-lion, three hundred forty-six million).

YOUNG Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good friend and fellow Kentuckian, Bill Young, in rec-ognition of his service and dedication to the state of Kentucky. As Bill steps down from a few of his many leadership positions, I pay tribute to him for his lifelong commitment to this region. Born in Lexington, he has always fo- cused on the state's higher education. Bill's many leadership positions, in-cluding Transylvania University Board of Trustees member and chairman of the board of Shakertown, have guided the growth and success of Kentucky. As he is known for his single-minded determination to help the future suc-cess of Kentuckians, he has left a leg-acy behind that would prove he is one of the state's greatest assets. No opportunity has been missed by Bill to continue Kentucky's prosperity. Beginning with investments in peanut butter that is now better known as Jif, his business endeavors started success-fully. With an interest in horses, he continued his success in the business world by becoming a prominent leader of thoroughbred racing. Over the years, he became a leading philanthropist by helping construct the YMCA located on Lexington's High Street, Shakertown, and the University of Kentucky's new William T. Young Library. He still con-tinues other projects for the commu-nity that are significant and meaning- ful to him. Kentucky would not be what it is today without Bill's leadership and guidance over the past years. Though Bill has stepped down for others to guide the future, Kentucky will feel the effects of his accomplishments for years to come. Thank you, Bill, for putting so much of yourself into this state to make it a better place for oth-ers. Your hard work and successes are admired, and they will continue to im-pact Kentucky for years to come. My colleagues join me in congratulating you on a job well done, and I wish you all the best for your future. f CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH- DAY OF COACH JEROME VAN METER Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I rise to celebrate the life and ac-complishments of one of West Vir-ginia's most esteemed citizens, Coach Jerome Van Meter. On August 15th of this year, Coach Van Meter will cele-brate his 100th birthday. A remarkable milestone for a truly remarkable man, Coach Van Meter's birthday provides a special opportunity for all of West Vir-ginia to join in thanking him for a life-time of service to our state. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7652 July 26, 2000 With a career that has spanned a cen- tury, there isn't much that Coach Van Meter hasn't accomplished. Known af-fectionately as just Coach to his many students, he led the Beckley Flying Ea-gles to three state championships in football, and six more in basketball. A member of the National High School Sports Hall of Fame, Coach was both a beloved teacher and principal and served on the faculty of Beckley Col-lege. In addition to the numerous hon-ors and awards he has received, Coach Van Meter holds the great distinction of being a surviving veteran of both World Wars. Today, however, the countless lives touched by Coach are his greatest leg-acy. The lessons he taught on the bas-ketball court and football field brought many victories, but the lessons of life he taught his players and students shaped their destinies in more profound ways. Dedication, hard work, compas-sion and dignity are the touchstones of Coach Van Meter's career, and his ex-ample continues to inspire us. Thank you, Coach, for the invaluable contributions you have made to the families and communities of West Vir-ginia. As you celebrate this very spe-cial birthday, you have my deepest ad-miration and gratitude. f A GREAT LADY DEPARTS Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on July 1, Mrs. Eusebia Ortiz Vera passed away in North Carolina. Born in 1912, she ar-rived in the United States from Cuba, appropriately, on the Fourth of July, 1954, poor and with young children to support. In America, she promptly seized the opportunity to build a new life, as all immigrants to the U.S. hope they can do. Eusebia worked very hard to ensure that her children prospered. She made certain, above all, that all of them re-ceived good educations. And those children who came to the United States did prosper, and become good citizens of the United States, going on to be a U.S. Ambassador to Honduras, a high school teacher, and a professor at the University of North Carolina. Among her grandchildren, Mr. Presi- dent, are two U.S. naval officers, a medical student studying to be a Navy doctor, two lawyers and an elementary school principal\u2014college graduates all. Each of them is a testament to a good life. When I read about her in The Char- lotte Observer, I felt a sense of pride in her story. It is not merely a testimony to her own character, discipline and strength. No, it is also a reflection of what America is all about for so many\u2014a land of opportunity and of hope. Mr. President, I ask that the July 3 article published by The Charlotte Ob-server be printed in the R ECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. The article follows: [From the Charlotte Observer, July Eusebia Ortiz Vera of Charlotte came from Cuba on July 4, 1954, in search of the Amer-ican dream. Like millions of immigrants who arrived before her, she was poor, but optimistic about the future. She had only one wish: for her children to become educated and success-ful Americans. When Vera, 87, died of natural causes Fri- day\u2014just days before Independence Day and the anniversary of her arrival in this coun-try\u2014it marked an end of a life that some say epitomized American patriotism. ''She was the original liberated woman,'' said Vera's daughter Miriam Leiva, after Vera's burial Sunday. ''She really wanted a better life for herself and her children.'' And Vera did attain that American dream. Born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in 1912, Vera moved to Cuba with her father and six sib-lings when she was just 4 months old. Her mother had died moments after she was born. Vera married a Cuban schoolteacher at 22. She was a housewife during her years in Cuba. The marriage that brought Vera three children ended in 1952. After the divorce, Vera was determined to give her children a better life than she had, family members said. Vera decided to move the family to Amer- ica, where she hoped her children would have greater opportunities. Leiva, 59, was 13 when her mother told her\u2014at a moment's notice\u2014 to pack a suitcase of her belongings. Leiva said she boarded a plane along with her mother, brother and two aunts en route to Miami. Her sister, Beatriz Manduley, 17 at the time, stayed in Cuba because she was married. ''We came to America for the same reasons as all immigrants, to better our family,'' said Leiva, a consulting professor at UNC Charlotte. The family could not speak English when they arrived, family members said. ''It was hard,'' Leiva said. ''The most dif- ficult part was all things we didn't under-stand.'' She said her mother did not learn the language until 10 years later when she took English classes at a local high school. The entire family shared a tiny one-room apartment, Leiva said. To make ends meet, Vera took a job as seamstress in the garment district of Miami. She never made more than 75 cents an hour, family members said. Despite the limited income and food, Vera still strived for her children to be successful. ''From the moment we came to the United States, she told us we were going to suc-ceed,'' said Frank Almaguer, Vera's son. Almaguer is now the U.S. ambassador to Honduras. Leiva said her mother prevented her from using a needle and thread because she didn't want her daughter to become a seamstress. ''Women would come to the house and ask, 'When is Miriam coming to the factory?' and mother will say 'No, Miriam is going to the university,''' Leiva said. Vera's dream came true in 1957 when Leiva enrolled at Guilford College in Greensboro. With scholarships, loans and help from local Quakers, Leiva was able to graduate in 1961 with a degree in mathematics. Almaguer graduated from the University of Florida in 1967. Manduley came to Miami in 1960. She received her master's degree from UNC Greensboro in 1973. All seven of Vera's grandchildren are college graduates. Vera lived in Miami until 1997, when health conditions caused her to move to a nursing home in Charlotte, close to Leiva. ''This is her legacy,'' said Leiva. ''Failure was simply not an option for us.'' HONORING JUDGE QUILLEN Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Delaware's most brilliant legal minds and genuinely al-truistic public servants\u2014the Honorable William T. Quillen. I have known Judge Quillen for 33 years, since I was an attorney fresh out of law school and looking for a job. As a 32-year old Delaware Superior Court judge he met with me and on blind faith recommended me for my first legal job. He has been a dear friend and confidant ever since. Over the past three decades, I have watched Judge Quillen with pride and admiration at-tain the greatest judicial heights any lawyer could ever strive for in Dela-ware, which is universally recognized\u2014 nationally and internationally\u2014as hav-ing one of the most reputable, intellec-tual benches bar none. He is known in my state affection- ately and respectfully as ''Judge,'' ''Chancellor,'' ''Justice,'' and ''Mr. Sec-retary of State.'' He nearly became Governor and was my recommendation to President Clinton in June, 1999 to serve on the United States Third Cir-cuit Court of Appeals. It was during a medical examination required for this position that his physician detected prostate cancer. For health reasons, we withdrew his name from consideration. I am happy to report that following treatment for prostate cancer, he is as healthy as ever, running 5K races like a man half his age. Now, in classic Bill Quillen altru- ism\u2014he says it's time to retire from the bench and make way for younger lawyers to serve as judges. Early in his career, Bill Quillen served in the United States Air Force as a judge advocate, then as a top aide for Delaware's Governor. His judicial career began in 1966 on the Superior Court, which is Delaware's primary trial court. In 1973, he was elevated and confirmed as Chancellor of Delaware's renowned Court of Chancery. Following a two-year experience as a private attorney with the Wilmington Trust Company, he again heeded the call for public service. In 1978, the Gen-eral Assembly had expanded Delaware's Supreme Court from three to five members, and the Governor called on Bill Quillen. He was confirmed unani-mously as a Delaware Supreme Court Justice. He served on the State's High-est Court for five years, before stepping down to run for Governor on the Demo-cratic ticket. In one of the rare in-stances when he did not achieve his goal, Bill Quillen was not bitter or dis-couraged. In 1993, he accepted Governor Tom Carper's call for continued public service to become Secretary of State. In a state that more than half of the Fortune 500 companies call home, Sec-retary Quillen made his mark on this prestigious office. But his heart remained in the law. In November, 1994, Governor Carper nomi-nated and the General Assembly unani-mously confirmed him to the Court where his storied career began\u2014the VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7653 July 26, 2000 Delaware Superior Court. As I said ear- lier, I believe our federal bench would have been enlightened by his experi-ence and brilliance, but for health rea-sons, this was not meant to be. What's even more striking than his distinguished legal career is Judge Quillen's love for history. He is a true Delaware historian, with long-time family roots in historic New Castle. His love and respect for the law, democracy and justice for all are unparalleled. Judge Quillen is recognized nation- ally for his extensive writings on Dela-ware's Court of Chancery, the history of Equity Jurisdiction in Delaware and the Federal-State Corporate Law Rela-tionship. His colleagues nationwide also have awarded him numerous pres-tigious awards, including the First Place Award for the 1980 Judge Edward R. Finch Law Day U.S.A. Speech, spon-sored by the American Bar Associa-tion, on the topic of ''Seven Percep-tions of Freedom.'' In June, 1998, he also received the ''American Judica-ture Society's Herbert Harley Award.'' Judge Quillen will continue to serve as a professor at the Widener Univer-sity School of Law and plans to spend more time with his wife of 41 years, two daughters and three grandchildren. I have no doubt his legal legacy, knowledge of Delaware, writing and speaking ability will continue to serve our State for many years to come. Judge Quillen is a proud graduate of Harvard Law School, and it was the Dean Emeritus of Harvard Law School\u2014Roscoe Pound\u2014who said: ''Law is experience developed by rea- son and applied continually to further experience.'' Judge Quillen's vast experience and reasoned principles applied as a mem-ber of Delaware's top three courts will forever leave its marks on our body of law in Delaware. Our State and our citizens are so much better for his serv-ice. So, Your Honor, May It Please The Court, respectfully accept this state-ment of profound gratitude and admi-ration. f TRIBUTE TO RON GIST Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and Phi Kappa Tau fraternity brother Ron Gist, as founder of Gist Piano Services, on the occasion of his success with his Louisville piano dealership. After attending the University of Louisville, Ron started his piano deal-ership with only $1000 and two used pi-anos in 1971. Many years later, after persevering through a tornado in 1974, a devastating fire that nearly de-stroyed his business, and the hardship of an unfortunate economic downturn, Gist Piano Services has grown to be-come one of Louisville's most highly regarded piano dealerships, restorers, and consultants in the region. As a natural salesman, Ron's success has led to profitable relationships with the Louisville Orchestra, Kentucky Center for the Arts, and Kentucky Fair & Exposition Center. Also, Ron is one of few in the country selected for the honor to represent Steinway pianos. Ron has also provided piano services to other prestigious performance venues and for popular entertainers like James Taylor and Carol King. Ron should not only be congratulated for his success with Gist Piano Serv-ices, but he should be recognized for his service to the community. He has dedi-cated himself to making a difference in people's lives through music. By cre-ating more avenues for young people to express themselves, like through play-ing the piano, children can learn how to imagine, create, and organize the power of music. These skills can later be used as key tools to succeed in the future as they enter adulthood. Thank you, Ron, for ensuring a better future for this state as the younger genera-tions are better equipped to lead Ken-tucky. Your hard work continues to display an unswerving commitment to the peo-ple of Kentucky and possesses the re-spect and gratitude of many in the community. The significant work which you and your wife Amanda have accomplished is appreciated by myself and the many others whose lives you have touched throughout your career. Ron, thank you and best wishes for many more years of success. Know that your efforts to better the lives of those in the region will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my col-leagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of your-self for so many others in Louisville, the state of Kentucky, and the entire music industry. f MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to the Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.

A bill to create a Pension Re- form and Simplification Commission to evaluate and suggest ways to enhance access to the private pension plan sys-tem; to the Committee on Health, Edu-cation, Labor, and Pensions. THE PENSION REFORM AND SIMPLIFICATION COMMISSION ACT Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President: I rise today to introduce legislation calling for the establishment of a Pension Re-form and Simplification Commission. The legislation derives directly from conversations I have had with constitu-ents and experts on three key issues. First, there is the problem related to the current cost and complexity of pri-vate pension plans. In my view current regulations place an unnecessary bur-den on small and medium business as they attempt to adopt pension plans. Indeed, even the most simple plans are often so complicated in form and func-tion as to be incomprehensive to an ev-eryday businessperson. Second, there is the problem involved in coverage. Although over-all pension coverage may be consistent over the last decade and the assets of private plans have been on the increase, my concern is with those individuals of low to moderate income who are being left out of the private pension plan equa-tion. As companies move toward cheap-er plans\u2014401(k)s being a salient exam-ple\u2014and feel less obligated to offer de-fined benefit-type plans, individuals who do not have the extra money to contribute to their pension plans are VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7657 July 26, 2000 unable to benefit from a plan's avail- ability. This is if a plan is available at all, and in many cases it is not. Third, there is the problem of what kind of private pension plans are best suited for the so-called ''New Econ-omy''. Clearly there is considerable de-bate as of late in terms of what kind of private pension plans should be offered so as to increase saving, decrease mo-bility, provide opportunity, enhance entrepreneurship, and so on, all of which is apparent in the rise of hybrid pension plans. My foremost concern here is that Congress now finds itself reacting to innovative private pension plans rather than being pro-active in their creation. Mr. President, in 1974, Congress passed the Employee Retirement In-come Security Act, known by most people by its acronym of ERISA, our intention at the time being twofold. First, we wanted to protect the assets held in private sector retirement plans. Second, we wanted to create uniform rules that govern how these plans will be implemented in each and every state. From most accounts we have accom- plished these two goals. There is no question that ERISA has flaws that must be addressed\u2014and I will discuss these in detail later\u2014but for all these flaws ERISA was extremely significant in that it reaffirmed the government's commitment to the importance of re-tirement plans for all Americans. Fur-thermore, it created a comprehensive framework in this country under which the expansion of private retirement plans could occur. Equally important, the mechanisms it established for per-sonal saving has added trillions of dol-lars in available investment capital over the last decade alone, fueling in a very tangible way the unprecedented economic growth that we are seeing right now. But for all the praise ERISA receives, it is also criticized widely and, in my opinion, correctly on a number of counts. For this reason, it is time to seriously re-evaluate whether it is ad-dressing the needs and concerns of all Americans. It is time to examine whether it fits the demands of a chang-ing, global, ''new'' economy. As a specific example of these prob- lems, the adoption of piecemeal, nar-row, and complicated statutes and reg-ulations in the 26 years since ERISA's implementation has made substantial portions of our retirement system inef-ficient, expensive, and oftentimes in-comprehensible to anyone wishing to use it. It is well-known that we con-tinue to add provisions and plans with no effort at all to make them inter-nally compatible. We may have a broad vision about what we want to do with retirement policy in this country, but we instead of revising retirement pol-icy in a comprehensive and strategic manner, we simply add new ideas and language incrementally, hoping they will appeal to businesses who wish to offer them to their employees. Sadly, the end result is that for many businesses the cost of compliance with ERISA regulations\u2014the adminis-trative and professional costs of quali-fication\u2014rival and even outweigh the costs of providing the benefits them-selves. This, in turn, has led to a deci-sion by many business owners that they can no longer afford to offer re- tirement plans to their employees, this in spite of their desire to do so. For these people, the current rules burden the system beyond the benefits they provide. This has to change. But the cost and complexity I have just mentioned has had a corollary ef-fect, that being a lack of access to pen-sion plans on the part of low- and mid-dle-income workers, women and mi-norities in particular. Rightly or wrongly, one of the foremost criticisms directed toward ERISA is that it has accelerated the demise of traditional defined benefit pensions and increased conversions to new forms of plans, spe-cifically defined contribution plans like 401(k)s. Employers oftentimes no longer feel it is their role to provide re-tirement income to their employees as they once did under defined benefit plans. Instead they make defined con-tribution plans available and then edu-cate employees as to how to save for themselves. The problem is that the retirement security of a great many workers now lies in their ability to contribute indi-vidually to these plans, and this is not always possible. Indeed, data suggests that if these individuals are able to save adequately at all, they do so late in their careers\u2014this after paying for their homes, their childrens' education, and other important spending prior-ities. Only then do they have the op-portunity to accumulate the money needed to supplement Social Security and carry them through retirement. But these are the lucky ones. The fact is a large portion of Americans simply no longer have the capacity to save, this in spite of living in a time of eco-nomic prosperity. This too needs to be changed. There is a third reason to re-evaluate ERISA, and that is that the dynamics of the New Economy demand a discus-sion of what retirement policies best serve the economic interests of the United States. For a good part of this century, private pension plans were seen by employers as a way to keep their workforce intact, their employ-ees' morale high, and devotion to the company constant. Employees stayed with companies because they identified with the company and were treated by employers as family. Continuity and connection were the primary motiva-tions for individuals as they considered a job. Recently, however, this rationale has changed, and has done so significantly. According to most analysts, the main determinant for most employees as they choose a job is personal develop-ment and professional growth, the feel-ing being that economic security is best attained by mobility\u2014moving from one job to another, increasing education, pay, and retirement savings as you go. Staying at one firm is still an ideal for some but it is not essential for many. Perhaps more importantly, given the dynamics of the New Econ-omy, it may no longer be practical to assume that you can find retirement security at a single firm. The bottom line, much as the recent debates over cash balance plans sug-gest, is that some very basic issues concerning pension policy are coming to the fore at this time, examples being the essence of the employer-employee relationship, the ability of companies to attract and maintain a skilled work-force, the benefits provided to short- and long-term employees, the advis-ability of worker mobility seen in the context of technological innovation and globalization, and so on. Here, we must confront the reality of political economic change, and do so quickly and coherently. But Congress is not doing that. As I stated previously, we are reacting to changes rather than planning for the future in a coherent and strategic man-ner. In my view, this is an extremely serious problem as it limits our ability to create the conditions necessary for national economic growth and indi-vidual economic welfare. As many of my colleagues know, the notion of a Pension Commission has been discussed and debated for a num-ber of years, but we have never placed it high enough on our list of priorities to address it with purpose. I would argue that we can no longer afford the luxury of contemplation, and the time to act is now. Failure to adjust our ex-isting policies to meet the challenges we face both now and in the future will result in several specific outcomes. First, it will mean that many work- ers will see their retirement expecta-tions fade or disappear. Second, it will likely mean that these individuals will be forced to rely on government spon-sored programs that are themselves fi-nancially overextended. Finally, it will mean that the capacity of U.S. firms to compete in the global marketplace will be diminished. In my view, none of these outcomes are acceptable. We sim-ply must become more thoughtful and pro-active. The bill I introduce today has a num- ber of purposes, but foremost among them is to establish an affordable, ac-cessible, equitable, efficient, cost-effec-tive, and easy to understand private pension plan system in the United States. It is designed to conduct a com-plete top-to-bottom evaluation of the current system and provide concrete recommendations as to how we can re-form it to serve the interests of em-ployers, employees, and the entire na-tion as a whole. This Commission will be composed of fifteen members, all with significant experience in areas related to retire-ment income policy. It is mandated that the activities of the Commission VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7658 July 26, 2000 will be concluded in a little over two years, with specific language to be pro-vided to Congress so that we can act on their recommendations immediately. To ensure that the activities of the Commission are not redundant or oth-erwise wasteful, it will be allowed to secure data from any government agen-cy or department dealing with retire-ment policy, and furthermore, may re-quest detailees from these agencies and departments on a non-reimburseable basis. The Commission will also be al-lowed to hold hearings, take testi-mony, and receive evidence as appro-priate from individuals who are able to contribute to this reform effort. This bill has been created after de- tailed discussions with a number of in-dividuals and organizations interested in retirement policy, from the Em-ployee Benefits Research Institute, to the Center for Budget and Policy Prior-ities, to the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans. Although all of the organizations involved have their own perspective on how retire-ment policy issues should be addressed in the United States, I have made a concerted effort to make their con-cerns compatible in this legislation. Significantly, all endorse the goals of the bill, as does the American Academy of Actuaries, the Executive Committee of the New York State Bar Association, and the Chairman of the Special Com-mission on Pension Simplification of the New York State Bar Association, Mr. Alvin D. Lurie. Mr. President, although there is much to recommend concerning our current pension system, it is common knowledge that this system is, in many instances, too complicated for partici-pants to understand, too difficult for businesses to use, and too inaccessible for individuals to join. We have added layer upon layer of legislation, to the point that the system is not only un-wieldy, but often of questionable pur-pose. We have reached the point that its complexity and inaccessibility is having a tangible impact on individ-uals and businesses alike. In my view, the status quo is no longer viable or acceptable. It is time to meet the challenge that faces us in a direct and strategic fashion. It is time to reform and simplify the system so that we have a effective mechanism that serves employers and employees alike and provides the means to guar-antee all Americans income security in their retirement years. Mr. President, the time to act is now. I ask my colleagues to recognize the importance of this legislation, and lend their support for its passage. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that a copy of the bill be included in the R ECORD at the conclusion of my statement. I also ask that the letters of support from the American Academy of Actuaries and the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans be included in the R ECORD immediately following my floor statement. There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 2922 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Pension Re- form and Simplification Commission Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) The creation and implementation of an affordable, accessible, equitable, efficient, cost-effective, and easy to understand sys-tem is essential to the continuity and viabil-ity of the current private pension plan sys-tem in the United States. (2) There is a near universal recognition in the United States that the laws that regu-late our pension system have become un-wieldy, complex, and burdensome, a condi-tion that hinders the achievement of in-creased saving and economic growth and cannot be fixed by ad hoc improvements to ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. (3) Significant and effective improvement of laws can only be accomplished through a coordinated, comprehensive, and sustained effort to revise and simplify current laws by a high-level body of pension experts, whose recommendations are then transmitted to Congress. (4) In recent years, the adoption of nar- rowly focused and increasingly complex stat-utes through amendment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (in this Act referred to as ''ERISA'') and the In-ternal Revenue Code of 1986 has impeded the efforts of employers and employees to save for their retirement and imposed significant challenges for businesses which consider es-tablishing pension plans for their workforce. (5) A high national savings rate can con- tribute significantly to the economic secu-rity of the Nation as it adds to available in-vestment capital, fuels economic growth, and enhances productivity, competitiveness, and prosperity. (6) The Federal Government can poten- tially increase the national savings rate through the implementation of policies that create an effective framework for the spread of voluntary retirement plans and the pro-tection of the private assets held in those plans. (7) Private pension plans have been, and remain, the single largest repository of pri-vate capital in the world and potentially act as a significant inducement for personal sav-ing and investment. (8) Pensions represent the only hope that most working Americans have an adequate supplement to social security benefits, and while the private pension system has been greatly improved since the establishment of ERISA, many inequities remain, and many workers are still not covered by the system. (9) It is essential that all Americans, no matter what their income security level, have the opportunity to achieve income se-curity in their retirement years. Currently, many tax and retirement incentives for pri-vate pension plans, while benefiting higher income employees who can often save ade-quately for their retirement, do not serve sufficiently the needs of low and moderate income workers. (10) The current pensions rules have tended to produce disparate coverage rates for low and moderate income workers. (11) The failure of the Government to mod- ify current pension policies will mean that many workers will be deprived of the options needed to save for their retirement and will, consequently, have their retirement expecta- tions minimized or eliminated. (12) The failure of the Government to re- dress the burdens imposed by over-regulation and complexity on employer-sponsored pen-sion plans will harm employees and their families. (13) The failure of the Government to re- dress the problems related to private pension plans may erode the ability of United States companies to compete effectively in the international market and result in a de-crease in the economic health of the Nation. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION. There is established a commission to be known as the Pension Reform and Sim-plification Commission (in this Act referred to as the ''Commission''). SEC. 4. DUTIES. (a) I NGENERAL .\u2014The Commission shall\u2014 (1) study the strengths, weaknesses, and challenges involved in the regulation of the current private pension system; (2) review and assess Federal statutes re- lating to the regulation of the current pri-vate pension system; and (3) recommend changes in the law regard- ing the regulation of the current private pen-sion system to mitigate the problems identi-fied under subsection (b), with the goal of making the system more affordable, acces-sible, efficient, less costly, less complex, and, in general, to expand pension coverage. (b) I SSUES TOBESTUDIED .\u2014The Commis- sion shall include in the study under sub-section (a) a consideration of\u2014 (1) the manner in which the current rules impact private pension coverage, how such coverage has changed over the last 25 years (since the enactment of ERISA), and reasons for such change; (2) the primary burdens placed on small and medium business in the United States regarding administration of pension plans, especially how such burdens affect the ten-uous position occupied by these organiza-tions in the competitive market; (3) the simplification of existing pension rules in order to eliminate undue costs on employers while providing retirement secu-rity protection to employees; (4) the primary obstacles to employees in gaining optimum advantages from the cur-rent pension system, with particular atten-tion to the small and medium business sec-tor and low and moderate income employees, including minorities and women; (5) the feasibility of providing innovative design options to enable small and medium businesses to be relieved of complex and costly legislative and regulatory burdens in matters of adoption, operation, administra-tion, and reporting of pension plans, in order to increase affordable and effective coverage in that sector, for low and moderate income employees, with emphasis on minorities and women; (6) the means of leveling distribution of private pension plan coverage between high wage earners and low and moderate income workers; (7) the feasibility of forward-looking re- forms that anticipate the needs of small and medium businesses in the United States given the obstacles and opportunities of the new global economy, in particular issues re-lated to the mobility and retention of skilled workers; (8) how pension plan benefits can be made more portable; (9) the means of achieving the expansion and adoption of pension plans by United States businesses, especially those employ-ing low and moderate income workers who currently lack access to such plans; VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7659 July 26, 2000 (10) the impact of expanding individual re- tirement account contribution limits and in-come limits on private pension plan cov-erage; (11) the provision of innovative incentives that encourage more employers to use exist-ing private pension plans; (12) the impact of qualified plan contribu- tion and benefit limits on coverage; and (13) any proposals for major simplification of Federal legislation and regulation regard-ing qualified pension plans, in order to ad-dress and mitigate problem areas identified under this subsection, with the goal of\u2014 (A) strengthening the private pension sys- tem; (B) expanding the availability, adoption, and retention of tax-favored savings plans by all Americans; (C) eliminating rules that burden the pen- sion system beyond the benefits they pro-vide, for low and moderate income workers, including minorities and women, with spe-cific emphasis on\u2014 (i) eligibility and coverage; (ii) contributions and benefits; (iii) minimum distributions, withdrawals, and loans; (iv) spousal and beneficiary benefits; (v) portability between plans; (vi) asset recapture; (vii) plan compliance and termination; (viii) income and excise taxation; and (ix) reporting, disclosure, and penalties; and (D) identification of the trade-offs involved in simplification under subparagraph (C).

J EFFBINGAMAN , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR SENATOR BINGAMAN : The American Academy of Actuaries would like to express its strong support for your idea of estab- lishing a national commission on pension re-form and simplification. The Academy has long advocated a comprehensive and coordi-nated approach to retirement policy. We be-lieve the establishment of a bipartisan com-mission of experts to analyze obstacles that weaken our private pension system and rec-ommend solutions is a positive first step. The Academy also believes that slight modi-fications to your proposal would make the commission more effective. The Academy commends you for recog- nizing that, because the laws that regulate our private pension system have become too complex, they discourage employers from helping their workers save for an adequate retirement. We strongly support the concept of a bipartisan commission of experts that will recommend specific ways to simplify the rules governing private plans, thereby en-couraging employers to expand coverage to more workers. The Academy believes that the commis- sion called for in your proposal could be made more effective if Congress was required to have an up-or-down vote on its rec-ommendations. Furthermore, we believe that, given the expertise available to the commission, it should be possible to formu-late a result in 12-18 months, rather than the 24 months specified in your legislation. Fi-nally, we would encourage the commission to examine pension changes in the context of a national retirement income policy, includ-ing Social Security, since major changes to the private pension system undoubtedly will affect Social Security. The Academy believes that creation of a national commission will be a positive first step toward our mutual goal of increasing pension coverage for Americans. We appre-ciate your recognition of the unique role that actuaries should play in such a commis-sion and look forward to providing any as-sistance that may be of benefit to you and your staff. Sincerely, J AMES E. T URPIN , Vice President, Pensions. APPWP, A SSOCIATION OF PRIVATE PENSION AND WELFARE PLANS , July 18, 2000. Pension Reform and Simplification Commis- sion Act Senator J EFFBINGAMAN , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEARSENATOR BINGAMAN : On behalf of the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans (APPWP\u2014The Benefits Association), I want to express our appreciation for your in-terest in, and support for, our nation's vol-untary, employer-sponsored retirement sys-tem as evidenced by the Pension Reform and Simplification Commission Act that you will soon introduce. APPWP is a public policy or-ganization representing principally Fortune 500 companies and other organizations that assist companies of all sizes in providing benefits to employees. Collectively, APPWP's members either sponsor directly or provide services to retirement and health plans that cover more than 100 million Americans. We appreciate your past and con-tinuing efforts to expand the private, vol-untary retirement system that currently en-ables millions of working Americans to achieve financial security in retirement. As you know, the employer-based retire- ment system provides an important source of income security for many Americans in re-tirement, and, in many respects, has been successful in meeting the challenges of an aging population. However, we recognize that public policy can build and expand on this success. Many employers, particularly small companies, find it difficult to establish retirement plans because of cost and admin-istrative complexity. As a result, many workers do not have access to private pen-sions and cannot save adequately for retire-ment. Moreover, our pension laws have not kept pace with the rapid developments in the business world. New technologies, inter-national competition, and many types of cor-porate transactions pose unique pension challenges that should be better accommo-dated by our nation's retirement policy. APPWP has consistently campaigned for ex-pansion and reform of the nation's pension laws with the express goals of expanding cov-erage, increasing portability, reducing com-plexity, and reflecting business realities. We are therefore pleased that you have made these goals the central objective of the com-mission you propose. In particular, APPWP commends you for putting the focus of pension reform on ex-panding coverage. You correctly note that our retirement system has become overly burdened with unwieldy and complex rules that have impeded expanded coverage and in-creased retirement security for all Ameri-cans. Your advocacy on behalf of the goals of coverage and simplification is an important step towards realizing a more secure retire-ment for all Americans. We look forward to working with you on these important issues. If we can be of fur-ther assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, J AMES A. K LEIN, President. By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. R OCKEFELLER , Mr. DASCHLE , Mr. M , , Mr. C ONRAD , Mr. G RA- HAM, Mr. B RYAN , Mr. K ERREY , Mr. R OBB, Mr. I NOUYE , Mr. L AU- TENBERG , Mr. A KAKA , Mr. S CHU- MER, and Mr. L EAHY ): S. 2923. A bill to amend title XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act to pro-vide for FamilyCare coverage for par-ents of enrolled children, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Fi-nance. THE FAMILY CARE ACT OF 2000 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the introduction of the Family Care Act of 2000, which takes the next logical step in assuring access by as many citizens as possible to affordable health insurance. I com-mend Congressman J OHN DINGELL and the rest of our colleagues for their fine work in crafting this legislation. The number of uninsured Americans is now more than 44 million, and the figure is rising by an average of one million a year. America is the only in-dustrial country in the world, except South Africa, that fails to guarantee health care for all it citizens. It is a national scandal that lack of insurance coverage is the seventh lead-ing\u2014and most preventable\u2014cause of death in America today. Three years ago, we worked together to create CHIP, the federal-state Chil-dren's Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage to children in families with incomes too high for Medicaid and too low to afford private health insurance. More than two million children have been enrolled in that program, and mil-lions more have signed up for Medicaid as a result of outreach activities. Soon, more than three-quarters of all unin-sured children in the nation will be eli-gible for assistance through either CHIP or Medicaid. But, despite this progress, the par- ents of these children, and too many others, have been left behind. The time has come to take the next step. The overwhelming majority of unin- sured low-wage parents are struggling to support their families. I will ask unanimous consent to insert a state-ment in the R ECORD from Patricia Quezada, a parent of three lovely girls, who would benefit from this legisla-tion. Parents who work hard, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, should be eligi-ble for assistance to buy the health in-surance they need in order to protect their families. Our message to them today is that help is on the way. Often, they work for companies which don't offer insurance, or they aren't eligible for insurance that is of-fered. Fewer than a quarter of the jobs taken by those who have been forced off the welfare rolls by welfare reform offer insurance as a benefit\u2014and even when it is offered too few companies make it available for dependents. The time has come to take the next step. The Family Care Act of 2000 will pro- vide with the resources, incentives and authority to extend Medicaid and CHIP to the parents of children covered under those programs. Coverage for parents also means bet- ter coverage for children. Parents are much more likely to enroll their chil-dren in health insurance, if the parents themselves can have coverage, too. This step alone will give to six and a half million Americans the coverage they need and deserve. The Family Care Act will also im- prove the outreach and enrollment for CHIP and Medicaid, and encourage states to extend coverage to other vul-nerable population, such as pregnant women, legal immigrants, and children ages 19 and 20. This program is affordable under cur- rent and projected budget surpluses. The Congressional Budget Office esti-mates that the cost will be $11 billion over the next five years. Last Monday, a majority of the Sen- ate voted in favor of this proposal as an amendment to the marriage penalty bill. We needed 60 votes, so it was not successful then, but we clearly have a bipartisan majority of the Senate. The bottom line is that we have the resources to take this needed step, and VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7661 July 26, 2000 end the suffering and uncertainty that accompanies being uninsured. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that statements and letters of support for this legislation be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: STATEMENT OF PATRICIA QUEZADA , JULY 21 , 2000 Good morning. I am Patricia Quezada. I am a mother of three girls (ages 9, 8 and 5). I work as a part-time parent liaison at Weyanoke Elementary School in Fairfax, Virginia. My husband is a self-employed gen-eral contractor. Because my husband is self- employed and I work part-time, our family does not have access to health insurance through our jobs. In the past, we were able to purchase pri- vate insurance that covered our family. But, in recent times, our family has been unable to afford the high rates because it came down to either paying for our home, trans-portation and other necessities\u2014including food\u2014or purchasing this costly insurance. On two occasions, the coverage was cancelled because we were unable to meet the pay-ments, which were required in advance. It was such a relief that my children are now able to receive coverage through Med-icaid and CMSIP, Virginia's SCHIP Program. (As a parent-liaison, part of my job has been to help other families sign up their children for health insurance.) I feel extremely fortu-nate that my children are now covered in case of an illness or accident, however I con-tinue to fear what could happen if my hus-band or I fall sick or have an injury. While we both do our best to take care of our health, we know how important it is to have health insurance coverage if we should need it. Thank you. CHILDREN 'SDEFENSE FUND, Washington, DC, July 21, 2000. Hon. E DWARD M. K ENNEDY , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR SENATOR KENNEDY : We are taking this opportunity to thank you for intro-ducing the FamilyCare Act of 2000 and to ex-press the strong support of the Children's Defense Fund for this bipartisan initiative to provide and strengthen health care coverage for uninsured children and their parents. Building on the successes of Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), this legislation will increase cov-erage for uninsured children, provide funding for health insurance coverage for the unin-sured parents of Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children, and simplify the enrollment proc-ess for Medicaid and CHIP to make the pro-grams more family friendly. We want to extent our appreciation to Sen- ators Chafee, Collins, Daschle, Lautenberg, Rockefeller, and Snowe for co-sponsoring this legislation in the Senate and to Rep-resentatives Dingell, Stark, and Waxman for taking the lead on this proposal in the House. We look forward to working with you for passage of the FamilyCare Act of 2000. Sincerely, G REGG HAIFLEY , Deputy Director Health Division. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHILDREN 'SHOSPITALS , Alexandria, VA, July 21, 2000. Hon. E DWARD KENNEDY , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. D EARSENATOR KENNEDY : On behalf of the National Association of Children's Hospital (N.A.C.H.), which represents over 100 chil-dren's hospitals nationwide, I want to ex- press our strong support for your introduc-tion of the ''FamilyCare Act of 2000.'' As providers of care to all children, regard- less of their economic status, children's hos-pitals devote nearly half of their patient care to children who rely on Medicaid or are unin-sured, and more than three-fourths of their patient-care to children with chronic and congenital conditions. These hospitals have extensive experience in assisting families to enroll eligible children in Medicaid and SCHIP. They are keenly aware of the impor-tance of addressing the challenges that states face in enrolling this often hard to reach population of eligible children. In particular, N.A.C.H. appreciates and strongly supports your efforts to simplify and coordinate the application process for SCHIP and Medicaid, as well as to provide new tools for states to use in identifying and enrolling families. In addition, N.A.C.H. ap-plauds your provisions that set a higher bar for covering children by: (1) requiring states to first cover children up to 200% of poverty and eliminating waiting lists in the SCHIP program before covering parents; and (2) re-quiring every child who loses coverage under Medicaid or SCHIP to be automatically screened for other avenues of eligibility and if found eligible, enrolled immediately in that program. N.A.C.H. also supports your legislation's provision to give states additional flexibility under SCHIP and Medicaid to cover legal im-migrant children. In states with high propor-tions of uninsured children, such as Cali-fornia, Texas and Florida, the federal gov-ernment's bar on coverage of legal immi-grant children helps contribute to the fact that Hispanic children represent the highest rate of uninsured children of all major racial and ethnic minority groups. Your provision to ensure coverage of legal immigrant chil-dren would be extremely useful in improving this situation. N.A.C.H. greatly appreciates all that you have done throughout your years of service, and continue to do, to provide all children with the best possible chance at starting out and staying healthy. We welcome and look forward to working with you to pass the ''FamilyCare Act of 2000.'' Sincerely, L AWRENCE A. M CANDREWS . MARCH OF DIMES, BIRTH DEFECTS FOUNDATION , Washington, DC, July 21, 2000. Hon. E DWARD KENNEDY , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEARSENATOR KENNEDY : On behalf of more than 3 million volunteers and 1600 staff mem-bers of the March of Dimes, I want to com-mend you for introducing the ''FamilyCare Act of 2000.'' The March of Dimes is com-mitted to increasing access to appropriate and affordable health care for women, in-fants and children and supports the targeted approach to expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program contained in the FamilyCare proposal. The ''FamilyCare Act of 2000'' contains a number of beneficial provisions that would expand and improve SCHIP. The March of Dimes strongly supports giving states the option to cover low-income pregnant women in Medicaid and SCHIP programs with an en-hanced matching rate. We understand that FamilyCare would allow states to cover un-insured parents of children enrolled in Med-icaid and SCHIP as well as uninsured first- time pregnant women. SCHIP is the only major federally-funded program that denies coverage to pregnant women while providing coverage to their infants and children. We know prenatal care improves birth out-comes. Expanding health insurance coverage for low-income pregnant women has bipar- tisan support in both the House and Senate. The March of Dimes also supports FamilyCare provisions to require automatic enrollment of children born to SCHIP par-ents; automatic screening of every child who loses coverage under Medicaid or SCHIP to determine eligibility for other health pro-grams; and distribution of information on the availability of Medicaid and SCHIP through the school lunch program. The March of Dimes also supports giving states the option to provide Medicaid and SCHIP benefits to children and pregnant women who arrived legally to the United States after August 23, 1996, and to people ages 19 and 20. We thank you for your leadership in intro- ducing the ''FamilyCare Act of 2000'' and are eager to work with you to achieve approval of this much needed legislation.

ASSOCIATION OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH PROGRAMS , Washington, DC, July 20, 2000. Hon. E DWARD KENNEDY , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEARSENATOR KENNEDY : On behalf of the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs (AMCHP), I am writing to express our support of the FamilyCare Act of 2000. We are particularly supportive of the provi-sions that allow states to include pregnant women in their SCHIP and Medicaid pro-grams. We are also pleased with the provisions giving states the flexibility to expand out-reach activities as well as moving towards greater equity in program payments. AMCHP represents state officials in 59 states and territories who administer public health programs aimed at improving the health of all women, children, and adoles-cents. In 1997, over 22 million women, chil-dren, adolescents and children with special health care needs received services, which were supported by the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant. We look forward to working with you and your staff on this bill. Sincerely, D EBORAH DIETRICH , Director of Legislative Affairs. AMERICAN DENTAL HYGIENIST ASSOCIATION , Washington, DC, July 24, 2000. Hon. E DWARD M. K ENNEDY , Hon. J AYROCKEFELLER , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR SENATORS KENNEDY AND ROCKE - FELLER : on behalf of the American Dental Hygienists' Association (ADHA), I write to express ADHA's support for the principles es-poused in the Family Care Act of 2000. This legislation is an important step toward the goal of meaningful health insurance cov-erage, including oral health insurance cov-erage, for all children and their parents. Regretfully, there is room for much im- provement in our children's oral health, a fundamental part of total health. Studies show that oral disease currently afflicts the majority of children in our country. Dental caries (tooth decay), gingivitis, and periodontitis (gum and bone disorders) are the most common oral diseases. The Public Health Service reports that 50% of all chil-dren in the United States experience dental caries in their permanent teeth and two- thirds experience gingivitis. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7662 July 26, 2000 The percentages of children with dental disease are likely far higher for the tradi-tionally underserved Medicaid-eligible popu-lation and for those eligible for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). For example, one of the most se-vere forms of gum disease\u2014localized juvenile periodontitis\u2014disproportionately affects teenage African-American males and can re-sult in the loss of all teeth before adulthood. If untreated, gum disease causes pain, bleed-ing, loss of function, diminished appearance, possible systemic infections, bone deteriora-tion and eventual loss of teeth. Yet, each of the three most common oral health dis-orders\u2014dental caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis\u2014can be prevented through the type of regular preventive care provided by dental hygienists. Despite the known benefits of preventive oral health services and the inclusion of oral health benefits in Medicaid's Early and Peri-odic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) program, only one in 5 (4.2 million out of 21.2 million) Medicaid-eligible chil-dren actually received preventive oral health services in 1993 according to a 1996 U.S. De-partment of Health and Human Services re-port entitled Children's Dental Services Under Medicaid: Access and Utilization. The nation simply must improve access to oral health services and your legislation is an important building block for all who care about our children's oral health, a funda-mental part of general health and well-being. We in the dental hygiene community look forward to working together toward our shared goal of health insurance coverage for all of our nation's families. Please feel free to call upon me or ADHA's Washington Counsel, Karen Sealander of McDermott, Will & Emery (202-756-8024), at any time. Sincerely, S TANLEY B. P ECK, Executive Director.

As reported by the Urban Institute in the July/August issue of Health Affairs, the pop-ulation of non-elderly uninsured grew by 4.2 million between 1994 and 1998. This hike in the rate of uninsured occurred among chil-dren and adults. In the same period, Med-icaid coverage fell from 10 to 8.4 percent, or about 3.1 million persons (1.9 million chil-dren and 1.2 million adults). Your legislation confronts and seeks to address these dis-turbing trends head on. The FamilyCare Act of 2000 not only ex- pands coverage to children\u2014it also enables states to provide health insurance to parents of children enrolled in CHIP and Medicaid. The bill creates new opportunities for states to cover immigrant children and pregnant women, and provides for the automatic cov-erage of children born to CHIP-enrolled par-ents, thereby enhancing presumptive eligi-bility. This legislation provides for the mutual re- inforcement of the Medicaid and CHIP pro-grams by integrating eligibility determina-tion and outreach efforts. A standard appli-cation form and simple enrollment process for both programs will raise the participa-tion rate for both programs. Finally, the bill provides grants to support broader outreach activities and employer subsidies to offer health insurance packages, thereby encour-aging joint public/private market innova-tions to reduce the population of uninsured. Stifling the growth in the rate of unin- sured and reversing the trend remain a top priority for the hospital community. Secur-ing the appropriate preventative care for these individuals will improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of further care, as the uninsured are more likely to be hospitalized for medical conditions that, initially, could have been managed with physician care and/ or medication. Thank you for taking the lead in address- ing the problem of America's uninsured. We look forward to working with you toward en-actment of this important legislation. Sincerely, K ERBKUHN, Vice President, Advocacy. FAMILIES USA, Washington, DC, July 17, 2000. Hon. E DWARD M. K ENNEDY , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. D EARSENATOR KENNEDY : We congratulate you on the introduction of your bill, the Family Care Act of 2000, which gives states the option to provide parents of children en-rolled in the Medicaid and CHIP programs with health insurance. We believe that your bill is a crucial next step in addressing the problem of our nation's uninsured, and we offer our unequivocal support. By covering parents through CHIP, the Family Care Act could provide health insur-ance to over four million previously unin-sured Americans. We believe this is a cost-ef-fective and efficient way to provide quality healthcare to low- and moderate-income working families. Children of CHIP-enrolled parents will be automatically enrolled at birth, but, equally importantly, research has shown that children are more likely to have health coverage when their parents are in-sured. This means that the Family Care Act could, in effect, cover many more Americans than the estimated four million. Addition-ally, the expansion of coverage to legal im-migrant children and pregnant women ad-dresses the needs of two particularly vulner-able groups. Again, we applaud your ongoing leadership in tackling the problem of the uninsured, and we support this important legislation. Please let us know how we can help you to enact this bill into law. Sincerely, R ONALD F. P OLLACK , Executive Director. AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION , Washington, DC, July 21, 2000. Hon. E DWARD M. K ENNEDY , Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Edu- cation, Labor, and Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. D EAR SENATOR KENNEDY : The American Hospital Association (AHA), which rep-resents, 5,000 hospitals, health care systems, networks, and other providers of care, is pleased to support the FamilyCare Act of 2000. The AHA shares your goal of expanding access to health care coverage for the 44 mil-lion uninsured Americans. We believe the federal budget surplus offers a unique oppor-tunity to fund solutions to the health care problems of the uninsured. Recent Medicaid expansions and the cre- ation of the State Children's Health Insur-ance Program (S-CHIP) have greatly im-proved access to health care coverage for millions of children living in low-income families. But more needs to be done. AHA strongly supports the objective of your legis-lation that embraces, as one option to ad- dress the problems of the uninsured, building on existing public programs to expand cov-erage to the parents of the children covered by S-CHIP. Furthermore, your provisions that include coverage for legal immigrants, improve Med-icaid coverage for those transitioning from welfare-to-work, and create state grant pro-grams to encourage market innovation in health care insurance are to be applauded. AHA believes these are good first steps to-ward lowering the numbers of the uninsured. In addition to expanding public programs, AHA supports measures that make health care insurance more affordable for low-in-come working families. Toward that end, AHA also support H.R. 4113, bipartisan legis-lation establishing refundable tax credits to assist low-income families in the purchase of health care insurance. Our nation's hospitals see every day that the absence of health coverage is a signifi-cant barrier to care, reducing the likelihood that people will get appropriate preventive, diagnostic and chronic care. With the unin-sured growing in numbers, AHA supports your effort to build on current public pro-grams as an important option to make it possible for more low-income families to get needed health care coverage. We thank you for your leadership and we look forward to working with you on advancing the FamilyCare Act of 2000. Sincerely, R ICKPOLLACK , Executive Vice President. NETWORK , Washington, DC, July 2000. From NETWORK\u2014A National Catholic So- cial Justice Lobby. Re: The Family Care Act of 2000. HON. SENATOR TEDKENNEDY : Since 1975, NETWORK: A National Catholic Social Jus-tice Lobby has worked for universal access to affordable, quality health care. NET-WORK considers the constant increase in the number of uninsured persons a national dis-grace and a serious moral and ethical issue. Sadly, the political will to reform the na-tion's fragmented non-system of health care is seriously lacking in the current climate of commercialization and profit-making. Therefore, millions of American citizens are denied their human right to medical care. Given that as the context, NETWORK sup- ports the efforts of those legislators who rec-ognize that the anticipated federal surplus should be utilized in part to rectify the seri-ous flaws inherent in the present situation. The Family Care Act of 2000 is one of those efforts. NETWORK urges Congress to pass the proposal. The goal of the bill is to build on existing legislation in order to enroll more uninsured children and their working parents in Med-icaid or CHIP. The bill requires that states first cover children up to 200% of poverty be-fore they enroll parents. This will serve to increase coverage of previously eligible but uninsured children by eliminating the CHIP waiting lists. It is estimated that over 4 mil-lion previously uninsured children will be enrolled. The proposal targets $50 billion in new money to enable the states to enroll the par-ents of children already covered by Medicaid and CHIP. This would reduce the number of uninsured parents by an estimated 6.5 mil-lion, one out of seven of the nation's unin-sured. Most of these uninsured families have at least one member who works. In addition, the bill proposes another $100 million per year for five years to encourage the states to develop innovative approaches to expanding coverage, tailoring their solu-tions to market needs. Much needed is the VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7663 July 26, 2000 proposed extension of The Transitional Med- icaid Assistance program. Some of the re-quirements which jeopardize access to health care by persons moving from welfare to low- wage, non-benefit jobs will be removed. First time pregnant women will receive prenatal care under the CHIP program and grants will enable states to develop innovative coverage mechanisms. All in all, the Family Care Act of 2000 as drafted seeks to rectify to a marked degree the serious problem of lack of health care coverage for the most vulnerable in our soci-ety, low-wage working families and their children. K ATHY THORNTON RSM, National Coordinator. CATHERINE PINKERTON , CSJ Lobbyist. Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, over the last several years health care reform has dropped off our national and Congressional agenda. We talk about it primarily to posture politi-cally, not because we are determined to actually succeed in extending cov-erage. Too often, the goal seems to be to simply create a campaign issue and make voters believe we are working to solve the problem, when in reality no progress is being made. This year, we have seen a lot of talk- ing on health care, but it's clear that Congress' priorities lie elsewhere. Just this past week we passed a tax break that will affect only 1.7 percent of Americans, yet will cost us $50 billion a year when fully phased in. In the meantime, 40 million people, mostly of modest incomes, continue to live their lives with little hope of getting the health coverage they need. The question that Congress needs to answer: will we continue to sit back and simply watch as the problem of the uninsured grows worse? Along with Senator K ENNEDY , and Congressmen D INGELL , STARK and W AX- MAN, I obviously have very clear an- swers to this question. And today we are offering a commonsense, bi-par-tisan step that Congress can take this year to improve the plight of working, uninsured families. We know that the majority of those without health insurance are con-centrated in lower-income, working families. The Medicaid and CHIP Fam-ily Care Improvement Act would target our efforts to these families by allow-ing states to extend Medicaid and CHIP to the parents of eligible children. This is a sensible, affordable expansion that will make a real and immediate dif-ference for many American families. In addition, FamilyCare would pro- vide assistance to increase coverage for workers in small businesses by pro-viding grant money for states to pur-sue new and innovative approaches to expand health insurance coverage through small business. Our plan also gives states a number of new tools to help improve outreach and enrollment in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Pro-gram. FamilyCare would provide health in- surance coverage to millions of low-in-come working families for a fraction of the cost of the recently-passed tax breaks that affect only a small number of people. Eight years ago, the fight for uni- versal health care had a surge of en-ergy and there was a common purpose among political leaders and the Amer-ican people. Unfortunately, little progress has been made since then. While the number of uninsured has grown from 36 million in 1993 to 44 mil-lion in 1999, we have stood by as a na-tion and simply watched. Over the next 3 years, about 30 percent of the popu-lation, 81 million Americans, can ex-pect a gap in their health insurance coverage lasting at least one month. It is practically inconceivable\u2014and mor-ally wrong\u2014that we are allowing this to happen in such a strong economy, with an extremely competitive labor market. It is time to end the failed experi- ment of trying to let the disease cure itself. We need to accomplish the goal of comprehensive reform in any way we can\u2014even if it means continuing to work on incremental changes, as long as we always keep our target squarely set on universal coverage. Today, we are giving Congress the opportunity to take a major step for-ward in accomplishing this goal. With FamilyCare, we are simply taking a program that is already working to re-duce the number of uninsured, and ex-panding it to cover more people who we know need the help. This approach makes so much sense that even the conservative Health In-surance Association of America\u2014the organization that helped to defeat uni-versal coverage\u2014has offered its sup-port. In addition, our bill has four Re-publicans as original cosponsors. With this bipartisan bill we have a real op-portunity to stop talking about ex-panding health coverage, and start act-ing. By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. DURBIN , and Mrs. F EINSTEIN ): S. 2924. A bill to strengthen the en- forcement of Federal statutes relating to false identification, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Ju-diciary. THE INTERNET FALSE IDENTIFICATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2000 Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague from Illinois, Senator D URBIN , I am introducing leg- islation to stem the proliferation of web sites that distribute counterfeit identification documents and creden-tials over the Internet. In May, the Senate Permanent Sub- committee on Investigations, which I chair, held hearings on a disturbing new trend\u2014the use of the Internet to manufacture and market counterfeit identification documents and creden-tials. Our investigation revealed the widespread availability on the Internet of a variety of fake ID documents or computer templates that allow individ-uals to manufacture authentic looking IDs in the seclusion of their own homes. The Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000 will strengthen current law to prevent the distribution of false identification documents over the Internet and make it easier for Federal officials to prosecute this criminal activity. The high quality of the counterfeit identification documents that can be obtained via the Internet is simply as-tounding. With very little difficulty, my staff was able to use Internet mate-rials to manufacture convincing IDs that would allow me to pass as a mem-ber of our Armed Forces, as a reporter, as a student at Boston University, or as a licensed driver in Florida, Michi-gan, and Wyoming\u2014to name just a few of the identities that I could assume, using these phony IDs. We found it was very easy to manufacture IDs that were indistinguishable from the real documents. For example, using the Internet, my staff created this counterfeit Con-necticut driver's license, which is vir-tually identical to an authentic license issued by the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles. Just like the real Connecticut license, this fake with my picture on it, includes a signature writ-ten over the picture\u2014which is supposed to be a security feature. It includes an adjacent ''shadow picture,'' and it in-cludes the bar code and the State seal for the State of Connecticut. Each of these sophisticated features was added to the license by the State of Connecticut in order to make it more difficult to counterfeit. Yet the Internet scam artists have been able to keep up with the technology, and every time a State adds another security fea-ture it has been easily duplicated. Unfortunately, some web sites sell fake IDs complete with State seals, holograms, and bar codes to replicate a license virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. Thus, technology now allows web site operators to copy authentic IDs with an extraordinary level of sophistication and then dis-tribute and mass produce these fraudu-lent documents for their customers. The web sites investigated by my subcommittee offered a vast and varied product line, ranging from the driver's licenses that I already showed to mili-tary identification cards to Federal agency credentials, including those of the FBI and the CIA. Other sites offered to produce Social Security cards, birth certificates, di-plomas, and press credentials. In short, one can find almost any kind of identi-fication document that one wants on the Internet. The General Accounting Office and the FBI have both confirmed the find-ings of the subcommittee's investiga-tion of this dangerous new trend. The GAO used counterfeit credentials and badges readily available for purchase via the Internet to breach the security at 19 Federal buildings and two com-mercial airports. GAO's success in doing so demonstrates that the Inter-net and computer technology allow VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7664 July 26, 2000 nearly anyone to create convincing identification cards and credentials. The FBI has also focused on the po- tential of misuse of official identifica-tion, and just last month executive search warrants at the homes of sev-eral individuals who had been selling Federal law enforcement badges over the Internet. Obviously, this is very serious. It al- lows someone to use a law enforcement badge to gain access to secure areas and perhaps to commit harm. For ex-ample, the FBI is investigating a very disturbing incident where someone al-legedly displayed phony FBI creden-tials to gain access to an individual's hotel room and then allegedly later kidnaped and murdered that indi-vidual. The Internet is a revolutionary tool of commerce and communications that benefits us all, but many of the Inter-net's greatest attributes also further its use for criminal purposes. While the manufacture of false IDs by criminals is certainly nothing new, the Internet allows those specializing in the sale of counterfeit IDs to reach a far broader market of potential buyers than they ever could by standing on the street corner in a shady part of town. They can sell their products with virtual an-onymity through the use of e-mail services and free web hosting services and by providing false information when registering their domain names. Similarly, the Internet allows crimi-nals to obtain fake IDs in the privacy of their own homes, substantially di-minishing the risk of apprehension that attends purchasing counterfeit documents on the street. Because this is a relatively new phe- nomenon, there are no good data on the size of the false ID industry or the growth it has experienced as a result of the Internet, but the testimony at our hearing indicates that the Internet is increasingly becoming the source of choice for criminals to obtain false IDs. The subcommittee's investigation found that some web site operators ap-parently have made hundreds of thou-sands of dollars through the sale of phony identification documents. One web site operator told a State law en-forcement official that he sold approxi-mately 1,000 fake IDs each month and generated about $600,000 in annual sales. Identify theft is a growing problem that these Internet sites facilitate. Fake IDs, however, also facilitate a broad array of criminal conduct. We found that some Internet sites were used to obtain counterfeit identifica-tion documents for the purpose of com-mitting other crimes, ranging from very serious offenses, such as identify theft and bank fraud, ranging to the more common problem of teenagers using phony IDs to buy alcohol. The legislation which Senator D UR- BINand I are introducing today is de- signed to address the problem of coun-terfeit IDs in several ways. The central features of our legislation are provi- sions that modernize existing law to address the widespread availability of false identification documents on the Internet. First, the legislation supplements current Federal law against false iden-tification to modernize it for the Inter-net age. The primary law prohibiting the use and distribution of false identi-fication documents was enacted in 1982. Advances in computer technology and the use of the Internet have rendered that law inadequate. This bill will clar-ify that the current law prohibits the sale or distribution of false identifica-tion documents through computer files and templates which our investigation found are the vehicles of choice for manufacturing false IDs in the Internet age. Second, the legislation will make it easier to prosecute those criminals who manufacture, distribute, or sell coun-terfeit identification documents by ending the practices of easily remov-able disclaimers as part of an attempt to shield the illegal conduct from pros-ecution through a bogus claim of nov-elty. What we found is that a lot of these web sites have these disclaimers, in an attempt to get around the law, saying that these can only be used for enter-tainment or novelty purposes. No longer will it be acceptable to provide computer templates of government- issued identification cards containing an easily removable layer saying it is not a government document. I will give an example. this is a driv- er's license from Oklahoma. It is a fake ID which my staff obtained via the Internet. It is enclosed in a plastic pouch that says ''Not a Government Document'' in red print across it, but it was very easily removed. All one had to do, with a snip of the scissors, was cut the pouch, and then the ID is easily removed and the disclaimer is gone. That is the kind of technique that a lot of times these web site operators use to get around the letter of the law. Under my bill, it will no longer be acceptable to sell a false identification document in this fashion. Finally, my legislation seeks to en- courage more aggressive law enforce-ment by dedicating investigative and prosecutorial resources to this emerg-ing problem. The bill establishes a multiagency task force that will con-centrate the investigative and prosecu-torial resources of several agencies with responsibility for enforcing laws that criminalize the manufacture, sale, and distribution of counterfeit identi-fication documents. Our investigation established that Federal law enforcement officials have not devoted the necessary resources and attention to this serious problem. by prosecuting the purveyors of false identification materials, I believe that ultimately we can reduce end-use crime that often depends on the avail-ability of counterfeit identification. For example, the convicted felon who testified at our hearings said that he would not have been able to commit bank fraud had he not been able to eas-ily and quickly obtain high-quality fraudulent identification documents via the Internet. I am confident that if Federal law enforcement officials pros-ecute the most blatant violation of the law, the false ID industry on the Inter-net will wither in short order. By strengthening the law and by fo- cusing our prosecutorial efforts, I be-lieve we can curb the widespread avail-ability of false IDs that the Internet fa-cilitates. The Director of the U.S. Se-cret Service testified at our hearing that the use of such fraudulent docu-ments and credentials almost always accompanies the serious financial crimes they investigate. Thus, my hope is that the legislation we are intro-ducing today will produce a stronger law that will help deter and prevent criminal activity, not only in the man-ufacture of false IDs but in other areas as well. By Mr. THURMOND: S. 2925. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish an Of-fice of Men's Health; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions. MEN'S HEALTH ACT OF 2000 Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the Men's Health Act of 2000. This legisla-tion will establish an Office of Men's Health within the Department of Health and Human Services to mon-itor, coordinate, and improve men's health in America. Mr. President, there is an ongoing, increasing and predominantly silent crisis in the health and well-being of men. Due to a lack of awareness, poor health education, and culturally in-duced behavior patterns in their work and personal lives, men's health and well-being are deteriorating steadily. Heart disease, stroke, and various can-cers continue to be major areas of con-cern as we look to enhance the quality and duration of men's lives. Improved education and preventive screening are imperative to meet this objective. Mr. President, as a lifelong advocate of regular medical exams, daily exer-cise and a balanced diet, I feel strongly that an Office of Men's Health should be established to help improve the overall health of America's male popu-lation. This legislation is identical to a bill introduced earlier this year in the House of Representatives. I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill appear in the C ONGRESSIONAL RECORD immediately following my remarks. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 2925 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7665 July 26, 2000 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Men's Health Act of 2000''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) There is a silent health crisis affecting the health and well-being of America's men. (2) This health crisis is of particular con- cern to men, but is also a concern for women, and especially to those who have fa-thers, husbands, sons, and brothers. (3) Men's health is likewise a concern for employers who lose productive employees as well as pay the costs of medical care, and is a concern to State government and society which absorb the enormous costs of pre-mature death and disability, including the costs of caring for dependents left behind. (4) The life expectancy gap between men and women has steadily increased from 1 year in 1920 to 7 years in 1990. (5) Almost twice as many men than women die from heart disease, and 28.5 percent of all men die as a result of stroke. (6) In 1995, blood pressure of black males was 356 percent higher than that of white males, and the death rate for stroke was 97 percent higher for black males than for white males. (7) The incidence of stroke among men is 19 percent higher than for women. (8) Significantly more men than women are diagnosed with AIDS each year. (9) Fifty percent more men than women die of cancer. (10) Although the incidence of depression is higher in women, the rate of life-threatening depression is higher in men, with men rep-resenting 80 percent of all suicide cases, and with men 43 times more likely to be admit-ted to psychiatric hospitals than women. (11) Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the United States among men, accounting for 36 percent of all cancer cases. (12) An estimated 180,000 men will be newly diagnosed with prostate cancer this year alone, of which 37,000 will die. (13) Prostate cancer rates increase sharply with age, and more than 75 percent of such cases are diagnosed in men age 65 and older. (14) The incidence of prostate cancer and the resulting mortality rate in African American men is twice that in white men. (15) Studies show that men are at least 25 percent less likely than women to visit a doctor, and are significantly less likely to have regular physician check-ups and obtain preventive screening tests for serious dis-eases. (16) Appropriate use of tests such as pros- tate specific antigen (PSA) exams and blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol screens, in conjunction with clinical exams and self-testing, can result in the early de-tection of many problems and in increased survival rates. (17) Educating men, their families, and health care providers about the importance of early detection of male health problems can result in reducing rates of mortality for male-specific diseases, as well as improve the health of America's men and its overall eco-nomic well-being. (18) Recent scientific studies have shown that regular medical exams, preventive screenings, regular exercise, and healthy eat-ing habits can help save lives. (19) Establishing an Office of Men's Health is needed to investigate these findings and take such further actions as may be needed to promote men's health. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE MEN'S HEALTH. Title XVII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300u et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following section: '' OFFICE OF MEN 'S HEALTH ''SEC. 1711. The Secretary shall establish within the Department of Health and Human Services an office to be known as the Office of Men's Health, which shall be headed by a director appointed by the Secretary. The Secretary, acting through the Director of the Office, shall coordinate and promote the status of men's health in the United States.''. By Mr. BINGAMAN: S. 2926. A bill a amend title II of the Social Security Act to provide that an individual's entitlement to any benefit thereunder shall continue through the month of his or her death (without af-fecting any other person's entitlement to benefits for that month) and that such individuals' benefit shall be pay-able for such month only to the extent proportionate to the number of days in such month preceding the date of such individual's death; to the Committee on Finance. THE SOCIAL SECURITY FAMILY RELIEF ACT Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Social Security Family Relief Act, which is legislation designed to both revise current Social Security law and assist families living in New Mexico and across the United States. For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with this issue, at present the Social Security Administration pays benefits in advance, and, thus, a check an individual receives from So-cial Security Administration during the month is calculated and paid in an-ticipation that the individual will be alive the entire month in which a pay-ment was received. However, if a person dies during that month, the payment must be reim-bursed in full to the Social Security Administration. If a person dies on the 5th of the month, or the 15th of the month, or the 25th of the month, none of this matters. If they die, they are no longer entitled to any benefits for that month, period. Furthermore, if a sur-viving spouse or family member uses a check received from the Social Secu-rity Administration for that month in which a family member had died, they must send it back\u2014in full\u2014to the So-cial Security Administration. Let me make this clear that this is not just a problem in the abstract. In-deed, the introduction of this bill is prompted by a very real experience faced by a family living in New Mexico. In this case, a constituent had a close relative pass away on December 31, 1999. The last day of the month. Not knowing it ran contrary to Social Se-curity law, the family used the rel-ative's last Social Security check to pay her final expenses. Only after these activities had occurred did they receive a letter from the Social Security Ad-ministration stating that they would have to return the check. Not just par-tial payment, but in full. No recogni-tion on the part of the Social Security Administration that this person was alive for the entire month. No recogni-tion on the part of the Social Security Administration that this person had expenses that had to be paid for after they had died. No recognition on the part of the Social Security Administra-tion that the surviving relatives had their own bills to pay, and that this ad-ditional expense imposed a burden on them that was difficult to manage. My constituents found this to absurd. Why, they asked, should they have to return a check for a relative that was alive, was accumulating expenses while she was alive, and deserved the money that was provided to her? Why, they asked, should they be required to pay for the relative's expenses when money should be available? Why should their emotional suffering be made all the more distressful by the addition of fi-nancial obligations not of their own making? I think these are good questions, and it is logical that Congress address them directly and in a manner that solves the problem at hand. From what I can see, they are right. Individuals that have worked over the years and have paid into the Social Security Trust Fund all that time, these folks have earned Social Security benefits and should receive them in full for the pe-riod that they are alive. As such, So-cial Security law should be written in such a way that allows the surviving spouse or family member to use the final check to take care of the remain-ing expenses, whether they be utilities, or mortgages, or car payments, or health care, or whatever needs to be taken care of. But although my constituents are sometimes critical of the Social Secu-rity Administration on this issue, in fairness that agency did not create this problem, Congress did. We wrote the law, and the Social Security Adminis-tration merely implements it. Any re-sponsibility for what is happening be-longs to us. We need to fix the law so the Social Security Administration can do its job better. It is my understanding that this issue has been discussed in the past by a number of Senators, but the revisions have gone nowhere because some felt it would impose an administrative burden on the Social Security Administration. I find this argument to be uncon-vincing as we clearly find a way to cal-culate complex equations that ulti-mately benefit that agency. There are those that now argue that tracking down appropriate beneficiaries would be difficult. But I find this to be quite unconvincing as well\u2014after all, we do it already when someone dies. Surely there is a way to make the changes necessary. Surely the technology and expertise already exists. Surely it is time to stop making excuses and do what is right for Americans and their families. The legislation I am introducing today is easy to understand. The legis-lation says, quite simply, that an indi-vidual's entitlement to Social Security benefits shall continue through the month of his or her death, and after VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, S7666 July 26, 2000 that individual's death, the entitle- ment shall be calculated in a manner proportionate to the days he or she was still alive. In other words, we are using a method of pro-rating to calculate what portion of the entitlement that individual will receive for the last month. Then, instead of being asked to return that final check, the surviving spouse or appropriate surviving family members will receive a check, which can then be used to settle the dece-dent's remaining expenses. I think this is a perfectly fair and reasonable ap-proach to solving the problem at hand. And I think it is long overdue. It is my understanding that another bill addressing this problem has been introduced in the Senate by my col-league Senator M IKULSKI . Further- more, she has introduced this legisla-tion for several years in a row. I com-mend her for her awareness of this problem and her ongoing efforts to fix it. That said, it is also my under- standing that her bill as written cal-culates these entitlement benefits on a half-month basis. In other words, if you die before the 15th, you get benefits for a half a month. If you die after the 15th, you are entitled to benefits for the entire month. To be honest, I see no obvious rationale for addressing the problem in this way, and I find a pro- rate strategy to be far more compel-ling. But this said, I look forward to working with her and her co-sponsors to repair the problem. We clearly have the same concerns. Mr. President, let me state in conclu- sion that this legislation represents only a partial fix of the current Social Security system. There is no doubt in my mind that much more needs to be done. We have talked about the issues far too long, and it is time to make a serious effort to make the Social Secu-rity solvent and effective. If had my way, this effort would begin tomorrow. But since it is not, this legislation can be considered one small but very im-portant step on the path to reform. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that a copy of the legislation be included in the R ECORD at the conclu- sion of my statement. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 2926 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure that the in- carceration of inmates is not provided by private contractors or vendors and that persons charged or convicted of an offense against the United States shall be housed in facilities managed and maintained by Federal, State, or local governments; to the Committee on the Judiciary. THE PUBLIC SAFETY ACT Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, send- ing inmates to prisons built and run by prviate companies has become a pop-ular way to deal with overcrowded pris-ons, but in recent years this practice has been appropriately criticized. As reports of escapes, riots, prisoner vio-lence, and abuse by staff in private prisons increase, many have questioned the wisdom and propriety of private companies carrying out this essential state function. After considering safe-ty, cost, and accountability issues, it is clear that private companies should not be doing this public work. Govern-ment and only government, whether it's federal, state, or local, should oper-ate prisons. That is why I rise today to introduce a bill that will restore re-sponsibility for housing prisoners to the state and federal government, where it belongs. An identical bill was introduced in the House of Representa-tives by Congressman T EDSTRICKLAND , where it has received broad bi-partisan support and currently has 141 cospon-sors. Private prison companies, and pro- ponents of their use, claim that they save taxpayers money. They claim pri-vate companies can do the govern-ment's business more efficiently, but this has never been confirmed. In fact, two government studies show that it is far from clear whether private prisons save taxpayer money. One study, com-pleted by the GAO, stated that it could not conclude whether or not privatiza-tion saved money. The second study, completed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1998, concluded that there is no strong evidence to show states save money by using private prisons. More importantly, private prison companies are motivated by one goal: making a profit. Decisions by these companies are driven by the desire to make a profit and, in turn, please offi-cers and shareholders. This profit mo-tive in the context of housing crimi-nals is wrong. It is at cross-purposes with the government's goal of pun-ishing and rehabilitating criminals. So what happens when a private com- pany runs a prison? The prisons have promised to save taxpayers money, so they cut costs. This invariably results in unqualified, low paid employees, poor facilities and living conditions, and an inadequate number of edu-cational and rehabilitative programs. Recent episodes of escape, violence, and prisoner abuse demonstrate what happens when corners are cut. At the Northeast Ohio Correctional facility, a private prison in Youngs-town, Ohio, 20 inmates were stabbed, two of them fatally, within a 10-month period. After management claimed they had addressed the problems, six inmates, four convicted of homicide, escaped by cutting through two razor wire fences in the middle of the after-noon. At a private prison in Whiteville, Tennessee, which houses many inmates from my home state of Wisconsin, there has been a hostage situation, an assault of a guard, and a coverup to hide physical abuse of inmates by pris-on guards. A security report at the same Tennessee prison found unsecured razors, inmates obstructing views into their cells by covering up windows, and an inmate using a computer lab strict-ly labeled, ''staff only'' without any su-pervision. At a private prison in Sayre, Okla- homa, a dangerous inmate uprising jeopardized the security and control of the facility. As a result, the state of Oklahoma removed all its inmates from the facility and questioned its safety. Because the prison gets paid based on the number of inmates, how-ever, the prison continued to request, and other states sent, hundreds of in-mates to be housed there. Earlier this year the Justice Depart- ment filed a lawsuit against the Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, the second largest private prison com-pany in the United States, charging that in one of its juvenile prisons, con-ditions were ''dangerous and life threatening.'' A group of experts who toured the prison reported that many of the juveniles were short of food, had lost weight, and did not have shoes or blankets. The Department of Justice lawsuit also alleges that inmates did not receive adequate mental health care or educational programming. In addition to the poor conditions and lack of training, the guards physically abused the boys and threw gas gre-nades into their barracks. Some juve-nile inmates even tried to commit sui-cide or deliberately injure themselves so they would be sent to the infirmary to avoid abuse by the guards. Mr. President, the profit motive clearly has a dangerous and harmful ef-fect on the security of private prisons, but the profit motive also shortchanges inmates of the rehabilitation, edu-cation, and training that they need. Private prisons get paid based on the number of inmates they house. This means the more inmates they accept and the fewer services they provide, the more money they make. A high crime rate means more business and eliminates any motivation to provide job training, education, and other reha-bilitative programs. These allegations of abuse and the negative effects of the profit motive are especially troubling because they have a disparate impact on the minority community, which has been incarcerated disproportionately in recent years particularly with the rise of mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. Another issue of concern is account- ability for dispensing one of the strong-est punishments our society can im-pose. Incarceration requires a govern-ment to exercise its coercive police powers over individuals, including the authority to take away a person's free-dom and to use force. This authority to use force should not be delegated to a private company that is not account-able to the people. This premise was re-inforced by the Supreme Court in Rich-ardson v. McKnight, which held that private prison personnel are not cov-ered by the qualified immunity that shields state and local correctional of-ficers. This means that a state or local government could be held liable for the actions of a private corporation. Mr. President, the legislation I intro- duce today, the Public Safety Act, ad-dresses these concerns. It restores con-trol and management of prisons to the government. It makes federal grants under Title II of the Crime Control Act of 1994 contingent upon states agreeing not to contract with any private com-panies to provide core correctional services related to transportation or incarceration of inmates. The legisla-tion was carefully crafted to apply only to core correctional services meaning that private companies can still pro-vide auxiliary services such as food or clothing. Mr. President, let us restore safety and security to the many Americans who work in prisons. Let us protect the communities that support prisons. And let us ensure rehabilitation and safety for the individuals, including young boys and girls, who are housed there. This bill returns to the government the function of being the sole adminis-trator of incarceration as punishment in our society. I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of the Public Safety Act. I ask that the text of the bill be placed in the R ECORD following this statement. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 2927 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7668 July 26, 2000 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Public Safe- ty Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The issues of safety, liability, account- ability, and cost are the paramount issues in running corrections facilities. (2) In recent years, the privatization of fa- cilities for persons previously incarcerated by governmental entities has resulted in fre-quent escapes by violent criminals, riots re-sulting in extensive damage, prisoner vio-lence, and incidents of prisoner abuse by staff. (3) In some instances, the courts have pro- hibited the transfer of additional convicts to private prisons because of the danger to pris-oners and the community. (4) Frequent escapes and riots at private facilities result in expensive law enforce-ment costs for State and local governments. (5) The need to make profits creates incen- tives for private contractors to underfund mechanisms that provide for the security of the facility and the safety of the inmates, corrections staff, and neighboring commu-nity. (6) The 1997 Supreme Court ruling in Rich- ardson v. McKnight that the qualified immu-nity that shields State and local correctional officers does not apply to private prison per-sonnel, and therefore exposes State and local governments to liability for the actions of private corporations. (7) Additional liability issues arise when inmates are transferred outside the jurisdic-tion of the contracting State. (8) Studies on private correctional facili- ties have been unable to demonstrate any significant cost savings in the privatization of corrections facilities. (9) The imposition of punishment on errant citizens through incarceration requires State and local governments to exercise their coer-cive police powers over individuals. These powers, including the authority to use force over a private citizen, should not be dele-gated to another private party. SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS.

By Mr. M CCAIN (for himself, Mr. KERRY , Mr. A BRAHAM , and Mrs. BOXER ): S. 2928. A bill to protect the privacy of consumers who use the Internet; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. THE CONSUMER INTERNET PRIVACY ENHANCEMENT ACT Mr. M CCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from Massachusetts, Michigan, and Cali-fornia to introduce the Consumer Internet Privacy Enhancement Act. The purpose of this legislation is sim-ple. We want to ensure that commer-cial websites inform consumers about how their personal information is treated, and give consumers meaning-ful choices about the use of that infor-mation. While the purpose of this legis-lation is simple, the task my col-leagues and I are seeking to accom-plish is complex and difficult. The Internet is a tremendous me- dium spurring the world's economy and allowing people to communicate in ways that were unimaginable a few short years ago. The Internet revolu-tion is transforming our lives and our economy at an incredible pace. Like any other technological revolution it promises great opportunities and, it presents new concerns and fears. Chief among those concerns is the ability of the Internet to further erode individual privacy. Since the beginning of commerce, business has sought to learn more about consumers. The abil-ity of the internet to aid business in the collection, storage, transfer, and analysis of information about a con-sumer's habits is unprecedented. While this technology can allow business to better target goods and services, it also has increased consumer fears about the collection and use of personally identi-fiable information. Since 1998, the Federal Trade Com- mission has examined this issue in a series of reports to Congress. The FTC and privacy organizations formed by industry identified ''four fair informa-tion practices'' which should be uti-lized by websites that collect person-ally identifiable information. In simple terms, these practices are notice of what information is collected and how it is used; choice as to how that infor- mation is used; access by the user to information collected about them; and appropriate measures to ensure the se-curity of the information. Over the last three years industry has worked diligently to develop and implement privacy policies utilizing the four fair information practices. While industry has made progress in providing consumers with some form of notice of their information practices, there is much work to be done to im-prove the depth and clarity of privacy policies. The legislation we introduce today should not be viewed as a failure on the part of industry to address privacy. In-stead industry's efforts over the past few years have driven the development of standards which serve as the model for this legislation. Our objective is to provide for enforceable standards to en-sure that all websites provide con- sumers with clear and conspicuous no-tice and meaningful choices about how their information is used. Currently, some websites have pri- vacy policies that are confusing and make it difficult for consumers to re-strict the use of information. During a recent hearing before the Senate Com-merce Committee, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission\u2014a former dean of Georgetown Law School\u2014ex-pressed his own difficulties in under-standing some privacy policies. Privacy is harmed not enhanced when consumers are lost in a fog of legalese. Some current privacy policies confuse and contradict rather than pro-vide clear and conspicuous notice of a consumer's rights. The bill my colleagues and I intro- duce today attempts to end some of this confusion by providing for enforce-able standards that will both protect consumers and allow for the continued growth of e-commerce. Specifically, the bill would require websites to pro-vide clear and conspicuous notice of their information practices. It also re-quires websites to provide consumers with an easy method to limit the use and disclosure of information. The provisions of the bill are enforce- able by the FTC. States Attorneys General could also bring suits in fed-eral court under the Act using a mech-anism similar to the Telemarketing Sales Rule. We also propose a civil pen-alty of $22,000 per violation with a max-imum fine of $500,000. Currently, the FTC can only seek civil penalties if an individual or business is under an order for past behavior. The legislation also preempts state law to ensure that the law governing the collection of personally identifiable information is uniform. Finally, the bill would direct the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of pri-vacy to examine the collection of per-sonal information in the offline-world as well as methods to provide con-sumers with access to information col-lected by them. Despite our best efforts I recognize this bill does not address all of the VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7669 July 26, 2000 issues affecting online privacy. As I said earlier, this is a complex and dif-ficult issue. Other related concerns that should be addressed will continue to arise as we consider this measure. For example, the sale of data during bankruptcy, the use of software also known as spyware that can transfer personal information while online without the user's consent or knowl-edge, and the government's use and dis-semination of personally identifiable information online. Additionally, other new ways to help resolve the issue of online privacy will also arise as we consider this measure. These include the deployment of tech-nology that will enable consumers to protect their privacy is one issue we should expect to address. Another issue is the use of verifiable assessment pro-cedures to ensure that websites are fol-lowing their posted privacy policies. The discovery of new issues and new solutions as we move through this process will serve to highlight the dif-ficulty and complexity of dealing with this issue. It is not my intention to rush to judgment on these matters. In-stead, I firmly believe the best way to protect consumers and provide for the continued growth of e-commerce is to give privacy careful and thoughtful de-liberation before we act. Mr. President, it is clear that busi- nesses should inform consumers in a clear and conspicuous manner about how they treat personal information and give consumers meaningful choices as to how that information is used. While some of us may disagree on the manner in which we meet this goal, we all agree that it must be done. I look forward to working with my colleagues and addressing their concerns as we move through the legislative process. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent to print the full text of the bill in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 2928 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators M CCAIN, BOXER and A BRAHAM in announcing that today we will be introducing a bill that takes a positive, balanced ap-proach to the issue of Internet privacy. There can be no doubt that consumers have a legitimate expectation of pri-vacy on the Internet. Our bill protects that interest. At the same time, con-sumers want an Internet that is free. For that to happen, the Internet, like television, must be supported by adver-tising. Our bill will allow companies to continue to advertise, ensuring that we VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, SENATE S7671 July 26, 2000 don't have a subscription-based Inter- net, which would limit everyone's on-line activities and contribute to a dig-ital divide. If we recognize that the economy of the Internet calls for advertising, we must also recognize that it won't at-tract consumers if they believe their privacy is being violated. Finding this fine balance of permitting enough free flow of information to allow ads to work and protecting consumers' pri-vacy is going to be critical if the Inter-net is going to reach its full potential. And I believe this bill strikes the right balance. I think all of the bill's cosponsors were hopeful that self-regulation of Internet privacy would work. And I think self-regulation still has an im-portant role to play. But it seems that now it is up to Congress to establish a floor for Internet privacy. I have no doubt that many innovative high tech companies and advertisers will go be-yond the regulations for notice and choice we provide here. A number of companies in my home state of Massa-chusetts already do, providing con-sumers with anonymity when they go online. I applaud and encourage those efforts and am certain that if Congress enacts this bill, they will continue. But technology and innovation won't address all the concerns people have about Internet privacy. Congress has the responsibility to ensure that core privacy principles are the norm throughout the online world. We need to respond to the consumers who don't shop on the Internet because they are concerned about their privacy. This is necessary not only for the sake of the consumers, but for every online busi-ness that wants to grow and attract customers. The bill that we are introducing today will encourage those skeptical consumers to go online. This legisla-tion will require Web sites to clearly and conspicuously disclose their pri-vacy policies. People deserve to know what information may be collected and how it may be used so that they can make an informed decision before they navigate around or shop on a par-ticular Web site. They shouldn't have to click five times and need to trans-late legalese before they know what a site will do with their personal infor-mation. Requiring disclosure has the added benefit of providing the FTC with an enforcement mechanism. If a Web site fails to comply with its posted disclosure policy, the FTC can bring an action against it for unfair or deceptive acts. This is the bare minimum of what I believe consumers deserve and expect, and I don't think this would have any unintended or negative consequences on e-commerce. In addition, this bill addresses the core principle of choice by requiring Web sites to offer consumers an easy to use method to prevent Web sites from using personally identifiable informa-tion for marketing purposes and to pre-vent them from selling that informa-tion to third parties. This bill empow- ers consumers and lets them make in-formed decisions that are right for them. By ensuring consumers have the right to full disclosure and the right to not have their personally identifiable information sold or disclosed, this bill addresses the most fundamental con-cerns many people have about online privacy. But I believe there are still a number of important questions that we need to answer. The first is whether there is a difference between privacy in the offline and online worlds. Most of us hardly think about it when we go to the supermarket, but when Safeway or Giant scans my dis-count card or my credit card, it has a record of exactly who I am and what I bought. Should my preferences at the supermarket be any more or less pro-tected than the choices I make online? Likewise, catalog companies compile and use offline information to make marketing decisions. These companies rent lists compiled by list brokers. The list brokers obtain marketing data and names from the public domain and gov-ernments, credit bureaus, financial in-stitutions, credit card companies, re-tail establishments, and other cata-logers and mass mailers. On the other hand, when I go to the shopping mall and look at five dif-ferent sweaters but don't buy any of them, no one has a record of that. If I do the same thing online, technology can record how long I linger over an item, even if I don't buy it. Likewise, I can pick up any book in a book store and pay in cash and no one will ever know my reading preferences. That type of anonymity can be completely lost online. This bill requires the National Re- search Council to study the issue of on-line versus offline privacy, and make a recommendation if there is a need for additional legislation in either area. Likewise, this bill requires the Coun- cil to study the issue of access. While there is general agreement that con-sumers should have access to informa-tion they provided to a Web site, we still don't know whether it's necessary or proper for consumers to have access to all of the information gathered about an individual. Should consumers have access to click-stream data or so- called derived data by which a com-pany uses compiled information to make a marketing decision about the consumer? And if we decide consumers need some access to this type of infor-mation, is it technology feasible? Will there be unforeseen or unintended con-sequences such as an increased risk of security breaches? Will there be less, rather than more privacy due to the necessary coupling of names and data? I don't we are ready to regulate until we have some consensus on this issue. Finally, it is important to add that this bill in no way limits what Con-gress has done or hopefully will do with respect to a person's health or finan-cial information. When sensitive infor-mation is collected, it is even more im- portant that stringent privacy protec-tions are in place. I have supported a number of legislative efforts that would go far to protect this type of in-formation. Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to join with the Senator from Ar-izona, the Senator from Massachusetts, and the Senator from California in in-troducing the Consumer Privacy En-hancement Act. This legislation will provide Americans with some basic\u2014 but critically important\u2014protections for their personal information when they are online. Privacy has always been a very seri- ous issue to American citizens. It is a concept enshrined in our Bill of Rights. As persons from all walks of life be-come increasingly reliant on com-puters and the Internet to perform ev-eryday tasks, it is incumbent upon pol-icymakers to ensure that adequate pri-vacy protections exist for consumers. We must ensure that our laws evolve along with technology and continue to provide effective privacy protection for consumers surfing the World Wide Web and using the Internet for commercial activities. The American people are letting it be known that they have mounting con-cerns about their vulnerability in this digital age. They are very concerned about the advent of this new high-tech era we've entered and the new threats it potentially poses to our personal pri-vacy. And I believe there is a consensus building in Congress to begin to tackle the question of ensuring adequate pri-vacy protections for individuals using the Internet. Whether we can find a similar con- sensus on a particular legislative pro-posal remains to be seen. However, I think it is imperative that we begin to address this topic now and not simply wait until Congress reconvenes next year before we take the issue up. So I have joined my colleagues here in in-troducing legislation that I think ac-complishes several important objec-tives. The most important provision, I be- lieve, is its most elemental concept: We require that before consumers are asked to provide personal information about themselves, they must be given an opportunity to review the website's privacy policy in order to learn how their information will be utilized. While many websites have privacy poli-cies, including the vast majority of those websites receiving the most traf-fic, there are still many websites out there that do not offer privacy policies or adequate protections for consumers. In addition, many of the privacy poli- cies that do exist are very lengthy and often quite confusing to consumers. There are pages and pages of ambig-uous legalese and often seemingly con-tradictory claims about how protected your information truly is. So our bill also calls on the Federal Trade Com-mission to ensure that privacy policies VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, SENATE S7672 July 26, 2000 are ''clear, conspicuous, and easily un- derstood,'' and that any consent mech-anisms shall be ''easy to use, easily ac-cessible, and shall be available online.'' Finally, this legislation recognizes the importance of allowing the Inter-net industry to continue to promote greater self-regulation and to develop new technology means for to continue to evolve and to help us address legiti-mate consumer privacy concerns. There have been several initiatives un-dertaken by industry leaders to get websites to develop and post privacy policies and to give consumers the op-tion of when to provide information and for what uses. This legislation is designed to allow such efforts to con-tinue and to provide for technological advances in the area of privacy to ben-efit consumers. For instance, Ford and other companies have been partici-pating in the Privacy Leadership Ini-tiative whereby companies engaged on-line are working to establish industry guidelines and protocols for protecting consumers privacy. Nothing we do here today should inhibit such industry ef-forts. So with those critical features ad- dressed, I believe the legislation we in-troduce today will be an important stepping stone along the path of ensur-ing that Americans can be confident of having their personal information will be protected when they go online. I urge my colleagues to review this legislation and to support our efforts to protect consumers against unwar-ranted intrusions into their personal privacy when they are using their com-puters and surfing the Internet. I yield the floor. By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. H OLLINGS , and Mr. I NOUYE ): S. 2929. A bill to establish a dem- onstration project to increase teacher salaries and employee benefits for teachers who enter into contracts with local educational agencies to serve as master teachers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions. MASTER TEACHER LEGISLATION Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senators H OLLINGS , INOUYE , and I are introducing a bill to create a dem-onstration grant program to help school districts create master teacher positions. Our bill authorizes $50 million for a five-year demonstration program under which the Secretary of Education would award competitive grants to school districts to create master teach-er positions. Federal funds would be equally matched by states and local governments so that $100 million total would be available. Under the bill, 5,000 master teacher positions could be cre-ated, or 100 per State, if each master teacher were paid $20,000 on top of the current average teacher's salary. As defined in this amendment, a mas- ter teacher is one who is credentialed; has a least five years of teaching expe-rience; is judged to be an excellent teacher by administrators and teachers who are knowledgeable about the indi-vidual's performance; and is currently teaching; and enters into a contract and agrees to serve at least five more years. The master teacher would help other teachers to improve instruction, strengthen other teachers' skills, men-tor lesser experienced teachers, develop curriculum, and provide other profes-sional development. The intent of this bill is for districts to pay each master teacher up to $20,000 on top of his or her regular sal-ary. Nationally, the average teacher salary is $40,582. In California, it is $44,585. Elementary school principals receive $64,653 on average nationally and $72,385 in California. The thrust of the master teacher concept in this bill is to pay teachers a salary closer to that of an administrator to keep good teachers in teaching. The bill requires State and/or local districts to match federal funds dollar for dollar. It requires the U.S. Depart-ment of Education to give priority to school districts with a high proportion of economically disadvantaged stu-dents and to ensure that grants are awarded to a wide range of districts in terms of the size and location of the school district, the ethnic and eco-nomic composition of students, and the experience of the districts' teachers. There are several reasons we need this bill. NEW TEACHERS NEED SUPPORT First, new teachers face over- whelming responsibilities and chal-lenges in their first year, but in the real world, they get little guidance. When first-year teachers enter the classroom, there is typically little help available to them, in a year that will have a profound impact on the rest of their professional career. They are ''out there alone,'' virtually isolated in their classroom, thrown into an unfa-miliar school and classroom with a room full of new faces. By the current sink-or-swim method, new teachers often find themselves ill equipped to deal with the educational and discipli-nary tasks of their first year. In California, 23 percent of teachers in kindergarten through the third grade are novices. Furthermore, we have 30,000 inexperienced teachers on emergency credentials in California, over ten percent of our teaching work-force. A new teacher can get experienced guidance from a master teacher who is paired with the new teacher. The mas-ter teacher can help plan lessons, im-prove instructional methods, and deal with discipline problems. ''If you're [a master teacher] teaching a class, then you can say, 'last week I handled a dis-cipline problem this way.' It's much more credible.'' said Carl O'Connell, a New York mentor teacher. ENHANCING THE TEACHING PROFESSION Second, master teacher programs can bring more prestige to teaching as a profession, by increasing the teacher's salary, by rewarding experience, and by giving teachers opportunities to super-vise others. A master teacher designa-tion is a way to recognize outstanding ability and performance. A master teacher position can give teachers a professional goal, a higher level to pur-sue. A 1996 report by the National Com-mission for Teaching and America's Future said that creating new career paths for teachers is one of the best ways to give educators the respect they deserve and to ensure that proven teaching methods spread quickly and broadly. In one survey of teachers which asked which factors make teachers stay in teaching, 79 percent of teachers said that respect for the teaching pro-fession is needed in order to retain qualified teachers. Eighty percent said that formal mentoring programs for beginning teachers is key (Scholastic/ Chief State School Officers' Teacher Voices Survey, 2000). Over 70 percent of teachers said that more planning time with peers is needed to keep teachers in the classroom. This amendment should help. IMPROVING RETENTION , REDUCING TURNOVER Because of the higher pay and en- hanced prestige, a master teacher pro-gram can help to recruit and retain teachers. Mentor systems provide new teachers with a support network, some-one to turn to. Studies indicate higher retention rates among new teachers who participate in mentoring pro-grams. According to Yvonne Gold of California State University-Long Beach, 25 percent of beginning teachers do not teach more than two years and nearly 40 percent leave in the first five years. In the Rochester, New York, sys-tem, the teacher retention rate was nearly double the national average five years after establishing a mentoring program. As Jay Matthews wrote in the May 16 Washington Post, programs like this ''can provide a large boost to the pro-fession's image for a relatively small amount of money.'' These programs can keep good teachers in the class-room, instead of losing them to school administration or industry. Larkspur, California, School Superintendent Bar-bara Wilson says she is ''witnessing a steady exodus to dotcom and other, more lucrative industries.'' (San Fran-cisco Chronicle, March 26, 2000). Higher salaries and prestige for mas- ter teachers could deter the drain from the classrooms. HOLDING TEACHERS ACCOUNTABLE Another reason for this amendment is that teacher mentoring programs can make teacher performance more accountable. A master teacher can help novice teachers improve their teaching and get better student achievement. ''Teachers cannot be held accountable for knowledge based, client-oriented decisions if they do not have access to knowledge, as well as opportunities for consultation and evaluation of their work,'' said Adam Urbanski, President of the Rochester, New York, Teachers VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, S7673 July 26, 2000 Association. He went on: ''Unsatisfac- tory teacher performance often stems from inadequate and incompetent su-pervision. Administrators often lack the training and the resources to su-pervise teachers and improve the per-formance of those who are in serious trouble.'' Good teachers are key to learning. Lower math test scores have been cor- related with the percentage of math teachers on emergency permits and higher math test scores were linked both to the teachers' qualifications and to their years of teaching experience, according to ''Professional Develop-ment for Teachers, 2000.'' CALIFORNIA WOULD BENEFIT This bill could be very helpful in California where one-fifth of our teach-ers will leave the profession in three years, according to an article in the February 9, 2000, Los Angeles Times. California will need 300,000 new teachers by 2010. ''More students to teach, smaller classes, teachers leaving or retiring means that California school districts are now having to hire a record 26,000 new teachers each year,'' says the report, ''Teaching and California's Future, 2000.'' California's enrollment is growing at three times the national rate. With these kinds of demands, understaffing often leads to under qualified and new teachers enter-ing the classroom. We have to do all we can to attract and retain good teach-ers. EXAMPLES OF MASTER TEACHER PROGRAMS California has instituted several pro- grams along these lines. California has a program to help beginning teachers. It has grown from $5 million (sup-porting 1,100 new teachers in 1992) to nearly $72 million (serving 23,000 new teachers in 1999-2000). But even with this increase, the program still does not serve all new teachers,'' according to the report, Teaching and Califor-nia's Future, 2000. The Rochester City, New York, school system has a Peer Assistance and Review Program, begun by the schools and the Rochester Teacher As-sociation. The Rochester program is working. ''The evaluation is absolutely spectacular. The program has been a terrific success. It has been deemed a success by mentors, by the panel, by the district, by the union, and, most importantly, by the interns them-selves,'' reported the newspaper, New York Teacher. Delaware provides mentors for begin- ning teachers. ''Not only are beginning teachers receiving the support they need, but the mentoring program is also developing networks among teach-ers within districts and across the state, and the mentors have 'a new en-thusiasm' for teaching,'' as reported in ''Promising Practices'' in 1998. Columbus, Ohio, schools instituted a Peer Assessment and Review program similar to Rochester's. It has two com-ponents: the intern program for all newly hired teachers and the interven-tion program for teachers who are hav-ing difficulties in the classroom teach- ing. According to the State Education Agency, ''the district has a lower rate of attrition than similar districts be-cause of PAR.'' (Promising Practices, 1998). The funds provided in this bill can supplement and expand existing State programs and help other States start new programs. STUDENTS ARE THE WINNERS The true beneficiaries of master teacher programs are the students and that is, or course, our fundamental goal. As stated in Rochester's teaching manual, the goal is ''to improve stu-dent outcomes by developing and main-taining the highest quality of teaching, providing teachers with career options that do not require them to leave teaching to assume additional respon-sibilities and leadership roles.'' I believe this bill can begin to pro- vide teachers the real professional sup-port they need, can attract and retain teachers and can bring to the profes-sion the prestige it deserves. I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this bill. By Mr. MURKOWSKI: S. 2931. A bill to make improvements to the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984; to the Committee on Govern-ment Affairs. IMPROVEMENTS TO THE ARCTIC RESEARCH AND POLICY ACT OF 1984 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to improve the operation of the Arctic Re-search and Policy Act. We have about 15 years of experience with this Act, and the time has come to make some modifications to reflect the experience we have gained over that time. The most important feature of this bill is contained in Section 4. This sec-tion authorizes the Arctic Research Commission, a Presidential Commis-sion, to make grants for scientific re-search. Currently, the Commission can make recommendations and set prior-ities, but it cannot make grants. Our experience with the Act and the Com-mission has shown us that research needs that do not fit neatly in a single agency do not get funded, even if they are compelling priorities. One example is a proposed Arctic contamination initiative that was de-veloped a few years ago after we dis-covered that pollutants from the Former Soviet Union\u2014including radio-nuclides, heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants\u2014were working their way into the Arctic environment. It be-came clear that the job of monitoring and evaluating the threat was too big for any single agency. The Interior De-partment, given its vast land manage-ment responsibilities in Alaska, was in-terested. The Commerce Department, given the jurisdiction over fisheries issues, was interested. The Department of Health and Human Services, given its concern about the health of Alas-ka's indigenous peoples, was inter-ested. The only agency that didn't seem interested in the problem, strangely enough, was the EPA, which at the time was in the process of dis-mantling its Arctic Contaminants pro-gram. Unfortunately, because the job was too big for any single agency, it was difficult to get the level of interagency cooperation necessary for a coordi-nated program. Moreover, agencies were unwilling to make a significant budgetary commitment to a program that wasn't under their exclusive con-trol. If the Arctic Research Commis-sion, which recognized the need, had some funding of its own to leverage agency participation and help to co-ordinate the effort, we would know far more about the Arctic contaminants problem than we do today. Another example is the compelling need to understand the Bering Sea eco-system. Over the past 20 years we have seen significant shifts in some of the populations comprising this ecosystem. King crab populations have declined sharply. Pollock populations have in-creased sharply. Steller sea lion popu-lations have declined as have many types of sea birds. Scientists cannot tell us whether these population shifts are due to abiotic factors such as cli-mate change, biotic factors such as predator-prey relationships, or some combination of both. Because the na-tion depends on this area for a signifi-cant portion of all its seafood, this is not an issue without stakeholders. De-spite the chorus of interests and fed-eral agencies that have said research is needed, a coordinated effort has not yet occurred. If the Arctic Research Commission, which recognized this need early on, had some funding of its own to leverage agency participation and help to coordinate the effort, we would know far more about the Bering Sea ecosystem than we do today. This bill also makes a number of other minor changes in the Act: Section 2 allows the Chairperson of the Commission to receive compensa-tion for up to 120 days per year rather than the 90 days per year currently al-lowed by the Act. The Chairperson has a major role to play in interacting with the Legislative and Executive branches of the government, representing the Commission to non-governmental orga-nizations, in interacting with the State of Alaska, and serving in international fora. In the past, chairpersons have been unable to fully discharge their re-sponsibilities in the 90 day limit speci-fied in the Act. Section 3 authorizes the Commission to award an annual award not to ex-ceed $1,000 to recognize either out-standing research or outstanding ef-forts in support of research in the Arc-tic. The ability to give modest awards will bring recognition to outstanding efforts in Arctic Research which, in turn, will help to stimulate research in the Arctic region. This section also specifies that a current or former Com-mission member is not eligible to re-ceive the award. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7674 July 26, 2000 Section 5 authorizes official rep- resentative and reception activities. Because the Commission is not author-ized to use fund for these kinds of ac-tivities, the Commission has experi-enced embarrassment when they were unable to reciprocate after their for-eign counterparts hosted a reception or lunch on their behalf. Under this provi-sion, the Commission may spend not more than two tenths of one percent of its budget for representation and recep-tion activities in each fiscal year. Mr. President, the Arctic Research and Policy Act and the Arctic Research Commission has worked well over the past 15 years. It can work even better with these modest changes. I look for-ward to working with my colleagues to enact this bill as soon as possible. By Mr. NICKLES: S. 2933. A bill to amend provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 relating to remedial action of uranium and tho-rium processing sites; to the Com-mittee on Energy and Natural Re-sources. TO AMEND PROVISIONS OF THE ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 1992 Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend pro-visions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 relating to remedial action of active uranium and thorium processing sites. On October 24, 1992, President Bush signed the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) into law. Title X of EPACT authorized the Department of Energy to reimburse uranium and tho-rium processing licensees for the por-tion of the costs incurred in the reme-diation of mill tailings, groundwater and other by-product material gen-erated as a result of sales to the federal government pursuant to the Atomic Energy Commission's procurement pro-gram. The Title X reimbursement program has worked very well. The licensees have completed much of the surface reclamation at the Title X sites. How-ever, increasingly stringent remedi-ation standards and groundwater de-contamination programs have signifi-cantly increased the cost and time nec-essary to complete remediation at many sites. Under current law, in order for a licensee to be eligible to recover the federal share of remediation costs incurred subsequent to December 31, 2002, the licensee must describe and quantify all costs expected to be in-curred throughout the remainder of the site's cleanup in a plan for subsequent remedial action. This plan must be sub-mitted to the Department of Energy before December 31, 2001 and approved prior to December 31, 2002. This bill would amend Title X to ex- tend the date, from 2002 to 2007, through which licensees can submit claims for reimbursement under the procedures now in place and extend the date until December 31, 2007 that li-censees must submit their plans for subsequent remedial action to the De-partment of Energy. This legislation does not seek any increase in the exist- ing authorization. It merely provides the time necessary to prepare the plans on a more informed basis and avoid the unintended hardship which would like-ly result from the 2002 deadline. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 2933 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. REMEDIAL ACTION AT ACTIVE URA- NIUM AND THORIUM PROCESSING SITES. Section 1001(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)) is amended\u2014 (1) in paragraph (1)(B)\u2014 (A) in clause (i), by striking ''2002'' and in- serting ''2007''; and (B) in clause (ii), by striking ''placed in es- crow not later than December 31, 2002,'' and inserting ''incurred by a licensee after De-cember 31, 2007,''; and (2) in paragraph (2)(E)(i), by striking ''July 31, 2005'' and inserting ''December 31, 2008''. By Mr. TORRICELLI: S. 2934. A bill to provide for the as- sessment of an increased civil penalty in a case in which a person or entity that is the subject of a civil environ-mental enforcement action has pre-viously violated an environmental law or in a case in which a violation of an environmental law results in a cata-strophic event; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. THE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR REPEAT POLLUTERS ACT OF 2000 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to the in-creased number of environmental en-forcement actions brought against re-peat violators in the United States. In 1970, many of America's rivers and lakes were dying, our city skylines were disappearing behind a shroud of smog, and toxic waste threatened countless communities. Today, after a generation of environmental safe-guards, our rivers and lakes are becom-ing safe for fishing and swimming again. Millions more Americans enjoy clean air and safe drinking water, and many of our worst toxic dumps have been cleaned. Yet more remains to be done before we can truly say our envi-ronment is a healthy environment. Indeed, in 1997 alone, over 11,000 envi- ronmental enforcement actions had to be taken at the State and Federal lev-els. Sadly, it is also becoming much more common for the defendants in these actions to be repeat violators. For instance, in 1994, a chemical com-pany in New Jersey was fined $6,000 for environmental violations. Just four years later, the same chemical com-pany was again cited for an environ-mental crime\u2014releasing cresol into the air. Unfortunately, this time 53 chil-dren and 5 adults had to be hospitalized and the EPA had to evacuate the local community. Incidents such as this are becoming all too common. Under current law, the penalties for repeat environmental vio- lators, or parties responsible for envi-ronmental catastrophes resulting in se-rious injury, are too low. Indeed, paltry fines are insufficient deterrents for large corporations or parties that re-peatedly commit environmental crimes. Between 1994 and 1998, New Jer-sey had 774 repeat violators\u2014more than any other State in the nation. This lack of deterrence has serious re-percussions for the environment and public health. To provide a real safeguard against these repeat violators, today I will in-troduce the ''Zero Tolerance for Repeat Polluters Act of 2000.'' This legislation will create stiffer penalties for repeat violators of environmental safeguards and provides penalties that will more accurately reflect the costs to public health and the environment of cata-strophic events. The bill also gives the EPA emergency order and civil action authority to address imminent and substantial endangerments of health and environment and creates a new EPA trust fund into which recovered funds can be used to address other sig-nificant threats. Repeat environmental polluters that negligently endanger the public with their actions or inaction will not be tolerated. No individual or business should be able to endanger the public's health and safety with only the threat of a slap on the wrist hanging over them. The ''Zero Tolerance for Repeat Polluters Act of 2000'' goes a long way towards ensuring that public health and the environment are truly pro-tected for future generations. By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. G RASSLEY , Ms. M IKULSKI , Mr. B AYH, Mr. REAUX , Ms. COLLINS , and Mr. A KAKA ): S. 2935. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the Public Health Service Act to increase Americans' access to long term health care, and for other pur-poses; to the Committee on Finance. THE OMNIBUS LONG -TERM CARE ACT OF 2000 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to introduce the Omnibus Long-term Care Act of 2000 with my colleagues Sen-ators G RASSLEY , M IKULSKI and A KAKA . Americans in need of long-term care now face a fragmented and inadequate system of state and federal programs. This is no longer acceptable. Millions are struggling today to meet their long-term care needs, and these num-bers will grow dramatically as the country ages. While Medicare reform is important, we will have accomplished little if we address seniors' acute care needs, but then leave them to suffer in poverty when they require long-term care. I am pleased to introduce bipartisan legislation that demonstrates the Sen-ate's commitment to addressing this issue in a comprehensive way. The Om-nibus Long-term Care Act of 2000 will VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7675 July 26, 2000 help millions of seniors and their care- givers who are struggling in our com-munities, while also encouraging all Americans to better plan for their own retirements. Many seniors move to Florida with plans of a comfortable retirement, but all too often, these hopes are never re-alized. A stroke or Alzheimer's Disease strikes and a family is quickly over-whelmed by their long-term care costs and responsibilities. To complicate matters, many spouses of disabled sen-iors are frail themselves, and so find it increasingly difficult to meet the needs of their loved ones. Caregiving is also a huge concern for the millions of Americans in the sand-wich generation, those who are caring both for their children and their par-ents, while also balancing work obliga-tions. Almost one-third of all care-givers is juggling employment and caregiver responsibilities, and of this group, two-thirds have conflicts that require them to quit work, cut hours, or turn down promotions. It is clear that too many Americans are now being forced to sacrifice their health and their careers to care for their loved ones. To help, this bill: pro-vides the disabled or their caregivers with a $3,000 long-term care tax credit; implements the National Family Care-giver Support Program, which will pro-vide caregivers with information and services to help them meet their re-sponsibilities; increases Social Services Block Grant funding for community- based long-term care services; and en-sures that seniors can return to their nursing home after hospitalization. This bill can also avert the long-term care crisis that will result if we do nothing to prepare for the aging of the Baby Boomers. Millions who are strug-gling to care for their parents today will soon need long-term care them-selves. Baby Boomers had a higher di-vorce rate and fewer children than to-day's seniors, so they will not have the same support network that today's re-tirees enjoy. With more seniors needing more paid help in the future, costs will sky-rocket. According to the Congressional Budget Office, individual out-of-pocket costs for long-term care could nearly double from $43 billion today to $82 bil-lion in 2020, and government's costs could increase from $73 billion to $125 billion in the same period. It is clear that future retirees and the govern-ment cannot afford business as usual. We must ask all Americans to take more responsibility for their own long- term care needs. To help bring this about, this bill: offers a tax deduction for the premiums of long-term care in-surance policies; provides long-term care insurance to federal employees; authorizes a national public informa-tion campaign to educate employers and employees about the benefits of long-term care coverage; mandates a federal survey to determine whether cities and counties are ''elder-ready;'' calls for studies to determine how best to meet Americans' future long-term care needs; and includes a Sense of the Senate affirming the body's commit-ment to ensuring seniors' physical, emotional, and financial well-being in the new century. The long-term care crisis we face demonstrates that we have neglected this issue for far too long. But we must act now. The large number of seniors and their caregivers who are suffering in our communities today and the fu-ture needs of the Baby Boomers require it. A big problem requires a big solu-tion, and this bill helps protect seniors today and in the future. All of the cosponsors of this legisla- tion have championed the need to meet seniors' long-term care needs. The fact that we have all come together in a bi-partisan manner demonstrates that the Senate is committed to addressing this issue in a meaningful way. I look for-ward to working with my colleagues and the many organizations that sup-port this bill to make comprehensive long-term care reform a reality. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President I rise as a proud original cosponsor of the Omnibus Long-Term Care Act of 2000. I am very pleased to join Senators G RA- HAM, G RASSLEY , B AYH, C OLLINS , BREAUX , and A KAKA to introduce this bipartisan legislation that provides a comprehensive approach to the long- term care of our nation's citizens. I am committed to finding long-term solu-tions to the long-term care problem in our country. I like this bill because it meets the day-to-day needs of Marylanders and the long-range needs of our country. At least 5.8 million Americans aged 65 and older currently need long-term care. While this legislation has many impor-tant provisions, I would like to high-light three of its features: the National Family Caregiver Support Program, long-term car insurance for federal em-ployees, and the ''return to home'' pro-vision. First, this bill would establish the National Family Caregiver Support Program. I am proud to have sponsored and cosponsored this legislation pre-viously in this Congress. This program will provide respite care, training, counseling, support services, informa-tion and assistance to some of the mil-lions of Americans who care for older individuals and adult children with dis-abilities. In fact, eighty percent of all long-term care services are provided by family and friends. This program has strong bipartisan support, will get be-hind our nation's families, and give help to those who practice self-help. As Ranking Member of the Sub- committee on Aging, I am pleased to report that last week the Health, Edu-cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee unanimously approved a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA). This bill included the caregiver support program which is strongly sup-ported by the entire aging community. As I work with Senators J EFFORDS , KENNEDY , and D EWINE and our col-leagues in the House to pass the OAA reauthorization in September, I want to strongly urge fellow appropriators in the House and Senate to fund these vital caregiver support services as close as possible to the full funding level of $125 million. Millions of Ameri-cans are waiting for Congress to act. Second, I think it is important that this bill includes the Long-Term Care Security Act. This bill would enable federal and military workers, retirees, and their families to purchase long- term care insurance at group rates (projected to be 15-20 percent below the private market). It would create a model that private employers can use to establish their own long-term care insurance programs. As our nation's largest employer, the federal govern-ment can be a model for employers around the country whose workforce will be facing the same long-term care needs. Starting with the nation's larg-est employer also raises awareness and education about long-term care op-tions. Yesterday, the Senate passed the Long-Term Care Security Act (H.R. 4040). I am proud to be the lead Demo-cratic sponsor of the Senate companion to this bill, S. 2420, because it gives people choices, flexibility, and secu-rity. Families will have an additional option available to them as they look at their long-term care choices. This provision would also help reduce reli-ance on federal programs, like Med-icaid, so the American taxpayer bene-fits. This legislation also provides people with flexibility because it allows them to receive care in different types of set-tings. They may choose to be cared for in the home by a family caregiver\u2014or they may need a higher level of care that nursing homes and home health care services provide. Different plan re-imbursement options will ensure max-imum flexibility that meet the unique health care needs of the beneficiary. Long-term care insurance also pro- vides families with some security. Family members will not be burdened by trying to figure out how to finance health care needs\u2014and beneficiaries will be able to make informed decisions about their future. Finally, I am pleased that the bill we have introduced includes bipartisan legislation that I have previously spon-sored, the Seniors' Access to Con-tinuing Care Act (S. 1142). This legisla-tion protects seniors' access to treat-ment in the setting of their choice and ensures that seniors who reside in con-tinuing care communities, and nursing and other facilities have the right to return to that facility after a hos-pitalization, even if the insurer does not have a contract with the resident's facility. Across the country seniors in man- aged care plans have discovered too late that after a hospital stay, they may be forced to return to a facility in the plan's provider network and not to the continuing care retirement com-munity or skilled nursing facility VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7676 July 26, 2000 where they live. No senior should have to face this problem. In Maryland alone, there are over 12,000 residents in 40 continuing care retirement commu-nities and 24,000 residents in over 200 li-censed nursing facilities. I have visited many of these facilities and heard from residents and operators about this seri-ous and unexpected problem. Residents choose and pay for facili- ties like continuing care retirement communities (CCRC's) for the con-tinuum of care, safety, security, and peace of mind. Hospitalization is trau-matic. Friends, family, and familiar staff and faces are crucial to a speedy recovery. Where you return after a hos-pital stay should be based on humanity and choice, not the managed care com-pany's bottom line. Specifically, the Seniors' Access to Continuing Care Act protects residents of CCRC's and nursing facilities by: en-abling them to return to their facility after a hospitalization; and requiring the resident's insurer or managed care organization (MCO) to cover the cost of the care, even if the insurer does not have a contract with the resident's fa-cility. Certain conditions must be met. This legislation also requires an in- surer or MCO to pay for a service to one of its beneficiaries, without a prior hospital stay, if the service is nec-essary to prevent a hospitalization of the beneficiary and the service is pro-vided as an additional benefit. Lastly, the bill requires an insurer or MCO to provide coverage to a beneficiary for services provided at a facility in which the beneficiary's spouse already re-sides, even if the facility is not under contract with the MCO. Certain re-quirements must be met. These provi-sions are an important part of our safe-ty net for seniors. I want to salute the strong leadership of the other cosponsors of this legisla-tion who have authored various provi-sions of this comprehensive bill that we have joined together to introduce today. I know that all the cosponsors are sincerely committed, as I am, to addressing the challenges facing our aging population. I look forward to working with all of them to enact this important legislation. Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I cosponsor the Omnibus Long-term Care Act of 2000, introduced by Senator G RAHAM . The cosponsors of this legislation are well- known for their commitment to en-couraging all Americans to prepare for their own long-term needs. Many Americans mistakenly believe that Medicare and their regular health insurance programs will pay for long- term care. They do not. Although Medicare provides some long-term care support, an individual generally must ''spend-down'' his or her income and assets to qualify for coverage. More and more Americans are requir- ing long-term care. About 6.4 million Americans, aged 65 or older, require some long-term care due to illness or disability. Over five million children and adults under the age of 65 also re- quire long-term care because of health conditions from birth or a chronic ill-ness developed later in life. Only 12 per-cent receive care in nursing homes or other institutional settings. The need for long-term care is great. In 20 years, one in six Americans will be age 65 or older. By the year 2040, the number of Americans age 85 years or older will more than triple to over 12 million. The cost of nursing home care now exceeds $40,000 per a year in most parts of the country, and home care visits for nursing or physical therapy runs about $100 per visit. In 1996, over $107 billion was spent on nursing homes and home health care. However, this figure does not take into account that over 80 percent of all long-term care services are provided by family and friends. In my own state of Hawaii, 13.2 per- cent of the population is 65 years and older. Although Hawaii enjoys one of the highest life expectancies\u201479 years, compared to a national average of 75 years\u2014the state's rapidly aging popu-lation will greatly impact available re-sources for long-term care, both insti-tutional and from non-institutional sources. Hawaii's long-term care facili-ties are operating at full capacity. Ac-cording to the Hawaii State Depart-ment of Health, the average occupancy rate peaked at 97.8 percent in 1994. But occupancy remains high. By 1997, the average occupancy dropped to 90 per-cent. These statistics point to the over- riding need to help American families provide dignified and appropriate care to their parents and relatives. We know that the demand for long-term care will increase with each passing year, and that federal, state, and local re-sources cannot cover the expected costs. Nursing home costs are expected to reach $97,000 by the year 2030. What Congress can do, however, it make long-term care insurance avail-able to a broad segment of the popu-lation. As the ranking minority mem-ber of the Subcommittee on Federal Services, I co-chaired a hearing on long-term care insurance on May 16, 2000. We heard testimony on S. 2420, legislation to authorize the Office of Personnel Management to contract with one or more insurance carriers for long-term care insurance for federal and military personnel and their fami-lies. As a cosponsor of that bill, I am pleased that just last night, the Senate passed our measure after substituting the text of S. 2420 under H.R. 4040, the House long-term care bill for the fed-eral family. The bill, as amended, also includes provisions of S. 1232, the Fed-eral Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act, which I cosponsored with Senator C OCHRAN last year. These provisions will provide relief to the es-timated 20,000 federal employees who, through no fault of their own, found themselves in the wrong retirement system. H.R. 4040, as amended, offer a model for the private sector. I am de-lighted that similar legislation pro- viding long-term care insurance for federal employees and military per-sonnel is included in Senator G RAHAM 's bill, and I welcome the opportunity to join with him in helping Americans meet their long-term care needs in a dignified manner. The bill introduced today provides a comprehensive effort to address our citizens' long-term care needs. Among its provisions are the authorization of a phased-in tax deduction for the pre-miums of qualified long-term care in-surance, implementation of the Na-tional Family Caregiver Support Pro-gram, restoration of $2.38 billion au-thorization for the Social Services Block Grant, and creation of a national public information campaign. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original sponsor of this bill. By Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. DASCHLE , Mr. B AUCUS , Mr. BREAUX , Mr. D ODD, Mr. D ORGAN , Mr. J OHNSON , Mr. K ENNEDY , IEBERMAN , INCOLN , EID, Mr. , Mr. , Mr. T ARKIN , and Mr. B AYH): S. 2936. A bill to provide incentives for new markets and community devel-opment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance. CREATING NEW MARKETS AND EMPOWERING AMERICA ACT OF 2000 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Creating New Markets and Empowering America Act of 2000, which is designed to strengthen and revitalize low and moderate in-come communities across America. Because we made some tough choices to balance our budget, we have the first federal surplus since Lyndon Johnson was President. And now is the time to give some back, particularly to those who have missed out on so much of our economic prosperity. This legis-lation would pump new capital into our nation's inner cities and isolated rural communities\u2014areas that have had a difficult time building up from within. The legislation contains three ''New Markets'' initiatives designed to at-tract and expand new capital into low to moderate income areas. First, a New Markets Tax Credit would infuse $15 billion in investments over the next 7 years through a 30 percent tax credit for businesses who provide capital to lower income communities. Secondly, the bill authorizes the designation of America's Private Investment Compa-nies (APIC's) which would receive fed-eral matching funds for private invest-ments made in lower income areas. This provision would allow $1 billion in federal low-cost loans to match $500 million in private investment. Thirdly, the bill would create a new class of venture capital funds to assist with the operation and administration of ongo-ing businesses in lower income areas, who have growth potential, so they can continue to expand. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7677 July 26, 2000 The bill also requires mandatory funding for Round II Empowerment Zones (EZ's) and Enterprise Commu-nities (EC's) and creates a new set of Round III EZ's. Mr. President, the mandatory fund- ing of Round II Empowerment Zones is critically important to the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia. The Federal Government made a commit-ment to these two communities\u2014they need and deserve the funding\u2014and I am determined to get the check in the mail to them. With this legislation, the Norfolk-Portsmouth Empowerment Zone would be guaranteed the remain-ing $94 million it was promised when it competed for the Empowerment Zone designation. The legislation I'm introducing today also creates 40 Renewal Communities\u2014 which reflect the agreement between President Clinton and Speaker H ASTERT \u2014along with a host of tax pro- visions to expand and revitalize hous-ing. Very important to my home state of Virginia, this bill contains legislation I introduced earlier this year (S. 2445) to assist communities affected by job loss due to trade. The Assistance in Devel-opment for Communities Act (AID for Communities Act) both assists commu-nities in developing a plan to retool their economies and offers financial as-sistance and tax incentives to help communities implement those plans. Mr. President, the AID for Commu- nities Act is immensely important to the people of Martinsville, Virginia\u2014 who have suffered economic devasta-tion from the recent closing of a Tultex plant. This bill would give the citizens of Martinsville the urgent assistance they need to strengthen their economy and create a more vibrant future for all who live there. Finally, Mr. President, this legisla- tion includes two new initiatives to help religious and other community or-ganizations better participate in fed-eral grant programs. Specifically, it re-quires the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to pro-vide assistance in a manner similar to HUD's Office of Community and Faith- Based Organizations to assist faith- based and community organizations in applying for federal grant funds to pro-vide substance abuse treatment. It would also require the IRS to provide guidance and make information avail-able to assist religious and community organizations in establishing tax-ex-empt entities that can be used to oper-ate social services. Many of these organizations are un- familiar with the process necessary to set up a tax-exempt organization and are, therefore, unable to participate in federal grant programs. This provision would provide them with the necessary information and assistance. Mr. President, the ''Creating New Markets and Empowering America Act of 2000'' will spur economic growth in low to moderate income communities across our nation. As such, it will im-prove the lives of countless Americans. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the Creating New Markets and Empowering America Act of 2000. We are living in a time of un-precedented prosperity. However this prosperity has not reached every Amer-ican equally. The boom on Wall Street has not reached Main Street in many regions of our nation. The problem is quite simple. Many of our lower income communities are unable to attract the investment capital that is allowing more affluent areas to flourish. As the United States economy continues to grow it has become more and more ap-parent that attracting capital to these communities is one of the largest chal-lenges facing the private sector and all levels of government. It is important to keep in mind that this is not just an urban problem. Many rural communities, especially those that rely on agriculture, are watching their jobs disappear with nothing on the horizon in the form of new business or industry to offer much hope. My home state of Montana is fac-ing this economic turmoil right now. A state that was built on agriculture, mining, and timber has watched these industries diminish to the point that Montana is now 50th in per-capita in-come relative to other states\u2014dead last. We often hear the phrase ''digital di- vide.'' Well, Montana is standing on the edge of an economic divide, but we are not quitters. Montana has much to offer. We have an unparalleled quality of life, a highly-educated work force, a burgeoning high-tech sector, and top- notch schools. In many respects, we are right on the cusp of an economic up-swing. However, we are having an ex-tremely difficult time attracting the investment capital that we need to be-come a partner in the Internet main-stream, create good paying jobs, and truly turn the economic corner. This past June over the course of two days, I convened a Montana Economic Development Summit that brought to-gether not only our state's leaders and decision makers, but also outside ex-perts in various disciplines in an effort to build a road map for improving Mon-tana's economy. We covered many issues, but primarily focused on high- tech, business development, and mar-keting and trade. We tackled tough questions such as how we retain and support our current businesses and also attract new businesses that truly fit with Montanans and their values. Three points came up time and again. First, the need for and inability to get the necessary investment capital. We simply do not have the population or resources available that larger states enjoy. Second, our window of oppor-tunity is closing. Time moves faster than it used to and if we don't act quickly the world will move right past us. Third, and most importantly, any action or strategy that we take must come from begin locally. Economic de- velopment initiatives must be bottom- up and not top-down or they just will not work. It is for these three reasons that I am cosponsoring this legislation. The New Markets proposals are a quick and effi-cient way to leverage the necessary in-vestment in lower-income communities through private/public partnerships. And it will give these communities the tools they need to map their own eco-nomic destiny and create the better paying jobs that are so desperately needed. Two portions illustrate the private/ public partnership. On the public side, the Trade Adjustment Assistance pro-vision will enhance the ability of each community to be proactive in crafting a long-term strategy for economic de-velopment. This is crucial for commu-nities and regions in rural areas that are natural resource dependent and have suffered severe employment losses in the past decade. For the private sec-tor, the New Markets tax credit will create opportunity by providing a tan-gible incentive for companies to take a serious look at areas of the country that are currently being ignored. In closing, this legislation will pro- vide the necessary ingredients for revi-talizing America's less fortunate rural areas. It will help target investment to these communities and it will allow them the flexibility to build their economies on their terms and their ability. I commend my colleague from Virginia, Senator R OBB, for intro- ducing such proactive legislation that addresses several of the most urgent issues facing economically troubled areas. Finally, I urge my colleagues to work together and pass this legislation so that states like Montana can begin their long climb back up to economic stability and prosperity. Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join Senator R OBB and 16 other col- leagues to introduce comprehensive legislation aimed at spurring economic development and person empowerment in our inner cities and isolated rural areas. Our economy is booming, and has been for most of the 90s, yet there are still individuals and families who are struggling. What we've tried to do is develop eco- nomic incentives that will encourage business development and remove bar-riers that make it hard for entre-preneurs, community organizations and individuals to build healthy com-munities. Among the many important initia- tives in this bill is my new markets legislation that I introduced last Sep-tember, S. 1594, the Community Devel-opment and Venture Capital Act, which passed the Senate Committee on Small Business today, and as part of the Clinton/Hastert package in the House yesterday. It also includes full funding for Round II of Empowerment Zones. The Community Development and Venture Capital Act has three parts: a VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7678 July 26, 2000 venture capital program to funnel in- vestment money into distressed com-munities; Senator W ELLSTONE 's pro- gram to expand the number of venture capital firms and professionals who are devoted to investing in such commu-nities; and a mentoring program to link established, successful businesses with small businesses owners in stag-nant or deteriorating communities in order to facilitate the learning curve. The venture capital program is mod- eled after the Small Business Adminis-tration's successful Small Business In-vestment Company program. As SBA Administrator Alvarez pointed out just last week in a Small Business Com-mittee hearing, the SBIC program has been so successful that it has generated more than $19 billion in investments in more than 13,000 businesses since 1992. And, in the past five years, the SBIC participating securities program has returned $224 million in profits, vir-tually paying for itself for the past nine years. As successful as that program is, it does not sufficiently reach areas of our country that need economic develop-ment the most. One, out of the total $4.2 billion that SBICs invested last year, only 1.6 percent were deals of less than $1 million dollars in LMI areas. Two, only $1.1 million of that $4.2 bil-lion went to LMI investments in rural areas. Three, in 1999, 85 percent of SBIC deals were $10 million and more. In broader terms, the economy is booming. Since 1993, almost 21 million jobs have been created. Since 1992, un-employment has shrunk from 7.5 per-cent to 4 percent. In the past two years, we've paid down the debt $140 billion, and CBO currently projects a surplus of $176 billion. Some estimates even say more than $2 trillion. In spite of these impressive numbers, one out of five children grows up in poverty and there are pockets of America where un-employment is as high as 14 percent. We can make a difference by invest- ing in a new industry of community de-velopment venture capital funds that target investment capital and business expertise into low- and moderate-in-come areas to develop and expand local businesses that create jobs and allevi-ate economic distress. The existing 25 or 30 community development venture capital funds have set out to dem-onstrate that the same model of busi-ness development that has driven eco-nomic expansion in Silicon Valley and Route 128 Massachusetts can also make a powerful difference in areas like the inner-city areas of Boston's Roxbury or New York's East Harlem, or the rural desolation of Kentucky's Appalachia or Mississippi's Delta region. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan says ''Credit alone is not the answer. Businesses must have equity capital before they are consid-ered viable candidates for debt financ-ing.'' He emphasizes that this is par-ticularly important in lower-income communities. What I'm trying to do as Ranking Member of the Small Business Com-mittee, and have been working with the SBA to achieve, is expand invest-ment in our neediest communities by building on the economic activity cre-ated by loans. I think one of the most effective ways to do that is to spur ven-ture capital investment in our neediest communities. I am very glad that Sen-ator R OBB and my other colleagues agreed to include this powerful eco-nomic development plan in this legisla-tion. Switching to another provision in this bill, this legislation builds on the President's and Speaker's agreement by securing full, mandatory funding for Massachusett's Empowerment Zone. As I said earlier, this passed the full House yesterday by a vote of 394 to 27. Full, mandatory funding is important be-cause, so far, the money has dribbled in\u2014only $6.6 million of the $100 million authorized over ten years\u2014and made it impossible for the city to implement a plan for economic self-sufficiency. Some 80 public and private entities, from universities to technology compa-nies to banks to local government, showed incredible community spirit and committed to matching the EZ money, eight to one. Let me say it an-other way\u2014these groups agreed to match the $100 million in Federal Em-powerment Zone money with $800 mil-lion. Yet, regrettably, in spite of this incredible alliance, the city of Boston has not been able to tap into that le-veraged money and implement the strategic plan because Congress hasn't held up its part of the bargain. I am ex-tremely pleased that we were able to work together and find a way to pro-vide full, steady funding to these zones. That money means education, daycare, transportation and basic health care in areas\u2014in Massachusetts that includes 57,000 residents who live in Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattipan\u2014where al-most 50 percent of the children are liv-ing in poverty and nearly half the resi-dents over 25 don't even have a high school diploma Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their work on this important legis-lation. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to give my support to the Cre-ating New Markets and Empowering America Act of 2000. In a time of un-precedented economic prosperity, there are too many communities in this na-tion that are beleaguered by crumbling infrastructures and stagnant econo-mies. This legislation will help attract capital, produce much-needed housing, and encourage private investment to communities most in need. I am proud to join in cosponsoring this legislation and would like to thank Senator R OBB for all his hard work in crafting this bill. Of particular importance to my home state of Vermont are increases in the Low In-come Housing Tax Credit and Private Activity Bond cap. Vermont is currently in the middle of an affordable housing crisis. Produc-tion has stalled and demand has risen. In Chittenden County, one of Vermont's most populated areas, resi-dents face a rental vacancy rate of less than one percent. Housing costs are so expensive, middle income families are being forced into hotels, college dorms, homeless shelters, or left out on the street. Sadly, this is a situation that is being repeated nationwide. As funding for other federal housing assistance programs has diminished, states depend more and more on the LIHTC and private activity bonds to fi-nance affordable housing projects. The LIHTC has been extremely successful since its enactment as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Today, the LIHTC is one of the primary tools that states have to attract private investment in affordable rental housing. In Vermont, the LIHTC has made possible the pro-duction, rehabilitation, and preserva-tion of over 2,600 affordable apartments since 1987. Unfortunately this credit has not been increased since its cre-ation nearly fourteen years ago. Today, the demand for tax credits far exceeds their availability. This year in Vermont, over $2.5 million in credits were requested but only $718,000 were available. I am pleased that this bill raises the annual per capita allocation of tax credits from $1.25 to $1.75 and indexes the credit to inflation. In addition to the increased per capita allocation, I hope to work a small state minimum. Such a floor would help to ensure that small states like Vermont have access to the resources they need to provide affordable housing for every resident in need. Private activity bonds also play an important role in providing affordable housing for Vermonters. In 1986 the Federal Tax Reform Act limited the amount of tax-exempt bonds that each state could issue to no more than $50 per capita. There has not been an infla-tion adjustment to the cap since its in-ception. The Vermont Housing Finance Agency (VHFA) has issued over $1.25 billion in private activity bonds since 1974, bonds which have helped make the dream of home ownership a reality for over 20,425 Vermont households. I am pleased that this bill includes a cap in-crease from $50 to $75 per capita which will help Vermont's finance agencies continue this success. Again, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill which will offer many households, businesses and commu-nities new opportunities as we enter the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legisla-tion. By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. W YDEN , Mr. G RASSLEY , and Mr. K ERREY ): S. 2937. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to improve ac-cess to Medicare+Choice plans through an increase in the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rates and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7679 July 26, 2000 THE MEDICARE GEOGRAPHIC FAIR PAYMENT ACT OF 2000 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with some very distinguished colleagues from both sides of the aisle\u2014Senator W YDEN , who is here, and Senator G RASSLEY , who is not here\u2014 who are cosponsors of this measure, along with Senator B OBKERREY of Ne- braska. Mr. President, let me suggest for Senators' staff who are looking at this to look alphabetically. You will find how much is being reimbursed in your cities for the Medicare+Choice reim-bursement. Look at it, and you will see how the HMOs are reimbursed to pro-vide this rather good, fair, and com-petitive coverage to the senior citizens. You will be astounded. Many people think New York is covered. They are getting a very high rate of reimburse-ment because they started high. But look at some of the cities in New York. You will find that New York has a number of cities that are under $450. We reimburse them on the high level\u2014 as high as $800. The bill we are introducing today we are going to call the Medicare Geo-graphic Fair Payment Act. Week after week, the Federal Government deducts a portion of everyone's paycheck to support the Medicare program. After our seniors have retired and begin to take advantage of the program they have supported for so many years, I think it is fair that they continue to have a choice. Right now they have a choice. But the choice is really not for all seniors because we made a decision when we put in the Medicare+Choice Program, which was really an alternative that seniors could choose. We made a deci-sion as to how we would reimburse the provider. That decision was made based upon, as I understand from my good friend, Senator W YDEN \u2014allegedly based on what they needed to get the job done to get the program going. I don't intend to be critical, but in many instances those who had not been frugal, had not been careful about costs, got high reimbursements. But if you lived in Senator W YDEN 's State or New Mexico, where they were being ex-tremely frugal in what they charged for the services, they got a very low rate. It is unfortunate, but for Staten Is- land the rates of reimbursement are $814; $794 for Dade County\u2014I am not complaining; I am stating a dollar amount\u2014$702 for New Orleans; and $661 for Los Angeles. Senator W YDEN , perhaps, could inter- vene and tell me what it is in Portland. Mr. WYDEN. $445. Mr. DOMENICI. $445; Albuquerque is $430, $15 under Oregon. That is all the government will give as reimburse-ment if you decide to get into the HMO business with hospitals and everybody else joining together, if you are going to furnish this service. Remember, there are some places getting $800-plus. I am not here to take away anything from anyone. That is how our amend-ment is different. We are not trying to take the pie, leave it the same size, and say those who are getting more money have to cut back. Rural areas are even lower and are expected to provide the same level of benefits or nearly half the reimbursement. There were seniors who had a mar- velous Medicare+Choice Program. Why was it good? It was good because for a reasonable cost they were getting pre-scription drugs, which you don't get under Medicare, and the whole package was new benefits. Some of them got dental insurance, which they don't get. Some of them got a number of different things they don't get under Medicare, for a premium they could afford. These programs are being closed down every day we delay. Thousands of seniors are getting notices. They had a good program, but they won't have it in January. I want everybody to know if there are going to be any entitle-ment bills getting out of here on any-thing that is even close to Medicare, this is an amendment that will be on there\u2014or something better. This amendment says by January 1st of this year, the rates are raised. They are these low rates we are talking about. Very simply, under this bill, we will change the rates. It is pretty easy for everybody to un- derstand. This is not a complicated bill. What we are doing is saying for those metropolitan areas which are 250,000 or more, the minimum reim-bursement will be $525. If we can't get that through here to preserve some of these plans where seniors are just fall-ing off the log, desperately getting their notices, and raising it to $525, then I don't know what is fair around here anymore. For all the rural coun-ties, we have raised the minimum to $475. My friend, Senator W YDEN , can talk about his State and about his observa-tions. Clearly, he has been asking ev-erybody around here, including the Budget Committee, to have hearings on this great disparity which he calls pe-nalizing efficiency. The truth of the matter is in my home city and in my State of New Mex-ico, what is happening, the HMO com-panies can no longer stay in business. Seniors are getting notified. In fact, we don't have a lot of people under this program\u201415,000 are going to get knocked off the program right now, very soon. If you think they are not going to meetings, they met with Heather Wilson, one of our representa-tives, and 400 people showed up because they read in the newspaper she was holding a meeting and they already got their notices: Come January, find a new plan. They are asking: Why? The plan is good. It is very good for me. I have been paying all my life. Why are you taking this away? I ask Senators to take a look. In my case, we will get $34 million in addi-tional reimbursements during the first year and $170 out of this bill. Inciden-tally, this bill will cost $700 million the first year. I say to the thousands of seniors who may be able to keep their insurance and be under this kind of program, that is a pretty good bargain. Over 5 years, it will cost $3.7 billion. It also includes a third provision which I ask Senators to look at. It is the product of some very wise thinking by Senator Grassley. It should have been separately called the G RASSLEY bill, but it is packaged in this as our third title. It says essentially hospitals will hereinafter be reimbursed on labor costs\u2014on what the actual cost is, not on what the stated cost is. That makes the payment to hospitals go up sub-stantially. My small State will go up about $6.5 million over the year. I don't know what it would be in a State such as Ohio, but it would be rather substan-tial. I have extensive research, with cities alphabetically listed. Just look for your city and see what the reimburse-ment rate is. If it is under $525, we will take it to $525. If there are rural coun-ties that are not in these lists, call home and ask what some of the coun-ties are getting reimbursed. Raising it to $475 will help an awful lot of people. Is it enough? I don't know. I want to get something done. My friend wants to get something done, as do my two cosponsors. I assume in a couple of days or a week we will have a lot more Senators, bipartisan, asking to be on this. I remind everyone, the total cost of doing a bit of fairness to seniors and ending discrimination by region is going to be $700 million in the first year and $3.7 over 5. We have been talk-ing about astronomical numbers for Medicare reform, prescription drugs. I don't know where we will end up. I hope in the heat of this political 6 weeks we don't do anything major, be-cause it will be wrong, but clearly we have to do something. Come January 1, if we don't put money into this reimbursement pro-gram, I think my friend, who has fol-lowed this carefully, will say hundreds of thousands of seniors will be denied the option to buy coverage which they think is rather good in many cases, in-cluding prescription drugs, for which they only have to pay $50 extra. They can't get that anywhere else. They got extensive coverage of items in their health care needs that are not covered anywhere. I very much thank the Senators who are cosponsoring, Senators W YDEN , GRASSLEY , and B OBKERREY of Ne- braska. We will have more. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the bill and additional mate-rial be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 2937 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for the oppor-tunity to be involved in this issue. I think the chairman has said it very well. In effect, what he has done is make the case for why the bill we are proposing is absolutely essential to modernize the Medicare program. If there is one principle that Medi- care is going to have to stand for in the 21st century, it is that we must change this system which now literally re-wards waste and penalizes frugality. Medicare has an HMO reimbursement system today which is, even by beltway standards, perverse. It sends the mes-sage if you are really inefficient, if you have not taken the steps that Colorado and Oregon and other States have taken, don't worry about it, don't go out and make the tough choices about introducing competition to your com-munity. The Federal Government will just keep sending you big checks. I think it is absolutely key, espe- cially given the fact that close to a million seniors are going to lose their HMO coverage this year\u2014close to a million seniors will lose their coverage this year\u2014that we pass this bipartisan legislation. I think the chairman is right. I think by the end of the next couple of days, we will have many other colleagues from both political parties here. I see my friend, Senator S MITH of Oregon, has come into the Chamber. He and I have worked on this issue since he has come to the Senate as part of our bipartisan agenda for Or-egon. I am going to talk for a few min- utes to try to elaborate on some of the themes Chairman D OMENICI has so elo- quently addressed. As we have seen in Oregon and New Mexico and so many other States, the present HMO reimbursement system is literally driving HMO plans out of the program and leaving seniors across this country petrified about their future health care in their communities. What senior after senior asks at this point is how can it be that since they pay the same amount for hospitalization and outpatient services, if they live in Pen-dleton or they live in Portland, they pay the same amount for outpatient and hospitalization services as seniors in other parts of the country yet the Federal Government does not send an equal payment to folks in Pendleton and Portland? As Chairman D OMENICI has very specifically and eloquently de-scribed, they send dramatically dif-ferent payments to communities across this country. So you can have commu-nities, for example, on the east coast, that literally get twice the reimburse-ment of communities in Oregon and New Mexico. We hear about it very bluntly from our constituents. You can have a sen-ior in Pendleton or Coos Bay call up their cousin in one of the cities back East and ask their cousin about Medi-care, how it is going. The senior back East says: You know, it goes great. I get prescription drugs for only a few dollars a month. I also get dental coverage. I get free hearing aids. How is it going for you there in Coos Bay or Pendleton or Al-buquerque, NM? How is Medicare going for you? That senior in Albuquerque or Pen- dleton or Portland wants to throw the telephone through the living room win-dow because they don't get that pre-scription drug coverage, hearing aids, or dental coverage because the reim-bursement is as low as Chairman D OMENICI has described. The Congress was supposed to have begun, several years ago, a bipartisan effort to change this. The system was called a blended rate. In effect, over the next few years, we would move to a national system, so instead of driving some of these high-cost areas down pre-cipitously, we would move low-cost areas up over the next few years. Un-fortunately, that system has been de-layed. It has been delayed, in my view, in a fashion that has made for many plans saying they can no longer afford to stay in business; certainly no longer afford to offer some of those benefits such as prescription drugs, which are so important to seniors. That is why Chairman D OMENICI and I and Senator G RASSLEY and Senator KERREY and I know many of our col- leagues are going to join in a bipar-tisan effort, first, to establish a min-imum payment floor for urban coun-ties; second, to boost the rural counties where, again, these programs have barely been able to survive as a result of low reimbursement rates; and, third, to address the concerns with respect to wages that Senator G RASSLEY has so eloquently described. But I am of the view that if this Congress is to mod-ernize the Medicare program, the es-sence of such a modernization effort is to create more options and more choices. That will not be possible if you perpetuate an HMO reimbursement system that day after day after day pe-nalizes frugality and rewards waste. For those who really want to get into the details of this subject, the system is known as the AAPCC, the average adjusted per capita cost. The way it has worked, the HMOs are reimbursed by the Federal Government through a system that historically has looked at average local costs of various proce-dures, such as a heart bypass in Pen-dleton or cataract operation in Port-land\u2014and then you calculate a formula for reimbursing these HMOs, using a percentage of the fee-for-service costs for health care in the area. But at the end of the day, the mes- sage is, if you are wasteful, don't worry about it. If you are inefficient, the Fed-eral Government is going to say maybe that is not ideal, but we will just send you a check to reflect the fact that you are not taking steps to hold down your costs and we are not going to give you any consequences as a result. That makes no sense to Senator D OMENICI and me and our cosponsors. I know it makes no sense to the Pre-siding Officer because he and I have talked about this innumerable times. We tried to boost reimbursement rates for the people of Oregon. We have to change the Medicare program to elimi-nate the discrimination against com-munities that control costs while offer-ing good quality care. Our bipartisan legislation is not just a one-time infusion of money. We structured it so that money becomes part of a base for future increases, which in my view helps to jump-start what Congress intended several years ago by passing legislation to promote a nationwide blended rate. We all understand that at present, as we look to the last days of the session, with the budget surplus, it is going to be possible to use a portion of that sur-plus, after we have helped pay down the debt, after hopefully there is a tar-geted tax cut; at that point, we will have some dollars to take the steps to better meet the health care needs of older people and also jump start the modernization of the Medicare pro-gram. Our legislation, I hope, will be part of that effort. I think Chairman D OMENICI and Senator G RASSLEY , among our co- sponsors, are very likely to be in the room at the end of the day when that legislation is being offered. I and oth-ers are going to do our best to support those efforts in the Budget Committee. I know the Presiding Officer and I have used every opportunity to raise these issues, and we are going to continue to do so. Our State has been a pioneer in the health care reform area. We are proud of the fact that we are the first State in the country to have made tough choices about health care priorities through the Oregon health plan. We are proud of the fact that we have been able to introduce more choices and more competition to the health care system and, as a result, seniors in our State are able to get more for their health care dollar. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7687 July 26, 2000 It is not right for older people in Or- egon, New Mexico, Iowa, and in other States where they have done the heavy lifting and they have taken steps to hold down their costs, to be discrimi-nated against by the Federal Govern-ment. This bipartisan legislation, in my view, is going to help keep HMOs that are currently in the program in the program, and it will begin the process of bringing back to Medicare some of those we have lost because they have been discriminated against in the past with respect to reimbursement and they could not keep their doors open. We will be talking about this legisla- tion frequently in the last few days of this Congress and in the fall, and I be-lieve passing this legislation, as we look at that final budget bill that is sure to be part of our fall debates, that this is one of the best ways we can tar-get dollars that need to be spent care-fully so as to maximize the values of what we are getting in health care for older people. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I could not help but hear the words of Senator W YDEN and Senator D OMENICI about the terrible situation we have across this country today in regard to HMOs dropping senior citizens off the Medicare Plus Choice Program. While I was Governor of the State of Ohio, we had several instances where people were thrown off the rolls of their HMO and forced to be without any kind of supplemental insurance or prescription drug benefits. It is a grow-ing epidemic today in the United States of America. I want to go on record in support of the legislation of Senator W YDEN and Senator D OMENICI . In fact, earlier today I asked Senator D OMENICI if I could be a cosponsor of this legislation. It is important to point out that some of the on-budget surplus that we now have in the year 2000 and the pro-jected $102 billion in 2001 is generated by the fact that projected Medicare costs are coming in far below what they anticipated because of the for-mula that was adopted in 1997. It seems to me we ought to look at the situation as it really is, increase the reimburse-ment to those HMOs so individuals can stay in those programs, and so they don't have to buy Medigap insurance to cover out-of-pocket expenses and pre-scription drugs. It seems to me it should be our re- sponsibility to make sure those who are now covered remain covered and not be thrown out on the street. I have read so often: Don't worry about those people, somebody else will pick them up, or they can go to fee for service. When they go to fee for service, they don't get their 20 percent out-of-pocket paid for, nor does Medicare pick up pre-scription drugs. It is time for this Congress to step in and change the system, increase the re-imbursement, keep those individuals who are on Medicare Plus Choice Pro-grams so they can maintain coverage for out-of-pocket expenses and main-tain the prescription drug coverage they have. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to note the introduction of the Medi-care Geographic Fair Payment Act of 2000. I'm very pleased to join Senators D OMENICI , WYDEN , and K ERREY in this effort. While we share the problem of low payment rates, Iowa and Nebraska are in a different situation than New Mexico and Oregon. Those two states are concerned about Medicare + Choice plans leaving, but for the most part we in Iowa are still waiting for plans to arrive. There are a number of things that have to fall into place for Medi-care + Choice to become a reality in Iowa, but one of them is increasing payment rates. I want to make sure that if Congress provides any relief in Medicare + Choice this year, that low- cost areas are not forgotten. We need to make Medicare + Choice a truly na-tional program. There are two simple Medicare + Choice payment provisions in the bill. It would raise the minimum payment floor for all counties from the current $415 to $475 in 2001. This would pri-marily benefit rural and small urban areas, including the vast majority of Iowa. Secondly, it would establish a new minimum payment floor of $525 for all counties in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with populations exceed-ing 250,000. In Iowa, this would mean a substantial incentive for plans to enter the Des Moines and Quad Cities areas. As I've said so often throughout the five-plus years that I've been working on this issue, people in low-cost states like Iowa pay the same payroll taxes as those in high-cost areas. So it's a mat-ter of simple fairness and equity that all seniors have access to the choices in Medicare, wherever they live. The problem with Medicare + Choice has been that payment rates are based on fee-for-service payment rates in the same county; thus, cost-effective re-gions like ours are punished. This makes no sense. We took our first step toward breaking that unfortunate link in 1997, and I have high hopes that we will take another big step with this bill in 2000. We in low-cost regions have to keep the fight for equity going on two fronts: Medicare + Choice payment, and traditional Medicare payment. The latter is harder for Congress to change, because we have to identify inequities in the various Medicare payment poli-cies and fix them one by one. I thank my colleagues for including in this bill my earlier bill on the hospital wage index, which is one of those flaws in fee-for-service Medicare that cries out to be fixed. I look forward to the Finance Com- mittee's Medicare discussions this fall; this is the kind of legislation that mer-its serious consideration there. By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. R OCKEFELLER , Mr. J EF- FORDS , and Mrs. L INCOLN ): S. 2939. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a cred-it against tax for energy efficient ap- pliances; to the Committee on Finance. THE RESOURCE EFFICIENT APPLIANCE INCENTIVE ACT Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President I rise today to introduce an extremely time-ly piece of legislation in light of the current energy crisis facing our nation. This legislation, entitled ''The Re-source Efficient Appliance Incentive Act,'' will provide a valuable incentive to accelerate and expand the produc-tion and market penetration of ultra energy-efficient appliances. Senator R OCKEFELLER is joining me in this bi- partisan effort, along with Senators J EFFORDS and L INCOLN . Earlier this year, the appliance in- dustry, the Department of Energy, and the nation's leading energy-efficiency and environmental organizations came together and agreed upon significantly higher energy efficiency standards for clothes washers to accompany the new energy efficiency standards for refrig-erators that go into effect in July 2001, as well as the new criteria for achiev-ing the voluntary ''Energy Star'' des-ignation. This agreement is significant considering the fact that clothes wash-ers and dryers, together with refrig-erators, account for approximately 15 percent of all household energy con-sumed in the United States. This legislation will provide a tax credit to assist in the development of super energy-efficient washing ma-chines and refrigerators, and creates the incentives necessary to increase the production and sale of these appli-ances in the short term. Manufacturers would be eligible to claim a credit of either $50 or $100, depending on effi-ciency level, for each super energy-effi-cient washing machine produced be-tween 2001 and 2006. Likewise, manu-facturers would be eligible to claim a credit of $50 or $100, depending on effi-ciency level, for each super energy-effi-cient refrigerator produced between 2001 and 2006. It is estimated that this tax credit will increase the production and purchase of super energy-efficient washers by almost 200 percent, and the purchase of super energy-efficient re-frigerators by over 285 percent. Equally important is the long-term environmental benefits of the expanded use of these appliances. Over the life of the appliances, over 200 trillion Btus of energy will be saved. This is the equiv-alent of taking 2.3 million cars off the road or closing 6 coal-fired power plants for a year. In addition, the clothes washers will reduce the amount of water necessary to wash clothes by 870 billion gallons, an amount equal to the needs of every household in the city the size of Phoenix, Arizona for two years. Most importantly, the bene-fits to consumers over the life of the washers and refrigerators from oper-ational savings is estimated at nearly $1 billion. In my home state of Iowa, this legis- lation would result in the production of VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, S7688 July 26, 2000 1.5 million supper energy-efficient washers and refrigerators over the next six years, requiring over 100 new pro-duction jobs. I also expect Iowans to save $11 million in operational costs over the life span of the appliances, and 9 billion gallons of water\u2014enough to supply drinking water for the entire state for 30 years. Lastly, I believe the total revenue loss of this credit compares extremely favorably to the estimated benefits of almost $1 billion to consumers over the life of the super energy-efficient clothes washers and refrigerators from operational savings. Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Sen-ators G RASSLEY , JEFFORDS , and L IN- COLN , in the introduction of legislation to establish a tax credit incentive pro-gram for the production of super en-ergy-efficient appliances. This creative proposal will result in substantial envi-ronmental benefits for the nation at a very small cost to the government. Our bill would provide for either a $50 or $100 tax credit for the production and sale of energy efficient washing machines and refrigerators. Today, these two appliances account for ap-proximately 15 percent of the energy consumed in a typical home, which amounts to about $21 billion in energy expenditures annually. Although most Americans may not realize it, home ap-pliances offer the potential for major energy savings across the nation. Recently, several energy efficiency and environmental organizations joined with the appliance industry in endorsing considerably tougher energy- efficiency standards for washing ma-chines. These proposed standards are now under active consideration by the Department of Energy for incorpora-tion in new regulations. The new standards will result in tremendous en-ergy-efficiency improvements that will have very positive environmental con-sequences over time. But there is a cost to these new minimum standards and, as we often find, reluctance on the part of industry and the public to incur the additional costs necessary to achieve higher energy efficiencies. Home appliances can be made more ef-ficient but it would mean greater costs to consumers. I believe there is a nec-essary balance between the objective of obtaining higher energy efficiencies that reduce air emissions and the high-er product costs that result. This is as true with respect to the purchase of ap-pliances as it is with respect to the automobile, electric power, and other markets. I also recognize that there are understandable limits to the costs that society is willing to bear through regulation to obtain higher energy sav-ings that result in environmental bene-fits. However, that is not necessarily the limit at which point energy savings can be achieved. While many con-sumers may not be willing to pay extra for more energy-efficient appliances, I believe they can be encouraged to do so through incentive programs. The legis- lation we are proposing today would do just that by giving manufacturers ei-ther a $50 or $100 tax credit for every super energy-efficient appliance pro-duced prior to 2007. The idea is to give manufacturers the means by which to create the most appropriate incentives to get consumers to purchase washing machines and refrigerators that are the most energy-efficient. Through these tax credits we will accelerate the pro-duction and market penetration of leading-edge appliance technologies that create significant environmental benefits. The expanded use of super energy-ef- ficient appliances will have significant long-term environmental benefits. It is estimated that as a result of this legis-lation over 200 trillion Btus of energy will be saved over the life of the appli-ances manufactured with these credits. This is the equivalent of taking 2.3 mil-lion cars off the road or closing down six coal-fired power plants for a year. Energy savings of this magnitude pay significant environmental dividends. For example, it is projected that with these energy savings carbon emissions, the critical element in greenhouse gas emissions, will be reduced by over 3.1 million metric tons. In addition, the super energy-efficient washing ma-chines will reduce the amount of water necessary to wash clothes by 870 billion gallons, or approximately the amount of water necessary to meet the needs of every household in a state the size of West Virginia for nearly 2 years. Vice President G ORE recently rec- ommended a similar program of tax in-centives for the purchase of home ap-pliances as part of his energy savings initiatives\u2014and I congratulate him for his leadership in this regard. I am very glad the Vice President is considering ways to balance how we produce energy savings and believe it is important that we discuss this balance of interests as part of our national dialogue to im-prove our energy efficiency. I am also extremely pleased this legislation is strongly supported by leading environ-mental organizations including the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Alliance to Save Energy, and the American Council for an Energy Effi-cient Economy. The use of energy-efficient appli- ances is an important milestone on the road to a cleaner, lower-cost energy fu-ture. This common-sense initiative fol- lows on the heels of other important bipartisan legislation that I am proud to have sponsored or cosponsored dur-ing this Congress to improve our na-tion's energy independence and the en-vironment. During the first session of the 106th Congress, I was joined by Senators H ATCH , CRAPO , and B RYAN in introducing the Alternative Fuel Pro-motion Act in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower our consumption of imported oil. Ear-lier this year I joined Senators J EF- FORDS and H ATCH on the Alternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act, which would accomplish many of the same goals. I am especially proud to have joined with Senator B INGAMAN and six of my Democratic colleagues on the Energy Security Tax and Policy Act, a com-prehensive energy policy bill that looks to improve our nation's energy independence while protecting the en-vironment. Finally, it was my pleasure last week to join with Environment and Public Works Chairman B OBSMITH and the Ranking Democratic Member Senator B AUCUS on the Energy Effi- cient Building Incentives Act, which promotes the construction of buildings 30-50 percent more efficient than to-day's standard. As building energy use accounts for 35 percent of the air pollu-tion emissions nationwide and $250 bil-lion per year in energy bills, this legis-lation could produce a dramatic benefit for our environment, and this coun-try's long-term energy needs. By Mr. HATCH: S. 2940. A bill to authorize additional assistance for international malaria control, and to provide for coordina-tion and consultation in providing as-sistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 with respect to malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis; read the first time. GLOBAL AIDS AND TUBERCULOSIS RELIEF ACT OF 2000 Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, earlier today, we approved the Helms sub-stitute to H.R. 3519, ''Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000.'' I was pleased to support this legislation, rec-ognizing the need for our country to support an enhanced effort to prevent and treat AIDS and tuberculosis abroad. I was pleased to work with Chairman H ELMS , Senator B IDEN, Senator F RIST, Senator S MITH of Oregon, and other members of the Senate Foreign Rela-tions Committee as this legislation was finalized, and, indeed, I want to work closely with them on our continuing ef-forts to address the problems of infec-tious diseases in the developing world. For the reasons I will lay out today, I believe the aid we make possible in H.R. 3519 should be expanded to em-brace not only HIV/AIDS and TB, but also malaria as well. In fact, I think it essential to make sure our foreign as-sistance program in Africa and the de-veloping world coordinates its activi-ties closely among these three diseases. With the support of Chairman H ELMS , Senator B IDEN, and Senator F RIST in the Senate, and Chairman L EACH in the House of Representatives, I have draft-ed companion legislation to H.R. 3519 which make certain that U.S. efforts for all three diseases are well-coordi-nated. Accordingly, I rise today to intro- duce S. 2940 the ''International Malaria Control Act of 2000''. The World Health Organization esti- mates that there are 300 million to 500 million cases of malaria each year. Ac-cording to the World Health Organiza-tion, more than 1 million persons are estimated to die due to malaria each year. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7689 July 26, 2000 The problems related to malaria are often linked to the devastation of two other terrible diseases\u2014Acquired Im-munodeficiency Disease, that is AIDS, and tuberculosis. One of the unfortu-nate commonalities of these diseases is that they all ravage sub-Saharan Afri-ca and other parts of the under-developed world. In addition to the one million ma- laria related deaths per year, about 2.5 million persons die from AIDS and an-other 1.5 million people per year die from tuberculosis. The measure I introduce today cen- ters on malaria control and calls for close cooperation among federal agen-cies that are charged with fighting ma-laria, AIDS, and TB worldwide. According to the National Institutes of Health, about 40 percent of the world's population is at risk of becom-ing infected. About half of those who die each year from malaria are chil-dren under nine years of age. Malaria kills one child each 30 seconds. Although malaria is a public health problem in more than 90 countries, more than 90 percent of all malaria cases are in sub-Saharan Africa. In ad-dition to Africa, large areas of Central and South America, Haiti and the Do-minican Republic, the Indian subconti-nent, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East are high risk malaria areas. These high risk areas represent many of the world's poorest nations which complicates the battle against malaria as well as AIDS and TB. Malaria is particularly dangerous during pregnancy. The disease causes severe anemia and is a major factor contributing to maternal deaths in ma-laria endemic regions. Research has found that pregnant mothers who are HIV-positive and have malaria are more likely to pass on HIV to their children. ''Airport malaria,'' the importing of malaria by international aircraft and other conveyances is becoming more common as is the importation of the disease by international travelers themselves; the United Kingdom re-ported 2,364 cases of malaria in 1997, all of them imported by travelers. In the United States, of the 1,400 cases of malaria reported to the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention in 1998, the vast majority were im-ported. Between 1970 and 1997, the ma-laria infection rate in the United States increased by about 40 percent. In Africa, the projected economic im- pact of malaria in 2000 exceeds $3.6 bil-lion. Malaria accounts for 20 to 40 per-cent of outpatient physician visits and 10 to 15 percent of hospital visits in Af-rica. Malaria is caused by a single-cell parasite that is spread to humans by mosquitoes. No vaccine is available and treatment is hampered by develop-ment of drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. Our nation must play a leadership role in the development of a vaccine for malaria as well as vaccines for TB and for the causal agent of AIDS, the human immunodeficiency virus\u2014HIV. In this regard I must commend the President for his leadership in direct-ing, back on March 2nd, that a renewed effort be made to form new partner-ships to develop and deliver vaccines to developing countries. I must also com-mend the Bill and Melinda Gates foun-dation for pledging a substantial $750 million in financial support for this new vaccine initiative. The private sector appears to be pre- pared to help meet this challenge as the four largest vaccine manufacturers, Merck, American Home Products, Glaxo SmithKline Beecham, and Aventis Pharma, have all stepped to the plate in the quest for vaccines for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. We must all recognize that the private sector pharmaceutical industry, in close part-nership with academic and government scientists, will play a key role in the development of any vaccines for these diseases. Among the promising developments in recent months has been Secretary Shalala directing the National Insti-tutes of Health to convene a meeting of experts from government, academia, and the private sector to address im-pediments to vaccine development in the private sector. Another goal of this first in a series of conferences on Vac-cines for HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tu-berculosis, held on May 22nd and 23rd, was to foster public-private partner-ships. These ongoing NIH Conferences on Vaccines for HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis will address three basic questions: what are the scientific bar-riers to developing vaccines for ma-laria, TB and HIV/AIDS? What admin-istrative, logistical and legal barriers stand in the way of malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS vaccines? And, finally, if vaccines are developed how can they best be produced and distributed around the world? Each of these questions will be dif- ficult to answer. Developing vaccines for malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS will be a difficult task. While each vaccine will be different, there are commonal-ities such as the fact that the legal im-pediments and distributional issues may be very similar. Also, there is an unfortunate geographical overlap with respects to the epidemics of malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS. Ground zero is sub- Saharan Africa. So while the ultimate goal is to end up with three vaccines, we must be mindful that there is a close societal and scientific linkage between the tasks of developing and delivering vac-cines and therapeutic treatments for those at risk of malaria, TB and HIV/ AIDS worldwide. While the greatest immediate need is clearly in Africa and in other parts of the developing world, citizens of the United States and my constituents in Utah stand to benefit from progress in the area of vaccine development.

R ES. 343 Whereas Israel's Magen David Adom Soci- ety has since 1930 provided emergency relief to people in many countries in times of need, pain, and suffering, regardless of nationality or religious affiliation; Whereas in the past year alone, the Magen David Adom Society has provided invaluable humanitarian services in Kosovo, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea, as well as Greece and Turkey in the wake of the earthquakes that devastated these countries; Whereas the American Red Cross has rec- ognized the superb and invaluable work done by the Magen David Adom Society and con-siders the exclusion of the Magen David Adom Society from the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement ''an injus-tice of the highest order''; Whereas the American Red Cross has re- peatedly urged that the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement recognize the Magen David Adom Society as a full member, with its emblem; Whereas the Magen David Adom Society utilizes the Red Shield of David as its em-blem, in similar fashion to the utilization of the Red Cross and Red Crescent by other na-tional societies; Whereas the Red Cross and the Red Cres- cent have been recognized as protective em-blems under the Statutes of the Inter-national Red Cross and Red Crescent Move-ment; Whereas the International Committee of the Red Cross has ignored previous requests from the United States Congress to recognize the Magen David Adom Society; Whereas the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement state that it ''makes no discrimination as to na-tionality, race, religious beliefs, class or po-litical opinions,'' and it ''may not take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in con-troversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature''; Whereas although similar national organi- zations of Iraq, North Korea, and Afghani-stan are recognized as full members of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the Magen David Adom Society has been denied membership since 1949; Whereas in the six fiscal years 1994 through 1999, the United States Government provided a total of $631,000,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross and $82,000,000 to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; and Whereas in fiscal year 1999 alone, the United States Government provided $119,500,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross and $7,300,000 to the Inter-national Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That\u2014 (1) the International Committee on the Red Cross should immediately recognize the Magen David Adom Society and the Magen David Adom Society should be granted full membership in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement; (2) the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies should grant full membership to the Magen David Adom Society immediately following rec-ognition by the International Committee of the Red Cross of the Magen David Adom So-ciety; (3) the Magen David Adom Society should not be required to give up or diminish its use of its emblem as a condition for immediate and full membership in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement; and (4) the Red Shield of David should be ac- corded the same recognition under inter-national law as the Red Cross and the Red Crescent. Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution ex-pressing the sense of the Senate that the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement should recognize and admit to full membership Israel's Magen David Adom Society with its emblem, the Red Shield of David. I thank Senators L IEBERMAN , H AGEL , HELMS , and L UGAR for joining me as original cosponsors of this important resolution. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is the largest hu-manitarian network in the world. The Movement has many components, in-cluding the International Committee of the Red Cross (the ICRC\u2014the Swiss- based founding institution of the Move-ment that serves as a neutral inter-mediary in armed conflict areas) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (the Federation, which groups together the Movement's 176 recognized national so-cieties and coordinates international disaster relief and refugee assistance in non-conflict areas). The Red Shield of David has been in use and recognized de facto since 1930 as the distinctive emblem of the med-ical and first aid services of the Jewish population in Palestine and, after 1948, the state of Israel. Israel signed the Ge-neva Conventions in 1949. The new state of Israel therefore attempted to have the Red Shield of David recog-nized in the Geneva Conventions as an alternative to the red cross, the red crescent, and the red lion and sun. In a secret ballot, however, Israel's request was rejected, 22 to 21. The end result was that Israel's equivalent of the Red Cross, Magen David Adom (MDA), was relegated to non-voting observer status and thereby effectively excluded from the Movement. In rejecting the Red Shield of David, and excluding Israel's national society from the Movement, the 1949 diplo-matic convention established the prin-ciple that only those already using an exceptional sign\u2014that is, a non-Red Cross emblem\u2014had the right to con-tinue using it. All new national soci-eties would have to adopt the Red Cross. However, the admission of 25 new Red Crescent societies since 1949 demonstrates the inconsistency with which this principle has been applied. Despite MDA's exclusion from the Movement, it has continuously played an active role in disaster assistance worldwide, recently helping to rescue trapped civilians following the 1999 earthquakes in Turkey and Greece. Israeli medical teams were also among the first to assist victims of severe flooding in Mozambique this year. ICRC officials have praised MDA for its ''life-saving work'' and report they have maintained ''excellent working relations'' with the MDA for decades. The existing Protocols of the Geneva Conventions provide for two different uses of the Movement emblem: ''pro-tective,'' whcih is used for protective purposes in armed conflicts and re-quires the use of a single unique em-blem, and ''indicative,'' which is used for identification purposes in non-con-flict circumstances, and therefore al-lows for the existence of several em-blems. Currently, negotiations are un-derway to add a possible third Protocol to the Geneva Conventions to create a new neutral emblem and allow for MDA recognition with its emblem. However, before these negotiations can translate into formal recognition, sig- nificant procedural hudles must be overcome, including super-majority votes of three bodies and ratification by member nations that could take years. Meanwhile, the American Red Cross has been pursuing other ap-proaches that would allow for the rec-ognition of MDA and its emblem with-out the introduction of a third Pro-tocol. The resolution I am introducing today would help facilitate the negoti-ating process by putting the Senate on record in support of MDA recognition at a critical time in these negotiations. The House of Representatives passed a similar resolution on May 3, 2000. The Senate, however, last announced its support of recognition of MDA and its emblem over 12 years ago. Over the last six years, the United States Government has provided the ICRC and the Federation with $713 mil-lion. Once again, the United States Senate should urge the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to recognize the Red Shield of David emblem and admit MDA for full mem-bership in the Movement. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to encourage the Inter-national Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to recognize Israel's Magen David Adom society and its emblem, the Red Shield of David. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, SENATE S7692 July 26, 2000 SENATE RESOLUTION 344\u2014EX- PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE PROPOSED MERGER OF UNITED AIRLINES AND U.S. AIRWAYS IS INCON-SISTENT WITH THE PUBLIC IN-TEREST AND PUBLIC CONVEN-IENCE AND NECESSITY POLICY SET FORTH IN SECTION 40101 OF TITLE 49, UNITED STATES CODE Mr. M CCAIN (for himself and Mr. GORTON ) submitted the following reso- lution; which was referred to the Com-mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation: S. R ES. 344 Whereas, in 1999 the 6 largest hub-and- spoke airlines in the United States ac-counted for nearly 80 percent of the revenue passenger miles flown by domestic airlines, Whereas, according to Department of Transportation statistics, a combined United Airlines and US Airways would result in at least 20 airline hub airports in the United States where a single airline and its affiliate air carriers would carry more than 50 per-cent of the passenger traffic; Whereas, the Department of Transpor- tation and the General Accounting Office have documented that air fares are rel-atively higher at those airline hub airports where a single airline carries more than 50 percent of the passenger traffic; Whereas, a combined United Airlines and US Airways would hold approximately 40 percent of the air carrier takeoff and landing slots at the 4 high density airports, even tak-ing into account the parties' planned divesti-ture of slots at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport; Whereas, most analysts agree that a United Airlines-US Airways merger would lead to other merger in the airline industry, likely resulting in combinations that would reduce the 6 largest domestic hub-and-spoke airlines to 3 airlines; Whereas, media reports indicate that American Airlines has made a tangible offer to purchase Northwest Airlines and that Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines have engaged in merger negotiations; Whereas, it would be difficult for the De- partment of Transportation and other re-sponsible Federal agencies of jurisdiction to disapprove subsequent airline merger pro-posals if the government allows the largest domestic airline, in terms of total operating revenue and revenue passenger miles flown in 1999, United Airlines, to merge with the sixth largest airline, US Airways, making United Airlines substantially bigger than its next largest competitor; Whereas, 3 larger domestic airlines will have substantially increased market power, and would have the ability to use that mar-ket power to drive low fare competitors out of direct competition and to thwart new air-line entry into the marketplace; Whereas, the Department of Transpor- tation credits nearly all of the benefits of de-regulation (a reported $6.3 billion in annual savings to airline passengers) to the entry and existence of low fare airline competitors in the marketplace; Whereas, a combined United Airlines and US Airways, including their commuter air-line partners, would be the only carrier offer-ing nonstop flights between at least 26 do-mestic airports in 12 States; Whereas, in 1999 United Airlines and US Airways enplaned 22 percent of all revenue passengers flown by domestic airlines; Whereas, the transition from 6 major air- lines to 3 would likely result in less competi-tion and higher fares, giving consumers fewer choices and decreased customers serv- ice; Whereas, it is the role of the Senate Com- mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-tation and, more specifically the Sub-committee on Aviation, to conduct oversight of the aviation industry and to promote con-sumers' receiving a basic level of airline cus-tomer service; Whereas, the Air Transport Association member air carriers agreed to an Airline Customer Service Commitment to improve the current level of customer service in the airline industry; Whereas, in an interim oversight report, the Department of Transportation Inspector General recently concluded that the results are mixed with respect to the effectiveness of the efforts of the major airlines to imple-ment their Airline Customer Service Com-mitment; Whereas, the combination of 2 entities as large as United Airlines and US Airways could cause at least short-term disruptions in service; Whereas, according to the Department of Transportation statistics for the month of May 2000, for the 10 major airlines, a com-bined United Airlines and US Airways would have had the lowest percentage of ontime flight arrivals, the highest percentage of flight operations canceled, the second high-est rate of consumer complaints, and the sec-ond highest rate of mishandled baggage: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That\u2014 (1) the Senate expresses concern about the proposed United Airlines-US Airways merger because of its potential to leave consumers with fewer travel options, higher fares, and lowered levels of service; and (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the po- tential consumer detriments from the pro-posed United Airlines-US Airways merger outweigh the potential consumer benefits. Mr. M CCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by the Commerce Committee Aviation Subcommittee Chairman, Senator G ORTON , to intro- duce a Senate resolution expressing our strong reservations about the pro-posed merger of United Airlines and US Airways. Through Commerce Committee delib- erations, Senator G ORTON and I have carefully analyzed the proposed merg-er, as well as its long-term consumer effects. We conclude that whatever air travelers stand to gain from the merg-er is outweighed by what they stand to lose. The public interest would likely be harmed by a United Airlines-US Air-ways merger. First, almost all analysts agree that the merger would trigger additional consolidation in the airline industry. The six largest hub-and- spoke carriers in the country would likely become the ''big three.'' Every-thing else being equal, basic economic principles suggest that consumers are better served by having six competitors in a market rather than three. Even at this preliminary date, our experience bears out the prediction of additional industry consolidation. American Airlines has already made an offer for Northwest Airlines. Delta Air Lines and Continental have reportedly engaged in merger negotiations. Consolidation among these network carriers poses additional problems for the flying public. The likely result of fewer carriers is more single-carrier concentration at hub airports across the country. Studies by the Depart-ment of Transportation, the General Accounting Office, and others consist-ently conclude that air fares are rel-atively higher at hub airports ''domi-nated'' by a single carrier. Important new entry in the airline industry would be hurt by consolida-tion among the major airlines. The mega-carriers would have additional resources to engage in fierce and pro-longed behavior designed to drive new competitors out of the market, and to single potential entrants that they dare not compete with the incumbent. Today, many new entrants simply choose not to enter the major airlines' hub markets because they fear they cannot survive a sustained head-to- head battle. A United-US Airways merger, and the consolidation that would ensue, would further entrench the incumbent air carriers' positions. I admit that there are benefits asso- ciated with the proposed United-US Airways merger. The carriers, for in-stance, tout ''seamless'' connections to international destinations, an ex-panded frequent flyer program, and similar benefits that should appeal to travelers on the United-US Airways system. United and US Airways also applaud new service to a multitude of destina-tions as a consequence of the merger. It is important to note, however, that what is new to United is not exactly new to the flying public, since United's ''new'' service is made up of flights that are now offered by US Airways. Again, the point is that the anti- competitive harm posed by the pro-posed United-US Airways merger out-weighs its benefits. And that conclu-sion does not even take into account the customer service problems associ-ated with integrating the work forces of two or more major airlines. I want to underscore that this resolu- tion is designed to express our concerns about the proposed United-US Airways merger. It does not seek to force any federal agency or department to take any specific action with respect to the proposed merger. However, our con-cerns for the consumer are of such a significant nature that we are com-pelled to introduce this resolution. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the R ECORD a letter from the father of airline deregulation, Prof. Al-fred Kahn. His letter outlines his pre-liminary concerns with the proposed United-U.S. Airways merger. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: ALFRED E. K AHN, Ithaca, New York, June 9, 2000. Hon. J OHNMCCAIN, Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. D EARSENATOR MCCAIN: I'm very sorry that I can't accept your invitation to testify be-fore your Committee on June 20th, and hope that you will regard the arrival that day of VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7693 July 26, 2000 my son and his family from Australia, for a brief visit, as a sufficient reason. I particu-larly regret my inability to take advantage of that opportunity to renew our acquaint-ance. Your Ann Choiniere has asked me to offer, as a substitute, a statement of my\u2014as yet only provisional\u2014opinions about the pro-posed merger of United Airlines and US Air-ways. I am happy to do so, even though, to repeat, I have by no means a settled final opinion about whether or not it should be ap-proved. I do urge you to give careful consideration to its possible anticompetitive effects, how-ever. The central premise of deregulation was that competition would best serve and protect consumers; that meant vigorous en-forcement of the antitrust laws rather than direct regulation would become critical in the new regime. Primary responsibility for making this in- vestigation rests, of course, with the anti-trust agencies. It is my understanding, how-ever, that the Antitrust Division's resources are severely strained by their other obliga-tions, including other proceedings specifi-cally involving the airlines; if they lack the resources to look at this latest proposed merger with great care, it seems to me that would be a case of the government being penny-wise and pound-foolish. Partly be-cause of the possible direct effects of this merger and, perhaps even more, because of its threatening to set off a series of imitative mergers that would substantially increase the concentration of the domestic industry, there is a possible jeopardy here to the many billions of dollars that consumers have been saving each year because off the competition set off by deregulation. It seems to me there are several levels at which to assess these possible anticompeti-tive effects. 1. The first goes to the question of whether there are any substantial number of par-ticular routes on which United and US Air-ways are already direct competitors. In the case of the proposed merger of Continental/ Northwest, the Antitrust Division identified several very important routes between their respective hubs (for example, Houston/Min-neapolis-St. Paul, Houston/Detroit, Cleve-land/Minneapolis-St. Paul, Cleveland/Mem-phis, Newark/Twin Cities) on which it ap-peared those airlines were the two main if not only competitors, and their merger would simply eliminate that competition. I do not know to what extent there are similar overlaps between US Airways and United. 2. In deregulating the airlines we relied very heavily on the threat of potential as well as actual competition to prevent exploi-tation of consumers: an important part of the rationale of deregulation was the contestability of airline markets. It seems to me highly likely that there are many routes in which United or US Airways is a potential competitor of the other. And it is my recol-lection that while studies of the behavior of airline fares after deregulation (notably one by Winston and Morrison and another by Gloria Hurdle, Andrew Joskow and others) demonstrated that one actual competitor in a market is worth two or three potential contesters in the bush, they nevertheless also found that the presence of a potential contester\u2014identified as a carrier already present at one or the other end of a route\u2014 did constrain the fares incumbents could charge. 3. The likelihood that a United/US Airways merger would indeed result in suppression of this potential competition would seem to be enhanced by what I take it would be United's explanation and justification\u2014namely, its need for a strong hub in the Northeast (com-mented on widely in the literature, along with attributions of a similar need to Amer- ican Airlines). But if United really does feel the need for a big hub in the Northeast, this suggests that it is indeed an important po-tential competitor of US Airways, and that, denied the ability to acquire the hub in the easiest, noncompetitive fashion, by acquisi-tion, it might instead feel impelled to con-struct a hub of its own in direct competition with US Airways; if some place within a cou-ple of hundred miles of Pittsburgh is the needed location\u2014observe the hubs of Conti-nental at Cleveland and Delta at Cin-cinnati\u2014then why not, say, Buffalo for United? And while I have the impression that the suppression of potential competi-tion has not played a major role in most merger litigation, it might properly be defin-itive in this case, if only because, either ex-plicitly or implicitly, United is in effect con-ceding the potentiality of that competition in its rationalizations of the merger itself. The stronger its argument that it does in-deed require a big hub in the Northeast, the more that signifies that the alternative, if it were denied the opportunity to acquire US Airways, would be to construct a major com-petitive hub of its own. 4. In addition, if indeed United's acquisi- tion of a competitive advantage by this ac-quisition\u2014giving it the first claim on traffic feed from US Airways' extensive network\u2014 does increase the pressure on other carriers, particularly American to merge similarly, then it seems to me that is a possible com-petitive consequence of this particular merg-er that should additionally be taken into ac-count in deciding whether it should be per-mitted. I do hope you will undertake this impor- tant inquiry: we may be confronting a very radical consolidation of the industry, which cannot be a matter of indifference to people like you and me, who have regarded deregu-lation as a striking success thus far. With warm personal regards, Sincerely, A LFRED E. K AHN, Robert Julius Thorne Professor of Political Economy, Emeritus, Cornell University; Chairman, Civil Aeronautics Board 1977-78. Mr. M CCAIN. Mr. President, I want to highlight one point Professor Kahn makes. He asserts that United's main justification for the merger is the need for a hub in the northeast. He goes on to question, however, why United doesn't create a hub in the northeast, rather than follow the path of ''least competitive resistance'' by trying to acquire on its competitors' hubs. Mr. President, I ask the same question, and urge my colleagues to join Senator G ORTON and me in supporting this Sen- ate resolution expressing our strong concerns about a United-US Airways merger. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee who joined me in this resolution. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Washington. Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is my purpose to join with the Senator from Arizona today in introducing this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Each of us has thought long and hard about this proposed measure, as it goes to the heart of our air transport system in the United States. I believe I speak for the Senator from Arizona as well as for myself in saying this merger seems quite obviously to be beneficial both to United Airlines and to U.S. Airways. Public policy, however, does not con-cern itself primarily with the benefits to the companies involved in the com-petitive field. Public policy should con-cern itself with consumer interests and with the interests of the millions of Americans who use these airlines to fly from one place to another across the United States and for that matter overseas. A merger of these two airlines would create by far the largest single airline in the United States. Inevitably, it seems to me that would lead to two more mergers, at the very least involv-ing the other four of the largest six air-lines in the United States. In fact, it would be almost impossible to mount a logical and rational defense against such mergers as those airlines would complain with real justification that they were no longer competitive with the giant created by a United-U.S. Air-ways merger. From our perspective, we need to consider what the ultimate outcome of this merger would be and the impact it would have on airline passengers all across the United States. There would be a significant increase in the number of hubs overwhelmingly dominated by a single airline. There would be, in my view, a sharp decrease in the competi-tion for airline travel in many cities across the United States. There would certainly be the legitimate desire on the part of the remaining airlines to maximize their profits. That exists at the present time. But these three mergers would vastly increase the abil-ity of the airlines to do so in what would be distinctly a less competitive market. I have attended hearings on this sub- ject. I have had meetings with the CEOs of both airlines seeking to merge and with some of those who have ap-prehensions about that merger. I may say there are a number of ways in which my mind was changed by those meetings. My first reaction to the pro-posal was that the creation of one new entrant\u2014D.C. Airlines\u2014was little more than a sham. The hearings and my meetings indicated to me that I was al-most certainly wrong in that respect, and that the proposed new owner and manager of D.C. Airlines did intend to be a real airline to provide real service. But even if we grant the potential suc-cess of that airline, the net effect on competition overall would be highly negative on the part of this merger. I join with the chairman of the Com- merce Committee in this resolution. I do not think in the ultimate analysis that this merger is in the public inter-est. I believe it would lessen competi-tion among domestic airlines. I think it would not improve the way in which the airline passengers are treated, and probably, at least in the short term and perhaps in the long term, would ex-acerbate an already troublesome situa-tion. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 \u2014 SENATE S7694 July 26, 2000 I believe we would end up with three major airlines flying roughly 80 per-cent of all the passengers on domestic flights in the United States, and that the net result, by a significant margin from such a merger, would not be in the public interest. I hope this resolution becomes more formalized than it is just by the intro-duction by these two Members. I sus-pect the chairman of the Commerce Committee will bring it up in the Com-merce Committee. I hope it is here for consideration by the entire Senate promptly, and it will be considered by the regulatory authorities that are dealing with the proposed merger at the present time. f AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED TREASURY AND GENERAL GOV- ERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001 LEAHY AMENDMENT NO. 4016 (Ordered to lie on the table.)

(a) F INDINGS .\u2014Congress makes the fol- lowing findings: (1) According to the Surgeon General of the United States, the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) will soon become the worst epidemic of infectious dis-ease in recorded history, eclipsing both the bubonic plague of the 1300's and the influenza epidemic of 1918-1919 which killed more than 20,000,000 people worldwide. (2) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), more than 34,300,000 people in the world today are living with HIV/AIDS, of which approxi-mately 95 percent live in the developing world. (3) UNAIDS data shows that among chil- dren age 14 and under worldwide, more than 3,800,000 have died from AIDS, more than 1,300,000 are living with the disease; and in one year alone\u20141999\u2014an estimated 620,000 became infected, of which over 90 percent were babies born to HIV-positive women. (4) Although sub-Saharan Africa has only 10 percent of the world's population, it is home to more than 24,500,000\u2014roughly 70 per-cent\u2014of the world's HIV/AIDS cases. (5) Worldwide, there have already been an estimated 18,800,000 deaths because of HIV/ AIDS, of which more than 80 percent oc-curred in sub-Saharan Africa. (6) The gap between rich and poor coun- tries in terms of transmission of HIV from mother to child has been increasing. More-over, AIDS threatens to reverse years of steady progress of child survival in devel-oping countries. UNAIDS believes that by the year 2010, AIDS may have increased mor-tality of children under 5 years of age by more than 100 percent in regions most af-fected by the virus. (7) According to UNAIDS, by the end of 1999, 13,200,000 children have lost at least one parent to AIDS, including 12,100,000 children in sub-Saharan Africa, and are thus consid-ered AIDS orphans. (8) At current infection and growth rates for HIV/AIDS, the National Intelligence Council estimates that the number of AIDS orphans worldwide will increase dramati-cally, potentially increasing threefold or more in the next 10 years, contributing to economic decay, social fragmentation, and political destabilization in already volatile and strained societies. Children without care or hope are often drawn into prostitution, crime, substance abuse, or child soldiery. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7695 July 26, 2000 (9) Donors must focus on adequate prepara- tions for the explosion in the number of or-phans and the burden they will place on fam-ilies, communities, economies, and govern-ments. Support structures and incentives for families, communities, and institutions which will provide care for children or-phaned by HIV/AIDS, or for the children who are themselves afflicted by HIV/AIDS, will be essential. (10) The 1999 annual report by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) states ''[t]he number of orphans, particularly in Af-rica, constitutes nothing less than an emer-gency, requiring an emergency response'' and that ''finding the resources needed to help stabilize the crisis and protect children is a priority that requires urgent action from the international community.''. (11) The discovery of a relatively simple and inexpensive means of interrupting the transmission of HIV from an infected mother to the unborn child\u2014namely with nevirapine (NVP), which costs US$4 a tablet\u2014has cre-ated a great opportunity for an unprece-dented partnership between the United States Government and the governments of Asian, African and Latin American countries to reduce mother-to-child transmission (also known as ''vertical transmission'') of HIV. (12) According to UNAIDS, if implemented this strategy will decrease the proportion of orphans that are HIV-infected and decrease infant and child mortality rates in these de-veloping regions. (13) A mother-to-child antiretroviral drug strategy can be a force for social change, providing the opportunity and impetus need-ed to address often long-standing problems of inadequate services and the profound stigma associated with HIV-infection and the AIDS disease. Strengthening the health infrastruc-ture to improve mother-and-child health, antenatal, delivery and postnatal services, and couples counseling generates enormous spillover effects toward combating the AIDS epidemic in developing regions. (14) United States Census Bureau statistics show life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa falling to around 30 years of age within a decade, the lowest in a century, and project life expectancy in 2010 to be 29 years of age in Botswana, 30 years of age in Swaziland, 33 years of age in Namibia and Zimbabwe, and 36 years of age in South Africa, Malawi, and Rwanda, in contrast to a life expectancy of 70 years of age in many of the countries without a high prevalence of AIDS. (15) A January 2000 United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) report on the global infectious disease threat concluded that the economic costs of infectious dis-eases\u2014especially HIV/AIDS\u2014are already sig-nificant and could reduce GDP by as much as 20 percent or more by 2010 in some sub-Saha-ran African nations. (16) According to the same NIE report, HIV prevalence among militias in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are esti-mated at 40 to 60 percent, and at 15 to 30 per-cent in Tanzania. (17) The HIV/AIDS epidemic is of increas- ing concern in other regions of the world, with UNAIDS estimating that there are more than 5,600,000 cases in South and South-east Asia, that the rate of HIV infec-tion in the Caribbean is second only to sub- Saharan Africa, and that HIV infections have doubled in just two years in the former Soviet Union. (18) Despite the discouraging statistics on the spread of HIV/AIDS, some developing na-tions\u2014such as Uganda, Senegal, and Thai-land\u2014have implemented prevention pro-grams that have substantially curbed the rate of HIV infection. (19) AIDS, like all diseases, knows no na- tional boundaries, and there is no certitude that the scale of the problem in one con- tinent can be contained within that region. (20) Accordingly, United States financial support for medical research, education, and disease containment as a global strategy has beneficial ramifications for millions of Americans and their families who are af-fected by this disease, and the entire popu-lation which is potentially susceptible. (b) P URPOSES .\u2014The purposes of this title are to\u2014 (1) help prevent human suffering through the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HIV/AIDS; and (2) help ensure the viability of economic development, stability, and national secu-rity in the developing world by advancing re-search to\u2014 (A) understand the causes associated with HIV/AIDS in developing countries; and (B) assist in the development of an AIDS vaccine.

TITLE II\u2014INTERNATIONAL TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ''Inter- national Tuberculosis Control Act of 2000''. SEC. 202. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Since the development of antibiotics in the 1950s, tuberculosis has been largely con-trolled in the United States and the Western World. (2) Due to societal factors, including grow- ing urban decay, inadequate health care sys-tems, persistent poverty, overcrowding, and malnutrition, as well as medical factors, in-cluding the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of tuberculosis, tuberculosis has again become a leading and growing cause of adult deaths in the developing world. (3) According to the World Health Organi- zation\u2014 (A) in 1998, about 1,860,000 people worldwide died of tuberculosis-related illnesses; (B) one-third of the world's total popu- lation is infected with tuberculosis; and (C) tuberculosis is the world's leading kill- er of women between 15 and 44 years old and is a leading cause of children becoming or-phans. (4) Because of the ease of transmission of tuberculosis, its international persistence and growth pose a direct public health threat to those nations that had previously largely controlled the disease. This is complicated in the United States by the growth of the homeless population, the rate of incarcer-ation, international travel, immigration, and HIV/AIDS. (5) With nearly 40 percent of the tuber- culosis cases in the United States attrib-utable to foreign-born persons, tuberculosis will never be controlled in the United States until it is controlled abroad. (6) The means exist to control tuberculosis through screening, diagnosis, treatment, pa-tient compliance, monitoring, and ongoing review of outcomes. (7) Efforts to control tuberculosis are com- plicated by several barriers, including\u2014 (A) the labor intensive and lengthy process involved in screening, detecting, and treat-ing the disease; (B) a lack of funding, trained personnel, and medicine in virtually every nation with a high rate of the disease; (C) the unique circumstances in each coun- try, which requires the development and im-plementation of country-specific programs; and (D) the risk of having a bad tuberculosis program, which is worse than having no tu-berculosis program because it would signifi-cantly increase the risk of the development of more widespread drug-resistant strains of the disease. (8) Eliminating the barriers to the inter- national control of tuberculosis through a well-structured, comprehensive, and coordi-nated worldwide effort would be a significant step in dealing with the increasing public health problem posed by the disease. SEC. 203. ASSISTANCE FOR TUBERCULOSIS PRE- VENTION, TREATMENT, CONTROL, AND ELIMINATION. Section 104(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(c)), as amended by section 111(a) of this Act, is further amended by adding at the end the following: ''(7)(A) Congress recognizes the growing international problem of tuberculosis and the impact its continued existence has on those nations that had previously largely controlled the disease. Congress further rec-ognizes that the means exist to control and treat tuberculosis, and that it is therefore a major objective of the foreign assistance pro-gram to control the disease. To this end, Congress expects the agency primarily re-sponsible for administering this part\u2014 ''(i) to coordinate with the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Con-trol, the National Institutes of Health, and other organizations toward the development and implementation of a comprehensive tu- berculosis control program; and ''(ii) to set as a goal the detection of at least 70 percent of the cases of infectious tu-berculosis, and the cure of at least 85 percent of the cases detected, in those countries in which the agency has established develop-ment programs, by December 31, 2010. ''(B) There is authorized to be appropriated to the President, $60,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2001 and 2002 to be used to carry out this paragraph. Funds appropriated under this subparagraph are authorized to remain available until expended.''. TITLE III\u2014ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES SEC. 301. EFFECTIVE PROGRAM OVERSIGHT.

INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2000 CAMPBELL AMENDMENT NO. 4019 Mr. D EWINE (for Mr. C AMPBELL ) pro- posed an amendment to the bill (S. 1586) to reduce the fractionated owner-ship of Indian Lands, and for other pur-poses; as follows: Strike all after the enacting clause and in- sert the following: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000''. TITLE I\u2014INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION SEC. 101. FINDINGS. Congress finds that\u2014 (1) in the 1800's and early 1900's, the United States sought to assimilate Indian people into the surrounding non-Indian culture by allotting tribal lands to individual members of Indian tribes; (2) as a result of the allotment Acts and re- lated Federal policies, over 90,000,000 acres of land have passed from tribal ownership; (3) many trust allotments were taken out of trust status, often without their owners consent; (4) without restrictions on alienation, al- lotment owners were subject to exploitation and their allotments were often sold or dis-posed of without any tangible or enduring benefit to their owners; (5) the trust periods for trust allotments have been extended indefinitely; (6) because of the inheritance provisions in the original treaties or allotment Acts, the ownership of many of the trust allotments that have remained in trust status has be-come fractionated into hundreds or thou-sands of undivided interests, many of which represent 2 percent or less of the total inter-ests; (7) Congress has authorized the acquisition of lands in trust for individual Indians, and many of those lands have also become fractionated by subsequent inheritance; (8) the acquisitions referred to in para- graph (7) continue to be made; (9) the fractional interests described in this section often provide little or no return to the beneficial owners of those interests and the administrative costs borne by the United States for those interests are inordinately high; (10) in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S Ct. 727 (1997)), the United States Supreme Court found the application of section 207 of the In-dian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206) to the facts presented in that case to be un-constitutional, forcing the Department of the Interior to address the status of thou-sands of undivided interests in trust and re-stricted lands; (11)(A) on February 19, 1999, the Secretary of Interior issued a Secretarial Order which officially reopened the probate of all estates where an interest in land was ordered to es-cheat to an Indian tribe pursuant to section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206); and (B) the Secretarial Order also directed ap- propriate officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to distribute such interests ''to the rightful heirs and beneficiaries without re-gard to 25 U.S.C. 2206''; (12) in the absence of comprehensive reme- dial legislation, the number of the fractional interests will continue to grow exponen-tially; (13) the problem of the fractionation of In- dian lands described in this section is the re-sult of a policy of the Federal Government, cannot be solved by Indian tribes, and re-quires a solution under Federal law. (14) any devise or inheritance of an interest in trust or restricted Indian lands is a mat-ter of Federal law; and (15) consistent with the Federal policy of tribal self-determination, the Federal Gov-ernment should encourage the recognized tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over a reservation to establish a tribal pro-bate code for that reservation. SEC. 102. DECLARATION OF POLICY. It is the policy of the United States\u2014 (1) to prevent the further fractionation of trust allotments made to Indians; (2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of those interests into usable par-cels; (3) to consolidate fractional interests in a manner that enhances tribal sovereignty; (4) to promote tribal self-sufficiency and self-determination; and (5) to reverse the effects of the allotment policy on Indian tribes. SEC. 103. AMENDMENTS TO THE INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION ACT.

SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that\u2014 (1) in the 1800's and early 1900's, the United States sought to assimilate Indian people into the surrounding non-Indian culture by allotting tribal lands to individual members of Indian tribes; (2) as a result of the allotment Acts and re- lated Federal policies, over 90,000,000 acres of land have passed from tribal ownership; (3) many trust allotments were taken out of trust status, often without their owners consent; (4) without restrictions on alienation, allot- ment owners were subject to exploitation and their allotments were often sold or disposed of without any tangible or enduring benefit to their owners; (5) the trust periods for trust allotments have been extended indefinitely; (6) because of the inheritance provisions in the original treaties or allotment Acts, the own-ership of many of the trust allotments that have remained in trust status has become fractionated into hundreds or thousands of in-terests, many of which represent 2 percent or less of the total interests; (7) Congress has authorized the acquisition of lands in trust for individual Indians, and many of those lands have also become fractionated by subsequent inheritance; (8) the acquisitions referred to in paragraph (7) continue to be made; (9) the fractional interests described in this section provide little or no return to the bene-ficial owners of those interests and the adminis-trative costs borne by the United States for those interests are inordinately high; (10) in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S Ct. 727 (1997)), the United States Supreme Court found that the application of section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206) to the facts presented in that case to be unconstitutional, forcing the Department of the Interior to ad-dress the status of thousands of undivided inter-ests in trust and restricted lands; (11)(A) on February 19, 1999, the Secretary of Interior issued a Secretarial Order which offi-cially reopened the probate of all estates where an interest in land was ordered to escheat to an Indian tribe pursuant to section 207 of the In-dian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206); and (B) the Secretarial Order also directed appro- priate officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to distribute such interests ''to the rightful heirs and beneficiaries without regard to 25 U.S.C. 2206''; (12) in the absence of comprehensive remedial legislation, the number of the fractional inter-ests will continue to grow exponentially; (13) the problem of the fractionation of Indian lands described in this section is the result of a policy of the Federal Government, cannot be solved by Indian tribes, and requires a solution under Federal law. VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7705 July 26, 2000 (14) any devise or inheritance of an interest in trust or restricted Indian lands is based on Fed-eral law; and (15) consistent with the Federal policy of trib- al self-determination, the Federal Government should encourage the recognized tribal govern-ment that exercises jurisdiction over a reserva-tion to establish a tribal probate code for that reservation. SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY. It is the policy of the United States\u2014 (1) to prevent the further fractionation of trust allotments made to Indians; (2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of those interests into usable parcels; (3) to consolidate fractional interests in a manner that enhances tribal sovereignty; (4) to promote tribal self-sufficiency and self- determination; and (5) to reverse the effects of the allotment pol- icy on Indian tribes. SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS TO THE INDIAN LAND CON- SOLIDATION ACT. The Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) is amended\u2014 (1) in section 202\u2014 (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ''(1) 'tribe''' and inserting ''(1) 'Indian tribe' or 'tribe'''; (B) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following: ''(2)'Indian' means any person who is a mem- ber of any Indian tribe or is eligible to become a member of any Indian tribe at the time of the distribution of the assets of a decedent's es-tate;''; (C) by striking ''and'' at the end of paragraph (3); (D) by striking the period at the end of para- graph (4) and inserting ''; and''; and (E) by adding at the end the following: ''(5) 'heirs of the first or second degree' means parents, children, grandchildren, grandparents, brothers and sisters of a decedent.''; (2) in section 205\u2014 (A) in the matter preceding paragraph (1)\u2014 (i) by striking ''Any Indian'' and inserting ''(a) I NGENERAL .\u2014Subject to subsection (b), any Indian''; (ii) by striking the colon and inserting the fol- lowing: ''.

AMENDMENT NO . 4019 (Purpose: To provide for a complete substitute) Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Ohio [Mr. D EWINE], for Mr. C AMPBELL , proposes an amendment num- bered 4019. (The text of the amendment is in today's R ECORD Under ''Amend- ments Submitted.'') Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, on September 15, 1999, I introduced S. 1586, the Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000. At that time I pledged to work with all interested parties to address the vexing problems associated with fractionated ownership of Indian lands. These lands were carved out of Indian reservations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Within only a few generations, the ownership of the allotments was di-vided among dozens of the heirs of the original owners of these parcels. This situation has only grown worse as each decade passes. In 1983, Congress tried to solve frac- tionation when it enacted the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA), P.L. 94-459. The ILCA prevented small undi-vided interests from passing by either devise or descent. Only those interests that produced more than $100 in rev-enue in the preceding year were ex-empted. In 1987 the Supreme Court ruled in Hodel v. Irving , 481 U.S. 704, that those provisions of the ILCA vio-lated the 5th Amendment by taking property without just compensation. Then in 1992, the General Accounting Office surveyed 12 Indian reservations with fractionated ownership and re-ported to Congress: VerDate Mar 15 2010 SENATE S7709 July 26, 2000 BIA's workload for ownership records is substantial. The agency maintains about 1.1 million records for the 12 reservations. Over 60 percent of the records represent small ownership interests of Indian individuals\u2014 some as small as one four thousandth of 1 percent. (GAO/RCED-92-96BR) In 1994, the Department of Interior began a national consultation with tribal leaders and landowners con-cerning the need to address fraction-ation through a comprehensive legisla-tive proposal. Based on these consulta-tions, in June 1997, the Administration submitted a legislative proposal on land fractionation to Congress. Also in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled in Babbitt v. Youpee , 519 U.S. 234 that the 1984 amendments to the ILCA did not go far enough to alter the Court's previous finding that the ILCA violated the 5th Amendment. On November 4, 2000, the Senate In- dian Affairs Committee (SCIA) held a joint hearing on S. 1586 with the House Committee on Resources. On March 23, 2000, the SCIA reported S. 1586. Relying on a suggestion in the Supreme Court's 1987 opinion, the re- ported bill allowed an owner to devise fractional interests of less than 2%, but eliminated the intestate descent of such interests. These interests were al-lowed to ''escheat'' to the tribe exer-cising jurisdiction over the parcel. Be-cause of the controversy associated with the escheat provision, Committee staff continued to work with interested parties to develop a proposal for ad-dressing fractionation without the use of escheat. On June 14, 2000, the SCIA reported S. 1586 with an amendment in the nature of a substitute. In response to concerns that probate reform should be com-prehensive, the reported version of the bill was not limited to smaller frac-tional interests. Instead the bill ad-dressed both the problem of fractionated ownership and the loss of trust land through devise and descent. The bill provided that non-Indian heirs and devisees would receive ''non-Indian interests in Indian land,'' rather than fee title to trust and restricted land. In most instances, these interests would operate as if they were a life estate in the interest. S. 1586 was endorsed on June 28, 2000 by the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), the largest and most representative tribal organization in the Nation, through Resolution Jun-00- 044. The Resolution requested that the bill's sponsor continue to work with NCAI to address technical issues. Throughout June and July, a con- certed effort has been made to consult with Indian tribes, landowners, and inter-tribal organizations, BIA per-sonnel, and interested academics to clarify and simplify the bill. For exam-ple, in many instances a ''non-Indian estate in Indian land'' might prove a more complicated interest than was necessary to achieve the bill's objec-tive. It was recommended that the bill's non-Indian estate should simply be replaced by an ordinary life estate. A proposed amendment in the nature of a substitute has been produced. The amendment differs from the version re-ported by the SCIA on June 14, 2000 in the following ways: The definition of ''Indian'' is amend- ed. As reported on June 14, 2000, the definition included members of Indian tribes and those eligible for member-ship in an Indian tribe. The proposed amendment adds a provision for: ''any person who has been found to meet the definition of 'Indian' under a provision of Federal law if the Secretary deter-mines that using such law's definition of Indian is consistent with the pur-poses of this Act.'' This amendment will ensure that individuals who are treated as Indians for other purposes of Federal law will also be treated as In-dian for purposes of this Act. Section 207 dealing with the devise and descent of interests in trust and re-stricted lands has been rewritten to provide that non-Indians inheriting in-terest in trust and restricted land will now receive life estates in place of ''non-Indian interests in Indian land.'' The owner of allotted land who does not have any Indian heirs may devise his interest to non-Indian heirs. Such a devise may then reserve a life estate if the remainder interest is acquired by the tribe under section 206(c). Section 206(c), which allows Indian tribes to acquire interests devised to non-Indians has been rewritten for clarity. As reported on June 14, 2000, S. 1586 provided that interests of 5% or less that pass by intestate succession would be inherited with the right of survivor-ship to prevent further fractionation. Since the BIA is in the process of re-forming its trust and probate manage-ment system, the proposed amendment provides that this provision will not take effect until the Secretary certifies that the BIA has a process in place to track interests held with the right of survivorship. A separate subsection concerning gift deeds is now incorporated into another section that allows the Secretary to approve conveyance of trust land to In-dians. Also, trust land may now be con-veyed to Indians by a person of Indian ancestry who owns trust land, but does not meet the ILCA''s definition of In-dian. A second title to S. 1586 includes the text from S. 1315 and its House coun-terpart H.R. 3181, which allow the Sec-retary of Interior to approve oil and gas leases on lands allotted to indi-vidual Navajo Indians, as long as the specified majority of owners of undi-vided interests approve the trans-action. S. 1315 and H.R. 3181 were intro-duced at of the Navajo Al-lottee Association, Shii Shi Keyah. I have described S. 1586 as the ''cor- nerstone'' of the Committee's efforts to reform the BIA's management of land fractionation. Without this bill, inter-ests will continue to fractionate. That is why the Department of the Interior continues to support this bill, even though it differs greatly from the De- partment's original proposal. As far back as 1934, a member of the House of Representatives referred to fractionated interests as: ''a meaning-less system of minute partitioning in which all thought of the possible use of the land to satisfy human needs is lost in a mathematical haze of book-keeping.'' S. 1586 provides a framework that will allow the Federal govern-ment, tribal governments, and those who own interests in allotments to begin addressing these issues. Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amend-ment be agreed to, the committee amendment be agreed to, as amended, the bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any state-ments relating to the bill be printed in the R ECORD . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 4019) was agreed to. The committee amendment, in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to. The bill (S. 1586), as amended, was read the third time and passed.

This Act may be cited as the ''Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000''. TITLE I\u2014INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION SEC. 101. FINDINGS. Congress finds that\u2014 (1) in the 1800's and early 1900's, the United States sought to assimilate Indian people into the surrounding non-Indian culture by allotting tribal lands to individual members of Indian tribes; (2) as a result of the allotment Acts and re- lated Federal policies, over 90,000,000 acres of land have passed from tribal ownership; (3) many trust allotments were taken out of trust status, often without their owners consent; (4) without restrictions on alienation, al- lotment owners were subject to exploitation and their allotments were often sold or dis-posed of without any tangible or enduring benefit to their owners; (5) the trust periods for trust allotments have been extended indefinitely; (6) because of the inheritance provisions in the original treaties or allotment Acts, the ownership of many of the trust allotments that have remained in trust status has be-come fractionated into hundreds or thou-sands of undivided interests, many of which represent 2 percent or less of the total inter-ests; (7) Congress has authorized the acquisition of lands in trust for individual Indians, and many of those lands have also become fractionated by subsequent inheritance; (8) the acquisitions referred to in para- graph (7) continue to be made; (9) the fractional interests described in this section often provide little or no return to the beneficial owners of those interests and the administrative costs borne by the United States for those interests are inordinately high; (10) in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S Ct. 727 (1997)), the United States Supreme Court VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7710 July 26, 2000 found the application of section 207 of the In- dian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206) to the facts presented in that case to be un-constitutional, forcing the Department of the Interior to address the status of thou-sands of undivided interests in trust and re-stricted lands; (11)(A) on February 19, 1999, the Secretary of Interior issued a Secretarial Order which officially reopened the probate of all estates where an interest in land was ordered to es-cheat to an Indian tribe pursuant to section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206); and (B) the Secretarial Order also directed ap- propriate officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to distribute such interests ''to the rightful heirs and beneficiaries without re-gard to 25 U.S.C. 2206''; (12) in the absence of comprehensive reme- dial legislation, the number of the fractional interests will continue to grow exponen-tially; (13) the problem of the fractionation of In- dian lands described in this section is the re-sult of a policy of the Federal Government, cannot be solved by Indian tribes, and re-quires a solution under Federal law. (14) any devise or inheritance of an interest in trust or restricted Indian lands is a mat-ter of Federal law; and (15) consistent with the Federal policy of tribal self-determination, the Federal Gov-ernment should encourage the recognized tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over a reservation to establish a tribal pro-bate code for that reservation. SEC. 102. DECLARATION OF POLICY. It is the policy of the United States\u2014 (1) to prevent the further fractionation of trust allotments made to Indians; (2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of those interests into usable par-cels; (3) to consolidate fractional interests in a manner that enhances tribal sovereignty; (4) to promote tribal self-sufficiency and self-determination; and (5) to reverse the effects of the allotment policy on Indian tribes. SEC. 103. AMENDMENTS TO THE INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION ACT.

INDIAN TRIBAL PURCHASES OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN SELF GOVERNANCE Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it would be helpful to get a clarification for the R ECORD from the manager of H.R. 1167, the distinguished Chairman of the Sen-ate Committee on Indian Affairs. I un-derstand that H.R. 1167, the bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to pro-vide for further self-governance by In-dian tribes, contains a provision that would allow Indian tribes to purchase prescription drugs from the Federal Supply Schedule for the purpose of pro-viding health services to Indians under contract with the Indian Health Serv-ice. Mr. CAMPBELL. I would be glad to clarify this matter for the distin-guished Senator from North Carolina. Your understanding is correct. Mr. HELMS. I thank the able Sen- ator. Moreover, I understand that the committee intends that the prescrip-tion drugs purchased off the Federal Supply Schedule can only be used for Indians whose health care is provided by the tribe, and cannot be purchased or used for resale, nor may they be dis-pensed to non-Indian employees of a tribe. Is that correct, Mr. Chairman? Mr. CAMPBELL. It is the Commit- tee's intent that prescription drugs purchased off the Federal Supply Schedule, as authorized under H.R. 1167, are for the exclusive use of tribal members, not for non-Indian employees of a tribe. Furthermore, it is the intent of the committee that prescription drugs purchased through access to the Federal Supply Schedule by tribes are not to be resold. Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate agree to the amendments of the House. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f FUGITIVE APPREHENSION ACT OF 2000 Mr. D EWINE.

The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 2516) to fund task forces to locate and apprehend fugitives in Federal, State and local felony criminal cases and give ad-ministrative subpoena authority to the United States Marshals Service, and for other purposes. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill which had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, with an amendment, as follows: (Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the part printed in italic) S. 2516 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

AMENDMENT NO . 4020 Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senators T HURMOND , BIDEN, and L EAHY . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Ohio (Mr. D EWINE) for Mr. T HURMOND , Mr. B IDEN, and Mr. L EAHY , proposes an amendment numbered 4020. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To impose nondisclosure requirements, and for other purposes) On page 14, beginning with line 21, strike through page 15, line 20 and insert the fol-lowing: ''(3) N ONDISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS .\u2014 ''(A) I N GENERAL .\u2014Except as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2), the Attorney General may apply to a court for an order requiring the party to whom an administrative sub-poena is directed to refrain from notifying any other party of the existence of the sub-poena or court order for such period as the court deems appropriate.

On page 16, line 9 insert '', in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury,'' after ''eral''. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased that tonight the Senate is considering S. 2516, the Fugitive Appre-hension Act. Senator B IDEN and I intro- duced this important legislation to help address the serious threat of fed-eral and state fugitives. The need for it was clearly demonstrated in a hearing I held on this matter last month in my subcommittee. The number of wanted persons is truly alarming. There are over 38,000 felony warrants outstanding in federal cases. There are over one-half million felony or other serious fugitives listed in the National Crime Information Center database. Yet, this is far less than the actual number of dangerous fugitives roaming the streets because many states do not put all dangerous wanted persons into the database. As recently reported in the Washington Post, California has 2.5 million unserved felony and misdemeanor war-rants, and Baltimore has 61,000. While violent crime in the United States has been decreasing in recent years, the number of serious fugitives has been climbing. The number of N.C.I.C. fugitives has doubled since 1987, and continues to rise steadily each year. Fugitives represent not only an out- rage to the rule of law, they are also a serious threat to public safety. Many of VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7717 July 26, 2000 them continue to commit additional crimes while they roam undetected. The bill would provide $40 million dollars over three years for the Mar-shals Service to form fugitive task forces with state and local authorities. The Marshals Service is the lead fed-eral agency regarding this matter. Task forces combine the expertise of the Marshals Service in these special-ized investigations with the knowledge that local law enforcement has about their communities. This teamwork helps authorities prioritize and appre-hend large numbers of dangerous crimi-nals. The legislation would also provide administrative subpoena authority, which would allow investigators to track down leads about wanted persons faster and more efficiently. Currently, the time it takes to get vital informa-tion, such as telephone or apartment rental records, through a formal court order can make the difference between whether a fugitive is apprehended or remains on the run. This bill has been endorsed by var- ious law enforcement organizations, in-cluding the National Sheriffs Associa-tion, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National Association of Police Or-ganizations, and the subpoena author-ity is supported by the Administration. This is an important step that we can take to help federal and state law en-forcement address the serious fugitive threat that exists in our country. I ask consent to have printed in the R ECORD a section-by-section analysis of the bill. There being no objection, the anal- ysis was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: SECTION -BY-SECTION ANALYSIS Section 1. Short title The title is the ''Fugitive Apprehension Act of 2000.'' Section 2. Fugitive apprehension task forces The purpose of this provision is to assist Federal, state and local law enforcement au-thorities by forming multi-agency task forces around the country to locate and ap-prehend fugitives wanted by their jurisdic-tions. The bill would authorize to be appropriated to the U.S. Marshals Service $40 million dol-lars over three years to establish new, per-manent Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces and supplement the efforts of task forces al-ready operating in areas throughout the United States. The Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces would be totally dedicated to lo-cating and apprehending fugitives under the direction of a National Director and not under a specific District to insure that they are not utilized for other Marshals Service missions. Section 3. Administrative subpoena authority This section of the bill creates a new sec- tion 1075 in Title 18, United States Code, pro-viding for administrative subpoena authority to ascertain the whereabouts of fugitives. Section 1075(a) contains various definitions for ''fugitive,'' ''investigation,'' and ''state,'' that delimit the scope of the section's opera-tive provisions. Section 1075(b) provides for the issuance of administrative subpoenas in investigations as defined in section 1075(a). The Attorney General may subpoena witnesses for the pro- duction of records the Attorney General finds, based on articulable facts, are relevant to discerning the whereabouts of a fugitive. A subpoena must describe the records or items required to be produced and prescribe a return date within a reasonable period of time within which the records or items can be assembled and made available. Witnesses may not be required to travel more than 500 miles from the place of service of the sub-poena, and must be paid the same fees and mileage paid witnesses in United States courts. Section 1075(c) provides for methods of service of a subpoena under this section. Section 1075(d) empowers courts to enforce subpoenas issued under this section. Sub-poena recipients may move to modify or quash an administrative subpoena within 20 days of service of the subpoena, or prior to the return date, whichever period is shorter, on specified grounds. Section 1075(e) provides that the Attorney General must issue a report to the Congress about the use of this section, for the first three years following enactment of the stat-ute. Section 1075(f) provides that the Attorney General shall issue guidelines governing the issuance of administrative subpoenas aimed at the apprehension of fugitives as author-ized by this section. The guidelines shall mandate that no such subpoenas issue absent review and approval of senior supervisory personnel within the respective investigative agency or component of the Department of Justice. Section 1075(g) provides that administra- tive subpoenas issued to a provider of elec-tronic communication service (as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a72510) or remote computing service (as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a72711) may include delayed notification and nondisclosure provi-sions consistent with 18 U.S.C. \u00a72705. Para-graph (g) further provides that subpoenas issued under this section for financial records are subject to the Attorney General's power to request a delayed customer notice pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a73409. Administrative subpoenas issued pursuant to this section should be governed, where appropriate, by 18 U.S.C. \u00a72705 and 12 U.S.C. \u00a73409. Otherwise, the Attorney General may apply for a court order imposing a non-disclosure period for specified reasons. Section 1075(h) provides that good faith compliance with a subpoena issued under this section, and good faith compliance with a nondisclosure order under this provision (whether incorporated in a subpoena by the Attorney General or separately ordered by a court), will be immunized from civil liability in state and federal courts. Section 4. Study and report of the use of admin- istrative subpoenas This section requires the Attorney Gen- eral, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to complete a study of the use of administrative subpoena power, and re-port to the Congress by December 31, 2001. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing S. 2516, ''The Fugitive Apprehension Act of 2000.'' During Senate Judiciary Committee consideration of this legislation, we were able to reconcile in the Thur-mond-Biden-Leahy substitute amend-ment to S. 2516, the significant dif-ferences between that bill, as intro-duced, and S. 2761, ''The Capturing Criminals Act,'' which I introduced with Senator K OHLon June 21, 2000. I commend Senators T HURMOND and BIDEN for their leadership on this issue and am glad we were able to make a number of changes to the bill to ensure that the authority granted is con-sistent with privacy and other appro-priate safeguards. As a former prosecutor, I am well aware that fugitives from justice are an important problem and that their capture is an essential function of law enforcement. According to the FBI, nearly 550,000 people are currently fugi-tives from justice on federal, state, and local felony charges combined. This means that there are almost as many fugitive felons as there are citizens re-siding in my home state of Vermont. The fact that we have more than one half million fugitives from justice, a significant portion of whom are con-victed felons in violation of probation or parole, who have been able to flaunt courts order and avoid arrest, breeds disrespect for our laws and poses unde-niable risks to the safety of our citi-zens. Our federal law enforcement agencies should be commended for the job they have been doing to date on capturing federal fugitives and helping the states and local communities bring their fugi-tives to justice. The U.S. Marshals Service, our oldest law enforcement agency, has arrested over 120,000 fed-eral, state and local fugitives in the past four years, including more federal fugitives than all the other federal agencies combined. In prior years, the Marshals Service spearheaded special fugitive apprehension task forces, called FIST Operations, that targeted fugitives in particular areas and was singularly successful in arresting over 34,000 fugitive felons. Similarly, the FBI has established twenty-four Safe Streets Task Forces exclusively focused on apprehending fugitives in cities around the country. Over the period of 1995 to 1999, the FBI's efforts have resulted in the ar-rest of a total of 65,359 state fugitives. Nevertheless, the number of out- standing fugitives is too large. The substitute amendment we consider today will help make a difference by providing new but limited administra-tive subpoena authority to the Depart-ment of Justice to obtain documentary evidence helpful in tracking down fugi-tives and by authorizing the Attorney General to establish fugitive task forces. ''Administrative subpoena'' is the term generally used to refer to a de-mand for documents or testimony by an investigative entity or regulatory agency that is empowered to issue the subpoena independently and without the approval of any grand jury, court or other judicial entity. I am generally skeptical of administrative subpoena power. Administrative subpoenas avoid the strict grand jury secrecy rules and the documents provided in response to such subpoenas are, therefore, subject to broader dissemination. Moreover, since investigative agents issue such subpoenas directly, without review by VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:35 Dec 04, \u2014 SENATE S7718 July 26, 2000 a judicial officer or even a prosecutor, fewer ''checks'' are in place to ensure the subpoena is issued with good cause and not merely as a fishing expedition. Nonetheless, unlike initial criminal inquiries, fugitive investigations present unique difficulties. Law en-forcement may not use grand jury sub-poenas since, by the time a person is a fugitive, the grand jury phase of an in-vestigation is usually over. Use of grand jury subpoenas to obtain phone or bank records to track down a fugi-tive would be an abuse of the grand jury. Trial subpoenas may also not be used, either because the fugitive is al-ready convicted or no trial may take place without the fugitive. This inability to use trial and grand jury subpoenas for fugitive investiga-tions creates a gap in law enforcement procedures. Law enforcement partially fills this gap by using the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), which author- izes federal courts to ''issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.'' The procedures, however, for obtaining orders under this Act, and the scope and non-disclosure terms of such or-ders, vary between jurisdictions. Thus, authorizing administrative subpoena power will help bridge the gap in fugitive investigations to allow federal law enforcement agencies to ob-tain records useful for tracking a fugi-tive's whereabouts. The Thurmond-Biden-Leahy sub- stitute amendment incorporates a number of provisions from the Leahy- Kohl ''Capturing Criminals Act'' and makes significant and positive modi-fications to the original version of S. 2516. First, as introduced, S. 2516 would have limited use of an administrative subpoena to those fugitives who have been ''indicted,'' and failed to address the fact that fugitives flee after arrest on the basis of a ''complaint'' and may flee after the prosecutor has filed an ''information'' in lieu of an indictment. The substitute amendment, by con-trast, would allow use of such sub-poenas to track fugitives who have been accused in a ''complaint, informa-tion or indictment.'' Second, S. 2516, as introduced, would have required the U.S. Marshal Service to report quarterly to the Attorney General (who must transmit the report to Congress) on use of the administra-tive subpoenas. While a reporting re-quirement is useful, the requirement as described in the original S. 2516 was overly burdensome and insufficiently specific. The substitute amendment, as in the Capturing Criminals Act, would require the Attorney General to report for the next three years to the Judici-ary Committees of both the House and Senate with the following information about the use of administrative sub-poenas in fugitive investigations: the number issued, by which agency, iden- tification of the charges on which the fugitive was wanted and whether the fugitive was wanted on federal or state charges. Third, although the original S. 2516 outlined the procedures for enforce-ment of an administrative subpoena, it was silent on the mechanisms for con-testing the subpoena by the recipient. The substitute amendment expressly addresses this issue. As set forth in the Capturing Criminals Act, this sub-stitute amendment would allow a per- son who is served with an administra-tive subpoena to petition a court to modify or set aside the subpoena on grounds that compliance would be ''un-reasonable or oppressive'' (a standard used in Fed. R. Crim. P. 17 for trial subpoenas) or would violate constitu-tional or other legal rights of the per-son. Fourth, the original S. 2516 did not provide, or set forth a procedure, for the government to command a custo-dian of records not to disclose or to delay notice to a customer about the existence of the subpoena. This is par-ticularly critical in fugitive investiga-tions when law enforcement does not want to alert the fugitive that the po-lice are on his/her trail. The substitute amendment incorporates from the Cap-turing Criminals Act the express au-thority for law enforcement to apply for a court order directing the custo-dian of records to delay notice to sub-scribers of the existence of the sub-poena on the same terms applicable in current law to other subpoenas issued to phone companies and other elec-tronic service providers and to banks. Fifth, the original S. 2516 did not pro- vide any immunity from civil liability for persons complying with administra-tive subpoenas in fugitive investiga-tions. As in the Capturing Criminals Act, the substitute amendment would provide immunity from civil liability for good faith compliance with an ad-ministrative subpoena, including non- disclosure in compliance with the terms of a court order. Sixth, S. 2516, as introduced, would have authorized use of an administra-tive subpoena upon a finding by the At-torney General that the documents are ''relevant and material,'' which is fur-ther defined to mean that ''there are articulable facts that show the fugi-tive's whereabouts may be discerned from the records sought.'' Changing the standard for issuance of a subpoena from ''relevancy'' to a hybrid of ''rel-evant and material'' sets a confusing and bad precedent. Accordingly, the substitute amendment would authorize issuance of an administrative subpoena for documents if the Attorney General finds based upon articulable facts that they are relevant to discerning the fu-gitive's whereabouts. Seventh, the original S. 2516 author- ized the Attorney General to issue guidelines delegating authority for issuance of administrative subpoenas only to the Director of the U.S. Mar-shals Service, despite the fact that the FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Admin-istration also want this authority to find fugitives on charges over which they have investigative authority. The substitute amendment would authorize the Attorney General to issue guide-lines delegating authority for issuance of administrative subpoenas to super-visory personnel within components of the Department. Eighth, the original S. 2516 did not address the issue that a variety of ad-ministrative subpoena authorities exist in multiple forms in every agency. The substitute amendment incorporates from the Capturing Criminals Act a re-quirement that the Attorney General provide a report on this issue. Finally, as introduced, S. 2516 au- thorized the U.S. Marshal Service to establish permanent Fugitive Appre-hension Task Forces. By contrast, the substitute amendment would authorize $40,000,000 over three years for the At-torney General to establish multi- agencytask forces (which will be co-ordinated by the Director of the Mar-shals Service) in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the States, so that the Secret Service, BATF, the FBI and the States are able to participate in the Task Forces to find their fugitives. This Thurmond-Biden-Leahy sub- stitute amendment makes necessary changes to this bill that will help law enforcement\u2014with increased resources for regional fugitive apprehension task forces and administrative subpoena au-thority\u2014bring to justice both federal and state fugitives who, by their con-duct, have demonstrated a lack of re-spect for our nation's criminal justice system. Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to, the committee substitute amendment, as amended, agreed to, the bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements re-lating to the bill be printed in the R ECORD .

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Sen-ate completes its business today, it ad-journ until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, July 27. I further ask con-sent that on Thursday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Sen-ate then begin a period of morning business for Coverdell tributes only until 11 a.m., with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f PROGRAM Mr. D EWINE. When the Senate con- venes at 9:30 a.m., the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 11 a.m. for statements in memory of Sen-ator Paul Coverdell. Following morn-ing business, the Senate will have a swearing-in ceremony for Senator-des-ignate Zell Miller.

By previous order, following the cloture vote, the Senate will begin con-sideration of the conference report to accompany the Department of Defense appropriations bill, with a vote to occur at approximately 3:15 p.m. As-suming cloture is invoked on the mo-tion to proceed to the energy and water appropriations bill, the Senate will then begin 30 hours of postcloture de-bate.

Our national agriculture was profoundly im- pacted by Jake's promotion and developmentof soybean farming. His family brought the firstsoybean seed to the mid-South, and heachieved remarkable success through theJacob Hartz Seed Co., a leader in the indus-try. More than just a businessman, Jake'slong-standing service in State and nationalsoybean organizations culminated in his ten-ure as president of the American Soybean As-sociation; in the interim he founded the Arkan-sas Soybean Association, served as presidentof the Arkansas Seed Dealers Association,was named director and finance chairman ofthe Soybean Council of America, and was anactive member of the Arkansas Plant Board.All this while sitting on the board of directorsfor the Little Rock branch of the Federal Re-serve Bank of St. Louis, and serving on thetrust board of the Boy Scouts of America. Jake was ahead of his time in under- standing the importance of research and tech-nology in agriculture. He hired the first reg- istered seed technologist in 1952. In 1973,Jake was appointed to the U.S. Department ofAgriculture's Plant Variety Protection Board,and this experience led him to begin a re-search program to develop higher-yield, dis-ease-resistant soybean varieties for the mid-South. Soon thereafter, the Hartz Seed Co.established the largest soybean research facil-ity in the southern United States. Even further, Jake worked tirelessly to pro- tect the valuable surface and groundwatersupplies in the Grand Prairie region. Throughthe conservation measures and alternativewater supplies he proposed, Jake contributedsignificantly toward achieving the re-authoriza-tion of the Grand Prairie Region and BayouMeto Basin project. Numerous awards and honors have been bestowed upon Jake Hartz, including the Pres-idential ``E'' Certificate for Exports to recognizehis outstanding contribution to export expan-sion in Japan, Mexico, and Spain; the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers Commander'sAward for Public Service, in honor of his lead-ership in protecting natural resources; andspecial designations from Ducks Unlimited, theBoy Scouts of America, and St. Vincent Infir-mary. As a veteran of World War II, a community activist, an outstanding businessman, a leaderin agriculture, and a generous public servant,Jake Hartz deserves our respect and grati-tude. On behalf of the Congress, I am proudto extend best wishes to my good friend onhis 80th OF AMANDA PEARSON\u00d0 REVOLUTION'' HON. DONALD A. MANZULLO OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, I was visited recently by Amanda Pearson of Rockford, Illi-nois. Amanda is in high school. When I dis-covered that her essay on Sam Adams hadbeen placed in God's World News, I requestedthat she send me a copy. The article is sotimely that I believe more Americans need toknow this story. I commend this article to mycolleagues and other readers of the R ECORD. SAMUEL ADAMS : FATHER OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION (By Amanda Pearson) ``We must do something. The present situa- tion cannot remain untouched.'' The middle-aged man of about 48 mulled these thoughtsover as he paced steadily toward the Bostonbuilding that sheltered the town meetings. Samuel Adams shuddered, pulled his jack- et closer around him and continued his mus-ing. ``The day before yesterday, March 5, sev- eral colonists were killed right here in Bos-ton, when those oppressive British regularsopened fire.'' ``We are being ruled by a pure tyrant,'' he muttered under his breath. ``How long mustwe suffer under a power that violates thelaws of nature and of nature's God?'' He turned a corner and walked along the street toward the building at the end. Histhoughts turned back to the massacre. ``Yes,'' Mr. Adams thought. ``We must fight to remove the British from Boston beforemore difficulties arise!'' With that, he marched up the steps and into the building. Yes, Samuel Adams did succeed in getting those British troops removed from Boston.In fact, he became known as the ``Father ofthe American Revolution.'' YOUNG SAM Samuel Adams was an older cousin of John Adams, who eventually became president ofthe United States. Samuel was born in Bos-ton, Massachusetts, on Sept. 22, 1722. His father was well-to-do and provided his son with a good education. And Samuelproved to be studious. At 18, he graduated from Harvard, a college with strong Christian roots. Once he wasdone with his schooling, he was apprenticedto a well-established merchant in Boston. Eventually, Samuel set up his own busi- ness. But he did not care for that profession.He was more interested in politics and thecurrent situation of the colonies. SAM'S YOUNG FAMILY Samuel married Elizabeth Checkley in Oc- tober of 1749. Only two of the couple's fivechildren\u00d0Samuel Adams Jr. and Hannah\u00d0reached adulthood. And his wife, Elizabeth died on July 25, 1757. Seven years later, Sam married Eliza-beth Wells, an industrious woman whohelped her step-children and husband to livecomfortably in spite of Samuel's small in-come.Samuel reared his family on Christian principles. The Bible was read every night inthe Adams household. TOWARD REVOLUTION Samuel Adams knew that the British and King George III of England were treating thecolonists unfairly. The people tried to settletheir problems with the government peace-fully. But the British wouldn't listen, and things continued to simmer towards a boil. In 1763, Samuel was one of the first to pro- pose that the American colonies becomeunited to fight against England. Seven yearslater, he was serving as spokesman for Bos-ton after the Boston Massacre occurred. In 1772, he launched the Committees of Correspondence with the help of RichardHenry Lee. The Committees provided thecolonists with the latest current events andkept them up-to-date on British activities. THE COMMITTEES The Committees had three goals: 1. to delineate the rights the Colonists had as men, as Christians, and as subjects of thecrown; 2. to detail how these rights had been vio- lated; and 3. to publicize throughout the Colonies the first two items. One of the documents that the Committees of Correspondent distributed in late 1772 wasthe ``Rights of The Colonists'' that SamAdams had written. His Christian characterand knowledge of Scripture were apparent ashe wrote: ``The Rights of the Colonists as Christians. These may be best understood by readingand carefully studying the institutes of thegreat Law Giver and Head of the ChristianChurch, which are to be found clearly writ-ten and promulgated in the New Testa-ment.'' FOR GOD AND COUNTRY In 1774, the British governor of Massachu- setts attempted to quiet Sam Adams. He of-fered him a high rank in the colonial govern-ment. However, Sam refused to be silenced. ``I trust I have long since made my peace withthe King of kings. No personal considerationshall induce me to abandon the righteouscause of my country,'' he said. ``Tell Governor Gage, it is the advice of Samuel Adams to him, no longer to insultthe feelings of an exasperated people.'' HONOR In 1774, Samuel Adams was elected as a delegate of Massachusetts to the ContinentalCongress. There in 1776 he eagerly signed theDeclaration of Independence, declaring thecolonies free from England. In 1778, after the Revolution, Mr. Adams eventually supported Massachusetts' ratifi-cation of the U.S. Constitution, although atfirst he refused to do so. He served as governor of Massachusetts from 1793 to 1797 then retired from publicservice altogether. GLORY At the end of his life on earth, Samuel Adams made a final statement of his beliefsin his will: ``Principally and first of all, I reccommend my soul to that Almighty Being who gave itand my body I commit to the dust, relyingupon the merits of Jesus Christ for a pardonof all my sins.'' VerDate 11<MAY>2000 E1320 July 26, 2000 He died in 1803 at the age of 82, a Founding Father, ``Firebrand of the Revolution,'' andmost important, a Christian man. /fdash TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR MILDRED FULWOOD HON.

ROY BLUNT OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, today I congratu- late the vision, and commitment of the officers,administrative staff and employees of theSpringfield Remanufacturing Corporation inSpringfield, Missouri as they attain the higheststatus available in OSHA's Voluntary Protec-tion Program. The company located in Missouri's Seventh Congressional District employs 370 people inthe remanufacturing of diesel engines fortrucking, agriculture and heavy equipment in-dustries. With this award from the Occupa-tional Safety and Health Administration, thecompany joins a select group of only 15 otherfirms in the state, four in Springfield, with thedesignation of Star Sites. Nationally there areonly 550 sites which have attained this level ofcommitment to worker safety. The certification was granted after an inten- sive self study of safety policies, proceduresand practices by employees at all levels fol- lowed by a rigorous comprehensive reviewvisit by OSHA inspectors who found the work-places to be fully in compliance with all regula-tions. According to OSHA this designation means that the health and safety practices and proce-dures developed by the company are modelswithin their industry, and that the company isachieving the highest levels of health andsafety compliance. I would also point out that this outstanding achievement is the result of a cooperative ef-fort between public and private entities ratherthan a unilateral regulatory effort on the part ofa lone federal agency. To quote OSHA ``Thisconcept recognizes that compliance enforce-ment alone can never fully achieve the objec-tives of the Occupational Safety and HealthAct. Good safety management programs thatgo beyond OSHA standards can protect work-ers more effectively than simple compliance.'' Springfield Remanufacturing Corporation, apart from this award, is a success story on itsown. In 1983 employees of the Remanufac-turing Division of International Harvester pur-chased the operation from the parent com-pany and established it as an employeeowned company. The firm has since estab-lished a number of its own subsidiaries andhas been named as one of the ``The 100 BestCompanies to Work for in America''. I express my appreciation, and that of all my colleagues, to President Jack Stack, PlantManager Marty Callison and Safety DirectorKathy Miller for their leadership in bringing thisnational recognition to Springfield, Missouriand the Seventh Congressional District. /fdash IN RECOGNITION OF NEW HAVEN POSTMASTER SHELDON RHINE-HEART FOR OUTSTANDING PUB-LIC SERVICE HON.

I wishhim many years of continued health and hap-piness in his retirement. /fdash INTRODUCTION OF THE LOCALLY REGULATED TOWING ACT HON. JAMES P. MORAN OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to be introducing the ``LocallyRegulated Towing Act.'' This legislation will re-store the ability of local governments to regu-late tow truck operations. Congress took this authority away from state and local hands when it passed the Fed-eral Aviation Administration Authorization Actof 1994, (P.L. 103\u00b1305). This law was in-tended to replace multiple and sometimesconflicting state and local regulations on inter-state carriers like Federal Express and UPS,with a single uniform, national regulation. Ex-panding services like Federal Express andUPS urged passage of the law to help lowercosts and improve their delivery time. Whilethe law achieved its objectives, it also openeda loophole that permitted tow trucks to qualify as an interstate carrier and thereby exemptedthem from state and local regulations. Unlike Federal Express, UPS, and other major interstate carriers which are regulatedby the federal government, tow truck operatorsare not. Congress has never granted any fed-eral agencies the power to regulate towtrucks. As a result, their operations are free ofany direct oversight or public accountability. In response to growing complaints about tow truck operations, Congress did amend thelaw in December 1995 (P.L. 104\u00b188) to permitstate and local governments to regulate priceson non-consensual towing. This change in fed-eral law restored state and local governments'ability to regulate towing performed without the permission of the vehicle's owner, as in the in-stance where owners of vacant, private lotsarrange for a tow truck operator to removecars parked there without their permission. Iam familiar with a number of alleged ``shamoperations'' where lot owners failed to properlypost signs that prohibited parking. Local busi-ness and restaurant patrons and tourists un-able to find street parking were enticed to usethese vacant lots only to discover later theircars were towed away and the cost to recoverthem is $100 or more. Unfortunately, even this modest change in federal law has had limited success. Con-sumer complaints about tow truck operatorsstill abound. In the last two years, ArlingtonCounty, a jurisdiction I represent, receivedmore than 160 complaints ranging from ratescharged, some as high as $120, to vehicledamage, to theft and rude behavior. Peoplewho have had their vehicles towed have toldmy office about having to go to impoundmentlots late at night in dangerous neighborhoodsto recover their cars. When they get there,they are told that only cash is accepted. Moreover, State and local ability to reassert control over tow truck operations have beenthrown into even greater confusion followingtwo conflicting Federal appeals court rulings.Ace Auto Body & Towing v. City of New Yorkupheld the ability of states and local govern-ments to regulate safety issues and prices ofnon-consensual towing, while R. Mayer of At-lanta, Inc. v. City of Atlanta denied local gov-ernments' similar authority. The only real and effective solution to this problem is to restore full state and local au-thority over all aspects of tow truck operations.The legislation I am introducing today will ac-complish this objective. It is a common sense,pro consumer piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it. /fdash REMARKS IN HONOR OF THE LATE JUDGE JON BARTON HON. KAY GRANGER OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, today I honor and remember the life of Texas state DistrictJudge Jon Barton, who passed away Saturdayat his home in Keller, Texas. He was 43 yearsold.

After practicing law in Corpus Christi and Fort Worth, Texas, Judge Barton was electedto preside over the 67th District Court in 1996.Judge Barton was a talented and hard workingindividual. There is no question that he will bedeeply missed within the Texas legal commu-nity. Judge Barton was very active in our area. He was a member of the Downtown FortWorth Rotary Club and past president of theHurst-Euless-Bedford Rotary Club. Judge Bar-ton served on the advisory board of the JohnPeter Smith Health Network and was a chartermember of the Center for Christian Living. Asa man of God, he actively served BroadwayBaptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. JudgeBarton was always willing to give of himself tohis community, his church, and his family. Judge Barton was known for his great sense of humor and for his kindness to all. Hewas a committed husband and father wholoved his family deeply. Judge Barton facedcancer with the same humor and courage thathe lived life. His deep faith in God gave JudgeBarton the strength to carry on throughout hisstruggle with sinus and liver cancer.

PETE SESSIONS OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the commitment that more than2000 banks in our great country have made toour Nation's Youth Last year, the American Bankers Associa- tion pledged to enroll 1000 banks in America'sPromise, the organization led by General ColinPowell that draws on the talents and re-sources of public, private and nonprofit organi-zations to improve the lives of our nation'syouth. Banks of Promise agreed to increasetheir involvement in programs and activitiesthat benefit children in order to provide themwith the five fundamental resources they needto succeed in life. Those resources are: (1) Anongoing relationship with a caring adult; (2) asafe place with structured activities duringnon-school hours; (3) a healthy start in life; (4)a marketable skill through effective education;and (5) a chance to give back through com-munity service. The response by the industry has been overwhelming. Today, the number of Banks ofPromise has more than doubled to 2102, re-flecting the banking industry's commitment toits communities, America's youth and the fu-ture of our nation. These banks\u00d0and state VerDate 11<MAY>2000 E1322 July 26, 2000 bankers associations across the country\u00d0are offering the children in their communities ev-erything from job training and mentoring tosafe and accessible playgrounds and financialeducation. Indeed, our nation's banks aremaking an invaluable investment: they are in-vesting in our kids. Mr. Speaker, today I rise not only to recog- nize the banking industry's commitment butalso to encourage other businesses, organiza-tions and individuals to make a similar invest-ment in their local youth. From Fortune 500companies to government agencies to thelocal mom and pop store\u00d0we all have theability, and the obligation, to help our childrensucceed in life. One familiar quote adequately sums up the importance of America's Promise. It says:``One hundred years from now, it will not mat-ter what my bank account was, the sort ofhouse I lived in, or the kind of car I drove. Butthe world may be different because I was im-portant in the life of a child.''

BOB SCHAFFER OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Mr. SCHAFFER. Mr. Speaker, today, on the eve of his impending retirement, I honor Dr.Judson M. Harper, Vice President for Re-search and Information Technology and Pro-fessor of Chemical and Bioresearch Engineer-ing, at Colorado State University (CSU), lo-cated in Ft. Collins, Colorado. During his ten-ure at the University, Dr. Harper has been in-strumental in positioning CSU as a world-classleader for research in the fields of animalsciences, information technology, natural re-sources management, atmospheric sciences,and agriculture. In 1993, Dr. Harper orchestrated the con- struction of the Animal Reproduction and Bio-technology Lab, located on the campus ofCSU. With the acquisition of this nationally-re-nowned research facility, CSU became thefirst in the nation to develop artificial insemina-tion procedures for livestock. Other accom-plishments associated with the lab include pio-neering efforts in gene splicing and cloning.Research projects from the Animal Reproduc-tion and Biotechnology Lab have also ensuredthe United States' livestock production industryremains competitive internationally. Dr. Harper is also primarily responsible for establishing the Center for Geosciences atCSU. The Center, in partnership with the De-partment of Defense, is entering into a fourthphase of research projects to develop moresophisticated equipment and technology tobetter understand weather dynamics as it re-lates to military activities. Dr. Harper has not only provided leadership in the scientific arena, but as the interim presi-dent in 1887, when Dr. Albert Yates, currentCSU President, was away on sabbatical. Dr.Harper also directed the University throughperhaps its darkest period. The flood of 1997,one of the worst weather disasters in the his-tory of the state, claimed five lives, destroyed2000 homes, and damaged 212 businesses, resulting in a $200 million loss. Thirty buildingson the CSU campus sustained damage andnearly 200 faculty, staff, and students weredisplaced. Many books were ruined, and trag-ically, many faculty lost much of their life'swork. Disaster officials were extremely im-pressed with CSU's rapid recovery, many at-tributing the credit to Dr. Harper. An active administrator and respected re- searcher, Dr. Harper is recognized internation-ally as an expert in the area of food extrusion,a process by which food ingredients are heat-ed and fashioned in an effort to achieve de-sired shapes and textures. Food extrusion isenergy efficient, cost effective, and has be-come a central part of many modern foodprocessing operations. His accomplishmentsin this area include 77 journal publications,two books, and 10 separate chapters in otherworks. In addition, he is also the co-holder offive U.S. patents. Mr. Speaker, I have had the good fortune to work with Dr. Harper for many years and onmany projects during my service as a Colo-rado State Senator and a United States Con-gressman. I regard him as a friend, an honor-able public servant, a scholar, and one of themost decent human beings I've ever met. Dr.Harper's devotion to Colorado State Universityand the people of Colorado has been thebasis for the profound legacy he has estab-lished. Future generations may one day become unfamiliar with the name of Jud Harper, but allwill be touched just the same by his exem-plary work and his superior intellect. There aremany reasons Colorado State University hasrisen to the top of higher education achieve-ment. Dr. Jud Harper is among the most sig-nificant leaders who have positioned the insti-tution in a place of such world-class prestige. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Jud Harper is leaving be- hind a tremendous legacy as he moves onfrom Colorado State University to the nextphase of his life. He will truly be missed. /fdash TRIBUTE TO THE RED ARROW CLUB HON. GERALD D. KLECZKA OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Mr. KLECZKA.

October 15th, 2000 marks the 60thanniversary of the U.S. Army's 32d Infantry Di-vision's call to active duty prior to World WarII, and also the 39th anniversary of the Octo-ber 15th, 1961 call to active duty for the BerlinCrisis. This is a very important day for theclub, for those who have worn the ``RedArrow'' in war, as well as peacetime. Comprised of troops from Michigan and Wisconsin, these soldiers were inducted intofederal service at Lansing, Michigan on Octo-ber 15th, 1940. The ``Red Arrow'' arrived inAustralia on May 14, 1942 and participated ina number of heroic WWII campaigns, seeingaction in Papua, New Guinea, Leyte, andLuzon, and later in Japan they often withstoodbitter hand-to-hand combat, and fought brave-ly and honorably for their country. During theirtour of duty in World War II, the members ofthe 32d Division laid their lives on the line fortheir country, asking nothing in return. And once again on October 15th, 1961 the ``RedArrow'' answered the call of their country toprotect our vital interests overseas, this timefor the Berlin Crisis. For their bravery, members of the 32d have received a total of ten Congressional medalsof Honor and fourteen Distinguished Unit Cita-tions. In addition, the unit has received severaldecorations including the Presidential Unit Ci-tation (Army) and the Philippine PresidentialUnit Citation. This special day serves to honor the many veterans who answered the call to duty toserve their country in this distinguished divi-sion, a number of whom made the ultimatesacrifice and never returned home to familyand friends. To the veterans, as well as thoseon active duty, my sincere congratulations onthis very special milestone in the 32d Divi-sion's history. It is an honor that is well de-served. /fdash HONORING THE LATE DIANE BLAIR HON. MARION BERRY OF ARKANSAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Mr. BERRY. Mr. Speaker, today I pay trib- ute to a great Arkansan. Today President Clin-ton, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, andmany other distinguished citizens of Arkansasare attending a memorial service in Fayette-ville to celebrate and honor the life of DianeBlair, who passed away last month. I believethat Diane Blair also deserves a tribute in theCongress, because her influence and serviceimpacted our nation as well. Diane was first and foremost a professor of political science at the University of Arkansas,and it was through this role that she touchedan entire generation of Americans. She lit-erally ``wrote the book'' on Arkansas politics\u00d0Arkansas Politics and Government: Do thePeople Rule? still stands as the one and onlyauthoritative treatment of the subject. Beyondher academic accomplishments, Diane is bestremembered as a caring and thoughtful teach-er. She engaged her students, and impartedher love of learning to them. Moreover, through her example she inspired countless people to become active in the polit-ical system. She was the conscience of theDemocratic party in Arkansas for years, but her grace and magnanimity attracted admirersfrom across the political spectrum. She wasan outspoken advocate for women and edu-cation, and for progress in general. Her accomplishments are manifold and di- verse: chairwoman of state and national com-missions, including the Corporation for PublicBroadcasting; professor emerita; author andeditor of two books; mother of five, grand-mother of two. The life of Diane Blair will be memorialized in many ways. The University of Arkansas willcreate a center for the study of southern polit-ical culture in her name. The Corporation forPublic Broadcasting has already named itsnew boardroom in her honor. However, thebest memorial to Diane Blair exists in thehearts and minds of her friends, students, andloved ones. I am proud to count myself amongthis fortunate group, and on behalf of the Con-gress I extend my deepest sympathies to thefamily of Diane Blair in their time of mourning.

ALBERT RUSSELL WYNN OF MARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Mr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, today I congratu- late Mr. Gary Francis Thomas upon his retire-ment from the United States House of Rep-resentatives Office of the Sergeant at Arms,after thirty-six years of service. Mr. Thomas began his career in Congress in 1965 working for the Architect of the Capitolin the Labor Room, where he served for fiveyears. Upon completing his work with the Ar-chitect of the Capitol in 1970, Mr. Thomastransferred to the Parking Office, where he isnow completing his thirty-six year career. Mr. Thomas began his career during the 89th Congress when Representative John W.McCormick was Speaker of the House and Lyndon B. Johnson was President of theUnited States. He has since served undereighteen Congresses and seven Presidents,rising within the Sergeant at Arms Office tothe supervisory level. Mr. Thomas resides in the 4th Congres- sional District of Maryland, which I am proudto represent. He is the father of six, three boysand three girls, while his wife, Mrs. JanellThomas, is currently expecting the couple'sseventh child.

Gary Francis Thomas' dedication to all he has served here in Congress will undoubtedlybe missed.

JERRY WELLER OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, July 19, 2000 Mr. WELLER. Mr. Speaker, I submit for the record a letter written by the Joint Committeeon Taxation (JCT) regarding a provision in- cluded in H.R. 4843, the Comprehensive Re-tirement Security and Pension Reform Act.This letter should help to clarify the provisionwhich applies to the Section 415 limits for mul-tiemployer pension plans. The JCT letter helps to clarify that, if the IRS follows the precedents it has establishedin the past, the individual multiemployer pen-sion plans will be able to provide benefit in-creases for individuals who are already retiredfrom their plan related employment if all oftheir benefits have not been previously distrib-uted. This means that an employee who iscurrently retired from union employment canbenefit from the Section 415 modifications in-cluded in H.R. 4843. I am particularly interested in this issue be- cause of a family in my district who losesmore than one-half of their annual pension be-cause of the Section 415 limits. Larry Kohr isa retired union worker who lives with his familyin my district in Illinois. Larry loses more thanone-half of his annual benefits because of the415 limits. The letter I am including into therecord today clarifies that the IRS and the indi-vidual multiemployer pension plans will havethe right and the ability, once the 415 changesare signed into law, to ensure that current re-tirees, such as the Kohr's, will be able to ben-efit from the changes in the Section 415 limits. Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to clarify this important issue. CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION , Washington, DC, July 19, 2000. Hon. J ERRY WELLER , House of Representatives,Washington, DC. D EARMR. WELLER : This is response to your request dated July 18, 2000, regarding theprovision in H.R. 4843, the ``ComprehensiveRetirement Security and Pension ReformAct,'' as reported by the Committee on Waysand Means, modifying the section 415 limits on benefits under multiemployer pensionplans. Specifically, you requested informa-tion concerning the impact that the enact-ment of H.R. 4843 would have on the author-ity and ability of multiemployer pensionplans to correct future benefits for retireeswhose pension benefits are reduced underpresent law by operation of the section 415limits. H.R. 4843 would not require multiemployer pension plans to increase pension benefits forretired participants or participants who arecurrently employed. Section 415 provideslimits on the maximum benefits that may bepaid from a pension plan, not minimum ben-efit requirements. Therefore, a modificationof an applicable section 415 limit would notautomatically increase a participant's ben-efit. Rather, whether an increase occurswould depend on the plan provisions and anymodification made to the plan to reflect theincreased limit. In order to determine the effect that H.R. 4843 would have on the authority and abilityof a multiemployer plan to increase benefitsfor retirees, a useful analogy is the repeal ofthe combined limitation on defined benefitand defined contribution plans under formersection 415(e) as a result of the enactment ofthe Small Business Job Protection Act of1996. Prior to the effective date of the repealof section 415(e), the Internal Revenue Serv-ice (the ``IRS'') issued Notice 99\u00b144, in whichthe IRS provided guidance concerning ben-efit increases that would be permitted uponthe repeal of the combined limitation on de-fined benefit and defined contribution plans. In Notice 99\u00b144, the IRS stated that if a plan is not amended to take into account therepeal of section 415(e), the effect on the ben- efits of plan participants will depend on theplan's existing provisions for applying thelimitations of section 415(e) and any otherrelevant plan provisions. According to theIRS, a plan's existing provisions could resultin automatic benefit increases for partici-pants as of the effective date of the repeal ofsection 415(e). For example, the IRS stated,the repeal of section 415(e) could result inautomatic benefit increases for participantsin defined benefit plans that incorporate byreference the limitations under section 415. In addition, the IRS stated in Notice 99\u00b144 that a defined benefit pension plan may pro-vide for benefit increases to reflect the re-peal of section 415(e) for a current or formeremployee who has commenced benefits underthe plan prior to the effective date of the re-peal of section 415(e) for the plan, but only ifthe employee or former employee has an ac-crued benefit on that date. In other words,the IRS determined that a plan may providefor benefit increases to reflect the repeal ofsection 415(e) for a former employee who hasbegun receiving benefit distributions prior tothe effective date of the repeal but whosebenefits under the plan have not been com-pletely distributed prior to the effective dateof the repeal. If H.R. 4843 is enacted, the modifications to the section 415 limits affecting multiem-ployer pension plans would be effective foryears beginning after December 31, 2000. If,in the implementation of these modifica-tions, the IRS follows the precedent that ithas established with respect to the repeal ofsection 415(e), a multiemployer plan wouldbe permitted to provide for benefit increasesto reflect the modifications of the section 415limits for a former employee who has com-menced distributions prior to 2001 but whosebenefits have not been completely distrib-uted prior to 2001. In addition, the modifica-tion of the section 415 limits could result inautomatic benefit increases for participantsin defined benefit plans that incorporate byreference the section 415 limits. I hope this information is helpful to you. If we can be of further assistance in this mat-ter, please let me know. Sincerely, L INDY L. P AULL . /fdash IN RECOGNITION OF CAPTAIN BAR- BARA P.

KAREN McCARTHY OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Ms. MCCARTHY of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to the Carter BroadcastGroup, Inc., owner of KPRS\u00b1FM and KPRT\u00b1AM radio, the oldest African-American ownedand operated radio station in America. Thisyear they celebrate 50 years of excellence asone of Kansas City's, and the nation's, mostestablished and respected broadcasters. In 1950, Andrew ``Skip'' Carter had a dream to build a black owned radio station in KansasCity that would serve the needs of his commu-nity. His station, KPRS\u00b1AM was only the sec-ond African-American station to receive abroadcast license from the Federal Commu-nications Commission (FCC). Operating withjust 1,000 watts, it went on the air playingsuch artists as Ray Charles and JamesBrown. It had to go off the air at sundown be- cause of the low wattage. In 1963 Skip Carter received a license from the FCC to operate a 100,000 watt FM facility.In 1973, their stations became the first fullyautomated stations in the Midwest. Skip Carter and his wife, Mildred, had oper- ated the two stations as a family businesssince their inception. Their grandson, Michael,had his own jazz show in the late 1960's ateight years of age. In 1987 Michael Carterwas named President of KPRS BroadcastingCorporation by his grandfather to carry on thefamily tradition. The name was later changedto the Carter Broadcast Group, Inc. to honorSkip Carter's legacy. Between 1990 and 1996 KPRS advanced from the eighth rated station to the top ratedstation in the Kansas City market as meas-ured by Arbitron. This recognition of the ``Hot103 Jamz'' came about by the hard work anddedication of the total staff, which has been in-corporated into the Carter Broadcast ``Family.''There have been numerous accolades duringtheir 50 years. Skip Carter was named to theRadio Hall of Fame, the station received aCrystal Award from the National Association ofBroadcasters, a Griffin Award from the Mis-souri Broadcasters Association for CommunityService, and their recent nomination for theMarconi Award from the National Associationof Broadcasters which recognizes excellencein radio. Winners of the Marconi Award will beannounced September 23 in San Francisco,our community will be cheering them as theyare acknowledged and honored. They havebeen recognized for business successes andcommunity service on many occasions. Threetimes they have been honored as a Top 10Small Business of the Year by the GreaterKansas City Chamber of Commerce, the mostrecent being this past April. They have con-stantly stepped forward in the community intimes of crisis. When children have been ab-ducted, they have devoted live broadcast timeto assist in finding them. They have lent theirairwaves to help raise funds for community or-ganizations such as the Ad Hoc GroupAgainst Crime. In 1999 alone, the stations as-sisted more than 150 community organizationsand aired 10,000 community service spots. Saturday, July 22, the Carter Broadcast Group is having a ``50th Anniversary Gala.''The proceeds from this event will benefit theSt. Vincent's Day Care Center, which serviesmany of Kansas City's critically at risk chil-dren. In celebration of this significant milestone, I am honored to recognize Michael Carter andthe Carter Broadcast Group's efforts and leg-acy. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratu-lating the Carter family and the entire organi-zation for 50 years of service to the GreaterKansas City community.EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING RELEASE OFRABIYA KADEER, HER SEC-RETARY AND SON BY GOVERN-MENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUB-LIC OF CHINA SPEECH OF HON. FRANK R. WOLF OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, July 24, 2000 Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup- port of this resolution that calls on the Peo-ple's Republic of China to immediately releaseRabiya Kadeer, a prominent Uighur business-women, her son, and her secretary. When the Chinese government arrests and imprisons people like this, it is an important re-minder to all of us of the true character of theChinese regime. The State Department's 1999Human Rights Report on China stated thisclearly, saying, ``The [Chinese] government'spoor human rights record deteriorated mark-edly throughout the year as the Governmentintensified efforts to suppress dissent, particu-larly organized dissent.'' The Chinese government will stop at noth- ing to silence any voice of freedom and truth.The Chinese government murders its ownpeople to stay in power, flattening thousandsof its own citizens who supported theTiananmen Square democracy movement.The Chinese government has arrested, impris-oned, or kicked out of the country virtuallyevery leading democratic dissident. People of faith are persecuted by the Chi- nese government. Christians, TibetanBhuddists, and Muslim Uighurs like Ms.Kadeer are imprisoned and forced into prisonlabor, because of their faith. The Chinese re-gime has imprisoned old men like 80\u00b190 year-old-Catholic bishops. The government regu-larly persecutes and imprisons priests andProtestant House church leaders, TibetanBhuddist monks and nuns. I am very supportive of this resolution today and I think this resolution sends an importantmessage of disapproval of the Government ofChina's deplorable behavior toward its owncitizens. /fdash IN MEMORY OF REV.

HENRY BONILLA OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Mr. BONILLA. Mr. Speaker, Monday, July 31, 2000 is the 80th birthday of retired AirForce Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott.I offer congratulations and continued happi-ness to him and his loved ones. On this spe-cial day for ``McD,'' I wish to honor and salutehim for his lifelong service to his fellow Ameri-cans. Born in Boston, Massachusetts, General McDermott attended Boston Latin School andNorwich University. He graduated from WestPoint with the Class of January 1943. Aftercommissioning, he flew 61 combat missions ina P\u00b138 over Europe. After World War IIended, he continued his military service in Eu-rope, the Pentagon, and, after earning anMBA at Harvard, on the faculty at West Point. His assignment to the newly created Air Force Academy in 1954 signaled the begin-ning of his outstanding contributions to theU.S. Air Force. As Dean of the Faculty for thefirst ten graduating classes, he pioneered andchampioned a number of innovations thatchanged the face of service academy edu-cation. These included a modernized and en-riched curriculum, academic majors, the firstDepartment of Astronautics in the country, andcooperative Master's degree programs withprestigious universities such as UCLA andPurdue. He also developed a whole-personadmissions program which brought the highestquality students to the Academy. These inno-vations were so successful that West Pointand Annapolis broke with their traditions andinstituted many of them. For these accom-plishments, General McDermott is universallyacknowledged as the ``Father of Modern Mili-tary Education.'' For many this would have been enough success for one lifetime, but not for McD. In1969 he tackled the private sector, becomingthe head of USAA, an insurance and financialservices association that served military offi-cers and their families. Under GeneralMcDermott USAA grew from a relatively smallproperty and casualty insurer into a successfulfinancial services supermarket. He added no- load mutual funds, credit cards, a discountbrokerage, and a full-service bank. He also pi-oneered technology-based customer service,employing ``800'' phone services, computers,and IMAGE processing. Today USAA is aworldwide insurance and diversified financialservices family of companies, where the ma-jority of customers continue to be members ofthe U.S. military. General McDermott also made USAA a great place to work. No company was ratedhigher in the first publication of the ``BestPlaces to Work in America,'' and Fortune se-lected USAA as the best service provider inthe insurance industry. McD has received vir-tually all the highest accolades offered to busi-nessmen, including selection to the NationalBusiness Hall of Fame. After retiring as USAAChairman Emeritus in 1993, his methods con-tinue to be a model for insurance and financialservices companies. At the same time McD has made enormous contributions to his community, includingfounding the San Antonio Economic Develop-ment Foundation, the Texas Research Park,and a mentor program that has reached thou-sands of children. General McDermott's en-ergy, vision, intelligence, character, and beliefin the Golden Rule has made everything hetouches positive and successful. Once again, Happy Birthday McD. Con- gratulations on a great 80 years and bestwishes for many more. /fdash IN RECOGNITION OF DR. OTAKAR HUBSCHMANN HON.

Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work of the Yosem-ite National Park Volunteer Project. Theproject is celebrating a decade of effort by theYosemite Fund and volunteers from ChevronCorporation to restore and preserve one of thecrown jewels of our National Park System. Yo-semite's 4 million yearly visitors will bear wit-ness to the fruits of this effort: More than 60acres of meadows, lake area and woodlandshave been restored. Nearly 3,000 volunteersdonated 27,500 hours to collect and plant10,000 oak seedlings, remove 1,000 feet ofroadway, build 4,000 feet of split rail fence, in-stall 1,500 feet of boardwalk, remove 600,000pounds of asphalt, plant 100 black oak treesand improve one mile of trails. Mr. Speaker, this is not glamorous work. To the contrary, splitting rails, digging up asphaltand laying boardwalk to protect meadows ishard, physical labor. The Chevron volunteersdid it happily, putting to superb use the $1.3million in contributions provided by Chevron.The Yosemite Fund, the National Park Serviceand Chevron have created a partnership thatinvigorates natural conditions in Yosemitewhich still might be in danger of permanentdegradation if it were not for this timely volun-teer and financial assistance.

Mr. Speaker, it is with great appreciation today, on the fiftieth anni-versary of the Korean War, to celebrate thosewho fought for this country and its ideals. I respect those who served in the Korean War and for the more than 54,000 who didn'treturn. I commend the men and women whoserved valiantly and with little recognition.These brave veterans returned home andwent back to work to make our country thegreatest nation on Earth. Because of this lack of attention, the Korean War has frequently been called ``The Forgot-ten War.'' Today I say that we have not forgot-ten. To this day, American and South Koreantroops stand watch on the Korean peninsula,living testaments to this critical episode in theannals of the Cold War. Millions of citizens inSouth Korea remember the sacrifices Ameri-cans made and cherish the freedom that wefought to preserve for them. Let me also pay special tribute to those who have made it their mission to ensure we donot forget those who fought there and did notreturn. Bob Dumas, a constituent of mine,continues his untiring search for his brother,Roger, who remains MIA in North Korea. Re-mains of another twelve American servicemenwere returned to the U.S. by North Korea onSaturday. I believe we must continue to pressuntil we have accounted for all lost in the con-flict. Finally, let me challenge my colleagues to take this opportunity, while we are remem-bering this ``Forgotten War,'' to renew ourcommitment to those who served with honor,those who fought bravely, and those who diedwith valor in the service of our country\u00d0ourveterans. Whether they served at Chosin Res-ervoir, Bunker Hill, Bloody Ridge, or Heart-break Ridge, let us respect their service andsacrifice through fully supporting those pro- grams which they truly deserve: adequatefunding of medical facilities including mentalhealth programs; more Community Based Out-reach Clinics to bring health care closer to ouraging veterans; more coordination among fed-eral agencies for our homeless veterans; andcontinued support of education and rehabilita-tion. Given the sacrifices of our veterans, weowe them much more than just a debt of grati-tude\u00d0we owe them the care that they earned. /fdash ASSURING QUALITY OF ELDER CARE IN NURSING HOMES\u00d0THEINTRODUCTION OF H.R. 4898 TOREQUIRE AIR CONDITIONING INNURSING HOMES HON. TOM LANTOS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, on June 15th and 16th of this year, three elderly patientsdied at the SunBridge Care and Rehabilitationhome in Burlingame, California, in my Con-gressional District and five others at the homewere hospitalized during a heat wave whentemperatures in the county soared to 108 \u00b0. When county officials visited the nursing homein Burlingame during last month's heat wave,fans were pointed toward staff, while elderlypeople were dying. Those deaths are underinvestigation by state and local officials in Cali-fornia. Mr. Speaker, we cannot have the federal government financially supporting nursinghomes where conditions are life-threatening.That is why I have introduced H.R. 4898, leg-islation which will require air conditioning innursing home facilities which receive Medicareor Medicaid funding. If the operators of theseprofit-making facilities are not willing to assurehumane conditions for the elderly living there,they will not receive federal funds. H.R. 4898 amends the Social Security Act to add the requirement for air conditioning tothe specifications which nursing home facilitiesmust meet in order to be eligible for federalfunds. Because Medicare and Medicaid pro-vide a major portion of the funding for manyof the patients at most nursing homes in thecountry, this legislation will require virtually allsuch facilities to have air conditioning. Mr. Speaker, these deaths in California oc- curred just a week after the release of a con-gressional study which was conducted at therequest of the members of the Bay Area con-gressional delegation. This study revealedhow substandard the conditions are in nursinghomes in our area. The study found that only6 percent of Bay Area nursing homes were in``substantial compliance'' with federal stand-ards, and 41 percent of homes were found tohave violations of federal standards ``thatcaused actual harm to residents or placedthem at risk of death or serious injury.'' Inshort, this report says our nursing homes arein crisis, and corrective action is necessary.Just one week later we saw the consequencesin the tragedy in Burlingame. Mr. Speaker, this need for air conditioning is not just a California problem. The heat wavenow affecting much of the Southern statesover the past two weeks has been blamed forthe deaths of at least 12 people in Texas andfour in Louisiana. Heat kills. It is an absolute outrage that elderly people in nursing homesare dying because it's too hot. We need totake action to protect our elderly who are innursing homes. I urge my colleagues to joinme as cosponsors of H.R. 4898 so that wecan protect our elderly citizens, our father andmothers, grandfathers and grandmothers,brothers and sisters, and friends from the heatwhen they are cared for in nursing homes. /fdash CHINA LAKE NAVY MUSEUM HON.

China Lake personnel devel-oped the first Sidewinder air to air missile.China Lake has been the source of techno-logical advances in cruise missiles, fuel-airmunitions, infrared and other technologies thatAmericans in uniform rely on in their quest todefend the nation. It is a remarkable storyproving what exceptional dedication can ac-complish. By building this museum, we can preserve a record of the achievements of people atChina Lake. Those achievements are a sourceof justifiable pride in eastern Kern County,California. With this museum, they become asource of inspiration to visitors and to thoseimportant future Americans who will come toChina Lake to solve new problems. /fdash RECOGNIZING THE SHREWSBURY HIGH SCHOOL COLONIALS BASE-BALL TEAM HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the community of Shrewsbury, Massa-chusetts, in celebrating the outstanding per-formance of the Shrewsbury High School Co-lonials Baseball team. Their remarkable sea-son came to an abrupt end on June 19th withtheir defeat in the Division 1 State Champion-ship game. This defeat, however, could notdetract from their extraordinary season. The mentality of the Colonials' baseball team can be summed up in a commonidiom\u00d0``comeback kids.'' However there isnothing ``common'' about this group of distin-guished young men. This season, driven bythe passionate leadership of Coach Dave Niro,the Colonials surprised many late-inning VerDate Remarks E1327 July 26, 2000 rallies, strong defense, and incredible hitting. As a matter of fact, four of their last six winswere come-from-behind victories. It was their``never-say-die'' attitude that lifted the spiritsand performance of the Shrewsbury HighSchool Baseball team to a level that very fewanticipated. Teamwork was the key to the Colonials' highly successful season. Led on the field byco-captains Catcher Jimmy Board and FirstBaseman Jamie Buonomo, every player per-formed to the highest level. The sensationalplay of outfielders Shayne Barnes, TommyCrossman, and Tim Kilroy, the de-fense Jon Bigda, Bill Morano, of pitchers Shawn Walker, LeeDiamotopolous, Brendan Slavin and MikeSigismondo, the clutch hitting by designatedhitter Matt Vaccaro and the numerous con-tributions by players Bob Roddy, Nick Dion,Matt Amdur, Todd Cooksey, Tim Ford, andBrian Merchant helped make this season sucha success. Also, special recognition must beextended to Head Coach Dave Niro, assist-ants P.J. O'Connell and Jay Costa, and man-ager Michelle Pessolano. It is with tremendous pride that I recognize the members of the Shrewsbury High SchoolColonials Baseball team for an unforgettableseason. I congratulate them on their accom- plishment and wish them the best of luck inthe years to come. /fdash OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS ON PORTALS BUILDING HON. RON KLINK OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, July 25, 2000 Mr. KLINK. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Commerce Committee received a letter fromthe Department of Justice which stated thatthe Department found that ``there is not a suffi-cient basis to warrant a criminal investigation''concerning whether a document was ``inten-tionally'' withheld by Tennessee developerFranklin Haney or one of his business associ-ates in a ``deliberate'' attempt to obstruct theCommittee investigation of the lease for thePortals building. That building is now theheadquarters of the Federal CommunicationsCommission. This letter marks the second time in two years that the Justice Department has rejectedthe majority's call for a criminal investigationbecause staff believed its Portals' work hadbeen obstructed. In December of 1998\u00d0after the Committee's year-long investigation andseven days of hearings resulted in a spectacu-larly unsuccessful attempt to uncover improperpolitical influence in the leasing of the Portalsbuilding\u00d0the majority wrote a staff report out-lining its unsubstantiated suspicions andasked Justice to determine if the witnesseshad made false statements ``under oath in adeliberate effort to mislead the Committee andobstruct its legitimate fact-finding processes.'' This referral was made, even though not a single witness testified to improper influence,and not a single document provided the nec-essary evidence. Justice responded by statingthat there was no ``specific and credible'' evi-dence to support the allegations of perjury andconspiracy. The majority has never accepted the results of their own investigation or even the FBI's.The FBI has already done an extensive inves-tigation of the origins of and statements in theunproduced document and obtained no evi-dence to warrant prosecution. So now appar-ently the allegation is that if the Committeehad had the document, it could have done abetter job. Nothing in the Committee's historyindicates any truth in that statement.
