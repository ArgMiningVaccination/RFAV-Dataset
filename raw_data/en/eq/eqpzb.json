As people get older, their health worsens, strength and intelligence generally diminish, and beauty is thought by many to go away. Rejuvenation is distinct from [life extension](/index.php/Life_extension). Life extension strategies often study the causes of aging and try to oppose those causes in order to slow aging. Rejuvenation is the reversal of aging and thus requires a different strategy, namely repair of the damage that is associated with aging or replacement of damaged tissue with new tissue. Rejuvenation can be a means of life extension, but most life extension strategies do not involve rejuvenation. Historical and Cultural Background Various myths tell the stories about the quest for rejuvenation. It was believed that [magic](/index.php?title=Magic_(paranormal)&action=edit&redlink=1) or intervention of a [supernatural](/index.php?title=Supernatural&action=edit&redlink=1) power can bring back the youth and many mythical adventurers set out on a journey to do that, for themselves, their relatives or some authority that sent them. An ancient Chinese emperor actually sent out ships of young men and women to find a pearl that would rejuvenate him. This led to a myth among modern Chinese that Japan was founded by these people. In some religions people were to be rejuvenated after death prior to placing them in [heaven](/index.php?title=Heaven&action=edit&redlink=1). The stories continued well into the 16th century. A famous Spanish explorer [Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n](/index.php?title=Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n&action=edit&redlink=1) led the expedition around the [Caribbean islands](/index.php?title=Caribbean_islands&action=edit&redlink=1) and into [Florida](/index.php?title=Florida&action=edit&redlink=1) to find the [Fountain of Youth](/index.php?title=Fountain_of_Youth&action=edit&redlink=1). Led by the rumours, the expedition continued the search and many perished. The Fountain was nowhere to be found as locals were unaware of its exact location. Since the emergence of [philosophy](/index.php?title=Philosophy&action=edit&redlink=1), [sages](/index.php?title=Wise_Old_Man&action=edit&redlink=1) and self-proclaimed [wizards](/index.php?title=Wizard_(fantasy)&action=edit&redlink=1) always made enormous efforts to find the secret of youth, both for themselves and for their noble [patrons](/index.php?title=Patron&action=edit&redlink=1) and [sponsors](/index.php?title=Sponsor&action=edit&redlink=1). It was widely believed that some [potions](/index.php?title=Potion&action=edit&redlink=1) may restore the youth. Another commonly cited approach was attempting to transfer the [essence](/index.php?title=Essence&action=edit&redlink=1) of youth from young people to old. Some examples of this approach were sleeping with [virgins](/index.php?title=Virgin&action=edit&redlink=1) or [children](/index.php/Child) (sometimes literally sleeping, not necessarily having sex) [[1]](#cite_note-1), bathing in or drinking their blood. The quest for rejuvenation reached its height with [Alchemy](/index.php?title=Alchemy&action=edit&redlink=1). All around the Europe and also beyond alchemists were looking for the [Philosopher's Stone](/index.php?title=Philosopher%27s_Stone&action=edit&redlink=1), the mythical substance that, as it was believed, could not only turn lead into gold, but also prolong life and restore youth. Although the set goal was not achieved, Alchemy paved the way to the [scientific method](/index.php/Scientific_method) and so to the medical advances of today. Serge Abrahamovitch Voronoff was a French surgeon born in Russia who gained fame for his technique of grafting monkey testicle tissue on to the testicles of men while working in France in the 1920s and 1930s. Which was one of the first medically accepted Rejuvenation Therapy (before he was proved to be wrong around 1930-1940). The technique brought him a great deal of money, although he was already independently wealthy. As his work fell out of favor, he went from being highly respected surgeon to a subject of ridicule. By the early 1930s, over 500 men had been treated in France by his rejuvenation technique, and thousands more around the world, such as in a special clinic set up in [Algiers](/index.php?title=Algiers&action=edit&redlink=1). [[2]](#cite_note-2) Noteworthy people who had the surgery included [Harold McCormick](/index.php?title=Harold_Fowler_McCormick&action=edit&redlink=1), chairman of the board of [International and the ageing premier of [Turkey](/index.php?title=Turkey&action=edit&redlink=1). [[4]](#cite_note-4) In fiction, there is an increasing amount of work being done on possibilities of rejuvenation treatments, and the effect this would have on society. [Misspent Youth](/index.php?title=Misspent_Youth&action=edit&redlink=1) as well as the [Commonwealth Saga](/index.php?title=Commonwealth_Saga&action=edit&redlink=1) by [Peter F. Hamilton](/index.php?title=Peter_F._Hamilton&action=edit&redlink=1) are one of the most well known examples of this, dealing with the short and long term effects of a near perfect 80 year old to 20 year old body change with mind intact. Also the [Mars trilogy](/index.php?title=Mars_trilogy&action=edit&redlink=1) deals with a much more imperfect type of rejuvenation, including problems such as long term memory loss and sheer boredom that comes with such age. Also the [post mortal](/index.php?title=Post_mortal&action=edit&redlink=1) characters in the [Revelation Space](/index.php?title=Revelation_Space&action=edit&redlink=1) series often illustrate this issue with long term or essentially infinite lifespans, sheer boredom induces them to undertake activities of extreme risk. Ancient developments The dream of longevity is a common heritage of humanity. The ancient researchers and practitioners of Siddha Vaidya in the east had developed strategies for the same reason, some of which were very effective. Our current understanding of biology, physiology, immunology and biochemistry is helping us to decipher the rationale of these therapies. Ranging from detoxification of the body to targeted nutrition these therapies can even produce invivo stimulation and deferentiation of stem cells into useful mature cells. Many of these longevity techniques are still practiced in South India. Modern developments [Aging](/index.php/Ageing) is an accumulation of damage to [macromolecules](/index.php/Macromolecule), [cells](/index.php/Cell_(biology)), [tissues](/index.php/Biological_tissue) and [organs](/index.php/Organ_(anatomy)). If any of that damage can be repaired, the result is rejuvenation. There have been many experiments which have been shown to increase the [maximum life span](/index.php/Maximum_life_span) of [laboratory](/index.php/Laboratory) animals, thereby achieving [life extension](/index.php/Life_extension). A few experimental methods such as replacing [hormones](/index.php/Hormone) to youthful levels have had considerable success in partially rejuvenating [laboratory](/index.php/Laboratory) animals and humans. There are at least eight important hormones that decline with age: 1. [human growth hormone](/index.php/Human_growth_hormone) (HGH); melatonin; 7. thyroid; 8. pregnenolone. In theory, if all or some of these hormones are replaced, the body will respond to them as it did when it was younger, thus repairing and restoring many body functions. This seems to be borne out in hundreds of thousands of persons who have replaced hormones for many years, especially human growth hormone (HGH, a.k.a. GH). Most attempts at [genetic](/index.php/Genetics) repair have traditionally involved the use of a [retrovirus](/index.php/Retrovirus) to insert a new [gene](/index.php/Gene) into a random position on a [chromosome](/index.php/Chromosome). But by attaching [zinc fingers](/index.php/Zinc_finger) (which determine where [transcription bind) to [endonucleases](/index.php/Endonuclease) (which break [DNA](/index.php/DNA) strands) [homologous recombination](/index.php/Homologous_recombination) can be induced to correct and replace defective (or undesired) DNA sequences. The first applications of this technology are to isolate [stem cells](/index.php/Stem_cell) from the [bone marrow](/index.php/Bone_marrow) of patients having [blood](/index.php/Blood) disease [mutations](/index.php/Mutation), to correct those mutations in [laboratory dishes](/index.php/Petri_dish) using zinc finger endonucleases and to transplant the stem cells back into the patients [[5]](#cite_note-5). [Regenerative](/index.php/Regeneration_(biology)) medicine uses three different strategies: - Implantation of [stem cells](/index.php/Stem_cell)from [culture](/index.php/Cell_culture)into an existing [tissue](/index.php/Biological_tissue)structure - Implantation of stem cells into a tissue [scaffold](/index.php/Scaffolding)that guides restoration or - Induction of residual [cells](/index.php/Cell_(biology))of a tissue structure to regenerate the necessary [body](/index.php/Body)part. A [salamander](/index.php?title=Salamander&action=edit&redlink=1) can not only regenerate a [limb](/index.php/Limb_(anatomy)), but can regenerate the [lens](/index.php/Lens_(anatomy)) or [retina](/index.php/Retina) of an [eye](/index.php/Eye) and can regenerate an [intestine](/index.php/Intestine). For regeneration the salamander tissues form a [blastema](/index.php/Blastema) by [de-differentiation](/index.php/Cellular_differentiation) of [mesenchymal cells](/index.php/Mesenchymal_stem_cell), and the [blastema](/index.php/Blastema) functions as a self-organizing system to regenerate the limb [[6]](#cite_note-6). Yet another option involves cosmetic changes to the individual to create the appearance of youth. These are generally superficial and do little to make the person healthier or live longer, but the real improvement in a person's appearance may elevate their mood and have positive side effects normally correlated with [happiness](/index.php?title=Happiness&action=edit&redlink=1). [Cosmetic surgery](/index.php/Cosmetic_surgery) is a large industry offering treatments such as removal of wrinkles (\"face lift\"), removal of extra fat (liposuction) and reshaping or augmentation of various body parts ( [abdomen](/index.php/Abdomen), [breasts](/index.php/Breast), [face](/index.php/Face)). There are also, as always in history, many fake rejuvenation products that do not work. Chief among these are powders and sprays and gels and homeopathic that claim to be \"growth hormone\". Authentic growth hormone can only be injected, because the 191 amino-acid protein is too large to be absorbed through the mucous membranes, and would break up in the stomach if it is swallowed. Eastern medical approaches offers us yet another treasure of techniques that can be used for tissue regeneration and invivo stem cell evolution and stimulation. According to Rajkumar Reghunathan, the inbuilt mechanism of inflammation and repair holds many keys for tissue renovation. Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS) The leading modern exponent of scientific rejuvenation is the biomedical [gerontologist](/index.php/Gerontology) Dr. [Aubrey de Grey](/index.php?title=Aubrey_de_Grey&action=edit&redlink=1). He calls his project to reverse the damage we call aging \"SENS\" (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence). He has proposed seven strategies for what he calls the \"seven deadly sins\": - Cell loss can be repaired (reversed) just by suitable [exercise](/index.php/Exercise)in the case of [muscle](/index.php/Muscle). For other tissues it needs various [growth factors](/index.php/Growth_factor)to stimulate [cell division](/index.php/Cell_division), or in some cases it needs [stem cells](/index.php/Stem_cells). - Senescent [cells](/index.php/Cell_(biology)), can be removed by activating the [immune system](/index.php/Immune_system)against them. Or they can be destroyed by [gene therapy](/index.php/Gene_therapy)to introduce \"suicide [genes](/index.php/Gene)\" that only kill senescent cells. [Protein](/index.php/Protein) [cross-linking](/index.php/Cross-linking)can largely be reversed by [drugs](/index.php/Medication)that break the links. But to break some of the cross-links we may need to develop enzymatic methods. [Extracellular](/index.php/Extracellular)garbage (like [amyloid](/index.php/Amyloid)) can be eliminated by [vaccination](/index.php/Vaccination)that gets [immune](/index.php/Immune)cells to \"eat\" the garbage. - For intracellular junk we need to introduce new [enzymes](/index.php/Enzyme), possibly enzymes from soil [bacteria](/index.php/Bacteria), that can degrade the junk ( [lipofuscin](/index.php/Lipofuscin)) that our own natural enzymes cannot degrade. - For [mitochondrial](/index.php/Mitochondrion)mutations the plan is not to repair them but to prevent harm from the mutations by putting suitably modified copies of the mitochondrial genes into the [cell nucleus](/index.php/Cell_nucleus)by gene therapy. The [mitochondrial DNA](/index.php/Mitochondrial_DNA)experiences a high degree of [mutagenic](/index.php/Mutagenic)damage because most [free radicals](/index.php/Radical_(chemistry))are generated in the [mitochondria](/index.php/Mitochondria). A copy of the mitochondrial DNA located in the [nucleus](/index.php/Cell_nucleus)will be better protected from free radicals, and there will be better [DNA repair](/index.php/DNA_repair)when damage occurs. All mitochondrial [proteins](/index.php/Protein)would then be imported into the mitochondria. - For [cancer](/index.php/Cancer)(the most lethal consequence of mutations) the strategy is to use [gene therapy](/index.php/Gene_therapy)to delete the [genes](/index.php/Gene)for [telomerase](/index.php/Telomerase)and to eliminate telomerase-independent mechanisms of turning normal cells into \"immortal\" cancer cells. To compensate for the loss of telomerase in [stem cells](/index.php/Stem_cells)we would introduce new stem cells every decade or so. Dr. de Grey has created the [Methuselah Mouse Prize](/index.php/Methuselah_Mouse_Prize), which awards money to researchers who can rejuvenate [mice](/index.php?title=Mouse&action=edit&redlink=1).
