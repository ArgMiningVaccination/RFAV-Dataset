By the end of this post, you'll have a simple, step-by-step method to meditate with aventurine and ask for what you need. Green aventurine brings luck, abundance, and emotional healing.

I'll focus on green aventurine in this post as it's the most widely used color, but it's good to know that other colors of aventurine bring different gifts. [You can find out about all the different aventurine colors and what each color brings in this blog post.](https://jewelandcrystalguide.com/what-colors-are-aventurine/) If your aventurine is a color other than green, simply adapt your intention and affirmations in the meditation below to suit the color crystal you are working with. Meditating with crystals is kind of like brushing your teeth: You need to do it regularly for the best results. This is why I recommend meditating with aventurine or any crystal once or twice a week. Regular meditation keeps an open connection with yourself and your crystals, and it maintains a balance in your life so things don't get out of control. Don't wait until you really need to meditate before dusting off your crystals and giving it a go. The truth is you can meditate as often or as little as you want, but you should definitely meditate when you feel you need to. Before meditating with aventurine, [be sure to cleanse and charge it]to remove old energy and tap into \"clean\" and powerful new energy.

[Click here for a list of affirmations that work well with aventurine.](https://jewelandcrystalguide.com/aventurine-affirmations/) Closely examine the crystal Take a good look at your aventurine while holding it up in the air and turning it around. Try to get your senses involved with the crystal, to start forming an active connection with it for the meditation (you'll see how we make our final connection in a little bit). In fact, this step is part of the meditation because you'll start forgetting about the rest of the world and bring your attention to the present moment. Be fully involved in this step and try to enjoy the bond that's forming with your crystal. Notice the colors, shape, patterns, and anything else unique about your crystal. Feel the entire crystal with your hands, and smell it. This is an important step in the meditation, even if you always use the same crystal. Please don't skip it unless you really have to. Put the crystal near your heart and solar plexus chakras Lie down somewhere comfortable, where you won't be interrupted. Wear warm clothes and cover yourself with a blanket if the air is chilly. Put the aventurine on the floor close to the chakra you want to activate. The table below tells you what chakras each aventurine color Chakra, Third Eye Chakra| And the following picture shows you where these chakras are all located on your body: If you have four aventurine crystals or a mix of crystals you can create an energy field around yourself to amplify the crystals' energies. To do this, just put a crystal above, below, and on each side of you when you lie down to meditate. Remember that they don't all need to be aventurine crystals to work. Take three deep breaths Now close your eyes and relax your body. Put your hands next to your body or place one hand on top of the other on your stomach. Take three deep, slow breaths, counting in for five and out for five. I like to breathe in through my nose and out with my mouth. Try lifting and filling your tummy with air when you breathe in. This is called \"belly breathing.\" This method helps you take in deeper breaths and a lot more revitalizing oxygen than regular shallow breathing. See the aventurine in your mind's eye Picture the aventurine crystal in your mind. Try to see it as clearly as you can floating gently in the space in front of your face. Remember the shape, feel, colors, markings, smell, and anything else you can about the crystal. The purpose of this exercise is to open your connection and communication with the crystal, and to forget about everything around you and any worries you might have. It also prepares the crystal to hear what you want to ask for. True connection with a crystal often takes time and practice, so don't give up if you struggle the first few times to see it when you close your eyes. The more often you try to connect with your crystal, the easier it becomes to recognize an \"active connection.\" An active connection with aventurine gives some people a feeling of warmth and light shining around the upper half of their body, especially around their chest area where their heart and solar plexus chakras sit. But you could feel the connection in another way. Pay attention to how your body reacts and tells you that it is making this connection, so you recognize it when it happens. Tell the aventurine what you seek Once you feel connected with the aventurine, or as connected as you can be at this time, ask the crystal to bring you what you need. You can ask silently in your mind or speak it out loud as an affirmation or open dialogue (just talking as things come up for you). If you're using an affirmation, repeat it at least three times, and be very clear and specific about what you do want: Always ask a crystal to bring something rather than take something away. For example, don't ask for a sickness or pain to go away. Ask for a healthy body and to feel revitalized once more. Or use one of my affirmations for healing and recovery, such as \"My body heals easily.\" You can also use phrases like \"I am well,\" \"I stay healed,\" or any other affirmations that resonate with you. Ask as many times as you need to, but ask only for one thing per meditation. If you ask for more gifts, you are diluting the request and probably won't get the results you want. Let your intuition guide you and stop when you feel you've asked enough times. Thank the aventurine There is power in gratitude. Giving thanks to your aventurine strengthens its powers to help you, making this a wonderful bond and friendship. To show appreciation, whisper the words \"Thank you\" and feel true and absolute gratitude with your entire body. Stay in this bubble of quiet thankfulness until you're ready to wake up from it. Now slowly open your eyes and rise. Keep your aventurine in the right place If you want to intensify the properties of your aventurine and your meditations, keep the crystal in a place that serves what you ask from it. For example, if you're asking for more restful sleep, keep aventurine on your nightstand, close to your bed.
