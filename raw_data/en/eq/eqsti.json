Our values, Code of Conduct, related policies, and selected globally acknowledged initiatives and principles create the foundation for sustainable performance at Valmet. 2 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2021 3 Reporting principles 4 GRI content index 11 Information on general disclosures 23 Information on specific standard disclosures 43 Independent assurance reportContents 2valmet | gri supplement 2021 | valmet's sustainability reporting in 2021 Valmet has been reporting its sustainability performance since 2002 on an annual basis. Our sustainability reporting in 2021 is in accordance with the Core option of the GRI Standards from the Global Reporting Initiative. Standard disclosures, with a reference to external assurance in the GRI content index, have been externally assured by an independent third party. Valmet's annual reporting in 2021 consists of the Annual Review, Financial Statements, GRI Supplement, Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement. The GRI Supplement defines the scope and principles of our GRI reporting, the selected topics, and their boundaries. The GRI content index included in the GRI supplement specifies where the information for each indicator can be found and explains any omissions to the reported data. Valmet's sustainability reporting in 20213valmet | gri supplement 2021 | reporting principles Our reporting covers the Valmet Group unless otherwise stated. Valmet acquired one Finnish and one German com - pany in 2021. The GRI indicators exclude data from these two companies. Valmet targets the reporting of complete data in all GRI indicators, including the acquired businesses, from 2022 onwards. The Group sustainability reporting excludes associated com - panies and joint ventures. Data on suppliers is provided to the extent required by the reported GRI indicators. In the GRI supplement, Valmet reports three-year trend data for material indicators in the respective columns. For some in - dicators, the 2020 numbers are shown in brackets after the 2021 numbers. Any other deviation of the data reported is noted separately. Financial reporting In our Group financial reporting, we follow the Internation - al Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Figures describing economic responsibility are mainly based on the financial statements. The data on purchases by country has been col - lected separately from the reporting units, and the country division is determined based on the supplier's domicile. The data on support for non-profit organizations is collected an - nually from the relevant Valmet units. Health, safety and environmental data Valmet's Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) organization is responsible for collecting and reporting HSE data, includ - ing data covering work-related injuries for external workers. Reporting principles Harmonized global HSE reporting principles and a system - atic data validation process form the basis of data quality for our HSE reporting. Some of the HSE data has been restated based on improvements in data quality. Injury data is reported continuously by all employees in a global HSE event management system. The data is consolidat - ed and analyzed in accordance with the European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) methodology. This method - ology is based on the code of practice of the International Labour Organization (ILO), \"Recording and notification of occupational accidents and diseases.\" Environmental data is collected quarterly in a global envi - ronmental reporting system based on local invoice, measure - ments and consumption records. Environmental data from the businesses acquired in 2020 is reported for the first time in 2021. We apply the financial control method outlined in the GHG Protocol \"Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard\" of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Valmet assesses its Scope 1 and 2 emissions based on the GHG Protocol's \"Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.\" Valmet assesses 3 emissions based on the GHG Protocol's \"Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.\" Valmet reports data on five se - lected relevant categories of Scope 3: category 1: purchased goods and services; category 4: upstream transportation and distribution; category 6: business travel; category 9: down - stream transportation and distribution; and category 11: use of sold products. Personnel data Valmet's Human Resources organization is responsible for collecting and reporting personnel data. The personnel and payroll data published in the financial statements is obtained in conjunction with financial reporting and is managed by Valmet's HR system specialists, using a global people man - agement system. Valmet's global people management system allows access to versatile and comparable HR data globally. Harmonized global HR reporting principles and a systematic data validation process constitute the basis of data quality for reporting related to our personnel. The employee data reported in our sustainability reporting for 2021 includes all active Valmet employees. The gender category includes three options (Female, Male, Not Declared). In 2021, the number of individuals in the \"Not Declared\" category was not large enough to impact the overall gender figures shown in this report and is therefore not included as a separate gender col - umn. The number of employees not included in the published data, namely all inactive employees on leave of absence (e.g. study-leave, long-term sick leave, parental leave) is minor and amounts to less than two percent of the total number of employees.4valmet | gri supplement 2021 | gri content index GRI content index GENERAL DISCLOSURES GRI STANDARD DISCLOSURE NUMBER DISCLOSURE TITLE GENERAL DISCLOSURES LOCATION COMMENTS OMISSIONS ASSURANCE ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE GRI 102 102-1 Name of the organization Name of the organization See comments Valmet Oyj GRI 102 102-2 Activities, brands, products and servicesActivities, primary brands, products and servicesAR 14-15 GRI 102 102-3 Location of headquarters Location of headquarters See comments Keilasatama 5 / P .O.

In this context, the role of Valmet's risk management is to support the achievement of Valmet's strategic targets and business objectives and the continuity of operations. Valmet has a systematic method for regularly assessing the probability and impact of threats and opportunities related to sustainability. The topics include health and safety, envi - ronment and climate, human rights and labor rights, and ethical business practices both in our own operations and our supply chain. Management of sustainability and climate-related risks is integrated into the multidisciplinary, Groupwide risk management process at Valmet. Each Valmet Business Line annually assesses the probability and impact of economic, environmental, and social risks and defines the need and priority of the actions to remove, mitigate, minimize, retain, or utilize risks by using Valmet's risk map. In 2021, Valmet analysed the potential long-term climate-re - lated physical and transitional risks and their financial impact on its operations and business environment with two different climate scenarios to support Groupwide risk management and strategy, and the capability to adapt to and mitigate climate change. Valmet discloses information about climate-related financial risks in line with the recom - mendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) also in its Financial Statements 2021 and Information for Investors. The full TCFD report is available on Valmet's website.Mechanisms for advice and concerns about ethics (GRI 102-17) Valmet encourages our employees and stakeholders to speak up and voice concerns about possible violations of Valmet's Code of Conduct, unethical business behavior or other misconduct. Valmet employees are encouraged to report suspected misconduct to their own supervisors, the Human Resources function, other management or if necessary, di - rectly to Legal Affairs and the Internal Audit function. Valmet offers an anonymous, web-based TrustLine channel for reporting suspected misconduct of our Code of Conduct. It provides Valmet employees and other stakeholders with the possibility to report anonymously, confidentially and in their native language. This reporting channel is maintained by an external party and is designed to guarantee anonymity. The reporting system and the process of handling the reports are managed by the Legal Affairs and the Internal Audit functions. Reported cases are investigated in accordance with Valmet's Compliance Reporting Guideline, which was updated in 2021. Valmet does not tolerate retaliation against any person who reports suspected violations in good faith or assists in investigations. In 2021, 36 concerns or allegations of potential Code of Con - duct violations were reported through the external reporting channel or other channels such as direct reporting to local HR, the Legal function or to Internal Audit. A total of 14 cases were closed. Most of the reported cases were related to respectful work environment. Valmet provides Code of Conduct training and communica - tions to our employees on all our available channels to inform them of the company's ethical expectations and protect the business. In 2021, 91 percent of active employees completed the updated Code of Conduct e-learning course.

Entities or individuals identified as stakeholders can reasonably be expected to be significantly affected by Valmet's activities, products and/or services, and their actions can reasonably be expected to affect Valmet's ability to success - fully implement its strategies and achieve its objectives. Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements (GRI 102-41) Valmet supports its employees' right to freedom of associ - ation and collective bargaining. We recognize and actively engage with employee representation bodies such as the European Works Council, which has representatives from Valmet countries in the European Union. Overall, 71 percent of Valmet employees are covered by col - lective bargaining agreements. Participation in collective bargaining agreements varies significantly between regions, with the highest participation in EMEA (87%), South Amer - ica (83%) and China (67%), and the lowest in North America (9%) and Asia-Pacific (3%). This reflects common practice in these regions. Stakeholder dialogue Valmet promotes its own and its stakeholders' operations through an active stakeholder dialogue on sustainability themes such as the development and implementation of energy and climate, environment, research and innovation, digitalization policies and legislation, and research and tech -nology development in environmental technology. Valmet develops low-emission and resource-efficient technology and has a long tradition of supporting e.g. universities in researching sustainable production technologies and find - ing new solutions. We also share our knowledge and raise awareness of eco-efficient products. In 2021, we also con - ducted a sustainability survey to gather opinions from our stakeholders. We maintain dialogue with our customers through regular meetings and other direct contact such as seminars, fairs, and customer satisfaction surveys, and through specific in - dustry organizations. We conduct annual and mid-year review discussions with our employees in which we emphasize open and active dialogue. We also conduct regular engagement surveys to measure how engaged we are as a company. The survey gives everyone at Valmet the opportunity to be part of the discus - sion and influence how we move the company forward. The survey is run every second year, and the results are used to develop the company over a two-year period. We meet our suppliers regularly as part of our supplier rela - tionship program. During 2021, we lauched a new program, the Supplier HSE Day, to drive sharing good HSE practices with Valmet's suppliers. The program also supports us in achieving the common goal of zero harm in our suppliers' workshops. In 2021, Valmet arranged Area-spesific Suppli - er HSE Day event in China, as well as other events within different Business Lines and spesific customer projects. In 2021, Valmet also arranged a Supplier Innovation Day in India. The event aimed to promote the innovation capability of our suppliers and invite their ideas combined with their knowledge, expertise, and technology to provide more sus - tainable and cost-competitive solutions. The Supplier Inno -vation Day is part of Valmet's Supplier Innovation process implementation. In 2021, Valmet continued to implement the global sustainability engagement program for selected key suppliers in North America and South America, in addition to ongoing sustainbaility engagement programs in China, Asia-Pacific and EMEA. We also regularly audit and assess our global suppliers. Valmet engages shareholders, investors, and analysts in dia - logue to ensure that the markets have correct and sufficient information for determining the value of Valmet shares. The financial community's interest in sustainability issues and responsible (ESG) investing continued to increase in 2021. In particular, there was increasing interest in sustainable fi - nance, including EU taxonomy and TCFD recommendations related reporting. In 2021, we organized a record amount of meetings with our financial stakeholders by introducing our role and progress in the transition to a carbon neutral economy and continued to develop our ESG equity story. The dialogue includes financial statements, interim reviews, the company website, stock exchange releases, press releases, investor meetings, seminars, webcasts, results news confer - ences, site visits and general meetings. Valmet is also active on social media - for example, on Twitter and LinkedIn, and publishes videos for the investor community. In 2021, Valmet's Investor Relations team participated in 32 road - shows and engaged with investors and analysts approximate - ly 260 times through various channels such as conference calls, roadshows and in-person meetings. Valmet meets with various media representatives through regular meetings and interviews, and direct contact at fairs, seminars, and other events. Valmet shares timely information about its operations through press and trade press releases, the company website, several publications, and social media channels. In research and development, Valmet collaborates 15valmet | gri supplement 2021 | information on general disclosures closely with its customers to collect information on their product development needs and to innovate new solutions. We also engage in dialogue with research institutes, as well as universities and vocational schools, through joint develop - ment projects and specific industry organizations. Continuous improvement through active feedback gathering In addition to the feedback gathered through regular busi - ness relationships and other forms of stakeholder dialogue, Valmet actively collects feedback from its stakeholders with specific surveys. For instance, suppliers, investors and customers are systematically asked for feedback at various events. Valmet has an external reporting portal for its stakeholders for collecting feedback on and managing events related to health, safety, environment (HSE) and continuous improve - ment (CI) in all Valmet operations. The tool is also used for collecting innovation ideas for R&D purposes. In 2021, we started collecting ideas regarding the climate program and how to reduce CO emissions in our own operations, in the supply chain or during the use phase of our technologies. Internally, we use employee surveys to collect feedback from employees. We also participate in externally conducted sur - veys assessing Valmet's reputation. In addition, we ask for regular feedback from our customers regarding how Valmet is perceived in the market, how its products and services meet customer needs and expectations, the role sustainabil - ity plays in customer perception and expectations, and how Valmet can improve its customer relationships. By reporting to selected third-party sustainability ratings and assessments, Valmet seeks to help its stakeholders assess its sustainability performance. The rankings also serve as a management tool in helping to continuously enhance our sustainability perfor - mance and define areas for improvement. Main topics highlighted in 2021 In 2021, we conducted an online survey as part of our sus - tainability agenda renewal to gather opinions and point of views from Valmet's stakeholders. The most significant topics in 2021 concerned climate change and reducing CO2 emis - sions, energy, water, chemical and raw material efficiency of Valmet's technology in customers use, and the health, safety and wellbeing of employees. Valmet received excellent feed - back on its general commitment to sustainability, as well as the introduction of the new climate program. Most stakeholder survey respondents assessed Valmet's sus - tainability performance as excellent or very good. We found new ways of engaging with our stakeholder groups e.g. in relation to the climate program, and made solid progress in our stakeholder engagement actions in 2021. Reported topics, topic boundaries and management approach (GRI 102-46, GRI 102-47, GRI 103-1) Reported topics and topic boundaries In accordance with the GRI 101 Foundation standard, the principles for defining report content were applied in assess - ing material topics and boundaries. A list of material topics can be found on the GRI content index in this report on pages 4-10. The process was initially conducted in 2013 and was last updated in 2018. It included a stakeholder survey, including customers, employees, and institutional investors and own - ers; interviews with key customers; and a benchmark study. The current business environment and the most important market drivers affecting the industries in which Valmet and its customers operate were also reviewed as part of the process of building a comprehensive understanding of all potential sustainability topics. The topics were assessed on the basis of their importance to Valmet and its stakeholders at an internal workshop with key experts and management. As a result of the process, we defined five sustainability focus areas, covering the most material sustainability topics for Valmet. Sustainability agenda The topics included in Valmet's 2021 reporting are based on the above process and create the basis for Valmet's Sustain - ability agenda, called Sustainability360\u00ba. The agenda was initially defined in 2014 and is renewed every three years. The Sustainability360\u00ba agenda focuses on five core areas of our operations: Sustainable supply chain; Health, safety and environment; People and performance; Sustainable solutions; and Corporate citizenship. The agenda includes detailed actions and targets for each sustainability focus area. The material topics are grouped according to the five focus areas, with corresponding goals, actions and KPIs. The topics and indicators related to each focus area are presented in the following tables, which also define the topic boundaries. In 2021, we completed the actions defined in the current ac - tion plan for 2019-2021. More information about each focus area and specific action plans, targets and achievements can be found in the sustainability sections of the Annual Review (AR 52-75). During 2021, we also renewed Valmet's Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda; identified new focus areas, and updated the material topics for the whole value chain. The new agenda was ap -16valmet | gri supplement 2021 | information on general disclosures proved by Valmet's Executive team in late 2021, and it will be introduced with three-year action plans in early 2022. Management approach Sustainability is an integral part of Valmet's strategy pro - cess and related Must-Wins. It is integrated in our processes through the comprehensive Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda and related climate program - Forward to a carbon neutral future. Valmet's Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda is aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement's 1.5-degree pathway and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and it is executed through concrete three-year action plans. The climate program was introduced in 2021. It continues our comprehensive sustainability work and includes ambi - tious CO emission reduction targets and concrete actions for the whole value chain, including the supply chain, our own operations, and customers' use of our technologies. The climate program's targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. The Board of Directors of Valmet has oversight of sustain - ability and climate-related matters, and they sign off the disclosure of non-financial information, which is included into Valmet's Financial Statements 2021 and Information for Investors.

The action plan for 2019-2021 can be found on Valmet's website. Evaluation of management approachWe continuously assess the impact of our processes and tools concerning our sustainable supply chain activities. We have a systematic method for supplier sustainability risk assessment that enables assessment of suppliers by country of origin and purchasing category. The aim is to assess the potential negative indirect impacts and risks related to human rights, labor practices, ethical business practices, environmental performance, and health and safety. Based on the supplier sustainability risk assessment, we may request that our suppliers self-assess their sustainability performance and management. The self-assessment may lead to a supplier audit conducted by an independent third party and Valmet. With the self-assessments and audits, we aim to enhance risk management and ensure compliance with the policy requirements. Topic boundariesWithin the organization (entire Group): Valmet's Procurement organization manages purchases and is responsible for ensuring that all purchasing is done sustainably and cost-effectively. Outside the organization: Valmet purchases components, products, materials, and services from some 17,000 active suppliers in more than 50 countries. Special attention is paid to assessing business ethics and legal compliance, human and labor rights, health and safety, and environmental issues in risk countries. Valmet's strategic target is to increase procurement close to customer projects and its own operations. All indirect purchases supporting Valmet's operations are procured locally. The ten largest countries in terms of purchases (EUR million) are Finland, China, Sweden, the USA, Germany, Poland, Brazil, Canada, Italy and Denmark. China, India, Indonesia, and Thailand are defined as having greater potential for negative human rights impacts than the other countries from which Valmet purchases goods and services.18valmet | gri supplement 2021 | information on general disclosures Health, safety and environment (HSE) Management approachWe are committed to protecting the health, safety and environment (HSE) of our people, partners, customers and the communities where we operate. Since we spend about a third of our time at work, the quality of our working lives is an important topic for our overall wellbeing. Our people, and the external workers in our operations, are exposed to potential health and safety hazards at work in our workshops, in our offices, during business travel and when working at our customers' construction sites, mills and plants. The main risks of occupational injury and illness are associated with the unexpected start-up of machinery, use of tools and equipment, mechanical lifting, working at height or in confined spaces, manual handling, hot work, exposure to hazardous substances and radiation, electrical work, road travel, exposure to infectious diseases, and the social and organizational work environment. Our operations also impact their local environment and contribute to climate change, as well as other global environmental challenges. The main aspects are direct and indirect energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions, water consumption, waste production, emissions into the air, discharges of effluent, use of hazardous substances, material consumption and noise. Based on life cycle analysis (LCA) and market data on the customer use phase of Valmet's technology, we estimate that around one percent of the environmental impact of Valmet's entire value chain is emitted from our own locations. Based on the above impacts, we intend to provide safe and healthy workplaces for all and to design and operate our facilities to promote the sustainable use of resources and prevent pollution. Our approach aims to ensure appropriate systems, competence and behaviors are in place to identify and control hazards and impacts before they cause harm. Compliance with regulatory obligations, internal standards and customer requirements is the basis for all operations. We have a continuous improvement approach and work proactively through strategic objectives and targets that are cascaded through annual improvement plans to drive environmental impact reduction, and to secure healthy and safe operations. Everyone is expected to take responsibility for HSE as defined in the Valmet Manager and Employee roles. We integrate sound HSE management practices in all aspects of our business and promote best HSE practice with our customers, suppliers and partners. Constant emphasis is placed on risk management, prevention and learning. We ensure worker participation and engage other interested parties in active and collaborative dialogue. We monitor and openly communicate our HSE performance to enable the continuous development of our approach. We focus on: Ensuring risk-based HSE management in all operations: We ensure processes for effective HSE management are in place wherever we operate, with a focus on defining and implementing global standards and best practice. Our main operations are certified according to the ISO 14001:2015 (environmental), ISO 45001:2018 (health and safety) and ISO 9001:2015 (quality) management standards. Continuously improving safety performance: We systematically enhance leadership, engagement, and mindsets to drive our safety culture forward. We implement preventive programs. Minimizing the environmental impact of our operations and products: We continuously develop our operational footprint, our supply chain, and the solutions we provide to our customers to improve environmental performance across the value chain. Our climate program includes ambitious targets and concrete actions supporting the transition to a carbon neutral future by reducing CO2 emissions from own operations by 80 percent by 2030. We invested 20.2 million in 2021 in environmental management and improvements. Promoting health and wellbeing: We support wellbeing at work through five evidence-based action areas - connect, be active, take notice, keep learning, and give - in local health promotion activities. Our location-based HSE and social committees ensure we have programs in place.

Anti-corruption (GRI 205-1) Group-level risk assessments cover all Valmet's operations. One tool for risk assessments is the FRIME audits, which cover five key units annually and account for about 80 percent of Valmet's turnover within a five-year evaluation cycle. Corruption risks are assessed as part of compliance and crime-related risks, e.g. fraud and misconduct, in the FRIME audits and in Valmet's annual group-level risk assessment process. The most significant corruption risks are related to financial impacts and reputation.

We design and develop all our technologies for water efficiency. Water efficiency is a key design and performance parameter for our pulp, paper and bio industry customers, and we engage actively with them to minimize their water impacts. Our own operations account for less than one percent of the total environmental impact of the value chain. Within our own operations, significant amounts of water are used for cooling in our foundry operations and as process water in our pilot machines in our Nordic R&D centers. We have targets for reducing the overall consumption of water in our operations. En - vironmental impact assessments are completed when establishing new operations and when planning significant changes in existing operations to ensure that water impacts are consid - ered and mitigated. All our new service workshops are located inside managed industrial estates. Valmet follows local discharge permits and requirements. Valmet's water withdrawal from water stress areas is small. Based on an analysis using the WWF Water Risk Filter 6.0, our Pune (India) and Xi'an, Zibo, Tianjin, Waigaoqiao and Changzhou (China) workshops are in geographical areas with high overall basin risk. In basins with very high risk, we do not have any workshops or production facilities. Considering our office facilities, one small office in Gurugram (India) is located in a geographical area with very high overall basin risk. The remaining 4 percent of our water impact is from the supply chain, and Valmet has a systematic process for engaging with key suppliers to improve their sustainability practises, including enviromental and water management.

The amount of Biogenic Scope 1 emissions is 1.6 percent of total Scope 1 emissions in 2021. Baseline 2019 approved by Science Based Target Initiative. Baseline 2019 and net sales for emissions intensity for this baseline are calculated based on Valmet's emissions and net sales data from 2019 and emissions and net sales from acquisitions from 2019 and 2020: 19,700 tCO 2 (Scope 1) and 100,300 tCO 2 (Scope 2, market-based), net sales 3,807 MEUR. The methodology used to calculate emissions is the direct measurement of energy sources consumed based on invoicing at the location level and conversion to CO 2 emissions. Data from the 2020 acquisitions is included for the first time in 2021 reporting. 2 Scope 1 emissions are based on default CO 2 emission factors for combustion from the \"2006 ICPP Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Volume 2 Energy\". The 2019 baseline is calculated based on emission data from 2019 and data from acquisitions from 2019 and 2020. 3 Location-based CO 2 emission factors are based on 2018 emissions as given by the \"International Energy Agency (IEA) (2020) Emission Factors\". Data for 2020 has been restated due to minor updates in the emission factors. 4 The following emissions factors have been applied to the 2019 data: ''eGRID 2019 Subregion GHG Output Emission Rates'' (United States Environmental Protection Agency), ''China eGRID 2019 Emission Output Rates'' (Clean Development Mech - anism China), ''CO 2 emission factors of the National Interconnected System of Brazil'' for 2019 (Brazilian Technology and Science Ministry) and ''European Residual Mixes 2019'' (Association of Issuing Bodies). The following emissions factors have been applied to the 2020 and 2021 data: ''eGRID 2019 Subregion GHG Output Emission Environmen - tal Protection Agency), ''China eGRID 2019 Emission Output Rates'' (Clean Development Mechanism China), ''CO 2 emission factors of the National Interconnected System of Brazil'' for 2020 (Brazilian Technology and Science Ministry), ''European Residual Mixes 2020'' (Association of Issuing Bodies) for electricity in Europe and \"International Energy Agency (IEA) (2020) Emission Factors\" for district heating in Europe. Supplier-specific emission factors were applied for electricity consumption in Canada and in Lenox, USA, as well as for carbon neutral district heating and solar energy consumption in Finland. Con - tract-based specific factors were applied for renewable electricity in Finland which is purchased with guarantees of origin. Location-based factors were applied in Thailand, Indonesia, Chile and India. Data has been restated for 2019 and 2020 due to updated emission factors and minor corrections in the data. 5 The specific emission factors used in calculating the greenhouse gas emissions are based on databases and publicly available sources using monetary values from Valmet's monitoring and reporting tools. 6 The analysis is based on the monetary value of purchased goods and services by category and supplier country. The emission flows have been calculated based on environmentally extended input output analysis and emission factors from Exiobase (www.exiobase.eu). The purchasing spend data used covers approximately 98% (2020: 98%) of Valmet's total purchase order amount (excluding business travel, transportation, and taxes and charges related spend). Data has been restated for 2019 and 2020 due to improved data coverage and quality related to system change. 7 The analysis of upstream and downstream transportation and distribution emissions is based on suppliers' emission reports, and when not available, the monetary value of purchased transportation services following the same calculation methodology as for category 1 emissions. The calculated transportation modes include air, rail, ocean and road ransportation. Data has been restated for 2019 and 2020 due to improved data coverage and quality related to system change. 8 The analysis of business travel emissions is based on emission, mileage and spend data from travel agencies. Valmet's business travel emissions: the air travel data used covers Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK, UAE, USA, Canada, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, China and represents 99,9% (2020: 99%) of Valmet's global workforce. For other business travel modes, including rented vehicles, compensated mileages and hotel nights, data used cov - ers Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, UK, USA, Canada, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, China and represents 97% of Valmet's global workforce. Data has been restated for 2019 and 2020 due to improved data coverage and quality related to system change. 9 Emissions from downstream transportation and distribution are based on an estimated volume of downstream transportation services. The distribution of transportation modes and emission intensity from upstream transportations has been applied for downstream transportations. The downstream transportation and distribution data includes air, train, ocean and road trans - portation and is estimated to be 15 percent of total transportation emissions. Data has been restated for 2019 and 2020 due to improved data coverage and quality related to system change. 10 Data includes Valmet's 2021 sold entire paper, board and tissue production lines, fossil-fired fluidizer bed boilers and lime kilns, during their expected lifetime (25 years). The CO 2 calculation is based on Valmet's average product specific energy con- sumption and product specifications including delivered capacity and intended fuel mix. N 2O and CH 4 included from biomass combustion in pulp and energy production. CO 2 emissions from electricity are calculated based on IEA (2020) country-spe- cific emission factors. CO 2 emissions from steam are calculated based on Fisher International installed base fuel mix data. Emission factors for fuels are based on IPCC, Defra and Tilastokeskus. IEA Scenario for current policies (STEPS) power sector emission intensity reduction (CAGR) is utilized in projecting the lifetime emissions for electricity and steam. Quantifying and projecting the future emissions from use of sold products involves a large number of assumptions and the actual emissions from use of sold products are largely dependent on choices made by our customers. For these reasons, the figure reported is an estimate to understand the magnitude of category 11 lifetime emissions, which are representing more than 95% of Val - met's value chain emissions. The included paper, board and tissue machines represent 78% of PAP's total orders received in 2019-2021, excluding basic machine unit assembly groups and smaller equipment deliveries. The fossil-fired boilers and lime kilns represent 9% of the P&E's 2019-2021 orders received. The remaining 91% of P&E's orders received is assumed to be carbon neutral (incl. bioenergy self-sufficient pulp mills and biomass-fired boilers). The share of total orders received is calcu - lated based on a three-year average (2019-2021) to balance the annual differences between project revenue realization. The data used covers 88% of Valmet's three-year average of total PAP's and P&E's orders received. The annual fossil emissions of the sold products were around 5,085,000 tCO 2e, whereas biogenic emissions were around 6,908,000 tCO 2e in 2021. 11 Emissions intensity ratio includes direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2, market-based) CO 2 emissions per MEUR net sales.26valmet | gri supplement 2021 | information on specific standard disclosures NOx, SOx, and other significant air emissions (GRI 305-7)\u00b9 GRI 305-7\u00b9: NOx, SOx, and other significant air emissions t 2021 2020 2019 Hazardous air pollutants (HAP) 1.8 1.7 1.6 NOX 20.5 12.7 13.2 Particulate Matter (PM) 12.5 9.7 10.8 SOX 2.1 0.7 0.6 Volatile organic compounds (VOC) 58.9 73.7 73.3 Others standard categories 4.1 0.7 1.2 1 Significant air emissions are defined as those listed in environmental permits of local operations.

We design and develop all our technologies to support circular material flows and minimize waste amounts. Valmet's process technologies, automation and services enable circular economy for our customers. For example: Our solutions improve energy, water and raw material efficiency in customer processes. Our solutions for biobased products decrease the need for non-renewable materials and enable cascaded use across industries. Our technologies for onsite recovery of energy and chemicals allow materials to circulate longer and reduce the need for virgin materials. Our energy technologies reduce the need for non-renewable fuels and the amount of waste. Modular machine design and smart engineering enable the use of the same equipment for new uses. Our services support well-planned maintenance and partial replacements, and rebuild solutions significantly prolong our equipment lifetime. We have take back programs for products like refiner segments and are actively developing other programs. Our products contain mainly recyclable materials. Read more about our sustainable solutions in our Annual Review on page 46 and 59. About one percent of our environmental impact including waste is from our own operations. We invest continuously in process efficiency improvements, and we implement the waste management hierarchy in all facilities with a focus on eliminating landfill waste and reducing hazardous waste amounts. We partner with certified waste handlers in waste disposal. The remaining four percent of our waste impact is from the supply chain, and Valmet has a systematic process for engaging with key suppliers to adopt circularity measures, identify opportunities for waste prevention and improve their waste management practices.

Since Valmet's solutions are complex in nature, their environmental impacts such as energy, water, raw material and chemical use, as well as the amount of emissions, depend on the project specifi - cations. The actual impact of the technologies also depends on factors such as how they are operated and the selection of raw materials. The following examples demonstrate quantified actions concerning the mitigation of the environmental impact of Valmet's products and services. Chip to Board Valmet's holistic Chip to Board approach for linerboard producers enables sustainable packaging with lower wood and power consumption, and a decreased carbon footprint - both for existing and new production lines. This unique approach provides many advantages when one supplier cov - ers everything from wood handling to final board, including mill-wide optimization and process control solutions for maximized cost competitiveness and energy efficiency across the line. Stronger pulp and stronger board are achieved through innovative chip impregnation, refining and stock preparation technologies, which reduce the need for virgin pulp and allow its replacement with recycled fibers, while preserving the strength of the board and saving energy. What is more, with advanced tools for board machines, Valmet can maximize the final strength properties of the fibers. With this combination, the basis weight and the overall carbon footprint of the linerboard can be reduced, and companies worldwide can produce linerboard that is both profitable and sustainable. Mill-wide optimization Valmet's Mill-wide optimization solution automates decision making at the pulp and paper mill level to help coordinate process areas in the pursuit of common objectives. This leads to operating decisions that are based on the total mill balance and forecast. Lower basis weights of end products with op - timal strength and higher production rates enable using less raw material and energy per unit. Production can be made with lower refiner energy. Optimizing the mill's steam and electricity production reduces environmental impacts. A re - duction in chemicals usage via online mill balance generates many environmental benefits, including a reduced need for transportation and energy to produce chemicals - e.g. elec - tricity consumption for the production of chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) via sodium chlorate, which is very energy intensive. Waste to Energy Optimization Optimized burning of waste is an important component in the processes and material chains of the circular economy. Materials that cannot be recycled need to be burned with the lowest possible emissions in the Waste to Energy (WtoE) processes. Maximizing the energy generation of a WtoE plant by load, as well as the waste fuel throughput together with advanced emission management are key process chal - lenges of WtoE plants. Valmet's WtoE optimization solution is based on the advanced process control (APC) solution and utilization of a furnace camera and is completed with advanced computer vision software for flame front position on the grate. Typical benefits are an increase of up to 15 percent in annual electricity production, a reduction of up to 5 percent in Valmet's own electricity consumption, and a reduction of up to 20 percent of NOx emissions with fewer additive chemicals.Sleeve Roll Valmet's advanced Sleeve Roll technology provides several benefits to the paper production process: increased pro - duction, a higher-quality end product, savings in energy consumption and reductions in the use of raw materials and chemicals. The dewatering pressure at the outer layer of the Sleeve Roll is created with a shoe. This dewatering method enables high energy efficiency, as less vacuum is required, and less friction caused by blade dewatering. Sheet dryness is achieved mainly with pressing. The Sleeve Roll technology also enables better strength on the surface and throughout by applying high sheet pressure, while also reducing the need for chemicals such as starch. These are significant advantages compared to more conventional solutions. Non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations (GRI 307-1) No significant environmental compliance cases resulted from major permit violations, claims, compensations or media coverage related to environmental incidents in 2021. Two minor non-compliance cases with limited environmen - tal impact resulted in an administrative fines at the Wuxi service center in China. The cases were related to domes - tic effluent control and to waste documentation. Immediate improvement actions were taken into use to the satisfaction of local authorities.30valmet | gri supplement 2021 | information on specific standard disclosures Total number and rates of new employee hires and employee turnover by age group, gender, and region (GRI 401-1) New hires1 GRI 401-1: Total number and rate of new employee hires by age New hires New hires, % Under 30 501 (475) 32.9 (43.2) 30-50 839 (524) 55.1 (47.7) Over 50 184 (100) 12.1 (9.1) Total 1,524 (1,099) 100 (100) GRI 401-1: Total number and rate of new employee hires by gender New hires New hires, % Female 366 (295) 24.0 (26.8) Male 1,158 (804) 76.0 (100) GRI 401-1: Total number and rate of new employee hires by region New hires New hires, % North America 172 (94) 11.3 (8.6) South America 171 (45) 11.2 (4.1) EMEA 883 (807) 57.9 (73.4) China 196 (95) 12.9 (8.6) Asia-Pacific 102 (58) 6.7 (5.3) Total 1,524 (1,099) 100 (100) 1 New hires calculation: (new hires per category/total number of new hires in 2021) *100.

The duty to conduct risk assessments of the HSE haz- ards and aspects of work activities is satisfied by applying a multi-layered risk assessment methodology, including: Location-specific HSE risk registers Job-specific risk assessments and safe operating procedures Pre-task dynamic hazard assessments Chemical risk assessments Risk and opportunity assessments in sales and delivery projects, including HSE aspects HSE risk assessment of change in operations (such as a new organization, new plant, new/rebuilt facilities, new processes). HSE impacts and risks are managed until they are eliminat - ed, reduced or controlled (based on the hierarchy of controls) to the point of being acceptable through the implementation of safe work systems before any work activities commence. Workers participate in and are informed about the HSE risk and impact management related to their work. HSE risk as - sessments are reviewed periodically, with an emphasis on ensuring the effectiveness of critical controls, and always in the event of significant changes, or after injuries and serious near misses have occurred.Everyone working for Valmet or in a workplace controlled by Valmet is responsible for reporting all incidents, as well as observations of hazards and hazardous situations, without delay to their manager and our global reporting system. This reporting triggers various activities within Valmet to ensure good incident management. Managers are responsible for incident investigations, including root cause analysis and corrective actions, all of which are documented in the report - ing system. Workers and their representatives participate in and support the investigation and corrective actions. HSE alerts are produced for all recordable and high-potential near misses, and shared globally as part of the monthly reporting. Managers and workers are trained in how to perform risk assessments, incident reporting and investigations. All work - ers have the right to refuse unsafe work and will inform their manager or site contact immediately of all concerns. Valmet's HSE function ensures the quality of hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation processes, and that improvements and lessons are shared globally. Occupational health services (GRI 403-3 (2018)) Valmet ensures employees' access to qualified occupational health services through country-based approaches that also comply with local legal requirements and provide service in the local language. Information on the available occupa - tional health services is provided to employees during their onboarding. Services are provided during workhours. In the larger production units, these services are available at the location. Valmet contractually requires that the employer of workers who are not Valmet employees ensures their access to these services.Worker participation, consultation and communication on occupational health and safety (GRI 403-4 (2018)) As stated in our HSE policy, we facilitate the participation and consultation of our people and partners in HSE activities and practices. The backbone of our approach is in joint man - agement-worker safety committees in all locations with more than 30 employees. Following a global guideline, these com - mittees meet at least once a year and more often in produc - tion locations, have elected worker representatives, establish annual budgets and action plans, and follow standard agenda items covering all aspects of the development, implementa - tion and evaluation of the local HSE management system. In addition, we deploy a variety of other methods, including making HSE a routine meeting agenda item in team meet - ings, townhall events and one-on-one discussions, toolbox talk practices, management safety walk-and-talks, elected worker safety representatives, employee surveys, employee participation in risk assessments and pre-task safety dis - cussions, HSE information on noticeboards, and intranet communications on HSE.

Its design is based on an assessment of legal, customer and industry HSE obligations, as well as HSE risks and impacts. All HSE training is provided free of charge and during paid workhours. Training effectiveness is evaluated through com - petence tests during the training session. We have two mandatory global training programs, both available in the main employee languages. All employees complete the HSE induction for the Valmet workplaces e-learning course during their onboarding. This e-learning covers Valmet's common HSE rules and minimum safety standards. This e-learning course is also available for all ex - ternal workers in our Partner Academy platform. All Valmet employees were also expected to participate in the Safety Di - alogue training by the end of 2021 (read more in the Annual Review on page 52). In this program, managers and employ - ees explore attitudes, behaviors and skills for promoting a positive safety culture at Valmet. Standard training material for our minimum safety standards, travel safety and other global HSE routines is also available in various languages in our learning library. All employees and external workers are required to contin - uously complete relevant worksite-spesific HSE inductions. During onboarding, introductions in local languages are held for the Valmet location and the specific local HSE risks, rules and routines. Valmet HSE inductions are also held for everyone entering our temporary and remote worksites in our installation projects in the main project language and in English if required. In addition, everyone working for Valmet is required to complete customer mill introductions. Role-specific HSE training requirements are defined in country- or location-based HSE training matrices reflective of local regulatory and industry requirements, as well as the Valmet minimum safety standards. These training programs are mainly provided for our employees by qualified external training service providers at the defined frequency and al - ways in the local language. We require that all external work - ers are provided with relevant role-specific training meeting our requirements by their own employer. All workers are given task-specific training on safe operating procedures as required. Promotion of worker health (GRI 403-6 (2018)) Valmet implements a global approach where locations with 30 or more employees have a social committee comprised of em - ployees based in the location and with the purpose of hosting social events and coordinating activities that build engagement and collaboration, as well as promoting wellbeing at work. Social committees support wellbeing at work through five evi - dence-based action areas - connect, be active, take notice, keep learning, and give. The social committee can be combined with the HSE committee, see GRI 403-4 on page 32. Valmet facilitates employees' access to non-medical and health - care services through a country-based approach utilizing a mix of mechanisms such as health insurance, company clinics and financial contributions. For workers who are not employees, their employer facilitates their access to these services.Percentage of employees represented in social committees by region Headcount, % North America 98 (99) South America 100 (100) EMEA 95 (94) China 99 (99) Asia-Pacific 70 (74) Total 94 (94) Prevention and mitigation of occupational health and safety impacts directly linked by business relationships (GRI 403-7 (2018)) A value chain perspective is embedded in our global man - agement system (GMS) and our health and safety objectives, actions and routines.34valmet | gri supplement 2021 | information on specific standard disclosures GRI 403-8: Workers covered by a certified management system (GRI 403-8 (2018))1 2021 2020 2019 ISO 9001:2015 (Quality management) 86 84 87 ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental management) 79 74 71 ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational health and safety management) 75 64 62 1 Valmet does not have a global tracking system for external worker headcount. Coverage of the occupational health and safety management system is calculated based on employee headcount, and it is assumed that this is also representative of the average coverage of external workers.Workers covered by an occupational health and safety management system (GRI 403-8 (2018)) All employees and external workers are covered by Valmet's global management system (GMS), an integrated quality, health, safety and environmental management system. Read more about the system in the Annual Report on page 51 and 66. The GMS is audited through several Groupwide internal processes, including risk management, logistics, HSE, cor - porate internal audit, sustainability assurance, and internal audits of the global management system. The GMS is certified as a global multi-site system by a third party according to the ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 standards, but to varying scopes of cover - age - see the table below. We are continually expanding our coverage, and the target is that all production locations and at least 90 percent of all workers will be covered by the system by 2025. We have defined an expansion roadmap toward this target. Currently, the ISO 45001:2018 certification covers the main production locations and project installations.35valmet | gri supplement 2021 | information on specific standard disclosures Work-related injuries (GRI 403-9 (2018))1 Based on a consolidation of local health and safety risk registers and an analysis of injuries and near misses, Valmet has identified twelve main hazards that pose a risk of high-conse - quence injury and defined them for each Minimum Safety Standard - as described in the management approach description (see page 18).

The average number of training hours for a Valmet employee in 2021 was 19.0 hours (female employees 24.0 hours, male employees 17.6 hours). Training hours are reported for all employees, based on the information available in Valmet's people management system. Learning programs (GRI 404-2) We encourage development throughout an employee's career at Valmet, making sure our peo - ple develop their competence continuously. We follow a 70-20-10 learning philosophy, with 70 percent occurring through on-the-job learning, 20 percent through learning relationships, and 10 percent through formal learning.We always adhere to legal requirements and country practices regarding the management of career endings. In situations that have a significant impact on individuals and local com - munities, we take steps to provide additional support in the form of outplacement training, individual skill development, financing for new enterprises, entrepreneur training and com - pensation for relocation costs. Performance reviews (GRI 404-3) Valmet carries out a documented annual review discussion comprising a performance review and development plan for its white-collar employees. Annual review discussions are also encouraged for Valmet's blue-collar employees, some of which take place as documented group discussions.

The remaining suppliers have been manually assessed for the potential sustainability risk. The screening covers business ethics, compliance, human and labor rights, health, safety and en - vironmental management, and product safety topics. Assessment of the health and safety impacts of product and service categories (GRI 416-1) Safety is an integral part of Valmet's technologies, automa - tion and services. The safety requirements of all Valmet's solutions are carefully reviewed and assessed in the R&D process, and must be fulfilled in each product development phase. Valmet's solutions are required to be safe to use, and they are designed to meet or exceed all applicable safety standards and regulations. To ensure safe operations, customer training is included in all project deliveries. Moreover, the majority of Valmet's operations are certified to quality, health and safety, and environmental management standards, and processes that ensure product safety are followed. Non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and economic area (GRI 419-1) There were no significant fines regarding non-compliance with social and economic laws and regulations in 2021. Measures taken to eliminate forced or compulsory labor in risk areas (GRI 409-1) In the industries from which Valmet makes most of its purchases, the potential human rights risks are related to freedom of association, the possible use of forced labor, and occupational health and safety. Valmet has also acknowl - edged that certain countries, for example in Asia, where it has both its own operations and makes purchases, are com - monly identified as risk countries in terms of human rights impacts. Child labor and forced labor are among the indica - tors assessed to define the country-specific risk. Valmet has a global process in place to ensure compliance with the requirements set out in its Sustainable Supply Chain policy. All suppliers are required to sign the policy as part of their contract with Valmet. Valmet has an automated sustainability risk assessment for all its suppliers. Based on the risk assessment, Valmet may ask its suppliers to evaluate their sustainability performance by conducting a self-as - sessment through an online tool, which is used as one of the criteria to define the need for a potential sustainability audit. Valmet conducts supplier sustainability audits with a certified independent third-party auditor. New suppliers that were screened using social criteria (GRI 414-1) Screening of new direct suppliers from a sustainability risk perspective is an automated and integrated feature of Valmet's global supplier approval process. Valmet's key per - formance indicators related to the sustainable supply chain are integrated into the global supplier sustainability man - agement process.

Selected Information The scope and boundary of our work is restricted to the non-financial indicators presented in the Report of the Board of Directors in Valmet Financial Statements 2021, and key sustainability performance indicators and metrics presented in Valmet Annual Review 2021 and GRI Supplement 2021. The indicators that have been assured as part of the scope of work are all non-financial disclosures on pages 10-16 in the Report of the Board of Directors and selected GRI-based sus - tainability disclosures identified with an 'x' in the Assurance column of the GRI content index in Valmet GRI Supplement 2021 on pages 4-10 (the \"Selected Information\"). To assess the Selected Information, which includes an as - sessment of the risk of material misstatement in the Report, we have used Global Sustainability Standard Board's GRI Standards and Valmet's reporting principles, (the \"Criteria\", see page 3). We have not performed any work, and do not express any conclusion, on any other information that may be published in the Report or on Valmet's website for the current reporting period. Our conclusion Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Selected Information is not fairly stated and has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria. This conclusion concerns only the Selected Information and is to be read in the context of this Assurance Report, espe - cially the inherent limitations explained below. Standard and level of assurance We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 revised - \"Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information\" (re - vised), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance. DNV applies its own management standards and compli - ance policies for quality control in accordance with ISO/IEC 17021:2015 - Conformity Assessment Requirements for bod - ies providing audit and certification of management systems, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quali - ty control, including documented policies and procedures re - garding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.The procedures performed in a limited assurance engage - ment vary in nature and timing from and are less detailed than those undertaken during a reasonable assurance en - gagement, so the level of assurance obtained is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. We planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered sufficient to provide a basis for our opinion to ensure the risk of this conclusion being in error is reduced but not completely eliminated. Basis of our conclusion We are required to plan and perform our work to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Selected Informa - tion; our work included but was not restricted to: Assessing the appropriateness of the Criteria for the Selected Information; Conducting interviews with Valmet's management to obtain an understanding of the data management systems and processes used to generate, aggregate, and report the Selected Information; Reviewing processes and systems for preparing site- level data consolidated at Head Office. One on-site and four remote site visits were conducted in Canada, China, India, Poland and Spain. DNV were free to choose the sites based on the materiality and type of sites visited in previous assurance engagements; Reviewing data at source and following this through to consolidated Group data;44valmet | gri supplement 2021 | independent assurance report Reviewing whether the evidence, measurements, and scope of the Selected Information are prepared in accordance with the Criteria; and Reviewing the Report and narrative accompanying the Selected Information in the Report with regard to the Criteria. Inherent limitations Our assurance relies on the premise that the data and in - formation provided by Valmet to us as part of our review procedures have been provided in good faith. Because of the selective nature (sampling) and other inherent limitations of both procedures and systems of internal control, there remains the unavoidable risk that errors or irregularities may not have been detected. Energy use data utilized in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature and the methods used for determining such data. Finally, the selection of dif - ferent but acceptable measurement techniques may result in materially different measurements. DNV expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this Independent Assurance Report. Our competence, independence and quality control DNV established policies and procedures are designed to ensure that DNV, its personnel and - where applicable - others are subject to independence requirements (including personnel of other entities of DNV) maintain independence where required by relevant ethical requirements. This en - gagement work was carried out by an independent team of sustainability assurance professionals, whose members have not been involved in the development of any of the Criteria. Our multidisciplinary team consisted of professionals with a combination of environmental and sustainability assur - ance experience. Responsibilities of the Management of Valmet and DNV The Management of Valmet have sole responsibility for: Preparing and presenting the Selected Information in accordance with the Criteria; Designing, implementing and maintaining effective internal controls over the information and data, resulting in the preparation of the Selected Information that is free from material misstatements; Measuring and reporting the Selected Information based on their established Criteria; and Contents and statements contained within the Report and the Criteria. Our responsibility is to plan and perform our work to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Information has been prepared in accordance with the Criteria and to report to Valmet in the form of an independent limited as - surance conclusion, based on the work performed and the evidence obtained.
