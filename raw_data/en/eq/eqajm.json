Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on May 09, 2019 I often receive emails from concerned readers asking me for advice on how to go about getting their chakras open and functioning. Normally this happens as a result of them being told (correctly or incorrectly) by a psychic that they have one or more non-functioning chakras. I'm not trying to bash psychic counselors, but it is important to use discernment about what is advised or suggested. It amazes me that anyone would tell someone that they have a closed chakra without offering any help on how to go about correcting the problem, other than to nudge them into consulting a healer trained in energy work who could evaluate their chakra system more thoroughly. It amazes me even more when someone doesn't ask that person to elaborate as to why such an evaluation of their chakra system was made in the first place. Below is a sampling of a few of the emails that have come my way. Sample Emails A psychic told me that my heart chakra is shut down because I repress my feelings. This really frightens me, what can I do to open up my heart? A friend of mine thinks that I'm ungrounded which indicates to her that my first chakra probably isn't functioning. That's not cool, what can I do to reverse this problem? A healer I consulted wants to do a treatment on me to open up my chakras. This scares me. What will happen if I let him do this for me? Be a Remedy Seeker - Ask Probing Questions It can be interesting and initially helpful to be given a diagnosis that one or more of your chakras are not balanced or closed off. But afterward being told that you have an imbalance, it is not beneficial for you to move into a place of fear or acceptance. Don't go into despair or shrug it off, become a remedy seeker. If you are concerned that your chakras are imbalanced my advice is to consult with an energy worker to have your chakras professionally evaluated. Find out as much information as you can by asking probing questions about what is happening inside your body and your energy levels. Ask what types of healing treatment options are available. What can you do on your own to fix the problem or ease the imbalance? In the meanwhile, there are some exercises to try to help navigate your chakras toward wellness.
