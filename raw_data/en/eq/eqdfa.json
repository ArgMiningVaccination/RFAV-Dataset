Intestinal bacteria are not only commensal, but they also undergo a synbiotic co-evolution along with their host. Beneficial intestinal bacteria have numerous and important functions, e.g., they produce various nutrients for their host, prevent infections caused by intestinal pathogens, and modulate a normal immunological response. Therefore, modification of the intestinal microbiota in order to achieve, restore, and maintain favourable balance in the ecosystem, and the activity of microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tract is necessary for the improved health condition of the host. The introduction of probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics into human diet is favourable for the intestinal microbiota. They may be consumed in the form of raw vegetables and fruit, fermented pickles, or dairy products. Another source may be pharmaceutical formulas and functional food. This paper provides a review of available information and summarises the current knowledge on the effects of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics on human health. The mechanism of beneficial action of those substances is discussed, and verified study results proving their efficacy in human nutrition are presented.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2017-09-15", "cleaned_text": "Effects of Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics after that, in 1965, Lilly and Stillwell described probiotics as microorganisms stimulating the growth of other microorganisms [ [2](#B2-nutrients-09-01021)]. The definition of probiotics has been modified and changed many times. To emphasise their microbial origin, Fuller (1989) stated that probiotics must be viable microorganisms and must exert a beneficial effect on their host [ [3](#B3-nutrients-09-01021)]. On the other hand, Guarner and Schaafsma (1998) indicated the necessary use of an appropriate dose of probiotic organisms required to achieve the expected effect [ [4](#B4-nutrients-09-01021)]. The current definition, formulated in 2002 by FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) and WHO (World Health Organization) working group experts, states that probiotics are \"live strains of strictly selected microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host\" [ [5](#B5-nutrients-09-01021)]. The definition was maintained by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) in 2013 [ [6](#B6-nutrients-09-01021)]. [7](#B7-nutrients-09-01021)]. In 2004, the definition was updated and prebiotics were defined as selectively fermented components allowing specific changes in the composition and/or activity of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, beneficial for host's health and wellbeing [ [8](#B8-nutrients-09-01021)]. Finally, in 2007, FAO/WHO experts described prebiotics as a nonviable food component that confers a health benefit on the host associated with modulation of the microbiota [ [9](#B9-nutrients-09-01021)]. [7](#B7-nutrients-09-01021)]. A selected component introduced to the gastrointestinal tract should selectively stimulate growth and/or activate the metabolism of a physiological intestinal microbiota, thus conferring beneficial effect to the host's health [ [10](#B10-nutrients-09-01021)]. As the word \"synbiotic\" implies synergy, the term should be reserved for those products in which a prebiotic component selectively favours a probiotic microorganism [ [11](#B11-nutrients-09-01021)]. The principal purpose of that type of combination is the improvement of survival of probiotic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract. [12](#B12-nutrients-09-01021)]. Therefore, an appropriate combination of both components in a single product should ensure a superior effect, compared to the activity of the probiotic or prebiotic alone [ [13](#B13-nutrients-09-01021), [14](#B14-nutrients-09-01021)]. 2. Probiotics [15](#B15-nutrients-09-01021)]. for Probiotic Strains [Table 1](#nutrients-09-01021-t001)). Probiotic characteristics are not associated with the genus or species of a microorganism, but with few and specially selected strains of a particular species [ [6](#B6-nutrients-09-01021)]. The safety of a strain is defined by its origin, the absence of association with pathogenic cultures, and the antibiotic resistance profile. Functional aspects define their survival in the gastrointestinal tract and their immunomodulatory effect. Probiotic strains have to meet the requirements associated with the technology of their production, which means they have to be able to survive and maintain their properties throughout the storage and distribution processes [ [17](#B17-nutrients-09-01021)]. Probiotics should also have documented pro-health effects consistent with the characteristics of the strain present in a marketed product. Review papers and scientific studies on one strain may not be used for the promotion of other strains as probiotics. It has to be considered, as well, that the studies documenting probiotic properties of a particular strain at a tested dose do not constitute evidence of similar properties of a different dose of the same strain. Also, the type of carrier/matrix is important, as it may reduce the viability of a particular strain, thus changing the properties of a product [ [18](#B18-nutrients-09-01021), microorganisms contained in pharmaceutical products and as food additives. 2.3. Mechanism of Action of Probiotics [27](#B27-nutrients-09-01021), [28](#B28-nutrients-09-01021)]. Live microorganisms meeting the applicable criteria are used in the production of functional food and in the preservation of food products. Their positive effect is used for the restoration of natural microbiota after antibiotic therapy [ [29](#B29-nutrients-09-01021), [30](#B30-nutrients-09-01021)]. Another function is counteracting the activity of pathogenic intestinal microbiota, introduced from contaminated food and environment. Therefore, probiotics may effectively inhibit the development of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens [ various species of Shigella [ [35](#B35-nutrients-09-01021)], Staphylococcus [ [36](#B36-nutrients-09-01021)], and Yersinia [ [37](#B37-nutrients-09-01021)], thus preventing food poisoning. A positive effect of probiotics on digestion processes, treatment of food allergies [ [38](#B38-nutrients-09-01021), [39](#B39-nutrients-09-01021)], candidoses [ [40](#B40-nutrients-09-01021)], and dental caries [ [41](#B41-nutrients-09-01021)] has been confirmed. Probiotic microorganisms such as plantarum pseudocatenulatum [ [44](#B44-nutrients-09-01021)] are natural group vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, B8, B9, B12). They also increase the efficiency of the immunological system, enhance the absorption of vitamins and mineral compounds, and stimulate the generation of organic acids and amino acids [ [18](#B18-nutrients-09-01021), [45](#B45-nutrients-09-01021), [46](#B46-nutrients-09-01021), [47](#B47-nutrients-09-01021)]. Probiotic microorganisms may also be able to produce enzymes, such as esterase, lipase, and co-enzymes A, Q, NAD, and NADP. Some products of probiotics' metabolism may also show antibiotic Probiotic bacteria may be able to adhere to epithelial cells, thus blocking pathogens. That mechanism exerts an important effect on the host's health condition. Moreover, the adhesion of probiotic microorganisms to epithelial cells may trigger a signalling cascade, leading to immunological modulation. Alternatively, the release of some soluble components may cause a direct or indirect (through epithelial cells) activation of immunological cells. This effect plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of contagious diseases, as well as in chronic inflammation of the alimentary tract or of a part thereof [ [28](#B28-nutrients-09-01021)]. There are also suggestions of a possible role of probiotics in the elimination of cancer cells [ [55](#B55-nutrients-09-01021)]. [28](#B28-nutrients-09-01021)]. For example, Lactobacillus genus bacteria may be able to produce bacteriocins, including low-molecular-weight substances (LMWB\u2014antibacterial peptides), as well as high-molecular-weight ones (class III bacteriocins), and some antibiotics. Probiotic bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) may produce the so-called de-conjugated bile acids (derivatives of bile acids), demonstrating stronger antibacterial effect than the bile salts produced by their host [ [28](#B28-nutrients-09-01021), [56](#B56-nutrients-09-01021)]. Further studies are necessary to explain the mechanism of acquiring resistance to their own metabolites by Lactobacillus genus bacteria. The nutrient essential for nearly all bacteria, except for lactic acid bacteria, is iron. It turns out that Lactobacillus bacteria do not need iron in their natural environment, which may be their crucial advantage over other microorganisms [ [57](#B57-nutrients-09-01021)]. Lactobacillus delbrueckii affects the function of other microbes by binding iron hydroxide to its cellular surface, thus making it unavailable to other microbes [ [58](#B58-nutrients-09-01021)]. [53](#B53-nutrients-09-01021), [59](#B59-nutrients-09-01021)]: - (1) - Induction and maintenance of the state of immunological tolerance to environmental antigens (nutritional and inhalatory); - (2) - Induction and control of immunological reactions against pathogens of bacterial and viral origin; - (3) - Inhibition of auto-aggressive and allergic reactions. [28](#B28-nutrients-09-01021)]. The principal host cells that are important in the context of the immune response are intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal immune cells. Components of the cellular wall of lactic acid bacteria stimulate the activity of macrophages. Those, in turn, are able to destroy microbes rapidly by the increased production of free oxygen radicals and lysosomal enzymes. Probiotic bacteria are also able to stimulate the production of cytokines by immunocompetent cells of the gastrointestinal tract [ [60](#B60-nutrients-09-01021)]. On the other hand, the immunological activity of yeast is associated with the presence of glucans in their cellular wall. Those compounds stimulate the response of the reticuloendothelial system [ [61](#B61-nutrients-09-01021)]. [62](#B62-nutrients-09-01021), [63](#B63-nutrients-09-01021), [64](#B64-nutrients-09-01021)]. However, not all probiotics exhibit detoxifying properties, as it is a strain-related characteristic. Studies should therefore be conducted to select strains with such characteristics. The effectiveness of some probiotics in combating diarrhoea is probably associated with their ability to protect the host from toxins. The reduction of metabolic reactions leading to the production of toxins is also associated with the stimulation of pathways leading to the production of native enzymes, vitamins, and antimicrobial substances [ [28](#B28-nutrients-09-01021)]. [65](#B65-nutrients-09-01021), [66](#B66-nutrients-09-01021), [67](#B67-nutrients-09-01021)]. Nutritional programming to manipulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota through the administration of probiotics continues to receive much attention for the prevention or attenuation of the symptoms of metabolic-related diseases. Currently, studies are exploring the potential for expanded uses of probiotics for improving health conditions in metabolic disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. Further investigations are required to evaluate the targeted and effective use of the wide variety of probiotic strains in various metabolic disorders to improve the overall health status of the host [ [65](#B65-nutrients-09-01021)]. [68](#B68-nutrients-09-01021)]. [Figure 1](#nutrients-09-01021-f001)summarises the mechanisms and effects of action of probiotics. 2.4. Probiotics for Humans [69](#B69-nutrients-09-01021), [70](#B70-nutrients-09-01021)]. Numerous studies assessed the use of probiotics in the treatment of lactose intolerance [ [71](#B71-nutrients-09-01021), [72](#B72-nutrients-09-01021)], irritable bowel syndrome, and the prevention of colorectal cancer [ [73](#B73-nutrients-09-01021)] and peptic ulcers [ [74](#B74-nutrients-09-01021)]. [75](#B75-nutrients-09-01021)]. On the other hand, a positive effect on the urogenital system (prevention and treatment of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) and bacterial vaginitis) constitutes an excellent example of the benefits associated with the use of probiotics [ [76](#B76-nutrients-09-01021), [77](#B77-nutrients-09-01021), [78](#B78-nutrients-09-01021)]. There were attempts to apply probiotics to pregnant women and neonates in order to prevent allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis. However, the scope of action is controversial in this kind of case [ [79](#B79-nutrients-09-01021)]. There is evidence that the consumption of probiotics-containing dairy products results in the reduction of blood cholesterol, which may be helpful in the prevention of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebral stroke [ [80](#B80-nutrients-09-01021)]. The reduction of cholesterol level achieved due to probiotics is less pronounced compared to the effect of pharmaceutical agents, but leads to a significant minimisation of side effects [ [80](#B80-nutrients-09-01021)]. Other studies confirmed the effect of the probiotic formula VSL#3 and of the Oxalobacter formigenes bacterial strain on the elimination of oxalates with urine, which may potentially reduce the risk of urolithiasis [ [81](#B81-nutrients-09-01021)]. Studies on animals demonstrated that orally administered Lactobacillus acidophilus induces expression of -opioid and cannabinoid receptors in intestinal cells and mediate analgesic functions in the intestine, and that the observed effect is comparable to the effect of morphine [ [82](#B82-nutrients-09-01021)]. However, the effect has not been demonstrated in humans. [83](#B83-nutrients-09-01021)]. The efficacy of probiotic strains in the therapy of nosocomial, non-nosocomial, and viral diarrhoeas has also been documented. It turns out that probiotics may increase the amount of IgA antibodies, which leads to the arrest of a viral infection [ [84](#B84-nutrients-09-01021)]. [85](#B85-nutrients-09-01021)]. [86](#B86-nutrients-09-01021)]. Other studies demonstrated that the application of a diet depleted of fermented foods caused a reduction of congenital immunological response, as well as a significant reduction of stool Lactobacillus count and of the stool amount of short-chain fatty acids. Moreover, the reduction of phagocytic activity of leukocytes was observed after two weeks of the diet, which could have a negative impact on the organism's ability to protect against infections [ [87](#B87-nutrients-09-01021)]. The effect of a fermented product containing Lactobacillus gasseri CECT5714 and Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT5711 strains on blood and stool parameters was studied in a randomised, double-blind trial on 30 healthy volunteers. No negative effects were observed in the group of subjects receiving the probiotic strains. Some positive effects were observed, including: the production of short-chain fatty acids, humidity, frequency and volume of stools, and subjective improvement of intestinal function [ [88](#B88-nutrients-09-01021)]. Studies by Alvaro et al. (2007) demonstrated a significant reduction of Enterobacteriaceae count and increased galactosidase activity in the alimentary tract of yoghurt consumers, compared to those who did not eat yoghurt [ [89](#B89-nutrients-09-01021)]. [Table 3](#nutrients-09-01021-t003)lists the results of studies focusing on the effect of probiotics on human health. There are examples of clinical trials during which the probiotics group received the probiotic prophylactically or in addition to the standard therapy. 3. Prebiotics [129](#B129-nutrients-09-01021)]. [130](#B130-nutrients-09-01021)]. Some of produced oligosaccharides (as much as 40%). Fructans, such as inulin and oligofructose, are believed to be the most used and effective in relation to many species of probiotics [ [131](#B131-nutrients-09-01021)]. 3.1. Prebiotic Selection Criteria [Figure 2](#nutrients-09-01021-f002)) [ [132](#B132-nutrients-09-01021)]. The first criterion assumes that prebiotics are not digested (or just partially digested) in the upper segments of the alimentary tract. As a consequence, they reach the colon, where they are selectively fermented by potentially beneficial bacteria (a requirement of the second criterion) [ [133](#B133-nutrients-09-01021)]. The fermentation may lead to the increased production or a change in the relative abundance of different short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), increased stool mass, a moderate reduction of colonic pH, reduction of nitrous end products and faecal enzymes, and an improvement of the immunological system [ [134](#B134-nutrients-09-01021)], which is beneficial for the host (the requirement of the third criterion). Selective stimulation of growth and/or activity of the intestinal bacteria potentially associated with health protection and wellbeing is considered another criterion [ [8](#B8-nutrients-09-01021)]. The last criterion of the classification assumes that a prebiotic must be able to withstand food processing conditions and remained unchanged, non-degraded, or chemically unaltered and available for bacterial metabolism in the intestine [ [132](#B132-nutrients-09-01021)]. Huebner et al. (2008) tested several commercially available prebiotics using various processing conditions. They found no significant changes of the prebiotic activity of the tested substances in various processing conditions [ [135](#B135-nutrients-09-01021)]. Meanwhile, Ze et al. (2012) showed that it was possible to alter the ability of gut bacteria by utilising starch in vitro [ [136](#B136-nutrients-09-01021)]. The structure of prebiotics should be appropriately documented, and components used as pharmaceutical formulas, food, or feed additives should be relatively easy to obtain at an industrial scale [ [137](#B137-nutrients-09-01021)]. [139](#B139-nutrients-09-01021), [140](#B140-nutrients-09-01021)]. Moreover, prebiotics cause a reduction of intestinal pH and maintain the osmotic retention of water in the bowel [ [134](#B134-nutrients-09-01021)]. However, it should be considered that an overdose of prebiotics may lead to flatulence and diarrhoea\u2014these effects are absent in the case of excessive consumption of probiotics. Prebiotics may be consumed on a long-term basis and for prophylactic purposes. Moreover, when used at correct doses, they do not stimulate any adverse effects, such as diarrhoea, susceptibility to UV light, or hepatic injuries caused by antibiotics. Prebiotic substances are not allergenic and do not proliferate the abundance of antibiotic-resistance genes. Of course, the effect of the elimination of selected pathogens achieved by the use of prebiotics may be inferior to antibiotics, but the properties mentioned above make them a natural substitute for antibiotics [ [134](#B134-nutrients-09-01021)]. 3.2. Prebiotic Substances [134](#B134-nutrients-09-01021)]: - not digested (or only partially digested); - not absorbed in the small intestine; - poorly fermented by bacteria in the oral cavity; - well fermented by seemingly beneficial intestinal bacteria; - poorly fermented by potential pathogens in the bowel. [141](#B141-nutrients-09-01021)]. Therefore, considering one of the basic classification criteria, it turns out that using those terms alternatively is not always correct. Prebiotics may be a dietary fibre, but dietary fibre is not always a prebiotic [ [138](#B138-nutrients-09-01021)]. The following non-starch polysaccharides are considered to be dietary fibre: cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins, gums, substances obtained from marine soy oligosaccharides, inulins, fructooligosaccharides, oligosaccharides (3-10 monomers), and polysaccharides. The most promising and fulfilling criteria for the classification of prebiotic substances, as evidenced by in vitro and in vivo studies, are oligosaccharides, including [ [144](#B144-nutrients-09-01021)]. 3.3. Mechanism of Action of Prebiotics [Figure 2](#nutrients-09-01021-f002)presents the principal mechanisms of prebiotic action and some of their effects on the host's health. Prebiotics are not digested by host enzymes and reach the colon in a practically unaltered form, where they are fermented by saccharolytic bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium genus). The consumption of prebiotics largely affects the composition of the intestinal microbiota and its metabolic activity [ [147](#B147-nutrients-09-01021)]. This is due to the modulation of lipid metabolism, enhanced absorbability of calcium, effect on the immunological system, and modification of the bowel function [ [147](#B147-nutrients-09-01021)]. It is highly probable that providing an energy source that only specific species in the microbiota can utilize has a greater impact on microbiota composition and metabolism than these other factors. The molecular structure of prebiotics determines their physiological effects and the types of microorganisms that are able to use them as a source of carbon and energy in the bowel [ [134](#B134-nutrients-09-01021)]. It was demonstrated that, despite the variety of carbohydrates that exhibit the prebiotic activity, the effect of their administration is an increased count of beneficial bacteria, mostly of the Bifidobacterium genus [ [148](#B148-nutrients-09-01021), [149](#B149-nutrients-09-01021)]. [150](#B150-nutrients-09-01021)]: - (1) - Prebiotics are able to regulate the action of hepatic lipogenic enzymes by influencing the increased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as propionic acid. - (2) - The production of SCFAs (especially of butyric acid) as a result of fermentation was identified as a modulator of histone acetylation, thus increasing the availability of numerous genes for transcription factors. - (3) - The modulation of mucin production. - (4) - It was demonstrated that FOS and several other prebiotics cause an increased count of lymphocytes and/or leukocytes in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs) and in peripheral blood. - (5) - The increased secretion of IgA by GALTs may stimulate the phagocytic function of intra-inflammatory macrophages. [151](#B151-nutrients-09-01021)]. As a result of the fermentation of carbohydrates, Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus may produce some compounds inhibiting the development of gastrointestinal pathogens, as well as cause a reduction in the intestinal pH [ [152](#B152-nutrients-09-01021)]. Moreover, Bifidobacterium genus bacteria demonstrate tolerance to the produced SCFAs and reduced pH. Therefore, due to their favourable effect on the development of beneficial intestinal bacteria, the administration of prebiotics may participate in the inhibition of the development of pathogens. There are very few documented study results regarding the inhibition of the development of pathogens by prebiotics. In 1997 and 2003, Bovee-Oudenhoven et al. studied the use of lactulose in the prevention of Salmonella Enteritidis infections on a rat model. Their results indicated that the acidification of the intestine occurring as a result of lactulose fermentation caused the reduced development of pathogens and increased translocation of pathogens from the bowel [ [153](#B153-nutrients-09-01021)]. It was also demonstrated that the administration of prebiotics increases the absorption of minerals, mostly of magnesium and calcium [ [154](#B154-nutrients-09-01021), [155](#B155-nutrients-09-01021)]. 3.4. Prebiotics for Humans [156](#B156-nutrients-09-01021)]. Among the advantages of those prebiotics, one may also mention the reduction of the blood LDL (low-density lipoprotein) level, stimulation of the immunological system, increased absorbability of calcium, maintenance of correct intestinal pH value, low caloric value, and alleviation of symptoms of peptic ulcers and vaginal mycosis [ [157](#B157-nutrients-09-01021)]. Other effects of inulin and oligofructose on human health are: the prevention of carcinogenesis, as well as the support of lactose intolerance or dental caries treatment [ [131](#B131-nutrients-09-01021)]. Rat studies demonstrated that administration of inulin for five weeks caused a significant reduction of blood triacylglycerol levels [ [156](#B156-nutrients-09-01021)]. Human studies demonstrated that the daily use of 12 g of inulin for one month led to the reduction of blood VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) levels (the reduction of triacylglycerols by 27%, and of cholesterol by 5%). This effect is associated with the effect of the prebiotic on hepatic metabolism and the inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and of glukose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. It is oligofructose accelerates lipid catabolism [ [157](#B157-nutrients-09-01021)]. [158](#B158-nutrients-09-01021)]. Buddington et al. (2002) confirmed a positive effect of fructooligosaccharides (FOS) on protection against Salmonella Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes infections [ [159](#B159-nutrients-09-01021)]. Moreover, prebiotics are helpful in combating pathogenic microorganisms, such as Salmonella Enteritidis and Escherichia coli, and reduce odour compounds [ [160](#B160-nutrients-09-01021)]. There are many reports regarding the positive effect of prebiotics on the carcinogenesis process. Results of rat studies proved that a prebiotic-enriched diet leads to significantly reduced indexes of carcinogenesis. Scientific research demonstrated that butyric acid may be a chemopreventive factor in carcinogenesis [ [161](#B161-nutrients-09-01021)], or an agent protecting against the development of colorectal carcinoma through the promotion of cell differentiation [ [162](#B162-nutrients-09-01021)]. Besides butyric acid, propionic acid also may possess anti-inflammatory properties in relation to colorectal carcinoma cells. In vitro studies on human L97 and HT29 cell lines (representing early and late stages of colorectal carcinoma) demonstrated that inulin fractions in plasma supernatant caused a significant inhibition of growth and induction of apoptosis in human colorectal carcinoma [ [163](#B163-nutrients-09-01021)]. According to scientific reports, the administration of inulin and oligofructose to rats caused the inhibition of azoxymethane-induced colorectal carcinoma at the growth stage [ [164](#B164-nutrients-09-01021)]. The supplementation of inulin and oligofructose at the dose of 5%-15% had also an effect on reduced occurrence of breast cancer in rats and of metastases to lungs [ [165](#B165-nutrients-09-01021)]. However, those results have to be confirmed in humans. [Table 5](#nutrients-09-01021-t005)lists the results of studies focusing on the effect of prebiotics on human health. There are examples of clinical trials during which the prebiotics group received the prebiotic prophylactically or in addition to the standard therapy. 4. Synbiotics [179](#B179-nutrients-09-01021)]. The effect of synbiotics on metabolic health remains unclear. It should be mentioned that the health effect of synbiotics is probably associated with the individual combination of a probiotic and prebiotic [ [180](#B180-nutrients-09-01021)]. Considering a huge number of possible combinations, the application of synbiotics for the modulation of intestinal microbiota in humans seems promising [ [181](#B181-nutrients-09-01021)]. 4.1. Synbiotic Selection Criteria 4.2. Synbiotics in Use [Table 4](#nutrients-09-01021-t004)presents the most commonly used combinations of probiotics and prebiotics. 4.3. Mechanism of Action of Synbiotics [182](#B182-nutrients-09-01021)]. Prebiotics are used mostly as a selective medium for the growth of a probiotic strain, fermentation, and intestinal passage. There are indications in the literature that, due to the use of prebiotics, probiotic microorganisms acquire higher tolerance to environmental conditions, including: oxygenation, pH, and temperature in the intestine of a particular organism [ [183](#B183-nutrients-09-01021)]. However, the mechanism of action of an extra energy source that provides higher tolerance to these factors is not sufficiently explained. That combination of components leads to the creation of viable microbiological dietary supplements, and ensuring an appropriate environment allows a positive impact on the host's health. Two modes of synbiotic action are known [ [184](#B184-nutrients-09-01021)]: - (1) - Action through the improved viability of probiotic microorganisms; - (2) - Action through the provision of specific health effects. [180](#B180-nutrients-09-01021)]. Synbiotics result in reduced concentrations of undesirable metabolites, as well as the inactivation of nitrosamines and cancerogenic substances. Their use leads to a significant increase of levels of short-chain fatty acids, ketones, carbon disulphides, and methyl acetates, which potentially results in a positive effect on the host's health [ [184](#B184-nutrients-09-01021)]. As for their therapeutic efficacy, the desirable properties of synbiotics include antibacterial, anticancerogenic, and anti-allergic effects. They also counteract decay processes in the intestine and prevent constipation and diarrhoea. It turns out that synbiotics may be highly efficient in the prevention of osteoporosis, reduction of blood fat and sugar levels, regulation of the immunological system, and treatment of brain disorders associated with abnormal hepatic function [ [185](#B185-nutrients-09-01021)]. The concept of mechanisms of synbiotic action, based on the modification of intestinal microbiota with probiotic microorganisms and appropriately selected prebiotics as their substrates, is presented in [Figure 1](#nutrients-09-01021-f001). 4.4. Synbiotics for Humans [186](#B186-nutrients-09-01021)]: - (1) - Increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genus count and maintenance of balance of the intestinal microbiota; - (2) - Improved hepatic function in patients suffering from cirrhosis; - (3) - Improved immunomodulative abilities; - (4) - Prevention of bacterial translocation and reduced incidence of nosocomial infections in patients' post-surgical procedures and similar interventions. [187](#B187-nutrients-09-01021)]. It is also known that LPSs induce proinflammatory cytokines, such as the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), playing a crucial role in insulin resistance and inflammatory cell uptake in NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). In the study on the effect of the synbiotic product containing a blend of probiotics fructooligosccharides, 52 adults participated for 28 weeks. It was found that supplementation with the synbiotic resulted in the inhibition of NF-B (nuclear factor B) and reduced production of TNF- (tumour necrosis factor ) [ [188](#B188-nutrients-09-01021)]. [157](#B157-nutrients-09-01021)]. Moreover, synbiotics are used in the treatment of hepatic conditions [ [189](#B189-nutrients-09-01021)] and improve the absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus [ [190](#B190-nutrients-09-01021)]. [191](#B191-nutrients-09-01021)]. [192](#B192-nutrients-09-01021)]. It was concluded that the application of the studied synbiotic may reduce the risk of colorectal carcinoma. A lower level of DNA damage was also observed, as well as a lower colonocyte proliferation ratio [ [147](#B147-nutrients-09-01021)]. [Table 6](#nutrients-09-01021-t006)lists the results of studies focusing on the effect of synbiotics on human health. There are examples of clinical trials during which the synbiotics group received the synbiotic prophylactically or in addition to the standard therapy. 5. Summary [207](#B207-nutrients-09-01021)]. It seems also that probiotics may be helpful in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, enteritis, bacterial infections, and various gastrointestinal disorders and diarrhoeas. Probiotic microorganisms are also effective in the alleviation of lactose intolerance and the treatment of atopic dermatitis. A positive effect of probiotics in the course of various neoplastic diseases and side effects associated with anti-cancer therapies is also worth noting. Prebiotics may be used as an alternative to probiotics, or as an additional support for them. It turns out that the development of bio-therapeutic formulas containing both appropriate microbial strains and synergistic prebiotics may lead to the enhancement of the probiotic effect in the small intestine and the colon. Those \"enhanced\" probiotic products may be even more effective, and their protective and stimulatory effect superior to their components administered separately [ [208](#B208-nutrients-09-01021)]. It seems that we will see further studies on combinations of probiotics and prebiotics, and further development of synbiotics. Future studies may explain the mechanisms of actions of those components, which may confer a beneficial effect on human health. Acknowledgments Conflicts of Interest References - Vergin, F.
