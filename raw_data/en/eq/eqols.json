She reported a headache over the previous few weeks. Over about 6 months she had been obtaining over the counter treatment from the local pharmacy for oral thrush. She had a slight fever on admission, no focal neurological signs or papilledema on funduscopy . On a full blood count she had a slight pancytopenia . A CT scan of her head showed one small ring enhancing lesion in the cerebrum ( Figure 1 ). After deliberation it was considered safe and prudent to perform a lumbar puncture. There were 10 lymphocytes (normal <5), a protein of 940 mg L -1 (normal range 150-450), but no organisms. She was started on phenytoin to control fits and ceftriaxone and metronidazole to treat bacterial brain abscesses . Later in her admission the possibility of HIV was considered. After counseling she tested positive for HIV. This changed the differential diagnosis. There had been no improvement in her fever or headache and she was presumptively diagnosed with toxoplasmic encephalitis . Treatment was changed to pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine plus folinic acid to help her bone marrow. Serology for Toxoplasma was IgG -positive and IgM -negative. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for Toxoplasma by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ). Over the next 3 months serial CT scans showed resolution of her lesion on treatment. An Evaluation of Patients' Willingness to Trade Symptom-Free Days for Asthma-Related Treatment Risks: A Discrete Choice Experiment Published in D. Lynd](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=Contrib&text1=Larry%2BD.%2BLynd) Background. Not taking treatment preferences into account may lead to patients' inappropriate use of asthma treatments. The objective of this study was to quantify these preferences, in terms of risk-benefits trade-offs, for six asthma treatment attributes using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Methods. Adult asthma patients (n = 157) participated in the study. The custom-designed DCE measured preferences for treatment effectiveness (symptom-free days), potential risk (oral thrush and tremor/heart palpitation), ease of use (frequency of daily administration and number of inhalers required), and cost. A nested logit model was used to determine the relative preferences of each attribute, from which the marginal rates of substitution were calculated. Segmented models were used to test for interactions between cost and treatment benefit with socioeconomic status and medication use. Results. Relationships between preferences and all attributes were in the hypothesized direction. On average, patients were willing to pay an additional $14 per month to receive one additional symptom-free day, and $26, $79, and $112 monthly to avoid one, two, and three annual episodes of oral thrush, respectively. Income and the magnitude of short-acting -agonist use also affected treatment preferences. Conclusions. Overall, asthma patients desired treatments that offered more symptom-free days, but they were willing to trade days without symptoms in exchange for a reduction in adverse events and greater convenience. Oral passive IgY-based immunotherapeutics Published in [Human summarizes the laboratory investigations and clinical trials published recently involving per-oral application of IgY supplemented food for specific orogastrointestinal disease prevention and control purposes. The prolonged use and misuse of conventional antibacterial drugs has spawned antibiotic resistant microbes prompting scientists to search for other germ-killing options. In particular, the use of IgY as a novel mode of immunotherapy using oral chicken immunoglobulin (IgY) to confer passive immunity has gained much interest as an inexpensive non-antibiotic alternative for the prophylaxis and treatment of a wide variety of infectious diseases. The stability of IgY in the orogastrointestinal tract and its safety profile has been well-documented. IgY has been used in the treatment or prevention of dental caries, periodontitis and gingivitis, gastritis and gastric ulcer, oral thrush and infant rotavirus diarrhea. The recent clinical trials on IgY with encouraging results has catapulted into the market novel nutraceutical or health supplements for therapeutic or prophylactic intervention based on the consumption of mono-specific or mixed IgY formulations. With recent trends in consumer preference for natural materials to alleviate health concerns, the increasing healthcare costs and the recent advances in drug delivery systems, IgY is likely to shift from its mainly functional food status toward pharmaceuticalization in the foreseeable future. Dermatology Quiz Published in [South African Family Practice](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/OJFP), 2008 A 36-year- old male presented with a history of nodules on the face for 3 months. He is HIV positive with a CD4 count of 92 cells/mm3. The patient has not yet been receiving ani-retroviral therapy. On clinical examination he was emaciated, had generalised lymphadenopathy and oral thrush. He had several nodular lesions on the face. These lesions bled easily on contact (Figure 1). Biopsy from one of the nodules showed an atrophic epidermis, proliferation of capillaries in the dermis and an inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes and neutrophils (Figure 2) Related Knowledge Centers Current Trials "}
