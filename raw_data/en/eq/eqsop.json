E Ernst, A Fugh-Berman Long a source of primary care in most countries, complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) has recently become a focus of interest in industrialised nations.12Terms often used synonymously reflect conflicting perspectives. Proponents may prefer the terms holistic, natural, non-toxic, integrative, m\u00e9decine douce (gentle medicine); opponents non-traditional, or \"Au enseitermedizin\" (outsiders' medicine). Perhaps the most neutral terms are \"practiques paralleles\" (parallel practices), unconventional, or complemen-tary medicine. \"Alternative medicine\" is more widely used in the USA (it is also the term employedby Medline), \"complementary medicine\" in the UK. We consider the latter most accurate but bowto the current convention of referring to CAM. The aim of this article is to provide a short general introduction to CAM. It is written predomi- nantly with occupational and environmental healthcare professionals in mind; its aim is to famil-iarise them with this increasingly important topic. cDEFINITION Complementary therapies seem to have little in common other than their exclusion from themainstream. Many supporters are convinced of the superiority and universal applicability of theirtreatment. CAM encompasses primary care systems of medicine (including traditional Chinesemedicine and Ayurvedic medicine, which have unique diagnostic criteria and diverse therapeuticoptions), discrete therapies (shark cartilage, bee pollen, ozone therapy, etc) and almost everythingin between. Besides comprising over 150 treatment modalities, 3CAM also embraces a large variety of diagnostic methods.4A positive denition, describing CAM by what it is rather than by what it is not, has recently been adopted by the Cochrane Collaboration: CAM is diagnosis, treatmentand/or prevention which complements mainstream medicine by contributing to a common whole,by satisfying a demand not met by orthodoxy or by diversifying the conceptual frameworks ofmedicine. 4 HISTORY Both in Europe5and the USA6CAM has enjoyed periods of popularity only to cycle into disfavour later. For example, in the USA during the mid to late 19th century, homeopathy, hydropathy (watercures), Thomsonianism (a system which included dietary changes, herbalism, and steam bathsbased on the teachings of Samuel Thomson) and Eclecticism (the precursor of today's naturopathy)all thrived, only to dwindle into obscurity in the 20th century. 7Sir William Osler's Principles and practice of medicine , rst published in 1892, recommended acupuncture for sciatica and lumbago; the reference was expunged 30 years after Osler's death in 1919.8 Neither prevalence of use nor patient satisfaction are acceptable surrogates for efcacy. If CAM is to have a lasting effect on the provision of health care, a sound evidence base must be established.Such an evidence base would be in the interest of the patient. It presents quite simply the only wayto make sure that CAM is doing more good than harm. 2 PRESENT PREVALENCE A telephone survey of more than 1500 adults in the USA demonstrated that 33% had used a com- plementary therapy in 1990; by 1997 the gure had risen to about 42%.9 Lifetime prevalence is in excess of 60%.10In 1990, the number of visits to CAM practitioners in the USA roughly equalled that to primary care physicians. In 1997 the former outnumbered thelatter by about 70%. 9 In other industrialised countries, CAM is even more popular. Between 20-65% of the general populations in Europe are using some form of CAM.11-13The use of CAM in non-industrialised countries may be ubiquitous; the World Health Organization (in an oft-invoked statement with noprimary reference) claims that 80% of the world depends on indigenous therapies. 14 T o date there is virtually no evidence regarding the provision of CAM through occupational health departments in the UK or elsewhere.

Downloaded from CAM (box 1), one might expect that such units frequently consider some form of CAM or another. Anecdotally we knowthat UK occupational health departments are increasinglybeing asked to provide or facilitate some forms of CAM, forinstance for employees. Reliable data regarding the extent towhich CAM is available in such departments should now begathered. REASONS FOR USE The high prevalence of CAM usage worries some andreassures others. In any case, it clearly begs the question, whydo so many people turn to CAM? While reasons may differvastly from one sample of users to another, several recurringthemes seem to emerge. 15-17 Expansion of diagnostic options A disparate collection of symptoms that ts no syndrome known to conventional medicine may be a perfect t for a tra-ditional Chinese medicine or a homoeopathic diagnosis.Recognising\u2014and naming\u2014a disease can be a major source ofvalidation and relief to a patient. Donning an alternative diag-nostic label can renew hope, maximising receptivity to CAMtreatments, regardless of whether or not the diagnosticmethod used is valid or not. Expansion of therapeutic options Patients who use CAM do so most often at opposite ends of the disease spectrum: either for chronic, minor illnesses (forexample, back pain) or for devastating, life threatening condi-tions (for example, cancer). In both situations, conventionaloptions may be perceived as either ineffective and/or too toxic.Besides perceived therapeutic benets, many complementarytherapies not only have few unpleasant adverse effects butactually have pleasant side effects\u2014for example, a massagetherapy for musculoskeletal pain can be very relaxing to themind. The aims of CAM may be closer to those of patients thandoctors; while physicians usually want to alter the course ofpathological processes, patients simply want to feel better. Psychological distress A recent and potentially important nding indicates that, in severely ill patients, the use of CAM might be a marker fordistress. A prospective study was conducted of how psychol-ogy influenced the usage of CAM in breast cancer patients.Three months after the diagnosis, those women who had cho-sen to try CAM had more evidence of depression, lower levelsof sexual satisfaction, a greater fear of recurrence of disease, aswell as more frequent and severe symptoms. 18Better patient-provider relationship It is here that conventional medicine should accept culpabil- ity; many of us are palpably bored by the management ofchronic problems (which, though not medically \"serious\", sig-nicantly affect the lives of our patients). When we exhaustour therapeutic repertoire in a terminal illness, we may turnour attention elsewhere. Whenever we cannot cure, we tend tofall short in our other duty: to care. It is hardly surprising thenthat many patients experience the therapeutic relationshipwith CAM practitioners more rewarding. Survey data seem to conrm these diverse motivations for trying CAM. Patients from three different European nationsthought that the most frequently named reasons for tryingCAM were: the desire to use all possible options of healthcare;the hope of being cured without side effects; previous goodexperience; and the use of CAM as a last hope. 17 INDICATIONS The conditions most commonly treated by CAM are listed inbox 1. It has been wryly pointed out that for conditions wheremainstream medicine offers a cure, CAM has no followers. 19 The offer of hope is a seductive incentive. CAM thrives where(depending on one's point of view) mainstream medicine hasfailed or no effective treatments exist. In truth these categoriesoverlap. This also points up the dissatisfaction of patients withconventional therapies (and perhaps conventional therapists)for these conditions.Box 1 Conditions most frequently treated with complementary therapies (in descending order) USA 1990* USA 1997 UK 1994 Low back pain Neck problems Low back pain Anxiety Back problems Other painHeadache Anxiety Psychological illnessChronic pain Depression Gynaecological conditionsCancer/tumour Headache Respiratory conditionsDepression Digestive problems ArthritisInsomnia Fatigue ME and fatigue *Data from Eisenberg et al.9 Data from Berg et al.10 Own data.

Downloaded from In the case of life threatening disease, the potential for exploitation of the patient is, of course, greatest.20On the one hand, the use of CAM for serious disease could mean that CAM merely sells hope (at times irresponsibly) where noeffective treatments are available. On the other hand, itsuggests that CAM is operating in an area where therapeuticsuccess is difcult, mainstream medicine has failed, and anybenet at all would be precious. ATTITUDES WITHIN CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE In the aforementioned surveys,972% of those seeing an alter- native practitioner did not tell their physician that they weredoing so. While patients may have feared censure, their physi-cians (especially family practitioners) may be more openminded than they think. A survey of 594 US family physiciansfound that 44% of these doctors thought faith healers andphysicians could work together to cure some patients, and23% believed that faith healers heal some patients whom phy-sicians cannot help. 21 A survey of 138 community physicians in Washington State, New Mexico, and southern Israel found that more than 60% ofall doctors had made referrals to CAM practitioners in the lastyear and 38% in the preceding month. 22Of 200 Canadian gen- eral practitioners, 54% referred to CAM practitioners and 16%practised some form of CAM. 23Seventeen per cent of Israeli family physicians have formal training in at least one form ofCAM, and 42% refer patients for such treatments. 24Those physicians who incorporate one form of CAM into their prac-tice are likely to use or refer patients for other CAMtreatments. 25 Physicians and medical students are clearly interested in learning more.26Many US medical schools are now offeringelective courses in CAM.27In the UK, 15 of all 23 medical schools now offer elective courses in CAM28and one medical faculty recently instituted a compulsory course on CAM for allundergraduate medical students. 29The extent to which CAM is integrated into the education of occupational and environ-mental medicine has so far not been investigated. Two independent surveys have investigated what evidence decision makers within the British National Health Servicerequire for purchasing CAM. 30 31The two items ranked highest were proof of efcacy (through randomised controlled trials(RCTs)) and safety. Evidence based medicine, it seems, willnot bypass CAM. HAS CAM AN EVIDENCE BASE? This article cannot be the place to provide an in-depth,comprehensive review of the evidence relating to CAM.Numerous RCTs are available and several systematic reviewsor meta-analyses of RCTs have been published (for example,Ernst and colleagues 32). A list of 60 systematic reviews pub- lished by the team of the rst author can be ordered from himfree of charge. Such critical evaluations of the existingevidence may come to sobering conclusions (box 2). 33-35For instance, contrary to what many believe and what practiceguidelines tell us, chiropractic is not proven beyond reasonabledoubt to be effective for low back pain. 35One ought to remem- ber, however, that absence of evidence must not be equatedwith evidence for absence of efcacy (or safety). In otherareas, particularly herbal medicine, the evidence base is rstlymore solid and secondly frequently compellingly positive. 32 Box 3 summarises the evidence available to date32for two con- ditions frequently encountered in occupational and environ-mental medicine: back pain and anxiety.Box 2 Clinical trial evidence in complementary medicine: conclusions from recent, authoritative meta-analyses and systematic reviews Acupuncture Homoeopathy Manipulation Conditions Chronic pain Any Low back pain Type of data summarised 14 RCTs of various forms of acupuncture 89 randomised and/or placebo controlled trials8 RCTs of chiropractic Method of evaluation Systematic review Meta-analysis Systematic review Conclusion (verbatim quotes) There is limited evidence that acupuncture is more effective than no treatment for chronic pain and inconclusive evidence thatacupuncture is more effective than placebo,sham acupuncture or standard careClinical effects of homoeopathyare [not] completely due toplacebo[No] convincing evidence for theeffectiveness of chiropractic foracute or chronic low back pain Reference Ezzo et al33Linde D et al34Assendelft et al35 RCT, randomised controlled trial Box 3 The evidence base for CAM using the examples of back pain and anxiety Therapy Back pain Anxiety Acupuncture Substantial amount of RCTs, overall result tentatively positive Insufficient data Aromatherapy Insufficient data Several RCTs, overall result tentatively positive Autogenic training Insufficient data Several RCTs, overall result tentatively positive Biofeedback Insufficient data Several RCTs, overall result not clear Herbal medicine Devil's claw: few RCTs, overall result positive Kava: satisfactory amount of RCTs, overall result positive Homoeopathy Insufficient data Insufficient data Hypnotherapy Insufficient data Insufficient data Massage Few RCTs, overall result tentatively positive Few RCTs, overall result tentatively positive Meditation Insufficient data Several RCTs, overall result positive Relaxation Insufficient data Several RCTs, overall result positive Spinal manipulation Substantial amount of RCTs, overall tentatively positive for acute back pain and less clear for chronic back painFew RCTs, overall result negative Spiritual healing Insufficient data Insufficient data Evidence based on systematic reviews summarised in Ernst et al.32EDUCATION *142 www.occenvmed.com on September 17, 2023 by guest.

The truly relevant question relates neither to efcacy nor to safety in isolation but asks: does it do more good than harm?Many users of CAM are convinced that CAM is totally devoidof adverse effects. CAM is (perceived as) natural, and\"natural\" implies \"no side effects\". This media hypedmisunderstanding 36can be dangerously wrong. Most, if not all, therapies have direct risks and adverse effects (forexample, Ernst and colleagues 32). Serious complications are being reported with depressing regularity but, at present, wecannot reliably dene their frequency (box 4). There are also indirect risks of CAM such as misdiagnoses, disregard of contraindications, hindering access to effective orthodox interventions, or potentially harmful diagnosticpractices associated with a given type of therapy. 32 37This issue is particularly delicate since it borders on the following ques-tion: who is medically competent to take responsibility forpatients and who is not? 36Competence can best be achieved by proper training and sufcient experience. Whenever trainingis insufcient, serious adverse effects are likely. Insufcienttraining or education may be a problem both with conven-tional healthcare professionals (who may not be properlytrained in CAM procedure) or non-medically qualied CAMpractitioners (who may not have sufcient medical knowledgein anatomy, physiology, pathology, etc). A solid evidence base should also contain data on the cost of CAM. Many proponents intuitively feel that CAM has thepotential to save money for our healthcare systems in the longrun. Sadly this is, so far, not supported by convincing evidence.A recent systematic review of all economic evaluations of CAMshowed that investigations with flawed methodology tendedto suggest that the use of CAM saves money. However, themore rigorous studies implied that this is, in fact, not true andthat expenditure for CAM represents an add-on cost. 38 CONCLUSION CAM is an important topic not least because a large proportionof our patients turn towards it. There are many reasons toexplain this phenomenon; in part they represent a seriouscriticism of orthodox medicine. The evidence base for CAM isgrowing but in most areas it is insufcient for making soundrisk/benet assessments. It follows that further research isneeded to ll these all too obvious gaps and that the funds tocarry out this work have to be found. REFERENCES 1Jonas WB .
