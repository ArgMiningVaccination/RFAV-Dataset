Students with demonstrated fi nancial need will be given priority. Book Awards Students who have been awarded aid (i.e. Pell Grant, stud ent loans, scholarship) prior to registration will have financial aid awards credited to the st udent's account at the time of registra tion. If an overage exists after tuition and fees have been deducted from the student's financial aid award the student will receive a credit in the campus bookstore to use towards book purchases. Availability of Funds Remaining credit will be made availa ble in the campus and online bookstor e one week prior to the first day of classes. Students may charge against their Pell Grant award, scholarships, loans and other financial aid to help pay for books and supplies in the campus bookstore. Financial Aid credits are only availabl e in the Bookstore a week before classe s start and the first week of classes. Part Of Term Classes Student Financial Aid| 45 Books needed for part of term classes should be purc hased at the beginning of the semester when funds are available in the bookstore. Note: Students who complete the verificati on requirements after the Priority Deadl ine may not have aid available for book purchases at the time classes begin. In the event that this o ccurs, the student is responsible for all tuition, fees, and book purchases. Once the student's file is complete and ai d awarded the student may be eligible for a refund. Overaward and Disbursement Students with a credit on their account after all tuition, fees and books have been paid will receive a refund of their credit balance by the 28th day of the term. The first disbursement of Pell Grant refunds are made to students no later than the 28th day of the term and every 14th day thereafter. Should a Pell Grant recipient withdraw from all classes before the 60 percent (60%) time frame entitlemen t period, he or she will be required to pay back funds* not earned. *This amount cannot be provided prior to the student's withdrawal. Overaward and Indebtedness It is expected that every student will discharge any indebt edness to the college as quickly as possible. When at all possible, West Georgia Technical College (WGTC) will a ttempt to resolve the over-payment during the next term(s). If the over-payment is due to student error and cannot be resolved, WGTC must report the over-award to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). Stud ents who are in over-award status are ineligible for financial assistance at any post secondary college until th e over-payment is resolved and will be prohibited from attending classes. Students are required to repay the over-p ayment received even if it was due to school error. Most awarding errors are due to the dropping of cour ses, non-attendance or inaccurate information on the financial aid application. Federal Title IV Refund Policy West Georgia Technical College (WGTC) is required by federal statute to recalculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a leave of absence prior to completing sixty (60%) of a payment period or term. The federal Title IV financial aid programs must be recalculated in these situations. If a student leaves the institution prior to completing 60% of a payment period or term, eligibility for Title IV funds is recalculated. This recalculation is based on the percen tage of earned aid using the following Federal Return of Title IV funds formula. If a student earned less aid than what was disbursed, th e College would be required to return a portion of the funds and the student would be required to return a portion of the funds. Keep in mind that when Title IV funds are returned, the student borrower may owe a debit balance to the institution. If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to him/her, the institution would owe the student a post-withdrawal di sbursement which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal. The College must return the amount of Title IV funds for which it is responsible no later than 30 days after the date of the determination of the date of the student's withdrawal. Refunds are allocated in the following order: 1. Unsubsidized 46| West Georgia Technical College Student Catalog 2017-2018 2. Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans 3. Federal Pell Grant 4. Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grants for which a Return of funds is required Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress In accordance with federal financial aid regulations, financial aid recipients are required to make Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) towards completion of their educ ational goals in a program of study in order to receive financial aid. This SAP policy is separate from West Georgia Technical College's (WGTC) academic progress policies. Additionally, federal rules state that SAP standa rds must include a review of all periods of enrollment. The following requirements must be met in order to receiv e or continue to receive financial aid. A student must be enrolled in an eligible program of st udy that leads to a certificate, diploma, or an associate degree. In addition, there are three (3) SAP requirements that students need to meet or they may become ineligible to receive financial aid due to unsatisfa ctory academic progress. The three requirements are as follows: Quality \u2014 this is monitored by grade point average (GPA ). To maintain eligibility for financial aid, students must stay in good academic standing by maintaining a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA and must have at least a 2.0 grade point average at the end of each semester on the scheduled credit hours attempted. All periods of enrollm ent at WGTC are included when calculating GPA for SAP purposes. Grades for all attempts of repeated courses are includ ed in the GPA calculation. Learning support grades, transfer credit, exemption exam cred it, credit for previous experience, audited courses, W grades and articulated credit are exempt from the qualitative component. Quantity \u2014 this is monitored by evaluating the percent age of attempted credits in which passing grades are earned. The minimum satisfactory completion rate is 67 percent. The completion rate is calculated by dividing the cumulative number of credit hours the student has successfully comp leted by the cumulative number of credit hours the student has attempted. A ll periods of enrollment at WGTC are included. All attempts of repeated courses are included in the co mpletion rate. Learning S upport classes and transfers of credit from other institutions are counted as cr edit hours attempted and ea rned in the calculation. Exemption exam credit, credit for previous experience , audited courses, and articulated credit are NOT included. Grades which are considered successful comple tions for financial aid SAP purposes are: A, B, C, D, or A*, B*, C*, D* from learning support classes. Courses in which the student received grades of F*, F, W, WF or I are considered unsuccessful co mpletions for financial aid SAP purposes. Maximum Timeframe \u2014 the final component requires that stud ents complete their program of study within one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the required credits of the program. For example, if you are in a program of study that requires 80 credits to gradua te, you may receive funding for the first 120 credits attempted. All repeated units are included as attemp ted; therefore, each time a course is taken, the number of units will be included in the calculation of the 150 percent rule and academic progress. Transfer credit hours are also included in this calcul ation. Maximum timeframe resets for each major. SAP is monitored at the end of each semester. Students who do not meet progress requirements will be placed on financial aid warning and may become ineligible for financial aid after one (1) additional semester. Student Financial Aid| 47 Financial Aid Warning: Students who receive financial aid, but fail to maintain SAP, will be placed on Financial Aid Warning for one semester. Students will be notified in writing that they have been placed on Financial Aid Warning. Students on Financial Aid Warning may conti nue to receive financial aid during the probationary semester. It is highly recommended that students on Fi nancial Aid Warning meet with an academic advisor or student affairs counselor to discuss educational plans/requirements and over all institutional academic progress. Removal from Financial Aid Warning: At the end of a student's Warnin g semester, the student must have completed the required number of units and/or raised the GPA to the minimum standards for all courses attempted during that semester to return to good progre ss. If the student fails to achieve academic progress after one semester, the student will be pl aced on Unsatisfactory Progress. Unsatisfactory Progress: A student placed on Unsatisfactory Progress is no longer eligible to receive financial aid. A student placed on Unsatisfactory Progress will be no tified in writing that he or she has failed to make SAP. Reinstatement of Financial Aid: A student who has lost his/her financia l aid may be reinstated by registering for classes at his or her own expense (without financial aid funds) and fulfilling the requirements for Satisfactory Academic Progress. Appeal Procedures If a student becomes ineligible for financial aid due to extenuating circumstances, the student may appeal the decision.

Prior learning goes beyond experience, as a student must demonstrate that college-level learning has occurred in relation to the learning outcomes of a particular cour se for which credit is being requested. Credit will be awarded only for demonstrable college le vel learning, and not for experience. The burden of proof lies with the student to demonstrate through testing or appropriate documentation, such as transcripts and certificates, submitted to designated Co llege authorities, that the learning m eets specific learning objectives and standards set forth in course syllabi and programs approved by related accrediting bodies. Prior Learning may have been required for professional competence; is reasonably current (some lear ning is time sensitive); is comparable to courses offered in colleges or universities; implies a co nceptual (theoretical) and practical understanding of the course(s). Any credits awarded through PLA must be in accordance with the Standards of The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Co lleges (SACSCOC Standard 3.4.4) and policies and guidelines of the Technical College System of Georgia.

Student Affairs Support Services| 59 Drug Free Schools and Communities Act The Federal Drug Free Schools and Communities Act of 1990 contains Section 20, Drug Free Schools and Campuses, which was enacted to ensure that any institution of hi gher education that received funds under any federal program has adopted and implemented a program to prev ent the use of illicit drugs and abuse of alcohol by students. No student may engage in the unlawful manufactu re, possession, use or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol on the Technical College's proper ty or as part of any of its sponsore d activities. Such unlawful activity may be considered sufficient grounds for serious punitive action , including expulsion. Disciplinary sanctions for students convicted of a felony offense involving alcohol or th e manufacture, distribution, sale, possession or use of marijuana, controlled substances or other illegal or danger ous drugs shall be immediate suspension and denial of further state and/or federal funds from the date of convicti on. Specifically in the case of a drug related offense the student shall minimally be suspended fo r the remainder of the quarter and fo rfeit all academic credit for that period. WGTC shall notify the appropriate state/federal fundin g agency within 10 days afte r receiving notice of the conviction from the student or otherwise after receivin g the actual notice of conviction. Within 30 days of notification of conviction, the Technical College shall with respect to an y student so convicted: 1. Take additional appropriate action against such student up to and including expulsion as it deems necessary. 2. Provide such student with a description of any drug or alcohol counseling treatment, or rehabilitation or re-entry programs that are available for such purpose s by a federal, state or local health, law enforcement or other appropriate agency. WGTC is responsible for ensuring th e development and implementation of a drug free awareness program to inform students of the following: 1. The dangers of drug and alcohol abuse on the campus and elsewhere. 2. Any available drug and alcohol counselin g, rehabilitation and assistance programs. 3. Any penalties to be imposed upon students for drug and alcohol abuse violations occurring on the campus. 60| West Georgia Technical College Student Catalog 2017-2018 Academic Affairs Each student at West Georgia Technical College must be a responsible partner in the learning process and should observe all current published regulations and procedures re quired by the College and by the program in which he or she is enrolled. Published information may be found in the student catalog, student handbook, college website, or linked from individual course syllabi. A current publishe d regulation will not be waived nor will an exception be granted because a student pleads ignorance of the regulati on or asserts that he or she was not informed of a specific requirement by an advisor or by a College staff member. Students must become especially familiar with the of ferings and requirements of their individual majors or programs of study and the content of the semester schedu le of classes, which may contain notices of changes in academic regulations or procedures. West Georgia Te chnical College will make a reasonable effort to keep students advised of any such changes, and information on changes made by the College will be available in the Student Affairs Office. Requirements for programs of st udy can be found on the College webpage and in the student catalog. Students must be aware that it is their own responsibility to re main informed about current graduation requirements and should speak to an academic advisor for the specific completion requirements of their respective programs. A candidate for graduation is normally subject to the catalog requirements in effect at the time of initial enrollment. However, in consultation with his or her advisor, a student may elect to satisfy the graduation requirements specified in any of the catalogs in effect subs equent to the time of initial enrollment. Also, a student who is not enrolled for one or more co nsecutive semesters is subject to th e catalog graduation requirements in effect at the time of re-entry. Academic Advising System Students admitted to West Georgia Technical College are assigned to the Advising Center for academic advisement. The only exceptions will be Transient and Special Status Students who will be assigned to the Registrar for advisement assistance, high school students who are assigned to a High School Coordinator, and Commercial Truck Driving students who are assigned to program faculty. Once a student completes approximately 50 percent of ac ademic program progression and completes any needed Learning Support classes, the student will be reassigned to the appropriate faculty advisor for that program. Exceptions to faculty advisor reassignment: 1. Healthcare Science, Healthcare Professional, Heal thcare Management, and Heal thcare Assistant students will be assigned to the Advising Center until they change their program or are accepted into another degree or diploma healthcare program; 2. Technical Specialist students will remain under the ad vising services of the Student Advising Center until they transfer or change programs. Enrolled credit students may access Self Service Banner Web at any time to identify whether they are assigned to the Advising Center or have been tr ansferred to their program faculty advi sor. Status or program changes may involve advisor reassignment, so students making such changes should contact th e Office of Admissions. The role of all academic advisors is to assist students in the development of meaningful educational plans that are compatible with their life goals. The ultimate responsi bility for making informed de cisions about life goals and educational plans rests with the individual student. Howe ver, the academic advisor can assist by working with students to identify and assess altern atives and additional opportunities. Academic Affairs| 61 An academic advisor's responsibilitie s include helping students design a program of study, interpret catalog program information and degree completion requirements, and help students understand academic alternatives. Advisors also monitor academic progress and recommend appropriate resources to answer questions or solve problems related to academic and career matters. They are also valuable sources of information about College policies, procedures, resources, and pr ograms. Students should review academic program information available on the school website prior to visiting ad visors and are encouraged to contact advisors early in the semester prior to the registration period for academic counseling. Academic advisors may be reached via email, phone, advise ment kiosk, or in person. Walk-in visits to program Faculty Advisors should be during their posted office hours or to the Advisement Center during posted advisement hours. Advisement centers are available in designated areas on each campus including in the new Academic Resource Centers (ARC) located in the Murphy and Coweta campus libraries. Course Availability A listing of semester course offerings at West Georgia Technical College is available by accessing Self-Service Banner Web on the website. The College reserves the ri ght to cancel classes due to low enrollment or other reasons. A full refund is made for any class canceled by the College. Course Progression To meet academic requirements, students may not ma ke a grade of D in their program courses, including program-specific electives. (This policy excludes core courses, unless a grade of C or better is required as a prerequisite to other courses.) Students who make a D mu st repeat the course and obtain a final grade higher than D. The first grade will, however, still be record ed on the transcript. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 is required for graduation. To fulfill the academic requirements of all Health Sc iences programs, a minimum grade of C is required for progress from specified courses to more advanced course s. In addition, a minimum grade of 75 is required for academic course progression in both the Registered Nursing and Licensed Practical Nursing programs. Students unable to meet the academic requirements for continuation in any Health Sciences program will not be allowed to continue until the requirements are met. Upon completion of these requirements, the student will be allowed to continue when course sequence permits. Students with a se cond failure of the same occupational course or of any subsequent course in the same program will not be elig ible to progress in the program. Students with two academic failures in occupational courses will not be a llowed a third attempt. This applies to all occupational courses in the School of Health Sciences except for those occupational courses in the Health Information Technology, Fire Science, Health Care Science, Health Care Assistant, Healthcare Professional, Nurse Aide, and Healthcare Management programs. Course Numbering System Courses numbered 0-0999 are preparat ory courses and do not carry credit toward graduation. Courses numbered 1000 and above carry credit toward graduation. General education courses carrying a course number of 1100 and above (e.g., ENGL 1101) are taught in associ ate degree programs. The only exception is COLL 1090 which is calculated into overall GPA and is requi red for both diploma or degree level programs. Elective Courses Program elective courses may be inside or outside the program of study, ba sed on the list of approved electives provided in each program description. Progra m majors may include three types of electives: 62| West Georgia Technical College Student Catalog 2017-2018 1. Occupational/technically-related el ectives are those that are relative to the student's chosen academic major. These electives are generally satisfied by courses found in the student's academic major area or in a major related to the student's chosen field of study. 2. General core electives are selected from the general core course offerings available at the award level of the academic program in which the student is enrolle d. Degree general core electives must come from degree level academic courses. Diploma level genera l core must come from diploma level basic skills offerings. However, if a student's placement score in a particular diploma program meets the degree level, the student may substitute the higher level degree course for the lower level diploma course, depending on compatibility of the course competencies and with regi strar approval. For example, if a student's diploma level program requires ENGL 1010 but the student's plac ement score in English is at the degree level (or higher), the student may take the higher degree level ENGL 1101 Composition and Rhetoric course. Diploma level courses cannot be used as electives in degree programs with the exception of open electives specifically listed as \"XXXX xxxx\" electives. 3. General electives may be satisfied by either a te chnically-related occupational course or a general education course. When a general education course is used to satisfy this elective, it must be selected from offerings available at the award level of the academ ic program in which the student is enrolled. Degree general education electives must come from degree leve l general education course offerings. Diploma level basic skills electives must come from diploma level ba sic skills offerings. However, if a student's placement score in a particular diploma program meets the degr ee level, the student may substitute the higher level degree course for the lower level diploma course, depe nding on compatibility of the course competencies and with registrar approval (see example in paragraph above). Learning support courses cannot be used to satisfy any el ective requirement. Students should consult with their program advisors before registering for any elective course to ensure that the course selection will meet program graduation requirements. Grading System The following grade system is used to repo rt student progress in credit courses: Grade Nature of Work Grade Points A (90-100) Excellent 4 B (80-89) Good 3 C (70-79) Satisfactory 2 D (60-69) 1 F (Below 60) Failin g 0 WF Withdrew Failin g 0 I Incomplete Not Computed NG No Grade Not Computed AU Audit Not Computed EX Credit by Competency Exam Not Computed TR Transfer Credit Not Computed W Withdrew Not Computed AC Articulated Credit Not Computed Academic Affairs| 63 Learning support courses are graded on an A* through F* scale. The following learni ng support grades are not computed in a student's institutional GPA but do apply toward the Financial Aid Satisfactory Progress Policy. A* = 90-100 Not Computed = 00-59 Not Computed Grade Point Average (GPA) A grade point average (GPA) is calculated by (1) multiplying the credits for each eligible course by the grade points associated with the grade earned, (2) to taling the points earned for all eligible courses, and (3) dividing the total points by the total number of credits attempted in eligib le courses. Eligible course s include all courses numbered 1000 and above. Grades for courses numbered 0-0999 are not included in the calculation of Grade Point Average. I (Incomplete) The grade of I is given to students only in ex tenuating circumstances. It signifies that a student has not completed all required course work by the end of the semester. Student and instructor must request a grade of I before grades are posted. If the required make- up work is not completed by the end of the first three weeks of the following semester, the I will automatically beco me an F. If a student received a grade of I in a course which is a prerequisite to other courses, the student must complete the required make-up work to determine the final grade and eligibility to enroll in other courses. F (Failing) This grade signifies that a student has completed the term; however, the student did not academically meet full course requirements. This grade is calculated as a failing grade (\"F\") in the student's GPA and may affect academic status and financial aid. AU (Audit) By registering as an auditor, a student is pe rmitted to audit a course/program and attend classes without receiving credit. Students are not permitted to ch ange from audit to credit after the drop/add period or from credit to audit after the drop/add period at the be ginning of each semester. Students who audit a class must pay regular tuition and fees for enrollment in any course(s). W (Withdraw) This grade signifies that a student has offici ally withdrawn by the withdrawal date of the semester. In addition, a grade of W can be given to students with extenuati ng circumstances if withdrawing after the withdrawal date of the semester. WF (Withdraw Failing) This grade indicates that a student officia lly withdrew after the withdrawal date of the semester. The WF has zero quality points and is calculated in the grade point average (GPA). Transcripts and grade reports contain two grades for each occupational course. The firs t grade is the letter grade assigned for academic work and skill development in the co urse. The second grade reflects the work ethics of the student in the course. (See section on Work Ethics.) 64| West Georgia Technical College Student Catalog 2017-2018 Attendance Students are expected to attend each scheduled class. Ab sences and tardies will become a part of the student's record through the work ethics grade (detailed in the catalog section on Work Et hics Procedures). It is recognized that there may be times when a student will not be able to attend class. In such cases, it is the student's responsibility to make arrangem ents with the instructor concerning the availability and completion of making up work missed. All make-up work will be at the disc retion of the instructor, und er the guidelines of the work ethics policy and procedures and consistent with classroom procedures establis hed in the course syllabus. Students receiving financial aid (especially Pell, WIA, or VA ) should be aware that abse nces could jeopardize their financial aid funding and satisfactory ac ademic progress. Students may not receiv e financial aid funds if they do not meet the attendance requirements of the financial aid agency. A student will be dropped from a course in which th e number of his or her absences, whether excused or unexcused, exceeds 20 percent of the total number of course meetings in the semester unless prior approval is given for extenuating circumstances, ac cording to the following guidelines: Fall and Spring Semester Number of course meetings per week Will be dropped if absences exceed 1 3 2 6 3 9 4 12 5 15 Summer Semester Number of course meetings per week Will be dropped if absences exceed 1 2 2 4 3 6 4 7 5 9 The grade of withdraw failing ( WF) will be assigned after the withdrawal date of the semester. If there are extenuating circumstances, a grade of W can be given. The instructor's discre tion will be considered in the final decision for an exception. Health Sciences programs and all courses with a significan t virtual learning component have attendance guidelines specific to those methods of instructional delivery. These gu idelines will be detailed in in dividual course syllabi and in program handbooks in these program areas. Online Courses: Online students must complete an academ ically related activity ea ch week to be considered active. Simply logging into class is not considered active. Academically related activities include, but are not limited to, submitting an academic assignment; taking an exam, an interactive tutorial, or computer-assisted instruction; participating in an online discussion about academic matte rs. A student will be dropped from an online courses if his/her absences exceed 20 percent of the number of weeks allocated for the course (absences do not have to be consecutive). Academic Affairs| 65 Hybrid Courses: Absences in hybrid courses may not exceed 20 percent of scheduled on-campus classes or 20 percent of the total contact hours for the course. Work Ethics Procedures The Technical College System of Georgia and WGTC believe it is extremely important to identify, evaluate, and encourage good work habits as an integral part of the instructional program. Theref ore, a system to evaluate \"work ethics\" in each course has been developed. Work et hics grades (3, 2, 1, 0) ar e earned in each completed credit hour course and are included on the student's permanent record and transcript. Characteristics The following work ethics ch aracteristics are emphasized: 1. Attendance 6. Productivity 2. Characte r 7. Organizational Skills 3. Teamwork 8. Communication 4. Appearance 9. Coopera tion 5. Attitude 10. Respect Throughout the semester consistent emphasis is given to each of these characteristics or traits. Periodic presentation by each instructor is pr ovided through a brief lesson, exercise, or activity featuring the trait which may be introduced in classes or labs. Grading Work Ethics grading is performed \"by exception\" indicati ng that the majority of students receive a work ethics grade of 2 (meeting expectations). Instructors record a grad e for students who display ei ther poor work ethics or exceptional work ethics behaviors by adding to or subt racting points from the grading of the respective work ethics trait. Instructors must document work ethics performance of all students and provide a plan of improvement and a review date for those students who display poor work ethics. The follow-up review date provides an opportunity to re-evaluate performanc e before a final work ethics grade is assigned. There are two formal reports\u2014the Mid-Semester Report, a progress report given to those students who need an opportunity to improve, and the Final Report, a semester work ethics grade to be displayed on the student's academic record. Evaluation Process: 3 points = Exceeds expectations 2 points = Meets expectations 1 points = Needs improvement 0 points = Unacceptable NOTE: The work ethics credits do not count toward grad uation requirements or in calculating eligibility for financial aid but may affect employment opportunities. Excused Absences 66| West Georgia Technical College Student Catalog 2017-2018 No points are deducted from the attendance portion of the work ethics report if the student must be absent under any of the following conditions and follows the outlined procedures: 1. Jury duty (prior notification of instructor with written proof). 2. Death of immediate family member (mother, father, sister, brother, spouse, or child; notify instructor during the first day of absence with maximum of three days excused). 3. Court summons (prior notification of instructor with written proof). 4. Military duty (prior notification of instructor with written proof). 5. Job interview (prior approval of instructor and a job interview verification form to be signed by the employer\u2014may be obtained from the job placement specialist). 6. Doctor's official work/school release form (complete d and signed by attending physician and provided for the instructor the first day of return; a maximum of three days in a given semester will be excused for medical reasons, but only with proper documentation). NOTE: Students are expected to follow individual inst ructors' make-up policies, and the excused absences outlined above are only considered wh en assessing your attendance grade fo r work ethics. The absences are still counted as part of the total allowable 20% of course ab sences. Absences above 20% of the total number of course meetings will result in the student's withdrawal from th e course unless prior approval is given for extenuating circumstances. (See individual course syllabi for attendance guidelines for Health Sciences programs and for online or hybrid courses.) Academic Honors The College recognizes the following academic ho nors for students enrolled in credit programs: Honor Graduate - These graduation honors are awarded based on the cumulative grade point average, in the following categories: Highest honors (3.9-4.0 GPA), Hi gh Honors (3.7-3.89 GPA), and Honors (3.5-3.69 GPA). President's List - Students achieving a 4.0 grade point average for the semester. Dean's List - Students achieving a grade poin t average of 3.5 to 3.99 for the semester. Names of qualifying students are acknowledged on the College website. Satisfactory Academic Progress Students are considered to be in good standing and mak ing satisfactory academic progress if they maintain a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher. A cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher is required for graduation. This designation appears on the semester grade report and the official tr anscript. Students who earn a GPA of less than 2.0 for a semester are placed on academic probation. Additional information about SAP is included in the Financial Aid section of the catalog and in the student handbook, both available on the college website and also linked from each course syllabus. Additional information about Academic Probation and Suspension is included in the Registrar Services section of the catalog. NOTE: Students enrolled in the Health Services programs should refer to the specific academic requirements for these programs. Academic Affairs| 67 NOTE: Health Sciences students who fail to earn a prog ram defined satisfactory grade in any course required for their selected program of study may repeat a course on e time only. Students with a second failure of the same occupational course or of any subsequent course in th e same program will not be eligible to progress in the program. Students with two academic failures in occupational courses will no t be allowed a third attempt. This applies to all occupational courses in the School of Heal th Sciences except for those occupational courses in the Health Information Technology, Fire Science, Health Care Science, Health Care Assistan t, Healthcare Professional, Nurse Aide, and Healthcare Management programs. (See Course Progression) Academic Integrity West Georgia Technical College encourages an academic culture of honesty and personal integrity among its faculty, staff, and student body. Academic integrity is defined by the Center for Academic Integrity as \"a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five f undamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.\" In this context, academic honesty mean s performing all academic work without plagiarizing, cheating, lying, tampering, stealing, re ceiving assistance from any other person or using any source of information that is not common knowledge (unless au thorized by the instructor). The work of another person represented as one's own is dishonest and does not fairly measure the competence, knowledge, and achievement of the individual. Academic dishonesty is contrary to the st andards, ethics, and goals of higher education and is unacceptable in the technical college community. West Georgia Technical College promotes and expects each member of the College to conduct himself or herself wi th professional behavior and intellectual integrity. Prohibited behaviors include, but are not limited to, the following: Plagiarizing any assignment. \"Plagiarism\" means us ing someone else's ideas or words without using quotation marks and/or giving cred it by citation of source(s). Copying/submitting an other person's work. Unauthorized taking of someone else's work. Using unauthorized notes or equipment (including programmable calculators) during an examination. Stealing an examination or using a stolen examination. Allowing another student to have access to your work, thereby enabling that student to represent the work as his or her own. Having someone else take an assessment in your place. Fabricating information such as data for a lab report. Falsifying a patient's medical record or a student's clinical record. Using another person's personal electronic file or copying another student's computer program. Depending on the severity of the situat ion, any student found to be in violation of any of the above prohibitions will be subject to a range of disciplinary actions, which may include the following: A zero for the assignment An F for the course Dismissal from the program Dismissal from the College In addition, copyrighted material may not be knowingly co pied or included in studen t submitted material or for personal benefit in violation of copyright laws or re gulations without the written consent of the copyright owner(s) or a duly authorized agent(s). Academic Integr ity policies including violations and permitted usage of copyrighted materials are outlined in the Student Code of Conduct available to studen ts in the Student Handbook. 68| West Georgia Technical College Student Catalog 2017-2018 The Student Code of Conduct (see the Student Handbook) is enforced for traditional, hybrid, web-enhanced, and online classes. Academic Overload An acceptable course load will vary depending upon the academic program and courses taken. Please contact your advisor to make an informed decision about a reasonab le course load when working full- or part-time. Students wishing to register for more than 18 credit hour s in any semester must obtain prior approval from the Dean of the School in which the student's program is in cluded. In general, a student must have been at West Georgia Technical College for at least two semesters and ha ve achieved an overall GPA of at least 2.5 before an overload will be approved. Online Learning Types of Courses The following terms describe the delivery methods of on line courses offered at West Georgia Technical College: Online \u2014A course in which all instruction occurs onlin e and testing may occur online or in a proctored environment. Hybrid \u2014 A course in which 25-50 percent of the learni ng activities are conducted online. Traditional class meeting times will vary with in these guidelines, depending on course content and instructor discretion. Meeting times will be predetermined and specified in the se mester class schedule. Web-enhanced \u2014 A traditional classroom course that uses the Internet as a component of the course. That component supports classroom instruction and may require students to use the internet in order to interact with one another and the in structor, do research, complete an d/or submit assignments, or take tests. Requirements The content, assessments, and student learning outcomes of online courses ar e of the same content, instructional quality and rigor as those of hybrid or web-enhanced cour ses. The primary difference is that online courses offer students an alternative form of course delivery that is mo re flexible and convenient than hybrid or web-enhanced courses. As a trade-off, however, on line courses require a greater time comm itment than hybrid or web-enhanced courses. Students who take online courses need strong sk ills in studying, time management, Internet navigation, and reading comprehension to be successful. Individual courses may require additional specific skills, such as proficiency in word processing. Following instructions, wo rking independently, and subm itting assignments by due dates are an important part of online learning. Students must have frequent access to a computer (preferably at home) and a reliable Internet provider as some providers are not compatible with the online platform. (For more information on appropriate providers and online re quirements, see our Online Learning web page.) It is not recommended for students in provisional status to register for online courses. Learning support and online courses are both demanding, and trying to do both decreases a student's chance of academic success. Students enrolled in the ENGL 0998 - Integrated Reading an d Writing learning support course cannot register for online courses. Students who failed or withdrew from a sp ecific course or provisional students who fail to meet minimum assessed proficiency requirements for a course will not be allowed to take that course online. Academic Affairs| 69 WGTC supports the choice of students to take online course s from the institution of th eir choice and participates as a National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA) approved institution. The State Authorization Reciprocity Agreem ent (SARA) is an agreement among its member states, districts and U.S. territories that establishes comparable na tional standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance-education courses and programs. It is intended to make it easier for stud ents to take online courses offered by postsecondary institutions in a st ate other than the one where they reside. Library Services The Library serves as a central location for many needed college-wide academic resources. A full service library is located on each campus (Carroll, Coweta, Douglas, LaGran ge and Murphy) to support th e curricular, professional, and personal development needs of the WGTC academ ic community. In addition, a resource and program designated library is located in the Central Education Ce nter (CEC) with material to support programs offered on the CEC campus. The library staff works closely with the fa culty, administration, and students to acquire and make accessible a well-balanced collection, in a variety of for mats, to support the college's instructional programs and adult learning center. The collection at each site will consist of books, period icals, newspapers, videos, audio cassettes, software, and other multimedia and electronic refere nce resources (respective of curricula and service needs). A daily courier service exists allowing for timely exchange of materials be tween sites. Each site houses a computer lab, offering software applications which are closely aligned to colleg e programs. Collectively WGTC libraries share a vision of providing a leading model of the \"virtual\" library. The commitment to open access for resources, services and information needs is met by combining on-site collections of current materials in print and electronic form (Galileo) along with remote access to content and servic es of the worldwide library and information resources. West Georgia Technical College acquires current, authoritat ive, and relevant materials and journals that support student learning outcomes for all instructional areas and academic departments at the degree, diploma, and certificate level. Emphasis is also placed on acquiring mat erials and providing services to ensure availability of adequate resources that directly support the general ed ucation programs. In acquiring new materials, the Library includes the continuing education and personal enrichment needs and interests of student, faculty, staff, and public users. Libraries located on the Murphy and Coweta campuses ha ve been redesigned to provide a centralized and open learning area allowing easier access to academic and s upport services for students. The newly opened Academic Resource Centers (ARC), located in each of these lib raries provides new meetin g, lab, and supplemental instructional areas with up-to-date technology for individu al and group student usage. In addition the advisement centers have been relocated to these locations to provid e easy access for student academic progression planning. Future ARC locations are in consider ation for the other 3 major campuses. Academic Support Services West Georgia Technical College is committed to enhancin g academic performance for all students. Resources are available at all campuses to stimulate academic achievement and include learning resource labs, tutoring, academic workshops, on-line tutorials, academic coaching and th e Mentor Connection program. These services are free for all WGTC students. The Student Academic Success website at http://www.westgatech.edu/Academics/S SS/Student_Success.htm provides curre nt information and a listing of available resources. For more information, plea se contact Academic Support at 706.756.4678 or wgtcsuccess@westgatech.edu. The follow ing resources for academic support are offered to all students studying in credit program areas: 70| West Georgia Technical College Student Catalog 2017-2018 First Class Student Seminar (COLL 1090) is a three-credit hour course designed to introduce and connect new students to WGTC allowing them to gain an awaren ess of various campus resources available. Emphasis is placed on acquiring the academic skills necessary to achiev e educational and career goals. The course will focus on matching student needs with WGTC re sources and the development of colle ge level learning. Knowledge is acquired by providing academic strategies and by demonstr ation of action based outcomes that will help students develop skills to be successfu l in college and in life.
