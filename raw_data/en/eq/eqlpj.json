''Every two months at least ten or twelve women attend the groups and there are probably twice as many who don't go to groups,\" says Ellie. The numbers of gay men attending similar workshops are increasing too. Debbie Hourigan and Lea Militello, co-mothers of ten-week-old Ryan, are amazed that ''everywhere we go we are surrounded by women who want to have children.\" Members of a lesbian and gay parents support group In San Francisco are being bombarded by news reporters and doctoral candidates researching their theses. One lesbian and gay monthly has twelve listings for lesbian and gay parenting workshops and support groups \u2014 twice as many listings as the section entitled \" professional groups.\" It seems that theGoddess of fertility has set up campaign headquarters In the lesbian and gay community. But the lesbian and gay lifestyle offers freeedom from the demands of parenthood \u2014 provided one doesn't bring along children from former heterosexual alliances. Why are so many lesbians and gay men choosing to take on the role of parent? \" I was always Into kids, my nieces and nephews, doing baby\u00ad sitting,\" says Rod Schmittou, a Guemeville hairdresser and father of 2 '/ 2-year-old Eddy. \" I helped Ian (his former loverjralse his two daughters.

August 15, to protest the lack of AIDS funding in the new county budget. I was one of them. When we approached the dais where strike settlement, and noting the cuts in the supervisors were seated we tossed red confetti \" blood\" on their hands, their desks and everything in sight. W earing skeleton masks and dressed in black we \" died\" right in front o f the rap id ly departing supervisors, invoking them and their budget as the cause of o u r demise. Although Sonoma County has the second highest per capita rale o f A ID S in C alifornia, the county budget for '89-'90 contains no new money for A ID S services. The Sonoma County Commission on A ID S , which served as an advisory body to the county, has lost its paid staff. The Sonoma County A ID S Foundation, a fundraising agen\u00ad cy, is w ithout a director. And the S250.000 request from Face to Face, the county's m ajor direct care agency fo r people w ith A ID S and A R C . has been to tally ignored. Since the Board o f Supervisors has decided to take a \" head in the sand\" approach to the growing A ID S epidemic AC T-U P decided to put the m atter before the public with a little guerilla theater. A iid the public has responded. D uring the 6 'h hours we oc\u00ad cupied the Supervisors' chambers. County employees, who have recently ended a labor strike, stopped by to offer their support. We were also visited by a representative from the newly formed Sonoma County Industrial U nion. Even our arresting officers displayed a real understanding o f the situation. A fte r seeing the dism al contract the County employees received in theirfunding for human services, the sheriffs are concerned about their own contract which comes up for negotiation in two months. We offered to w alk their picket line w ith them if they go on strike. Throughout the m orning the action remained low key. Protestors sat at the Supervisors' desks proclaim ing resolu\u00ad tions and offering funding to an au\u00ad dience o f empty chairs. We went back and forth to the bathrooms down the h all and our supporters were allowed to bring us food. A t about l:(X) p.m ., when four dem onstrators le ft the chambers together, the sheriffs locked the doors from the outside. The four banged on the door, another protestor let them in, and she was im m ediately arrested. We surrounded her. Eventually the officers threatened to arrest us if we didn't leave. We \" died\" once again in front of the Supervisors' desks and were carted off to ja il. On September 11, we w ill be arraign\u00ad ed on four charges, including failure to leave the scene o f a \" rio t\" and wearing a mask in the commission of a crime. W hile AC T-U P was occupying the chambers, two disabled supporters in wheelchairs chained themselves to the front doors o f the Adm inistration Building. One o f them, Jan Beck, has taken up a vig il in front o f the building. As a visible symbol o f the on-going struggle against A ID S he has received considerable support from the com\u00ad m unity and a lo t o f publicity from the news media.S.F.

According to this parade's media coordinator, A lle n W hite, \" It really is a non-issue at this point.\" \" We brought the measure up at the meeting, everyone looked around at each other, and not a single hand rose in favor. Then we moved on to something else.\" W hite cited San Francisco's pre\u00ad eminence as \" the first\" and \" the big\u00ad gest\" gay parade in the world as a key reason not to move the dates. He hinted that L A 's m otivation could possibly be economical, since \" you have to pay to get into their parade. Ours is free.

It was the \" Ixtttom line\" reason that they put forth the proposal. He labeled it \" unfortunate\" that they did not have representation at the recent SF meeting to lobby for their cause. However, the L A organization did place a full-page ad in a San Francisco gay newspaper recently, asking readers to support separate dates and asking the general membership o f the SF Parade Committee to reverse their decision. Those chances are in doubt, as W hite repeated. \" It really is a dead issue at this p oint.\" Christopher Street West has yet to form ulate a response and claims no \" form al\" reply came from San Fran\u00ad cisco, aside from a phone call.

Because o f this, and representing a m a\u00ad jo r policy shift in the perceptions o f the A ID S epidemic, on August 19, A ID S Project Los Angeles (A P L A ) and the New York-based Gay Men's Health Crisis (G M H C ) joined the San F ra n \u00adcisco A ID S Foundation endorsement (from the beginning of this year) and flatly stated; \" a ll those in risk groups for being possibly exposed to the A ID S virus, should vo lu n tarily, im m ediately, and anonym ously, be tested.\" U n til recently, gay men have greatly resisted taking the antibody test (E L IS A or Western Blot) for fear o f discrim in\u00ad ation, apathy and fatalism about the disease, o r the belief there wasn't anything anyone could do about it anyway.

A MESSAGE FROM THE MULTICULTURAL TRAINING RESOURCE CENTER FUNOED BY THE S F DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, AIDS OFFICEquantitative measurement o f the im \u00ad mune system which indicates its ability to resist disease. \" T 4 \" is a white blood cell subgroup o f lymphocytes, called T4-he!per cells. These cells help iden\u00ad tify invading pathogens, \" ta g \" them, and alert the body to begin producing increased antibody \" k ille rs \" to launch an attack. H IV kills off the T 4 cells and ends up storing itself in the macrophage u n til later release. T4 is measured in a number per cubic m illim eter o f blood, and the range for a healthy individual varies between 800 and 1.200. Although it is common for anyone exposed to immune com\u00ad prom ising factors\u2014 sunlight, stress, c ig a re tte s, u ltra v io le t ra d ia tio n , alcohol, to name a few\u2014to experience a tem porary slight lowering o f their counts, w ith HIV-infected persons, the level drops dram atically, and stays in a compromised range. Although experts' feelings vary on what actual level con\u00ad stitutes \" compromised.\" most agree around 400 T4 cells fits this definition. It has been ob.served for some tim e that counts in the 200 to 400 range are typ ic ally shown in people w ith AR C , and opportunistic infections usually oc\u00ad cur w ith counts below 200. In fact, one of the leading indications fo r aero.soliz- ed pentamidine treatments to prevent coming down with the most common A ID S - d is e a s e \u2014 P n e u m o c y s tis pneum onia\u2014is a count below 200, Anyw ay, A Z T works by interfering w ith the ab ility of the H IV to replicate itself. A fte r it makes genetic copies of itself, it creates \" bud cells\" on the outer protein layer o f the macrophage, and dozens o r hundreds break o ff to k ill other T 4 cells or infect other remaining macrophages. A Z T inhibits the uptake o f an essential enzyme needed for this process to take off, and therefore the cells remain infected, but lim ited in their a b ility to overwhelm the immune system. Although a ll participants showed im \u00ad provement, slowing o f the HlV-disease spectrum, the most dram atic results in the study were those in the group with less than 500 T4 cells. N ine percent developed A ID S who were taking the placebo during the two-year tria l; only roughly half of that (4 percent) went on to develop A ID S who were taking AZT. \"These studies provide irrefutable evidence of the success o f early detec tion aind early treatm ent,\" said D r. An thony Fauci, director of A ID S research at the National Institutes o f Health. Since 0 .1 .'s (opportunistic infections) do not appear with those having greater than counts of 500, a study portion is continuing that w ill help determine if A Z T w ill prevent any O .I.'s at all. Unrelated to this particular report\u2014 but bearing close scrutiny and gaining wider acceptance\u2014is the possibility o f A Z T preventing the H IV from gaining stronghold in the body by immediately adm inistering the drug following known exposure. The study also found (hat practically everyone can tolerate taking the drug when their immune system is intact. None in that group had to drop out because o f any AZT-induced anemia This is in contrast to w idely published reports o f up to 50 percent o f those on A Z T having to stop, secondary to tox icity problems. Evidence has shown those who have an intolerance to A Z T have also had a previous, or existing 0 .1 ., or have allowed their T4 cell counts to drop to precariously low levels. As far as the only other reported side effect: only 3 percent o f the particpants reported any nausea\u2014 and there were no statistical difference o f side effects between those taking the higher versus lower doses. \u00ab \u00a9 1989 Pardi Medical FeaturesPOLITICS Tales From The Closet by Michael Colhmno ________________ T 0 sooner did I say to myself that I would never write another word about Vaughn Walker, when his I specter arose to haunt me one more time. For thoseI ^ who hadn't heard. Walker, who represented the U.S. I Olympic Q ub against the Gay Games and placed the lien on the dying Tom Waddell's house, lost his bid to become Sen. Wilson's and President Bush's nominee to the U.S. District Court recently. When the Sentinel ran a story on Walker, allegations arose concerning the possibility of his being I a closeted homosexual who was doing damage to the gay community while concealing his true identity. Walker refused comment on the allegations, but while compiling the story, we at the Sentinel had to deal with the ethical question of when it is I appropriate to discuss a person's sexuality W e began w ith o ur basic editorial belief that everyone has a right to privacy, a belief that we have defended from H IV testing to gay c ivil rights. However, W alker's case was unique in that a) he is a public figure b) the case in dispute dealt directly w ith hom osexuali\u00ad ty and c) the issue had already been raised numerous times by people in the gay community who opposed his nom ination. W e also felt it would be fa ir to raise the issue if we let Vaughn W alker respond to the allegations, which he denied. The question also has great historical precedence, though it has not always been raised at the most appropriate times. The most famous, and h o rrify \u00ad ing. is the case o f Sen. Joseph M cC ar\u00ad thy and Roy Cohn, who terrorized v ir\u00ad tu a lly everyone who was left of center during the famous M cC arthy hearings in the 1950's. They were most famous for revealing alleged communists, but our well-edited high school textbooks often failed to m ention that they reigned over the most sickening \" wrecking b a ll\" attacks on closet doors in memory. Even if they found nobody behind that closet door, they frequently I destroyed people's careers and drove many to suicide. Numerous biographies insinuate that the never-married M c\u00ad C arthy may have been a homosexual but fa il to substantiate the claim . Cohn was long known to be gay, but was so feared that no one w ould dare reveal his sexuality publicly fo r fear o f retrib u \u00ad tion. When Cohn died o f A ID S , two biographies sprung onto bookshelves v ivid ly describing his flam boyant private life. Others have also done damage from the closet. C IA mega-Director J. Edgar Hoover was notorious for his files on his enemies' homosexual proclivity and used them to damage many people dur\u00ad ing his tenure, though he was almost certainly homosexual himself. In fact Hoover left his estate to his life-long \" travelling companion\" when he died. Congressman Bob Bauman led the 1 charge against gay rights from two places. Congress, and as head o f the p o w erful A m e ric a n C o nservative U nion, before being caught with a D.C. hustler. Lest we forget the infamous Jini Bakker, who denounced homosexuals from the pulpit on a weekly basis before we discovered that staff members were providing him w ith his weekly diet o f beefy boys. W hat is often lost to the general public in a ll o f this is that there is an issue o f honesty, not a referendum on gayness. M iddle Am erica looks at the Baumans and Bakkers and forms their opinions on homosexuals based on these ingrates. Meanwhile, wonder\u00ad ful gay public figures like Rep. Barney Frank, Cuomo aide V irg in ia Apuzzo. and lobbyist Jeff Levy go virtu a lly un\u00ad noticed by the public.So, where does all this lead me? To the domestic partners battle in San Francisco, that's where. Judge Ira Brown has refused to stop the November referendum on domestic partners. Two lesbians, C indy Bologna and Sydney Erskine, filed papers claim \u00ad ing the referendum was technically flawed and that people were misled into signing the petitions. W e ll, Judge Brown has long been the target o f peo\u00ad ple who claim that he is another Vaughn W alker and that he has a history o f anti-gay rulings from the bench. Straight lawyers can be heard jokin g about his \"cache of pretty boys\" in courthouse halls and gay activists grum ble about his \" inquisition from the closet.\" Stay tuned, we'll be talking to both sides on this one, too!

The U.S. Senate's leading anti\u00ad woman. anti-gay. anti-black, anti- everything-but-tobacco-industry lever pusher. Jesse Helms, has been given a virtu a l free trip back to the Senate as his only real opposition decided against running. Former Gov. James Hunt, who lost to Helms in a bitter race in 1984. said he was not interested in a race that \" emphasizes negative ads and character attacks.\" H unt also has two ailing parents and referred to his responsibilities to his wife, children, and grandchildren in rationalizing his decision. H unt was pressured from virtu a lly every prominent Democrat to run, from Q iairm an Ron Brown to M ajo rity Leader George M itchell.

I think that our political power, as well as our political opportunities, are subjects about which the m ajority of the gay and lesbian com m unity is woefully ignorant. For this reason, and sim ply because I find the issue fascinating. I im m ediately turned to Page 8. The article disappointed me. This piece \u2014 written. I'm sure, with the best intentions \u2014 m isinform ed instead o f educating. Fo r example, author Michael Coibnm o w rote,\" Harvey M ilk etched his way into history when he was elected as the first openly gay elected official in the country in I9 ''\"'.\" Harvey M ilk most certainly has a place in history, but not as the first \u2014 or even the second \u2014 openly gay elected official in the country. He was preceded by such politicians as Elaine Noble, who ran as an open lesbian and was elected to the Massachusetts House in 1974. A llan Spear, who was first elected to the M nnesota Senate in 1972, came out publicly in I9'74. and won his next election. Let's not deny these courageous people rAe//- place in history. Further. Colbruno wrote. \" In Laguna Beach, we find the N ation's only openly gay m ayor. Richard Gen\u00ad try .\" A t least two other American gay men. Richard Hey man o f Key West. Florida, and Gerald \" Gene\" U lrich o f Bunceton. M issouri, hold the office of m ayor \u2014 and U lrich is serving his fifth two-year term . These men have worked too hard to have their existence casually dismissed. These are only the most glaring in \u00ad accuracies in an article that contained m any\u2014such as calling Virg inia Apuzzo the New Y o rk governor's liaison to the gay and lesbian com\u00ad m unity. even though the paper came out several weeks after Apuzzo ceased her voluntary duties as liaison after a full-time paid liaison joined the gover\u00ad nor's staff. It is unfortunate that you could not present a more accurate picture when you took up such an im portant and interesting topic. I hope that informa tion in future issues o f [\\k Sentinel w ill be more reliable. Looking forward to your next issue. Masha (lessenDemeaning And Undemocratic T o the Editor; The legislation proposed by homophobic Republican right-winger Jesse Helms to bar the N ational E n \u00ad dowment for the A rts from m aking grants to organizations that support artw ork found offensive by some, is not only demeaning but undemocratic. W ho appointed homophobe Helm s the \" father\" o f us all? His pater\u00ad nalistic behavior suggests that he. and he alone, knows what is appropriate for us to see. No one was forced to see the M applethorpe o r Serrano ex\u00ad hibits. but those who chose to do so should be free to make their own judgments. Tampering w ith the autonom y o f the N E A w ill accelerate the censorship o f works of art which are considered offensive by to talitarian individuals and groups who have taken it upon themselves to make decisions for the rest o f us. It is further tam pering w ith the First Amendment. In a free society such as ours, it is to tally inappropriate for adults to be told what they can see. read o r say as long as such activity does not infringe on the freedom o r safety o f others. W ill the free men and women in C on\u00ad gress please stand up and say so? Roger LeM essurier Nobel Wasn't First To the E ditor: In response to Jessea N R Green- man's letter, E laine Nobel was not the first openly gay elected official in this country. M s. Nobel was elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature in November 1974. She is proceeded to an elected office by Kathy Kozachenko, who, as an out lesbian, was elected to the Ann A rb o r, M ichigan city council in A p ril 1974. As a resident o f Ann A rb o r at that tim e, I can attest to this fact and to the celebration that ensued in the les- bian/gay comm unity at the tim e of this milestone. However, I suggest readers refer to Leigh W . Rutledge's The Gay Book o f Lists for verifica\u00ad tion o f this fact. K arla RossiGay Games III Rip-Off To the Editor: As a Team SF sports co-chair, I just today received the G ay Games I I I registration m aterials for wrestling, and felt it neces.sary to comment on the fees. If G ay Games I II is going to be a succes.s. it w ill be because o f an even greater participation o f athletes. Yet it is hard to deny that money is going to be the deciding factor for too many young less aflluenl athletes who would want to participate. Being an athlete requires a lot of sacrifice, and an investment of not only tim e and sweat, but also money. The organized clubs o f many large cities can offset some o f these ex\u00ad penses for their members, but what o f the others who live outside the urban areas? A typical athlete has equip\u00ad ment. club dues, travel, gym member\u00ad ship. and medical expenses to deal with. Couple w ith this the expense of transportation, lodging, food, and mis.sing work for a week while par\u00ad ticipating in G ay Games 111. it is ob\u00ad vious that very m any athletes (especially students) w ill not be able to afford it. The Gay Games were founded BY the athletes FO R the athletes. They are not an excuse for a commercial venture, a political statement, a vaca\u00ad tion package, a new video, a music festival or media event. 1 therefore take issue with Vancouver over these high fees. If they really want to en\u00ad courage greater participation, then these fees should be token and nom inal. If Vancouver cannot support the cost of the event, then it should be scaled down. A fte r a ll. whose event is it anyway? The fans get to see the show for free, w hile the athletes pay fo r the privilege of performing???? The registration fee structure goes something like this: $J6 before 1/90. $54 after 1/90. $10 penalty for E A C H squad change. This does not include the possible individual membership fee (about $25) required by the respective Canadian sanctioning organization. M y experience o f winning medals at both previous G ay Games, and my life as com petitor, manager, and coach over these many years entitles me to more than just a mere opinion on the subject. It would be a tragedy for Gay Games I I I participation to suffer. Gene DermodvRustler Ray To the Editor: On behalf of o ur organization.

John Fry Prcsklcnl Rawhide II Rustlers \" Golden Broom\" Trashed To the Editor: I am really pis.sed off: at a group o f self appointed people, presumably gay. called the \" Golden Broom \" who self directingly go around the Castro on Sunday mornings tearing down a ll posters that have been put up. This past Saturday. August 5 . 1 opened an exhibit o f my artw ork \" The Sensuous and Erotic M ale\" to the public at my studio and private gallery, at 442 Sanchez Street. SF. To advertise this event to the public I had a hundred flyers printed. I went around Saturday m orning and placed them where I felt they could be seen to best advantage in the Castro. This m orning. Sunday August 6. when I walked through the Castro they had A L L . every one o f them, disappeared. They had a ll been pulled down by this group. I as much as anyone appreciate their cleaning up litte r IN T H E STREETS that, if left uncleaned would make our comm unity unsiehtivto everyone. I do not consider posters appropriately mounted litte r. I con\u00ad sider their rem oving my poster, or any poster unwarranted, unneeded censorship. Broadsides, posters and leafleting are an Am erican tradition and custom as old as the country itself. M any o f the events that are posted, as mine was. are weekend events. Tearing down the posters on Sunday morning deprives those posting of ac\u00ad cess to their intended public inform a\u00ad tion concerning their event for one of the most im portant days o f the weekend. As a result o f their actions no one who happened to .be walking in the Castro this past Sunday could be aware o f m y exhibit unless they hap\u00ad pened to have read o f it in one o f the newspapers events sections. I would like an apology from this group for destroying m y posters and a change or discontinuing of their prac\u00ad tice of removing postings of events that the public has a right to be in \u00ad formed of.

He has earned it and his proposal merits H. ^ The deal is a 'sm art' one, to use the mayor's own words, and the mayor has run a correspondingly smart ' campaign. Agnos has gone straight to the heart with an obviously sincere appeal to all San Franciscans. His message is that this is a city with room for all interests that we ought to be | able to vote for one another on matters that may or may not | appeal to certain segments of the city. Although it is our opinion that the clau se the M ayor won, which makes the developer pay these costs above $10 m illio n. The city w ill also continue to own the land, and at the end o f 40 years the city w ill own the ballpark as well. The new site is a better choice than the location proposed to voters in 1987. It 's not close to the Potrero H ill neighborhood, it's situated far better to control the wind and its c h ill compared to Candlestick, and it is next to the new M U N I line stop being planned for the new Embarcadero Boulevard. M ayor Agnos' plan follows his transit-first policy. Candlestick, which has no service ex\u00ad cept buses and cars, has about 10 per\u00ad cent mass transit use. The Oakland C ol\u00ad iseum. near a B A R T station, has 25 percent mass transit use. W hile M ayor Agnos' plan conservatively estimates that a (Thina Basin b allpark would have 20 percent mass transit use, we believe it would more nearly reach 40 percent. That figure would be more in line with W rigley Field in CTiicago and Fenway Park in Boston. The new stadium w ill be served by M U N I with cars running every four minutes as well as Cal-train service for South Bay com m uters with the possibility of ferry boat service being add\u00ad ed. . Parking may be eased somewhat since it w ill be easier for those working downtown to leave their cars there andB allp ark proposition goes beyond special interest groups and is good for a ll interests in San Francisco, gay and straight alike, we agree with the m ayor's philosophy. The Sentinel is proud to endorse M ayor Agnos' ballpark and jo in in sup\u00ad porting his across-the-city campaign. W h ile a num ber o f cities across the country have paid out tens of m illions of bonus dollars to attract o r keep cur\u00ad rent m ajor league teams, S.F. Giants owner Bob Lurie and M ayor Agnos have instead worked together to develop a San Francisco-style solution w ithout over-burdening the taxpayers. Rather than bonus dollars and a city gift o f a new stadium to the Giants, the two San Franciscans have worked out a business-like proposition allowing a private developer to build a dynamic spectator-oriented ballpark w ith the city as an investor. According to the terms worked out by M ayor Agnos, the city w ill begin in 1995 to make a $1 m illio n a year loan for 10 years, which w ill be repaid at 7.5 percent interest. The city also w ill begin in 1995 to in \u00ad vest $2 m illio n a year fo r ten years in return for 20 percent o f the net ballpark p ro fits\u2014 an estimated $80 m illio n return for the $20 m illio n investment. The city also is protected from con\u00ad struction cost overruns with an additionaltake mass tra n s it to the new b a llp a rk\u2014 something they can't do at Candlestick. In any event, a new garage and other new parking being planned for Mission Bay and other areas means that the (Tiina Basin ballpark w ill have as much parking as Clandlistick does now. A ll o f this w ill be taking place in a new neighborhood far better planned to handle ballpark crowds than H unter's Point-Bayview, which bears the brunt o f bad C andlestick tra ffic pat\u00ad terns\u2014 and endures the neglect o f some self-proclaimed planning activists who apparently feel bad traffic in a predom inantly black neighborhood isn't as serious as lower traffic levels near apartments renting for $1,000 a month and up. M ayor Agnos has proven in the past that he knows how to ask tough ques\u00ad tions fo r those who want to believe there are easy answers\u2014 whether the issue was anti-gay discrim ination, o r facing a budget deficit. He used that s kill in questioning whether the elements really fit San Francisco for a new ballpark, and the answer he's provided is one that meets the tough tests. M any lesbians and gay men wiD vote for a new ballpark simply because they are Giants fans and love sports. (Xhers w ill vote in favor because the lesbian and gay community has always sup\u00ad ported programs it believes to be good for the entire c ity\u2014we were among the strongest precincts voting for both school and lib ra ry bonds last year. A s a sign o f the voting m aturity o f o ur comm unity we are proud to make note that our most viable business organization, the G G B A , Golden Gate Business Association, has recently en\u00ad dorsed not only the Domestic Partners Porposition 'S' but also the m ayor's C hina Basin Proposition *P'. W e think that the M ayor has hit on a theme for this campaign that has im \u00ad portance for us beyond just this one election. M ayor Agnos has chosen a positive, upbeat campaign about our city andour diversity. This is no campaigii about the th re at o f losing the G iants\u2014this is a campaign about m ak\u00ad ing San Francisco a better city because we can \" vote for one another\" and sup\u00ad port the different interests that give San Francisco its unique spirit. As lesbians and gay men, we've won a place in San Francisco that goes beyond the mere grudging tolerance that gays have to settle fo r in too many other cities. W e've been a welcome part o f this city\u2014from the dozens o f key com\u00ad mission appointments held by lesbians and gay men, to the com fort we feel in neighborhoods across the city. By coincidence, both domestic part\u00ad ners and a new b allpark arc on the same November ballot. It has given rise to the campaign slogan, \" Vote for One Another.\" A good thought for the future. If that slogan tru ly takes hold in our city's spirit, it w ill be no mere coin\u00ad cidence. It w ill be because we had the good sense to embrace and work for a city that recognizes that we ought to support a diversity o f interests and respect the place we each have in our ci\u00ad ty- T h at's a campaign that is well worth winning, and one that has The Sentinel's fu ll support.

COVER STORY PARENTS Continued from front page therapist she did a lot o f self-analysis and decided to have a c h ild \" regardless.\" Three years ago she began charting her cycles. Two years ago she started inseminating. She became pregnant in December and miscarried in March. Although the miscarriage was \" devastating,\" she has started inseminating again. Rod was set up to adopt a baby several years ago but the adoption fell through. Responding to his grief, a close woman friend offered to bear his own biological child for him whenever he was ready. Rod is raising Eddy on his own but the biological m other has visitation rights and m aintains regular communication. Although M arguerite, who is preg\u00ad nant with her second child, would have preferred another adoption, she opted for pregnancy because o f the difficulties she encountered with the adoption p ro \u00ad cess. \" I didn't want to go through it again. 1 wanted to have more c o ntrol. ' ' W hile attempting to secure an adop\u00ad tion, she was dropped midway through the process by the adoption agency. She fin a lly found Rene's m other through an attorney. When Rene was six months old, his b irth mother took M arguerite to court to try to get him back. Marguerite and Elizabeth were plan\u00ad ning to adopt a second child last year but it was stillborn. So M arguerite in \u00ad seminated and her baby is due next month. Over in the East Bay, Sharon and Elaine (not their real names) adopted a baby g irl two years ago after Elaine fail- baby ^ two years ago after Elaine f^- ed to conceive a child. They are so enamored with parenthood that they semination process again. \" 1 think we're crazy personally,\" says Sharon, \" but we want to do it.\" D uring the eight years o f their rela\u00ad tionship Lea and Debbie have always shared a m utual desire for children. % the decision as to who would bear them was based on financial considerations. Since Lea earns a good salary as the Gay and Lesbian liaison to the San Francisco Police Departm ent, Debbie is the biological mother o f their son Ryan. A fter a miscarriage two years ago, Deb\u00adbie easily became pregnant again. Six months into the pregnancy she was hospitalized when some old ailments, aggravated by the strain of pregnancy, reappeared. A fte r surviving on an in \u00ad travenous diet fo r an entire month, Debbie gave b irth to a premature but fu lly developed Ryan. \" Pregnancy just doesn't agree w ith my body,\" says Debbie. If the couple decided to have another child they have agreed that Lea w ill be the biological mother. W hile several o f the lesbian couples had considered co-parenting with gay men. the spectre o f A ID S led them to choose sperm donors instead. \" 1 hope they find a cure for A ID S ,\" said Deb\u00ad bie, \" it would open more doors fo r les\u00ad bians and gay men to have children.\" The sperm for both o f Debbie's pregnancies came from a clinic on Castro Street run by nurse practitioner Sherran M ills . She charges $80 to in \u00ad seminate in her office and $60 if the recipient chooses to inseminate at home. Each doner is used fo r only five pregnancies and there is enough sperm available from an individual donor to see a recipient through to conception. A fter rejecting the insem ination pro\u00ad gram at a sperm bank because it re\u00ad quired an expensive training program, Barbara found a Sonoma County doc\u00ad to r \" who had helped other lesbians to inseminate.\" Now Barbara is on the \" rolle r coaster o f insemination and w aiting.\" Each cycle she takes an ovulation predictor test for $30, then brings home $85 worth o f sperm on $10 w orth o f dry ice and tries again. Adop\u00ad tion can be expensive too. Marguerite says that the average adoption costs about $3,000 \u2014 if everything goes smoothly. Once the difficult tasks o f deciding, preparing and inseminating or adopting are over, a new challenge awaits the eager parents. How are lesbians and gay men adapting to their parenting roles? W hat is the response o f their fam ily and friends? W hile Rod says that Eddy \" makes it very easy to be a single parent,\" he also regrets the \" lack of spontaneity\" in his life. He and his boyfriend \" really value the tim e we have together.\" But there is an added bonus, says Rod. \" M y father.Debbie H o o rig io , Lea M flite ilo and th e ir son Ryan who d idn't talk to me since I came out to him , has come aro und .\" In their typical middle-class subur\u00ad ban Petaluma home. Lea and Debbie are showered w ith support by their fam ily and neighbors. When Ryan's early a rriva l caught them unprepared, the neighbors \" pitched in and bought a layette.\" Now, a few months after the b irth , the co-moms are \"just exhausted a ll the tim e.\" Lea boasts about Debbie, \" whoever created the term housewife? She works three times as hard as I d o .\" And Sharon in Berkeley laments, \" The first year was very difficult. Everything they say about what a child does to your relationship is tru e .\" But a ll o f the couples with whom I spoke were weathering the storm. They are uniform ly sensible enough to have put o ff parenthood u n til their relation\u00ad ships were well established and they were secure in their careers. S till, after a ll the whys and wherefores are considered, is it really appropriate for lesbians and gay men to become parents? In the summer issue of the \" Lesbian Contradiction\" Anne Nemesis writes, \" Lesbians' lifestyle to tally frees them from the breeding farms o f the heterosexual 'fam ily.' Yetsome lesbians are so to tally out o f their minds that they go to great lengths to replicate and create women's essential oppression.\" Barbara disagrees, \" W hy shouldn't we have that privilege? Just because I 'm a lesbian is no reason fo r me to forgo parenthood.\" \" I 've always done pretty much m y own th in g ,\" responds M arguerite. \" I think it 's stereotyping lesbians.\" Turning the argument around, Lynn (not her real name), a Santa Rosa teacher with a seven-year-old daughter, directs the challenge back to the lesbian comm unity. \" M ore and more I feel that the lesbian community is not only neutral but anti-kid. I th in k children are seen as a lia b ility. W ithin a two month period I was invited to three separate events where children were not welcome.\" Interestingly, Rod does not find sim ilar negativity among gay men. \" A ctually they have been very suppor\u00ad tive. Numerous people have told me it was something they wanted to do.\" Perhaps some lesbians have bought into the concept that the things men do tradi\u00ad tionally are superior to the things that women usually do.However, one aspect o f the criticism that lesbians and gay men are tryin g to recreate the traditional fam ily does ring true for many lesbian and gay parents. They would like to find a better vehicle fo r raising children than the nuclear fam ily model. Sharon believes that the first step is creating an extended fam ily o f friends with children who trade childcare back and fo rth. She and Elaine \" have been doing trades\" w ith friends since their daughter was three months old. Through the years, Lynn has established a circle o f lesbian couples and single mothers who form her extended fam ily. They trade childcare on a regular basis. Lyn n 's daughter thinks o f two o f the children in her \"fam ily\" as her sister and brother. It would be a serious decision if any of them were to consider m oving away. Something very special is happening among lesbians and gay men. When they choose to become statistics in the Baby Boom they are combining the biological instincts o f the hum an species with new technologies and some radical new thinking. They are proving that it really is possible to fu lfill th e ir needs as lesbians and gay men w ithout denying themselves the joys o f parenthood. Alameda Union Asks For Domestic Partners Benefitsby Keith Clark Three locals of (he Service Employees International Union (SEIU) in Oakland have included domestic partners benefits as part of their current labor contract negotiations with Alameda County officials. SEIU locals 250, 535 and 616, representing the majority of employees in county government agencies ranging from hospitals to libraries, have included a domestic partners benefits extension as one of two major issues under ducussion with county administration representatives, according to Andrea Davis, SEIU local 616 president. The union proposal would give unmarried union members the same skk and bereavement leave available to married members as well as extend health insurance benefits to partners of county workers.

According tos u c c e s s fu lly in c lu d e d n o n \u00ad discrim ination language based on sex\u00ad ual orientation in the union's contract with the county two years ago, and was the driving force behind the demand for domestic partners health benefits in theDavis, the issue grew out o f the caucus' insistance that its union concerns be given p rio rity by S E IU . \" The lesbian/gay caucus in (S E IU local) 616,\" Davis said, \" was a 'Put your money where your m outh is'challenge to the union, and S E IU responded by including it. Now it 's the county's move next.\" The current union contract expires September 2, and by then S E IU hopes to have hammered out some agreement w ith Alameda County representatives over basic issues such as a comparable worth pay equity agreement and domestic partners benefits. Once negotiators agree on the general outline o f a new contract, it w ill go before the county board o f supervisors, where three of a total five votes are needed. Davis said union staff members have been \" very supportive of domestic p art\u00ad ners benefits\" but added that there was some rank and file opposition. \" I would be less than honest if I said there wasn't some real oppostition w ithin the union membership,\" she said. Davis also said at this point she had no idea how supervisors felt about the union proposal, but indicated three supervisors \u2014 W arren W idener, M ary King, and board chairman Don Perata \u2014 were the \" most like ly to support it. \" The supervisors declined to comment on the union proposal. A spokeswoman at Pereta's office said, \" I don't see how the supervisors could comment on something they haven't seen yet. \"San Jose Judge Compares Gays To Prostitutes Tim Samuels ______ San Jose Municipal Court lodge Douglas K. Southard ruled against eighteen gay men who claimed that they were arrested for late-night sex in cars simply because they were gay. On Friday, the judge rejected their defense that heterosexuals were not prosecuted for similar conduct, and cited prostitution figures as proof, \" Prostitutes and their 'dates',\" wrote Southard, \" are given no special consideration because they are heterosexual, male o r female. There is no reason homosexual offenders should expect preferential treatment for sim ilar conduct.\" 'Sim ilar conduct', not prostitution, was what defense attorneys contended to be the crux o f the case. A t no timewas money exchanged in the c ir\u00ad cumstances involving the eighteen men. The defense cited statistical data which showed that in an e i^ te e n month span, police arrested seventy-eight gays for having late-night sex in cars or nighttim e soliciting o f undercover of\u00ad ficers. However, no heterosexuals had been cited for the same charges during that period. In his decision, the judge added that the police \" carried out this delicate assignment in a respectful, polite and businesslike fashion.\" Attorney Bruce Nickerson, who headed up the defense team, was in vo lv\u00ad ed in a ju ry tria l at the tim e that Southard's decision was rendered. He said Tuesday, \" I 'm s till form ulating my response. And rather than shoot- ffom-the-hip. I 'd rather w ait to com\u00ad m ent.\" Nickerson and colleagues failed to sway Judge Southard from his belief in equating late-night gay sex in the open with prostitution. In his decision the judge even chastised the eighteen men for \" embarrassing\" supporters o f gay rights by reinforcing the \" negative stereotype which the gay com m unity has fought so hard to destroy.\"Activists Take Over Health Forumby John Zeh n ad hoc group of activists at a federally-funded conference on HIV infection among minorities in Washington D.C. last week took the meeting's title to heart, organizing its own \"framework for collective action'' to deliver a powerful mini-manifesto about America's AIDS crisis.discussed here.

Although Carper b still far from one hb original goab\u2014rabing $1,000,000 to be granted to commnnities that estabhsh residential fadhties for PWAs\u2014he retains a wealth of optimism and b determined to complete a cross-country journey that has been both inspiring and arduous. Carper, a P W A and A ID S activist ly , Carper wanted to dem onsti^e that, whose current address is in Oregon, began the \" W alk and R o ll fo r lif e '89\" from Portland on M ay 1. In addition to the fundraising effort, he wished to in \u00ad crease public awareness of A ID S issues around the country. Carper reasoned that giving people an opportunity to at\u00ad tach a face to the disease w ould make it seem less scary and remote to them and would thus encourage donations. Fmal-as he put it, \" if a P W A can w alk across the country to W ashington, D .C ., anyone can do anything.\" C arper, who has been hospitalized twice fo r AIDS-related problems in the past year and a half, is currently in good physical health and has averaged an impressive 25 miles per day on the journey. Along the way, he has met w ith state health officials and givenmore than eighty speeches, focusing on the psychosocial issues and political ram ifications o f livin g w ith A ID S in a hostile society. A n outpouring o f positive m oral sup\u00ad port, as w ell as extensive media coverage, has been given to C arper and his team. Jesse Jackson and the Rainbow Coalition have endorsed his effort; churches, health officials, and private citizens have supplied potluck dirmers and free campground space for the travellers' 23-foot m obile home; and farmers have stopped their tractors on the road to chat. Carper readily adm itted, however, that the trek has not been w ithout its hardships. W hat began as a support crew o f seven has dwindled to a single companion, p a rtia lly. C arper believes, because o f incidents such as the tim e in Western Nebraska when two young men in a jeep attempted to run him off the road. Carper is also discouraged by the consistent l^ k o f interest generated by his talks, fo r which the average au\u00ad dience size has been well under 100. Mid-summer heat, hum id ity and pesky flies have been a nuisance, often forcing Carper to walk at night. He has lost ten pounds, which he acknowledg- Y.; \u00c1 is not good for his condition, suf\u00ad fered briefly from a severdy swollen left foot, and was hospitalized for a few days in Lincoln, Nebraska. Carpers' road \u00e0nce being diagnosed w ith A ID S during the 1986 hoUday season has been a tough one. A recovering IV drug addict, he comrmt- ted him self to turning his life around and doing something positive to combat the disease when he learned o f his predicament. A fter losing a profitable $100,000 per year business as a m arine electrical contractor and being the vic\u00ad tim o f two unrelated violent attacks in the small Oregon town where he lived at the tim e. Carper decided to devote him sdf to A ID S activism on a full-time ba\u00e0s. In 1988, he founded a re\u00e0dential care facility fo r people w ith A ID S in Eugene, which was forced to close after a mere five months due to lack o f fund\u00ad ing. Carper is currently a member of the Oregon Task Force on A ID S policy, the W illam ette A ID S Council Board, and the Eugene Com m unity A ID S Consortium . A self-described \" vagabond\" who finds it difficult to set down roots. Carper moved to Oregon from C a lifo r\u00ad nia a number o f years ago. H is im- pul\u00e0ve nature, the pain and frustration he feels fo r fellow P W A 's, and his dream o f federally funded care facilities prompted him to tackle the 3,300 mile cross-country journey. Carper appreciates all the attention the \" W alk and R o ll\" has received, but he admitted to being frustrated by the media's tendency to forget that he is trying to m aintain a private life in addi\u00ad tion to the extremely public persona o f a political activist. Hoping to remind people o f his ind ivid uality, Carper haltingly described an em otional set\u00ad back he had on August 4, when, ner\u00ad vous about his ex-wife's failure to jo in him on the w alk as planned, he flew back to Oregon from the Midwest. \" A guy 1 had never seen before in my life answered the door and punched me repeatedly in the face. I was really shaken up,\" he said. Carper went on to explain that he has been involved in a co-dependent relationship w ith his ex-wife, who also has A ID S , for the past five yean. He is trying to break away but finds it almost impossible to form new rom antic a t\u00ad tachments due to the social stigma of having A ID S . Carper also resents the emphasis reporten and on-looken put on his past as an IV drug user, noting that he is eyed suspiciously when he drinks so much as a beer. He finds sweeping judgements like these somewhat ironic, considering the many prejudices that he has overcome on his own since learning Condoms are for lovers,too. Loving your partner means protecting each other from AIDS. It takes practice to use condoms correctly, but your life\u2014and your lover' s\u2014are worth Kr.im I'.fn I lepar t m m t .*( I 'lihlu- I le a li h am i l\u00bb> pnv au* an<l lo rp o ra infornuuion; C aH 'Ihll-frpe N orthern ( alif.(hoot T O D ( tl!' a Htil-Wioi;that he has A ID S . In fact. Carper ad\u00ad mitted that w hile he was extrem ely homophobic before being diagnosed, most o f his best friends are now gay men. U nfortunately, he has seen seven\u00ad teen of them die over the past three years. Though Carper knows first hand o f the high cost attached to being in the public eye, he said that if he had the choice to make again, he would s till opt to do the w alk. When it 's a ll over, however, he plans to move out o f the state of Oregon in an effort to regain some level o f anonym ity. Carper diligently records his ex\u00ad periences on the trip , whether inspiring or deflating, in a jo urn a l. He plans eventually to compile this record into a book, ten tatively title d American Roads o f Denial. Carper strongly believes that people in the U nited States today are too caught up w ith self\u00ad gratification to really care about others, particularly about others who have a disease th a t is as surrounded by ig\u00ad norance and fear as A ID S . Interestingly enough, he visited San Francisco three months ago, ju st before heading towards W ashington, and came away with the eerie sense that the level of apathy regarding A ID S issues in the ci\u00ad ty had increased m arkedly since the first months o f 1988. Along these lines. Carper emphasized that he needs the reassurance o f knowing that San F ra n \u00ad ciscans, especially members o f the gay and lesbian com m unity, support what he is doing. In spite o f the many personal and practical difficulties that have plagued Carper so far, he and what is left o f his team rem ain on schedule and plan to a rrive in W ashington, D .C . on September \" scrolled letter\" re\u00ad questing $20 m illio n for the care o f A ID S patients and signed by concerned citizens along the w alk w ill be delivered to the W hite House, and Carper w ill spend some tim e lobbying in the capital. \" Id e a lly, I 'd like to address a fu ll House o f Representatives and have d in\u00ad ner w ith George and Barbara,\" Carper said, suggesting that his supporters w rite the President to urge him to ex\u00ad tend such an invitation. \" The W a lk and R o ll\" has fallen short o f its fundraising plan, and tax deductible donations are s till m ore than welcome.

As Jackie Winnow, founder o f the W om en's Cancer Resource Center, noted in her speech at the Lesbian Caregivers Conference, 42,0(X) women die each year from breast cancer \u2014 almost as many as the number o f people who have died from A ID S since the epidemic's inception in 1981. Indeed, many women's health care issues are shoved aside, lacking the \"fla v o r and political urgency and emergency that A ID S has, observed Poole. \" A lot o f people are attracted toAlthough lesbians have been quick to lead the way as health care providers, they have been slow to take up A ID S as their own health issue. Denial of les\u00ad bians' vulnerability to the virus is ram \u00ad pant. \" We seem to try to hold onto the idea that we're separate,\" Blum observ\u00ad ed. \" It 's a very sad statement about the state of affairs in o u r comm unity. It points to the degree o f fear we h ave.\" And it points to the denial that some lesbians sleep w ith men and use in \u00ad travenous drugs \u2014 the prim ary way most lesbians with A ID S have become infected. The risk for lesbians is real. Although little is known about woman-to-woman sexual transmission, a handful of ca.ses have been m edically documented. \" Just because the risk is low doesn t mean you don't have to be concerned about it.\" Blachman observed. \" Les bians need to take as many precautions as anybody.\" Laurie Hauer, a registered nurse and Coordinator o f the Bay Area Perinatal a id s Center, has wrtnessed a \" prob\u00ad lem of extremes,\" from \" denial that lesbians can be affected\" to \"complete paranoia,\" with \" nothing in the mid\u00ad dle.\" Often those most concerned are at least risk, and vice versa. \" Lesbians need a better way o f assessing their own risks and the risks o f their partners and dealing w ith it . \" First and foremost, couples should talk about each other's histories and honestly evaluate the risks. If women decide to take the antibody test, \" it is im portant to consider how they would use the results,\" Blachman cautioned. She encourages women to \"leam how your lover's body lo o k s . . . .

Although Carper is still far from one his original goals\u2014raising $1,000,000 to be granted to communities that establish residential facilities for PWAs\u2014he retains a wealth of optimism and is determined to complete a cross-country journey that has been both inspiring and arduous. Carper, a P W A and A ID S activist ly, Carper wanted to demonstrate that. whose current address is in Oregon, began the \"W a lk and R o ll for Life '89\" from Portland on M ay I . In addition to the fundraising effort, he wished to in \u00ad crease public awareness o f A ID S issues around the country. Carper reasoned that giving people an opportunity to at\u00ad tach a face to the disease would make it seem less scary and remote to them and would thus encourage donations. Final-as he put it, \" if a P W A can walk across the country to Washington, D .C ., anyone can do anything.\" Carper, who has been hospitalized twice for AIDS-related problems in the past year and a half, is currently in good physical health and has averaged an impressive 25 miles per day on the journey. Along the way, he has met w ith state health officials and givenm ore than eighty speeches, focusing on the psychosocial issues and political ram ifications o f living with A ID S in a hostile society. A n outpouring o f positive m oral sup\u00ad port, as well as extensive media coverage, has been given to Carper and his team. Jesse Jackson and the Rainbow Coalition have endorsed his effort; churches, health officials, and private citizens have supplied poduck dinners and free campground space for the travellers' 23-foot mobile home; and farmers have stopped their tractors on the road to chat. Carper readily admitted, however, that the trek has not been without its hardships. W hat began as a support crew o f seven has dwindled to a single companion, p a rtia lly. Carper believes, because o f incidents such as the tim e in Western Nebraska when two young men in a jeep attempted to run him off the road. Carper is also discouraged by the consistent lack o f interest generated by his talks, for which the average au\u00ad dience size has been well under 100. Mid-summer heat, hum idity and pesky flies have been a nuisance, often forcing Carper to walk at night. He has lost ten pounds, which he acknowledg- Condoms are for lovers, too.

Nebraska. Carpers' road since being diagnosed with A ID S during the 1986 holiday season has been a tough one. A recovering IV drug addict, he commit\u00ad ted himself to turning his life around and doing something positive to combat the disease when he learned o f his predicament. A fte r losing a profitable $100,000 per year business as a m arine electrical contractor and being the vic\u00ad tim of two unrelated violent attacks in the small Oregon town where he lived at the time. Carper decided to devote himself to A ID S activism on a full-time basis. In 1988, he founded a residential care facility for people with A ID S in Eugene, which was forced to close after a mere five months due to lack of fund\u00ad ing. Carper is currently a member of the Oregon Task Force on A ID S policy, the W illam ette A ID S Council Board, and the Eugene Com m unity A ID S Consortium . A self-described \"vagabond\" who finds it difficult to set down roots. Carper moved to Oregon from C a lifo r\u00ad nia a number o f years ago. His im \u00ad pulsive nature, the pain and frustration he feels for fellow P W A 's, and his dream o f federally funded care facilities prompted him to tackle the 3,300 m ile cross<ountry journey. Carper appreciates all the attention the \"W a lk and R o ll\" has received, but he admitted to being frustrated by the media's tendency to forget that he is trying to m aintain a private life in addi\u00ad tion to the extrem ely public persona o f a political activist. Hoping to remind people of his individuality. Carper haltingly described an emotional set\u00ad back he had on August 4, when, ner\u00ad vous about his ex-wife's failure to jo in him on the w alk as planned, he flew back to Oregon from the Midwest. \" A guy 1 had never seen before in my life answered the door and punched me repeatedly in the face. I was really shaken u p ,\" he said. Carper went on to explain that he has been involved in a co-dependent relationship w ith his ex-wife, who also has A ID S , for the past five years. He is trying to break away but finds it almost impossible to form new romantic a t\u00ad tachments due to the social stigma of having A ID S . Carper also resents the emphasis reporters and on-lookers put on his past as an IV drug user, noting that he is eyed suspiciously when he drinks so much as a beer. He finds sweeping judgements like these somewhat ironic, considering the many prejudices that he has overcome on his own .since learningthat he has A ID S . In fact. Carper ad\u00ad mitted that while he was extrem ely homophobic before being diagnosed, most o f his best friends are now gay men. U nfortunately, he has seen seven\u00ad teen of them die over the past three years. Though Carper knows first hand o f the high cost attached to being in the public eye, he said that if he had the choice to make again, he would s till opt to do the walk. When it 's a ll over, however, he plans to move out o f the state of Oregon in an effort to regain some level of anonym ity. Carper diligently records his ex\u00ad periences on the trip , whether inspiring o r deflating, in a jo urn a l. He plans eventually to compile this record into a book, tentatively titled American Roads o f Denial. Carper strongly believes that people in the U nited States today are too caught up w ith self\u00ad gratification to really care about others, particularly about others who have a disease that is as surrounded by ig\u00ad norance and fear as A ID S . Interestingly enough, he visited San Francisco three months ago, just before heading towards W ashington, and came away w ith the eerie sense that the level o f apathy regarding A ID S issues in the ci\u00ad ty had increased m arkedly since the first months o f 1988. Along these lines. Carper emphasized that he needs the reassurance o f knowing that San F ra n \u00ad ciscans, especially members o f the gay and lesbian com m unity, support what he is doing. In spite of the many personal and practical difficulties that have plagued Carper so far, he and what is left o f his team remain on schedule and plan to a rrive in W ashington, D .C . on September \"scrolled le tter\" re\u00ad questing $20 m illio n fo r the care of A ID S patients and signed by concerned citizens along the w alk w ill be delivered to the W hite House, and Carper w ill spend some tim e lobbying in the capital. \" Ideally, I 'd like to address a full House o f Representatives and have din\u00ad ner with George and B arb a ra ,\" Carper said, suggesting that his supporters w rite the President to urge him to ex\u00ad tend such an invitation. \" The W alk and R o ll\" has fallen short o f its fundraising plan, and tax deductible donations are s till more than welcome. Checks made payable to \" W alk and R o ll for Life 1989\" can be mailed to: 1085 West Sixth Avenue, Suite 6, Eugene, Oregon, 97402. Those who wish to help Carper celebrate com\u00ad pletion of the walk should m ail their congratulations no later than Thurs\u00ad day. September 7. to; Richard Carper; entral Station; Washington. .

The more than 200 women who crowded into the workshops left no doubt that lesbian health care providers are in the forefront of the epidemic. \" A lot of lesbians have made careers out of AIDS,\" observed Marsha Rlachman, Women's Services Coordinator at the AIDS Health Project. What Draws Them The influx o f lesbians goes beyond the simple fact that women are condi\u00ad tioned to be caregivers \u2014 and caregivers o f men. It was also a gut level response from the other half o f the gay community. \"M y friends are getting sick and no one else is going to pay at\u00ad tention.\" recalled Ruth Schwartz. Educational Events Coordinator at the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. Added Kitsy Schoen. Bereavement Coordinator at Hospice o f San Francisco. \"The shit hit the fan and we forgot the quarrels we had.

Jones joined the team on Ward 5A during its incep tion in 1983. seizing the opportunity \" to work professionally fo r a paycheck\" in an area that coincided with \"m y own p<ilitical perspective and the work I'd been doing around lesbian and gay oppression.\" Lauren Poole, aI.auren Poole, a caregiver at SF G eneral's W ard 86. nurse practitioner on San Francisco General Hospital's outpatient AIDS clinic and a staff person at Project AW ARE (Association for Women's AIDS Research and Education) has found a way \" to be a health care provider in a much broader sense\" \u2014 a political activist and part o f a move\u00ad ment. And. on a personal level, lesbians en\u00ad joy the chance to be out in their workplaces. \"T h a t's a big deal, even in San Francisco.\" observed Jones. Add\u00ad ed Schwartz. \"A s a lesbian, it's been wonderful to be in a gay-positive en\u00ad vironment and working with so many other gay and lesbian people.\" Crealing Links With Men Through their work with AIDS, les\u00ad bians are building bridges to the gay m en' s co m m u n ity. Bca B lum . Residence Advocate at Shanii Project, has discovered \" new ways o f having in\u00ad timate and close relationships that aren't sexual\" with gay men. many of whom have never had lesbians in their lives in a close way. \" I 've seen a weav\u00ad ing o f men's and women's differences and a recognition of our similarities. Underneath it. the way we feel pain is the same.\" Lesbians have brought a feminist and progressive perspective, challenging their gay brothers around issues of class, race and gender. Observed Carmen Chavez. M in ority AID S Volunteer Training Coordinator at Mano a Mano. \" I t 's a constant struggle to have to educate the Latino gay men I work w ith .\" But the efforts have paid off in reciprocal support from gay men. \" I was so moved and happy to see so many gay men at the abortion ra lly .\" Schoen said. \" If I hadn't seen that. I would have been really a n g ry.\" Are Women's Health Issues Being Slighted? _____ Are lesbians flocking to the AIDS arena \u2014 assisting prim arily men \u2014 at the expense of women's health issues, such as cancer? As Jackie Winnow, founder of the Women's Cancer Resource Center, noted in her speech at the Lesbian Caregivers (Conference. 42.(XX) women die each year from breast cancer \u2014 almost as many as the number of people who have died from AID S since the epidemic's inception in I981. Indeed, many women's health care issues arc shoved aside, lacking the \"fla vor and political urgency and emergency that .AIDS has.\" observed Poole. \" A lot of people arc attracted toAIDS because of the momentum.\" Jones believes it boils down to a \"paycheck issue.\" The AIDS field is burgeoning with funded positions, while fewer jobs are available in lesbian and women's health care. \"N o com\u00ad parable political and social movement has been able to create the infrastruc\u00ad ture that exists around AID S .\" she ex\u00ad plained. \" If there was a comparable m obilization around women and cancer. I think you would see a lot of lesbians prc.sent in similar wavs vou see in AIDS. \" Shain foresees a direct benefit for women's health care through lesbian leadership in the epidemic. \"There have been some real wonderful learning ex\u00ad periences about systems for caring for folks that we can use to cause a re- emergence of our own health care system.\" Lesbians Are At Risk _ Although lesbians have been quick to lead the way as health care providers, they have been slow to take up AIDS as their own health issue. Denial of les\u00ad bians' vulnerability to the virus is ram\u00ad pant. \"W e seem to try' to hold onto the idea that we're separate.\" Blum observ\u00ad ed. \" I t 's a very sad statement about the state of affairs in our community. It points to the degree o f fear we have.\" And it points to the denial that some lesbians sleep with men and use in\u00ad travenous drugs \u2014 the primary way most lesbians with AIDS have become infected. The risk for lesbians is real. Although little is known about woman -to-woman sexual transmission, a handful of cases have been medically documented. \"Just because the risk is low doesn't mean you don't have to be concerned about it.\" Blachman observed. \" Les bians need to take as many precautions as anybody.\" l.aurie Hauer, a registered nurse and Coordinator of the Bay Area Perinatal AIDS (Center, has witnes,sed a \" prob\u00ad lem of extremes.\" from \" denial that lesbians can be affected\" to \"complete paranoia.\" with \" nothing in the mid\u00ad dle.\" Often those most concerned are at least risk, and vice versa. \" Lesbians need a better way o f assessing their own risks and the risks of their partners and dealing with it.\" First and foremost, couples should talk about each other's histories and honestly evaluate the risks. If women decide to take the antibody test, \" it is important to consider how they would use the results.\" Blachman cautioned. She encourages women to \"learn how your lover's body looks .... Most women don't know what a healthy vagina looks like, what arc healthy secretions.\" The most common complaint voiced bv lesbians is that \"n o one will say oral sex is safe.\" Blachman observed. \"The famous |dental| dam is still a very controvcrsi.ll topic. I tell people that the risk is there . . . They have to decide how comfortable or uncomfortable they are with that risk.\" ___^A n Isolated Population Ixsbians with H IV feel doubly isolated \u2014 as women and as lesbians. \"M ost lesbians I've worked with are not doing a lot o f talking about it among their friends.\" Blachman said. Mans fear hostilitv and ostracism.lesbians who come out. But the women who are infected \"have to find it out for themselves. It's a very painful step.\" Joan Baker chose to go public with her AID S diagnosis. \" I wasn't going to go back into the closet after just coming out as gay.\" she recalled. \" l want to let lesbians know they can get A ID S .\" Although Baker feels supported, she knows that some lesbians do not. One lesbian with A ID S who spoke at a con\u00ad ference received anonymous phone ''lesbians need a better way o f assessing their own risks . . . . \" \" Everybody wants to know how they got infected.\" Added Catherine Maier. Women's Services Program Coor\u00ad dinator at the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. \" If the lesbian community finds out they had sex with men or used lintravenous) drugs, that's not political\u00ad ly correct.\" Maier has seen the lesbian communi\u00ad ty to be generally \" very supportive\" ofcalls, telling her to stop speaking out. Services targeted to lesbians with H IV and AID S are virtually nonexis\u00ad tent. driving many women deeper into isolation. Women's support groups are predominantly hetero.sexual. \" I t 's a double' bind.\" admitted Blachman. \"There are already a limited number o f services for women and even fewer for lesbians.\" < 100% COTTON CLOTHING 0< FOR CHILDREN \u00b0 - B IR T H T O 6 x /7 , G IR L S T O 14. 4066- 24th S t..

R R T \u00a9 l9Sh P ardi M e d ica l Features With the news from the nationwide AZT study that convinced the researchers that the drug will not only greatly beneFit those with AIDS, but delay the onward progress for those presently HIV-infected (but not exhibiting any symptoms), the next critical step needs to be examined: who is going to pay for reimbursement? This question cannot be put o ff any F D A responding to them? The findings longer. The government, reimbursers. and health organizations now face a decision determining not only wAo pays a for the drug, but how is it going to get financed. Whether viewed from the perspective o f the national insurance carriers for those presently affording some sort of health coverage, o r the government who would be ethically responible for those who don't, everyone from those who pay premiums, to those taxpayers who pay fo r those who can't, w ill need to resolve the quandary: Do we pay preven\u00ad tion costs now, o r tot treatment costs later? The situation as it now stands is this: Insurance companies w ill only reim \u00ad burse for drugs that get the \" a p p ro val\" status from the F D A and become \"licensed.\" Commissioner o f the F D A D r. Frank Young has strongly en\u00ad couraged companies to give serious consideration to not w aiting for licens\u00ad ing for reimbursement costs to begin, but rather with the granting o f a drug's \" Treatm ent IN D \" status\u2014 which comes a considerable tim e p rio r to an \" approval\" status being granted. Although some companies have done this (a few have been reim bursing onia, as an example), most, unfortunately, have not. This A Z T scenario is frustrating for many because even w ith the encourag\u00ad ing news received last week, most w ill still not be able to afford it one way or the other, becau.se {Represent approval status for A Z T is granted fo r those \" with A ID S o r severe A R C ''\u2014 T-cell counts below 200 only. W hich defeats the very purpose o f the conclusions reached. W ith this recent announcement, the H ealth Insurance A ssociation o f America in Washington, D .C ., said the new findings w ill spur their insurers to reimburse policyholders fo r the drug in cases of early infection. The research also gave additional optimism regard\u00ad ing the purported $l2,000-a-year costs required, by noting that those study participants taking on\\y half the recom\u00ad mended dose regimen (six 100 mg. cap\u00ad sules, as opposed to twelve d a ily) wasas effective as those taking the higher range\u2014practically meaning that the overall costs could be reduced by many thousands of dollars. W ith H IV status increasingly being viewed as managing a chronic illness rather than a death sentence, there w ill hopefully be a greater demand fo r! testing, and also increased pressure for policy-makers to create ways for payments of treatments w ith anti-AID S drugs for all those with H IV . Increas\u00ad ingly, another component needing to be seriously addressed is the aspect of payments of those drugs for those unin\u00ad sured and/or w ithout prescription benefits, who constitute a sizeable por-, tion of the patient population. What about the study's findings andsuggest that future A Z T applications be given to those with T-cell counts in the compromised range (200-400). not in the present lim ited range otbehw 200. It w ill do little good for those wishing to halt the progression o f A ID S , or those wishing to delay symptomology. if new F D A guidelines do not reflect new \" labeling uses.\" \" People with T-helper cell counts between 200 and 400 and whose only symptoms were fever, night sweats and fatigue almost invariably cleared up on A Z T ,\" said D r. N eil Flynn, well-known Sacramento A ID S specialist. \" The drug benefits them im \u00ad mediately, within a month or so of start\u00ad ing it.\" What about the seemingly exorbi\u00ad tant costs? \"A Z T is a very complicated compound drug to m ake,\" said Karen Collins o f the Public Affairs Office o f Burrough W ellcom e's North C arolina adm inistrative center. \"People think we are making unwarranted sums o f money off this product, but the truth is. we've been funding grants for a lo t of the clinical tria ls the drug hasundergone. . . . W e have yet to calculate when we w ill recoup our R & D (Research and Development! costs since we are continuing to budget for future expanding clinical tria ls .\" W hat about their present profit m argin figures? \" I do not have those figures available.\" In response to my question about the m any demonstrations con\u00ad ducted against the appearance o f ex- ces,sive profits, and pointedly, o f the demonstration last fall against their cor\u00ad porate office in Burlingame by ac\u00ad tivists. Collins defended the cornpany's effort at producing the drug cost- effectively. \" We were able to lower the cost (from estimated SI2.000 to $8,000 a year! in December 1987 because of changes in the machinery used in the process; it was not the result o f any pressure, just efficiency.\" A suggestion to consider is purchasing A Z T directly from buyers' clubs or other organizations listed in the com\u00ad m unity's newsletters. Also, American Preferred Plan w ill fill your prescrip\u00ad tion. They are a membership organiza\u00ad tion that delivers regular prescriptions to your door, accepts insurance payments in fu ll (no co-pays o r paper\u00ad work). and as Project Inform notes, pro\u00ad vides complete confidentiality and sen\u00ad s itivity to For 24-hour, overnight d elive ry, call 1-800-227-1195. If you do decide to ob\u00ad tain your presecriptions this way, may I suggest you mention that \" P I\" sent you\u2014 A P P w ill make a donation towards Project Inform . F in a lly, the sum total o f the findings drastically underscore the need to ex\u00ad pand the federal government's AZT- funding fo r HIV-infected persons who lack insurance. As D r. Flynn pointed out. \" Now that the drug's been shown to help people live longer, how are we ethically going to withhold it?\" CERTIFIED MASSAGE Y ou will enjoy this relaxing Swedish-Esalen Massage.

W hat can women expect the next decade to hold in terms of career, health and lifestyle? What are the needs of modem women that have yet to be addressed and what is at the top of our agenda? The paa two decades have seen women assert the arength required to a lter radically the long term aatus quo o f a male-dominated society. We have changed the image men have o f us as w ell as the image we have of ourselves in order to b ura out o f the old conaraints o f being the \" weaker sex\" , regardless o f sexual orientation. Women entered the workplace and clim bed upward as the '80s unfolded. T o be sure there are s till too m any in- aances o f inequality to become compla\u00ad cent, but things have definitely im prov\u00ad ed quickly. Now there are women in top level corporate jobs and women who have aarted their own businesses. There has even been a female vice- presidential candidate, supreme court justice, and now women clergy. I believe that/Ac next step fo r women is to be one o f holistic inlegralion. To break through the barriers o f inequality women have to emphasize a political and career energetic that is derived from the immense physical body o f energythat is inherent beyond sex. A woman is not the fra il and fragile creature of the old mythology. A woman is a powerful dynamic in the universe. We can create life from our bodies which determines the course o f human development. The next logical step fo r women is to redistribute the focus in a more holistic way to encompass a variety o f achievements and experiences. The toughest part o f the outward journey is done, now is the tim e to look inward and discover ways in which we can find variety in fulfillm ent. Lesbians adopting children is an example o f this. Women must continue to move fo r\u00ad ward both in external and internal development. We see that women have made great achievements by the asser\u00ad tion of the body and m ind. We are physically able to move ahead in the social order. Now we need to explore the spiritual aspects o f fem ininity and womanhood. This spiritual nature o f woman is centered in the energy o f creating and PENINSULA - SOUTH BAY AROMATHERAPY MASSAGE 'Look in the perfumes ol flowers and of nature for peace of mind and joy of life '' My use of aromatic extracts from flowers, herbs and trees combined with Swedish/Esalen. deep tissue, and accupressure will affirm your well\u00ad being Sensual, not sexual: a truly nurturing ex\u00ad perience $40 per session.

U nlike men, women ac\u00ad tu a lly grow the future generations. Women can determine a great deal about the future o f the human race by the quality o f nurturing afforded tom orrow 's adults. This is a massive creative power that can be directed in a num ber o f ways aside from child rear\u00ad ing. The womb arei is caled (he hara in holistk metaphysics. Thb part of a women's body is (he center of power for man and womankind. All human hie extends from thb region. When women learn to work from thdr haras, almost aaythiag can be accompHshed. To harness thb power one must be aware of ib great poteatial. Another aspect o f womanhood to ex\u00ad plore is the area o f physical health. Now that women are entering the medical and scientific professions in droves we must have a m ore specific and sensitive understanding o f our needs and problems separate from m en. W e can learn more about what o ur re\u00ad quirements are for a long and healthy life. Women's workshops, classes and support groups provide the space for these needs and problems to be solved. Some o f the areas where women need to develop understanding include osteoporosis, anem ia, reproductive health, and pregnancy. The lim itations o f this column do not allow me to cover a ll of these topics now. Women can only excel in the m ental and spiritual if the physical is well m ain\u00ad tained. One key to keeping a strong body is to eat a diet that w ill protect you from an anemic condition. Am enia is a deficiency of red blood cells. Red blood cells encompass hemaglobin which gives them their a b ility to carry oxygen to the other cells and organs o f the body. A lack o f these red blood cells can result in exhaustion, headaches, dizziness, depression and irrita b ility . Women are especially vulnerable to anemia because o f the blood loss that results from m enstruation. The woman o f the '9Qs w ill find this suceptability compounded by the demands o f a career. Often having a career means an increase in day-to-day stress which destroys nutrients at an accelerated pace. Then one has to consider the pressure o f tim e lim itations. Women often neglect to eat right when they are rushing the clock to get ahead. M any women are concerned w ith their ap\u00ad pearance and follow unhealthy diets to keep their weight down. Pregnancy also increases a wom an's chances o f becom\u00ad ing anemic. In order to prevent anemia women should eat a diet that includes generous portions o f leafy green vegetables such as broccoli and kale. Taking sup\u00ad plements is prudent because anemia is easier to prevent than to get rid of. Vitam ins C, B complex and E are essential to the metabolism o f the red blood cells. Iro n and folic acid are also vita l nutrients. Fresh vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are good food choices to combat anemia; live r is often recommended but I believe that it is too to xic fo r re g u la r c o nsum p tion. Remember that the purpose o f the live r is to remove toxins from the body. The '90s can be the most rewarding tim e for women, as we continue on the path of achievement and self-discovery. This coming decade w ill require a lo t from women. W e w ill continue to need strength, but coupled w ith real compas\u00ad sion and sensitivity. It w ill be exciting to watch women grow stronger and ad\u00ad vance to new heights o f self-respect, self-love and w orld influence.

September), a new practical guide, boldandsassy. with a welcome disregard fo r convention, and a tongue-in-cheek w it that would make M iss M a n n e n _ b lu ^ Let us begin with nirting. Isn't that where it usually begins? Flirting is kindred to music, a light touch being both means and end. The word itself derives from the old French fleureter. literally \"to move lightly from flower to flower. \" A form of flirting is cruising, more goal-oriented and as.sertivc. F)ach lesbian has her unique flirting style, with marvelous variations. In Ihe beginning, you may want lo leam, even rehearse, a few themes, or call them \" opening plays\" as in other field sports. Never fear; even if you feel terminally shy. you can still develop (he quality of \"eloquenl receptivity.\" possibly, the most magnetic of all seduction styles. Lesbians appreciate that shyness is often a veil for the virtues. Aggressiveness, naturally, is forbidden Lesbian flirtin g , like lesbian seduc\u00ad tion, is an exchange. No one controls. No one is quarry. The big challenge is first to indicate to a woman you want to volley w ith her in the court o f delights. This stroke is called \" openers.\" MemorizeLa</>' Cliloressa's First Law o f Motion: N ine times out o f ten. YOU are going to have to make the first move. In the cruising game, even the most stomping lesbians play an amaz\u00ad ingly comic. \" After you, my dear Alphonse. . . \" routine. Each woman waits for the other to begin, in one of the strangest mating rituals of a ll species. Shy. very shy. women lead more exciting lives than ordinary folk can ever imagine. W hat seems like a metetete-a-tete to the bold is to the shy High Adventure, fraught with perils and dazzling successes. \" 1 smiled at her. and she smiled b a c k!\" may last two weeks for us. It is a m iracle les\u00ad bians ever taste sweet pollen at a ll, but it all works out as it is supposed to . , . later o r sooner. To make something happen now, simply w ork out a few general openers which feel natural to you. Practiced does not mean insincere. V irtu a lly a ll the gentle rakes in Lady Q itoressa's Circle have some openers rehearsed. As a rule, a ll agree that it is wise n e ve r to m ake y o u r openers devastating ly w itty , sarcastic or sophisticated. Your recipient usually can't come up with a quick repartee; she then feels clunky and wants to escape the situation\u2014 and you. A rem ark like . \"D o you always have thismuch fu n ? \" falls into this shoot-from- the-lips category. You want to frolic with this woman, not pin her to the w all. A lig h ly sexual innuendo like. \" Can I buy you a d rin k \u2014o r a summer at Blue Fish Cove?\" leaves many women flustered-even if they do know what the hell you're talking about. A starving artist, however, confessed to enjoying the irony of, \" M ay I buy you a d rin k, o r would you just like the money?\" This a ll led to a fascinating exchange on a rt. women's economics, and onward . . . Here is a New Age opener: \" Earth is such a beautiful place. Do you come here often?\" which of course requires a most benevolent setting not to sound dippy. It is a bit outre these days for les\u00ad bians to make bar o r party rounds p ly\u00ad ing alcohol like some kind o f boozy big daddy. You have to catch a lady be\u00ad tween glasses, and lesbians are sipping slower these days or observing the ritual with m ineral water o r juice. If you must, ask to \"g e t\" (not \" b u y \" ) her a d rin k, and o f course pay for it. A hot player responds w ith a dazzling smile, 'T i l get the next ro u n d .\" an incandes\u00ad cent player w ith. \" M aybe we can have the next one some place quieter. . H ere's a Twelve-Step opener: \" I f it is no longer romantic to be alcoholic, is it alcoholic to be rom antic?\" One good, all-around opener for anywhere, which doesn't depend on drinking props, is to ask. \"M a y 1 jo in you for a m om ent?\" The \"m om ent\" diarms a lady who fears being stuck with a strange b ird \u2014and gives you a way out if you H IV 'i' Alcohol and druRs suppress thehealth, especially when done to excess Forw ith HIV. substance abuse may speed progress.on to ARC. or a id s If you have tested HIV-positive, giving up drugs andalcohol may be one of the best things you can do to maintaingood health If you find it difficult to give them up ormoderate your use. professional counseling and 12-stcp ^ \" '^W^proy ide o^utpatient counseling, referrals and infor\u00adm ation to gav men with substance abuse problems Our Miding scafe fees mean no one is turned away Insurance is acetptedst^f^ is gay Wc understand your lifestyle and concerns.

The vita l purpose o f all ritu a l social phrases and small ta lk h contact; content is v ir\u00ad tually irrelevant. Small ta lk announces, \"1 am friendly and 1 want to acknowledge this moment we have together in Ihe w o rld .\" Sm all talk is a light interm ission from the literal. You too can lighten up if you just remember we arc in the pleasant land of process here, not content. Things warm up easi\u00ad ly if you can somehow discover a com\u00ad mon interest, which is why meeting at a women's studies course o r a gardening class is better than meeting ai a bar or on the bus. If a ll your attempts as Lady O iatterley continue to draw silence, remember pur\u00ad ple XX chromosomes do not necessarily rapport make. Be patient, however, with b rillia n t flashes of silence. It is unclut\u00ad tered awareness. Sim ply enjoy being with a beautiful woman. Smile at her for as long as it would take to say. \" Would you like to make love beyond words?\" Silence doesn't cost anything and it doesn't hu rt. It provides refreshment. Breathe in well-being and exhale hope. Remember this lady may have justventured out from Goddess knows where and may need a chance to son through suddenly new op tio ns- like you. If. however, she is not playing, period, have the galanterie to say. \"W e ll. I 've enjoyed talking to yo u .\" Ova and out. The most im portant q uality in con\u00ad versational foreplay is the good energy o f being there, alive and enjoying the game. This brings us to Lady ditoressa's Second Law o f Motion: Exhibit no undue haste. Lesbians have whole constellations of erotic emotions and sense to bring into p la y. It is not on\u00ad ly gauche to move toward instant gratification. i( is foolhardy. Most les\u00ad bians reseni and mistrust a rushed, fix \u00ad ated demand for sex from a stranger. We can afford to be connoisseurs o f subtle\u00ad ty, to be tantric with time. Sensuous les\u00ad bians know half the fun is getting there; the blossoms of ardor grow in the season of anticipation. We say, \"fam iliarity brings attempt.\" A t first meeting, try for a date, not a feel. \" I 'd really be interested in getting together again. M ay I call yo u ? \" W hatever yo ur pace, do something. Don't thin your blood with \" m ight have beens.\" Go ahead and catch the wheel o f karm a as it turns. Let us say you have moved the wheelforward. We come lo the next step along the path o f conversational foreplay after \" openings.\" after the great warm-up. It is the hot stroke called \"m aking the m ove.\" the proposition for s-e-x. M a k\u00ad ing the move can be attempted at first sight o r on the fifteenth date, depending on your period, sign o f the zodiac, and the signals you are getting. You may be propositioning this woman for life or for one sweet night. Practice this challenging scenario: it is your last night in M in \u00ad neapolis. Y o u 've been chatting up your seemingly interested beauty a ll evening and it is getting late. P layfu lly, you touch hands. \"1 hale to g o .\" Then your fingers attentively caress each tip of hers in a silent conversation. Before your very eyes her nipples harden to salute yours. It is now or never. But u'/io w ill make the move??? You remember the odds: she may be one o f the nine Lesbians in ten with o nly buddingf/Z/.v/i/A. The odds clearly dic\u00ad tate: it 's Y O U R move. Summoning a ll l\\\\c delicales.se of Lady C 's \" no undue haste\" that you can possibly muster since time \u00aba c tu a lly running out. you slowly whisper. \" M ay I kiss you just once?

Breathe deeply.I \"Y o u know 1 would be delighted i f you could spend the night with me. . .'' Serious seducers w ill note the harmless-sounding \" just once\" o f the opening line and the open-ended \"som etim e\" of the next. You are not. after a ll. desperate. One kiss is better than none and som etim e\u00ab better than never. \" If you co uld \" in the final p ro \u00ad position gives the lady who is not presently ready a way lo respond w ith her diplom atic \"W h y I can't . \" rather than \" I won't.\" The idea here is not to provide generic, canned come-ons, only to em \u00ad phasize old-fashioned, fiagrant good manners and the subtlety for which les\u00ad bians are famoas. In the above scenario, the qualifying phrases weave lacy loopholes for both players to dance through. You can easily reach out and you can easily let go. Perhaps/A\u00ab tim e, you w ill have to kuhis woman go. It is. however.rz/H'flw a successful advance lo gracefully let a beautiful woman know you are. well, moist.

The biggest proMem facing the next opera, Mozart's early masterpiece \u00a1domeneo. is a textual one. /domeneo. premiered in 1781 in Munich, represents the young composer's coming-of-age. It was his first chance to get out from under his father's thumb, and be blossomed in this new air of freedom. But even before Mozart could get \u00a1domeneo on to the stage, be ran into problems. The opera was playing rather longer than expected in rehearsal. Fearing terinm, Mozart cut several numbers. Then the tenor signed np for the title role pleaded with Mozart to spare an old man and simplify Idomeneo's bravura aria, \" Fnor dd m ar.\"WTien M ozart revived/rfo/neneo for a concert performance in Vienna in 1786. he made a new set o f changes, principally because he now had a tenor for the part o f Idomeneo's son.

For those who want precisely the ver\u00ad sion that w ill appear on the Opera House stage this season, the best bet is John P ritchard's new London set with Luciano Pavarotti as Idomeneo.

Lucia Popp's Ilia was. alas, caught IS years too late. The prospective/(/omeneo fan is b a \u00ad le r direded to either C olin D avis's 1968 P hilips recording and N ikolaus H a r\u00ad noncourt's 1980 Teldec performance. Davis whips through the score with a v ita lity and an ear fo r dram a that have not been equalled on record. The first drawback, however, is that D avis's ap\u00ad proach is from the old school, with a beefed-up modem orchestra and big. operatic voices. So it w ill not be to everyone's taste. Neveitheless it re\u00ad mains m usically the most compelling performance. A bigger problem lies with D avis's singers. The baritonish tenor o f George Shirley deals m anfully but not pleasingly w ith Idom eneo's high tessitura. M argherita R in a ld i's Ilia begins w ell, but as the demands on her increase, her resources shrink. For Idam ante. Davis sought out tenor Ryland Davies and then paradoxically asked him to deal w ith the original soprano version o f the role. It is therefore no surprise that he soundspinched and drawn. N o r can Pauline T in sle y's hard-voice E lettra manage the many shadings M ozart put into her part. H arnoncourt's version, on the o th a hand, is i b rillia n t defense of the o riginal instrument approach. His con- duaing has the lightness o f touch, and precision o f detail, for which this school is famous, but be never sacrifices the turbulence of the dram a. Indeed H a r\u00ad noncourt passionately points up every sinistCT moment and every th rillin g ex- u lu tio n . He has in W erner Hollweg a most stylish Idomeneo, who negotiates a ll the coloratura o f \" Fuor del m a r\" w ith delight. But s till. Hollweg does not invest Idomeneo's crucial dilemma w ith the haunting power that Shirley did. Trudeliese S h m id t is the o n ly Idamante on record to make the role sound natural, and as Ilia , Rachel Y akar turns in one o f her finest perfor\u00ad mances. though she does not quite match the creamy sweetness of Gundula Janowitz from W te h a rd 's 1964 A lbert H a ll performance (currentlv available on HRE-CD.)

A sim ilar problem faces the collertor searching for the perfea venion of V e r\u00ad d i'sOrW/o. There sim ply isn't one. P er\u00ad sonally I would lean towards Herbert von K arajan's I960 recording on L o n \u00ad don. It is to my ears John Culshaw's most successful acoustical environm ent. O f course, even its success cannot make it natural sounding, but it is spacious and places the voices in a m ythical center o f the orchestra, which (by the way) is the Vienna Philharm onic p la y\u00ad ing like gods. M a rio del M onaco's O tello is th rillin g in its bronze beauty, even if it ischaraaerized so broadly that very little is left o f O tello 's unique per\u00ad sonality. A ldo P ro tti's lago is the set's blackest failure, fo r it is neither pleasing to the ear nor rewarding for the m ind. But the one who turns the tide in favor o f this performance is Renata Tebaldi. Hers was not only the perfea voice for Desdemona. but her declamation is a sterling example o f Verdi style. K a ra ja n 's p rin c ip al com petition comes from James Levine's 1978 R C A recording w ith Pl\u00e1cido Dom ingo. Levine's conduaing is more pointed than K arajan 's \u2014 clearer in displaying V e rd i's rich polyphony and rhythm ical\u00ad ly much more vita l. Dom ingo's voice tends to get a little lost in R C A 's m ud\u00ad dier acoustk. but even at this early stage his was a more human and more com\u00ad pelling O tello than del Monaco's. Sher\u00ad r ill M ilnes renders lago w ith his customary magnificence of tone, but unfortunately w ithout any depth o f in \u00ad terpretation. The pivot is once againGiuseppe VenH. the year before tbe \" CMHk)'' p re n ie rt. Desdemona. Renata Scotto gives a most finely detailed and im aginative performance on records. The problem comes wheneser Scotto must sing high and loud. Her contribution to the A a III finale is downright painful. Continuing down the list one finds T u llio Seraf\u00edn's 1960 R C A performance with Jon Vickers in the title role. Seraf\u00edn was perhaps the most serenely powerful of all the Italian opera conduaors of this century, but his particular brand of quirt authority did not suit V e rd i's most compelling dram a. Jon V kke rs . at the beginning of his career, gives a superbly agonized interpretation o f O td lo 's predkament. I fo r one would never want to be w ithout his version o f the ' 'C o r t ig ia n a \" in te rv ie w w ith D esdem ona o r th e fo llo w in g monologue, but V icker's voice does not have the warm th needed to make V erdi's musk shine.Tito (jo b b i is likewise the most sophisticated o f a ll the lagos. the o nly one to bait his trap with intelligence. Nonetheless Gobbi does not have enough vocal weight to cut through Verdi's orchestration at crucial points. The odd holes in the m iddle of Leonie Rysanek's voice frequently rob her Desdemona o f its long, spinning lines. Even more than V ic ker's. this is sim ply the wrong voice for the job. Lorin M aazel's recent Angd record\u00ad ing is at least better than the Z e ffire lli movie made from it. Domingo has deepened his interpretation at several points and Katya Riccardli makes a sum ptuously innocent Desdemona. even if she has neither Tebaldi's ex\u00ad traordinary p u rity nor Scott's insights. But Justino D iaz is an ill-tuned and blustery lago. and M aazd 's. though good, work is not up to the best o f his predecessors. -4 No W ild,No W GIAIMIEIS Two Tango Pieces C O R R A I S T H E A T R E 1 1 <a5 G\u00ab'\u00bb S'-ee* So' -r-j /-\u00ce-W V ' >Ti'keis O ' C rf'ro\" T h e a tre O W i< e \u00ab n o ro \u00bb 09\u00ab\u00ab< r 498919 Eddie'S Not Worth Cruisingby Steve Warren It's not easy living with a perfectionist. Just ask my lover. It's not even easy spending 100 minutes with one in FxUUe and the Cruisers II: Eddie lives! Rut we'll come to that. The fact is. if most of us saw FJvis today we wouldn't recognize him. That's the irony of the opening sequence, as Fddie Wilson (Michael Pare) slips unnoticed into an Eddie Wilson look-alike contest and watches a line of gorgeous young men in black muscle shirts perform his material from 20 years before in front of hundreds of fans screaming for a man they think died before many of them were bom. In case you missed Eddie and the again and he helps Rick put a new band together, retaining o nly H ilto n (A n \u00ad thony Sherwood), the sax player, from R ick's old group. They line up a rock drum mer (Paul M arkle). a rock bassist (M ark Holmes) and a classical (!) pianist (David Matheson). The new band faces an up hill battle for popularity because the charts arc dominated by \"m ystery tapes\" featur\u00ad ing vocals by Eddie W ilson, released by his old record label which is getting rich off Eddie a ll over again w ithout having to pay him any royalties. Joe sounds so much like Eddie that he's competing with himself, although in real life the resemblance o f John Cafferty. who dubs Eddie's vocals, to Bruce Springs\u00ad teen didn't hurt sales o f the soundtrack album. W hat's curious about the new band is the political structure \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 that keeps it on the verge o f self-destructing. Y o u 've got five guys trying to run things dem ocratically, but they're outweighed by Eddie, a self- declared dictator. The overenthusiastic Rick acts like an anarchist, running off in his own direction and hoping others w ill follow . H ilto n functions asCm isiD' fo r i B n iis iii': M ic h td Pare Cruisers, it took a Citizen Kane ap\u00ad proach to piecing together the life of a rock-and-rollcr whose car had gone off a bridge in 1964. just as his band hit the big time. Eddie's body was never found, so the usual bunch o f ghouls formed a cult that refused to believe he was dead. In this case they were right, the final scene hinted strongly. Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives is a more typical story o f a band coming together and strug^ing for IS minutes before finding success. Eddie W ilson has a life in M ontreal as a con\u00ad struction worker named Joe West. He drinks beer, goes to hockey games and hangs out w ith the guys, yet he keeps a certain em otional distance from everyone. Joe's Charles Bronson manner a t\u00ad tracts the attention of Diane (M arina O rsini). who wants to paint his portrait, and a spontaneous session in a club turns Rick (Bcrnie Coulson). a would- be guitarist, into a disciple. \" They like me better dead than a liv e .\" Eddie laments, tom between the desire to make music and the fear o f re\u00ad jection. Diane persuades him to trypeacemaker in the manner o f a prime m inister w ithin a monarchy, persuading the bo,ss to think the right ideas were his own. W hile the others are out for fun. fame and fortune. Eddie insi,sts \" I t 's the music that counts,\" and drives them to rehearse when they want to be out performing. Diane goes on the road with them and is sometimes a calming influence on Eddie: but in one scene she upsets him by dancing w ith another man during a concert. He leaps off the stage and orders her to go to her room. She stands up to him for about three seconds before caving in and saying something to the effect o f \"1 love it when you're jealous.\" By the time things come together for the band to perform at M ontreal Pop. you'll be ready to push Eddie off a bridge yourself. The arrogant son o f a bitch may make good music, but it's not worth suffering his personality to hear it. Fortunately you have the option of buying the album and skipping the movie, and as in the case oiGreat Balls o f Fire! that's the way to go. F.ister paced than Eddie and the Cruisers. Eddie II isn't a bad picture, but it should follow its predecessor in selling more records than m ovie tickets.

After about four years of not a peep other than an occasionat play of an old single, he has finally surfaced again with the same energy and drive that put him on the charts years ago. A t the age o f 17, John went to Nashville on a one-way ticket to pay his dues and make his m ark in the w orld of country music. Over the years. John has received m ultiple awards, including C M A 's Song o f the Y ear. He has sold m illions o f records, including both a gold album and a gold single. The album entitled \"John Anderson 10\" is a pinnacle o f a great artistic career.But back to the side we a ll know, the wild one. The remaining portion o f the concert was a scene right out o f the television show \" Gunsmoke\" , the only thin g m issing was the ever-so- glamorous Miss K itty! The dance floor was in fu ll swing w ith a variety o f couples, ranging from young cowboys and cowgirls to hippies from Occiden\u00ad tal, C A . Country singers such as John have cer\u00ad tain rights, and he has the right to create his own style o f music on his terms. Considering a ll o f these items, one could say this is w hat has separated him from other country artists. John performed two separate shows that evening, which were both sold out to very rad fans. T o break the monotony, the form at fo r the two shows was altered, for most o f the au\u00ad dience purchased tickets fo r both shows. John pulled a ll the stops out for the last show and served up a mess of good ole country. One o f the songs that really stuck out was entitled \" Occasional Eagle\" which was perform ed effortless\u00ad ly with great feelin' and sincerity, a side to John that one would forget he has.As one can see, John draws a ll kinds o f people. As the evening progressed, it seemed as though the more radical the audience got, the more radical the band played. The sound was the real nitty- g ritty hard driving shit kic kin ' H ank W illiam s Jr. sound, to say the least. Not that they try to copy H an k's sound but it was a borderline honky tonkin rock feel. Needless to say, a good tim e was had by a ll, and the next tim e John Anderson comes to town it would be well w orth the money to see him . Look for a new single to hit the airwaves w ithin the next m onth, on the new M G M label. John Anderson International Fan Club P.O . Box becomes its own kind of poetry: taut, referential, brilliant.

And while not glos.sing over any of those faults. Rim 1201), a new City College class (as of August 22) examines contemporary lesbian and gay film, presenting a thoughtful and comprehensive twenty-week overview of gay themes in movies in (he past twenty-five years. 'I don't just choose twenty film s grotesque ways. The Fox and The with positive portrayals o f gays, even though th a t's what some o f the students w ant.\" explains course instructor Daniel Mangin o f Fram clinc (the non profit sponsor of the San Francisco .In\u00ad ternational Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.) \"A rtis ts look at human foibles as a way o f tryin g to make us better in the end and if we just saw candy-coated portraits, it would be a disservice. I try to sec what film 's role is in shaping people's values.\" Mangin is a personable, w itty and a r\u00ad ticulate expert in the field o f gay cinema. He views 1968 as the turning point year for gays in film s. \" It was a banner year, although in negative respects in a lot o f ways. There were over a dozen \u2014 The Killing o f Sister George. The Fox. The Detective. Up Tight!, among others. 1968 was the year the old Hollyw ood code fell, and that is why a lot o f these films got made.\" The first two classes w ill include screenings o f two very different film s from that landm ark year. The Detective (August 22) and The Fox (August 29). O f a ll the gay film s that came out in 1%8. The Fox is the only one that made a substantial amount o f money, says Mangin. It cost about $1.5 m illion to make, and it 's made about $16 m illio n so far. The Killing o f Sister George lost money. The Detective, did about average. But the financial success or failure o f the film s is secondary to their social impact. M angin explains: \"O ne o f the most interesting things about The Detective is how much they muted the hom osexuality in the film . They sort of had it rear its ugly head inDetective are both books that were made into film s. In The Detective the homosexuality is sloughed o ff and muted, not as strong as it is in the book. Bui with The Fox. they take everything that D .H . Lawrence im plied and make it explicit. So the two film s make a good comparison.\" Another of the 1968 film s. Jules Dassin's i/p Tight!, w ill be featured on October 24. The film is an a ll black ver\u00ad sion of John Ford's The Informer set in contemporary times. Mangin chose this particular work because \" the inform er is gay. so we get a view o f gays as out- siden, the black gay's relationship to his own society and the kind of dichotomy of being essentially outside in two ways.\" The class does not just concentrate on Hollywood product, because, as Manglin says. \"H o llyw o o d always represents homosexuality as a problem \u2014 even in Torch Song. I t 's not a given, it always becomes somehow the focus of the film , either by the acts that are in it or by what's left o u t.\" Among the foreign film s included on the schedule is Pi.xote. a 1981 film from Brazil (December 5). Mangin says. \" O f all the films. Pi.xote affected me the most. There's a kind o f transvestite character in the movie that's one o f the most sym - pathetic gay characters I 've ever seen . . . I noticed that even Pauline Kael. who is sometimes accused of gay word bashing, mentioned in her review how this character is gay. and he ac\u00ad cepts it. It 's just who he is. and he has affairs and is always trying to get people in his reform school to show affection to him . It 's a really interesting portrayal.

As a matter o f fact, some o f us have found that what we thought would he the perfect lover turned out to be closer to ground chuck than sirloin steak, so to speak! W e'd be here the rest o f the vear You sit at old tim e soda fountain tables. debating which hamburger is the best in town, and to some extent, it's like com\u00ad paring apples and oranges. If you're in the Castro. Upper M arket, and now Polk Street areas, however. I think that some o f the best burgers around may be found at Hot 'N ' H unky. H ot 'N ' Hunky is a success story for Bob Ray. It started w ith one outlet on 18th Street. H & H grew to two by ta k\u00ad ing over some of the space occupied by The M int on Market near Duboce. The latest Hot 'N ' H unky is on Polk near Bush, and also adjoins a bar. H am \u00ad burgers aren't Bob Ray's only food specialty, by the way. He also runs Bobbie R ay's Bar-B-Q on 18th Street at the site o f the form er Neon Chicken. The Polk Street H ot 'N ' H unky is done up in a kind o f up to date nostalgia, making you long for the days when you were growing up and going out one hot Saturday night for that special burger and shake w ith someone special. The walls have a checkerboard and white trim w ith some pictures of M a rilyn . There are whimsical decor touches like hula hoops and balloons.The only thing missing is The Drifters singing \"U n d e r the B oardw alk.\" The menu is fun to read, and how many places can boast about that? The Ita lia n stallion ($.V.^) is a burger with sliced ripe black olives and melted m oz\u00ad zarella which the restaurant claims \" brings out the stud in you.\" Some o f the names themselves are funny, like the Wue jo b ($3..M). a quarter pound burger w ith melted blue cheese. Jaws ($.^..^4) is their tuna sandwich, and H & H claim s: \"W e got C h a rlie !\" Looking out on Polk, one wonders if one could snag the chicken o f the sea. (Groan!) Being on the b rink o f starvation. I decided to try the double H ot 'n ' H u n ky macho man w ith cheese ($4.14). It turned out to be my only meal o f the day because it came w ith (gasp!) three quarter pound burgers, barely staying w ithin the confines of a sesame seed bun.

When parents o r relations, gay or not. are in town, one o f the best ways to impress them is to turn up a really in \u00ad teresting restaurant in the middle of a tourist area. T h at way, they can tell A unt Sally in D uluth that they've seen The W harf and you can tell your signifi\u00ad cant other that your folks are really im \u00ad pressed w ith you as a person about town because you took them to a really good restaurant. A good example o f this is the Bom \u00ad bay Palace, located in the middle o f The Cannery. T h in k o f it\u2014you've had to suffer a ll day w ith street musicians, cotton candy, Alcatraz t-shirts. Y our visitors have been snapping ro ll after ro ll of W algreen's E ktralite and saying\u2014 \"O h , Gus! Look at that! Two boys actually holding hands!\" If you don't watch out. it could turn into one o f those M aalox moments. Then The Cannery comes into view and you know that soon you'll be able to relax w ith a ta ll, cooling drink and introduce your visitors to some really delicious food in the best San Francisco tradition that even the lea.st adventurous visitor w ill adore. First, compared to some o f the ticky- tacky outside, you'll catch your breath.Bombay Palace, which also has branch\u00ad es in New Y o rk, Beverly H ills, London and Hong Kong, is visually stunning. The brick walls o f The Cannet 7 are offset by a white and pink pastel decor pattern. The tables are candlelit \u2014 you can see through glass windows into the kitchen. You can gaze down at the endless procession o f tourists on Beach Street and know that you're doing something special and your visitors w ill have something about which to ta lk onEven the half order is a generous por\u00ad tion. Even if you've never tried Indian food. I 'm almost w illin g to guarantee you'll love tandoori chicken. T in d o o ri prawns ($ 15.95) is another dish benefit- ting from this cooking process, and very appropriate to order in the Fisherman's W harf area. Tandoori mixed g rill ($17.95) is a good way to try a little of everything. To get a little more ethnic, try the keema nan ($3.25) as a side dish \u2014 it's Hot 'o' Hanky: Two triple squeeze, side order of fries. the way home. (There's no dress code, by the way, a ll are welcome.) Now some o f you skeptics may be saying \u2014 \"In d ia n food is curry and weird stuff. W hat could my A unt E m \u00ad ma possibly like at the Bombay Palace?\" To that, dear friends and fellow lovers o f life. I can give a one word reply; \" Tandoori\" Frankly. I 'm surprised that tandoori cooking hasn't passed in to the Am erican mainstream more than it has. A special clay oven reaches an internal temperature o f 8(X)\"F, and this sears in the flavor but leaves the meat juic y. I don't think any chicken lover alive could resist the Bombay Palace's suc\u00ad culent m urgh tin ($7.95 half order; $14.95 full order), m arinated in yogurt and other spices and seared to a juic y perfection.a soft, to rtilla like bread stufffed with lamb and spices. An appetizer blending the fam iliar and unfam iliar is chicken pakora ($4.50). featuring chicken pieces m arinated in Indian spices and then batter fried. There are a wide variety of curry dishes and b iryani dishes featuring spic ed rice with lots o f add ons. but to play it safe and get something everyone w ill love, try the tandoori.

As Mayor Agnos' campaign gets rolling, we gays in favor of it should let our support be known loud and clear. And support there is among sports-minded gays, the number of which greatly exceed those influenced by the self-acdaimed power brokers of the Toklas & Milk clubs. Conservatively speaking, there are 10,000 of us. If you add that to our friends and be a boon to the new transit lines relatives you are talking about a damn large bloc o f voters. I dare the Rec-Park to continue to ignore us. And incidentally M ayor Agnos has given us a guarantee that we w ill be treated fa irly in the future. Candlestick fo r future G ay Games and G ay W orld Series are distinct possibilities. Ih e m ayor w ill sup\u00ad port us. I have interviewed lite ra lly hundreds of gay athletes and their ^en ds and have found no substantial opposition to C hina Basin. Such diverse gay per\u00ad sonages as Tom V in d e ^ , Tom Scherck, Jo D aly, Phyllis Lyon, Del M a rtin , our publisher, Ray C halker, Tony Jasinski, Bob Cram er, Chuck Dem on, the Em peror Jerry C olleti and Empress Pat M ontclaire all express strong sup\u00ad port o f Agnos' proposed site. The list goes on ad infinitum. W h ile the intensity and reasoning of their support may vary, I honestly believe that the following letter from our S .F .P .A . w riter, that bon vivam o f local pool halls, Rick M arian i, is typical o f how m any o f us feel. \" As a native San Franciscan. Potrero H ill resident, and avid Giants fan, I opposed the original stadium pro\u00ad posal. This time, however, w ith the transportation questions settled and much more planning behind the con\u00ad cept, I am very much in favor of building a stadium in the C hina Basin area. Regardless of the pros and cons to this new ballpark, another question arises which needs our attention. We need to \"p la y b a ll\" w ith o ur m ayor. A rt A g n o s \u00ab our friend!

Let's show A rt we know this basic concept and vote for the stadium !\" H aving seen and listened to the M ayo r, as well as to the opponents o f Proposition P, I cannot find fault . . . and you a ll know how I love to find fault w ith th in g s. . . w ith any o f the m ayor's positions. He and his commission have taken great care to see to it that there w ill be m inim al transit or parking headaches for the local citizenry. If anything, usage by future ballpark patrons shouldalready financially committed to serv\u00ad ing the Mission Bay development, which w ill go on with o r without the proposed stadium. The value o f a m ajor league fran\u00ad chise, whether it be baseball o r football, to the economy o f Am erican cities is a proven fact. W hy else would Chicago pay over $100 m illio n to keep the low ly W hite Sox? Also ask the citizens and officials o f a rejuvenated Pittsburgh, Pa . . . recent\u00ad ly chosen as the best m ajor city in the U .S .A . to live . . . fo r the second straight year. . . how im portant the Three R iver Stadium was to the rem arkable rebirth o f their city. The same goes for C incinnati's Riverfront Stadium and even to the m inor league city o f Buffalo, which has attracted new industry and unexpected growth since their construction o f a ma\u00ad jo r league type s ta d iu m . . . over 1,000,000 attendance for a T rip le A team. O u r recent voting patterns have shown that the gay com m unity has grown beyond the realm o f a special in \u00ad terest group. We have proved ourselves to be a m ajor and v ita l part o f the city o f San Francisco. W hile its prosperity and success is ours to enjoy, we have acknowledged that it is also o ur respon\u00ad s ib ility to m aintain and enhance that prosperity. Voting yes on Proposition P continues that pattern. The proposed stadium w ill ensure continued v ita lity and a San Francisco that w ill attract not only tourists but new business and new fam ilies, both straight and gay. I empathize w ith those gays who rig h tfu lly w orry about the ever-present despair o f A ID S and fear that the finan cing o f the new stadium w ill somehow effect the financial burden we as San Franciscans face now and in the future However, the M ayor assured those in attendance at his recent meeting with the gay press that any monies involved would not in anyway come from funds alloted towards A ID S . He emphasized that the first year o f his term saw a 36 per cent increase in A ID S funding and such funding w ill remain the number one p rio rity in his adm inistration. In order for the city o f San Francisco to live up to its commitment to the A ID S crisis, it must be a fiscally sound entity. The m ayor contends, and I agree, that the approval o f the China Basin stadium and the retention o f both the Giants and the 49'ers w ill ensure just that. I sincerely hope that those gays who come out to support the Domestic Part ner b ill w ill also support M ayor Agnos and his China Basin proposal. Both propositions w ill make San Francisco better city for its citiz.ens, be they gay or straight. U n til next tim e, keep winning. And remember, if you can't play a sport, be one. Statewide Sport C overete with the SentinelTsunami Continues Its Record Setting Paceby Jeff Alien Weicome to Santa Cruz, this sunny beach and surf town whose famed boardwalk attracts thousands a year to its amusement park. The salty ocean air mixes with the smell of processed sugar and french fries bubbling in oil. Families, tourists, and beefy guys wearing trendy rubber sunglasses stroll down the honky-tonk walkway to queue up for one of many rides, or play the funky arcades. Ralph Doore, a 32-year-old com\u00ad puter consultant from San Francisco, is standing in line with a companion fo r a ride on the \" Giant D ipper,\" the boardw alk's rickety wooden ro lle r coaster. \" How long is the rid e ?\" D oore's nervous companion asks the ticket taker. \" Tw o m inutes,\" the ticket man replies. \" Yeah, tw o minutes,\" Doore says, \" but it 'll seem like forever.\" The ride, w ith its steep ascents, sharp drops, and whipping iumsdid feel like an etern ity, but it didn't compare to the scary event Dore had experienced about an hour before\u2014swimming the 200 meter butterfly! Doore. a member o f the Tsunam i G ay & Lesbian Masters Swim C lub, had come to UC-Santa C ruz, a few miles from the boardwalk, to compete in the 1989 Pacific Masters Long Cburse Swimming Championships. Tsunam i took an overall fifth place in the meet, held July 28-30, w ith team\u00ad mates registering 102 personal best times, setting 21 team records, and 35 San Francisco Recreation and Park records. Doore swam his best tim e, 3:34.35, in the 200 m fly, plus personal bests in the 100m fly, iciom breaststroke and 200m breaststroke. \" Even though they were m y personal bests, I was s till hoping fo r better in all m y events,\" Doore said. \" I was way off m y yardage times.\" Keith \" Coverman\" Sklow er, 37, a lso a com p uter p ro g ra m m e r, demonstrated once again the tenacity o f a bulldog in grabbing a personal best of 3:40.40 in the 200 individual medley. He also tackled the 800m freestyle, the 200m freestyle, the 200m breaststroke, and the 400 individual medley. \" Because my practice times were slower, I expected to do poorly, so I 'm pleased that I did as well as I d id,\" said Sklower, who took second place in both the 200m fly and 400 I.M . He has won the adm iration o f his teammates for tackling a grueling sport late in life \u2014and taking on some of the toughest events. \" The only way I can get a ribbon and get points of the team is to enter events few people w ill enter,\" Sklower said. The meet, which lasted nearly 12 hours one day and 10 hours another, was also the scene o f other Tsunami trium phs, some profoundly gutsy. Forget what you've been told about low helper T< ells. One swimmer, who months ago had undergone chemotherapy treatm ent fo r lym\u00ad phoma. grabbed a personal best in the50 backstroke and competed in the 200 I.M ., lOOm lOOm breaststroke. Lavonne H ing, 32-year-old cer\u00ad tified public accountant from Foster C i\u00ad ty . snapped 10 seconds off her 100m free to clock 1:36.87, a feat she modest\u00ad ly attributed to Tsunam i coach Chris A lle n. \" I did it a ll with his help and pa\u00ad tience.\" H ing said. \" He changed my stroke after noticing that m y arms were crossing over too m uch. He watched me on the 200m free at a meet in V an\u00ad couver last February and noticed that 1 had a powerful kick so he said, 'Let's start work on your p u ll.' \" Rick W indes. 34, o f San Francisco w ill be one of the big Tsunam i boys to watch next year at G ay Games I I I in Vancouver. He look first place in the 1500m freestyle in 18:22.52, but said, \" I enjoyed the 200m I.M . a lot m ore.\" He took 10 seconds o ff the 200 I.M . in an upset win over John Roemer of W alnut Creek. O ther big Tsunam i guns to watch at Gay Games I I I w ill be Joe Healy and Taite D arlington. Friends both in and out of the water, (they were teammates in a recent open-water relay meet), Healy and D arlington w ill be rivals at Vancouver in the 200m and 400m freestyle events. Healy. 29, volunteer coordinator for the Shanti Project's practical support program , was one o f four men who set a national record in Santa Cruz of 9:40.00\u2014 3 second faster than the previous record tim e\u2014 for the 800 meter freestyle relay. He beat D arlington in the 400m free by one second\u2014 but D arling to n defeated Healy in the 200m free by a se\u00ad cond. D arlington, who works for a sport- wear company and is a high school All-Am erican, noted, \" I beat Joe in the lOOm free, you know, by two seconds.\" \" W e ll,\" Healy sniffed, \" I swam the 100m fly and that bitch didn't even enter!\" M eanw hile, M ike M a rtin i, the youngest Tsunam i, w ill soon be leaving San Francisco fo r San Diego where he'll attend graduate school. His aggressive breaststroke and zany antics both in and out o f the lockerroom w ill be miss\u00ad ed. M a rtin i's move w ill be a loss for Tsunam i, a relatively young swim team that has succeeded in keeping its membership strong despite attrition. \" Tsunam i is still together and very much a te a m ,\" Lavonne Hing said. \" Even though we don't a ll train together now, hopefully we'll all be together in Vancouver.\"Gay Sports Day on Angel Island San Francisco FrontRunners arc again sponsoring Gay Sports D ay on Angel Island, the eighth year o f this event.
