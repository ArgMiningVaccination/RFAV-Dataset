The Global Alliance for VaccinesInitiative (GAVI) recently opened a funding window that has motivated more widespread roll-out of RCV. As countries plan RCV introductions, an understanding of the existing burden, spatial patterns of vaccine coverage,and the impact of patterns of local extinction and reintroduction for rubella will be critical to developing effective programmes. As one of the first countries proposing RCV introduction in part with GAVI funding, Madagas-car provides a powerful and timely case study. We analyse serological data from measles surveillance systems to characterize the epidemiology of rubella in Madagascar. Combining these results with data on measles vaccinationdelivery, we develop an age-structured model to simulate rubella vaccination scenarios and evaluate the dynamics of rubella and the burden of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) across Madagascar. We additionally evaluate the dri-vers of spatial heterogeneity in age of infection to identify focal locations where vaccine surveillance should be strengthened and where challenges to successful vaccination introduction are expected. Our analyses indicate thatcharacteristics of rubella in Madagascar are in line with global observations, with an average age of infection near 7 years, and an impact of frequent local extinction with reintroductions causing localized epidemics. Modellingresults indicate that introduction of RCV into the routine programme alone may initially decrease rubella incidence but then result in cumulative increases in the burden of CRS in some regions (and transient increases in this burdenin many regions). Deployment of RCV with regular supplementary cam- paigns will mitigate these outcomes. Results suggest that introduction of RCV offers a potential for elimination of rubella in Madagascar, but alsoemphasize both that targeted vaccination is likely to be a lynchpin of this success, and the public health vigilance that this introduction will require. 1. Introduction Rubella is a directly transmitted immunizing infection that usually occursduring childhood and is associated with low morbidity and mortality. Infection of women during early pregnancy can lead to spontaneous abortion, fetal death &2016 The Authors.

A relatively inexpensive, high efficacy vaccine that pro- vides lifelong immunity to rubella and can easily be combined as measles-rubella (MR), or measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) has been available for 50 years. Although rou- tine rubella vaccination can prevent CRS, inadequate vaccination coverage may actually increase CRS cases byincreasing the average age of infection [3]; this occurs because vaccination short of the threshold required for elimination effectively reduces incidence in the population, thus reducingthe risk of infection and delaying time to the first infection (figure 1). Consequently, introduction of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) has been limited globally. Recent efforts forthe control and elimination of measles have spurred renewed interest in the potential for rubella control, because the two vaccines are easily combined, and overall measles vaccinationcoverage levels have been climbing [4]. In addition, the Global Alliance for Vaccines Initiative (GAVI) has recently opened a funding window for rubella vaccination [5]. Mada-gascar is one of the countries that has successfully applied for this funding. For all low- and middle-income countries that take advan- tage of the GAVI funding window, introduction of RCV will likely be shaped by the context of measles childhood immu- nization efforts. In Madagascar, measles vaccination wasintroduced into the routine programme in 2004. Coverage increased steeply until political upheavals in 2009, at which point levels fell again; currently, measles vaccination coverage(defined as the number of doses delivered divided by the target population size) today hovers around 85% in Madagas- car [6]. One of the perceived possible advantages ofintroduction of RCV is strengthened investment in measles programmes [7], an important potential public health benefit in Madagascar. However, these benefits must be balancedwith broader consequences, including potential negative out- comes of introduction of RCV for the burden of CRS [8]. Birth rates in Madagascar remain relatively high (more than30 per 1000 per year [9]), and theory suggests that high birth rates are associated with a low burden of CRS in the absence of vaccination [10], making investment for RCV less of apublic health priority. Further, with high birth rates, and par- ticularly in the context of high transmission, a very high threshold of vaccination coverage is required to movebeyond coverage levels that result in increases in the CRS burden [10]. A final complication is that even where coverage is sufficiently high to ensure a country-scale reduction in theCRS burden, heterogeneous vaccination coverage might result in increases in inequity in the burden of CRS [11,12]. Local rubella extinction allows susceptible women to ageinto their childbearing years while still retaining susceptibility, thus creating regions at high risk for CRS. Vaccination may alter the flow of infected individuals into these high-riskregions to further elevate the burden of CRS [11]. Understanding key features of the context, and delineat- ing the possible consequences of introduction of RCV intoMadagascar has implications for other low-income countries. Many countries across the AFRO region are considering introduction of RCV, and although the WHO position pieceon rubella vaccination emphasizes the importance of immu- nizing women age [13], GAVI is not00.10.20.30.40.5equilibrium infected ( I*) 10152025303540average age of infection 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.00 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.00 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 00.20.40.60.81.01.21.4 vaccination covera ge of the birth cohort ( v)schematic ratio of burden pre- and post-vaccination(b)(a) (c) Figure 1.

(c) This conjunction of declining incidence but increasing average age of infection has the potential to yield a situation where more cases are occur-ring in women of childbearing age, even though the total number of cases is declining. As a result, the ratio of the equilibrium burden of CRS in the presence of vaccination relative to the equilibrium burden of CRS if no vaccination hasoccurred ( y-axis) may first increase with vaccination coverage relative to the scen- ario of no vaccination (indicated by the hori zontal grey line); eventually declining when incidence is sufficiently low to offset the increase in the average age ofinfection. (Results in the last panel are hypothetical; exact values will depend on the variance and skew of the distribut ion of age of infection; as well as pat- tern of fertility over age). This pattern o f increasing CRS burden with increasing vaccination coverage has been called 'the paradoxical increase of rubella'.rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 13: 201511012supplying funding beyond that required for introduction into routine childhood immunization programmes. As a result, few countries are investigating this possibility. Understand- ing the risks associated with a focus on routine vaccinationalone, when compared with routine vaccination with invest- ments into regular campaigns, is of considerable public health relevance [14]. It is possible that the particular demo-graphic and vaccination profiles of a given region may be such that routine vaccination will result in serious conse- quences [15]; and it is important that we consider allpossible outcomes when designing public health policy. Detailed characterization of a country's situation before and after introduction of RCV remains the exception in thecurrent landscape of global health. Using existing data from Madagascar, we are in a position to document the current status of the burden of CRS (thus providing a baseline forfurther evaluation), identify key surveillance needs and develop a better understanding of the risks in a broader public health context. Here, we draw on data from a range of sources to ask (i) What is the current epidemiology of rubella in Madagascar? (ii) What is the current context of measles vaccination deliveryin Madagascar, and what does this mean for how RCV will be deployed? and (iii) What are the likely consequences of intro- duction of RCV on both the incidence of rubella and the burden of CRS? We conclude by discussing what thesepatterns suggest for rubella roll-out more broadly, across low-income countries likely to capitalize on the GAVI initiative. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Epidemiology of rubella in Madagascar Rubella data were obtained via the system of general surveillance for measles in Madagascar (figure 2). For all patients presentingwith fever, generalized rash, and either cough, coryza or con-junctivitis, a serum specimen was collected, and subsequentlytested using standard serological techniques at the WHOnational reference laboratory located at the Institut Pasteur ofMadagascar in Antananarivo. Samples that were measles IgMnegative were tested for rubella IgM antibody. These assays sup-plied information about the age range and incidence of rubellathrough time across the six major provinces of Madagascar,and a Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (TSIR)model was fit to the data (see electronic supplementary material,2006 2008 2010 2012 20140510152025reported rubella incidence seasonal transmission ( bt) 24681012 Jan Feb Mar Apr May June July Aug Sep Oct Nov DecXmas Feb Easter Summer All Saints 0 5 10 15 20 2500.20.40.60.81.0 age (years)CDF Antananarivo Toamasina Fianarantsoa MahajangaToliara Antsiranana(c)(a)( b) (d) 0.09-0.10.055-0.090.051-0.0550.047-0.0510.043-0.0470.037-0.0430.031-0.0370.019-0.0310.016-0.0190.013-0.016Rubella cases per 1000 pop Figure 2.

This framework allows for estimation of the fraction of rubella cases that are reported (or reporting rate, here denoted r), as well as the starting proportion susceptible ( /C22S), and seasonal fluctuations in rubella transmission ( bs). It would be of consider- able interest to compare these patterns to the spatial andtemporal trends in incidence of CRS. However, the variety ofsymptoms associated with CRS and the multiplicity of possiblealternative causes of many of these symptoms (such as deafnessor cataracts) makes CRS surveillance intractable in low resourcesettings where serological testing is a rarity; data on CRS arenot currently available for Madagascar. 2.2. Characterizing measles vaccination in Madagascar We consulted the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Madagascar andUNICEF for details on recent measles vaccination coverage. Rou-tine vaccination is provided at most public and private clinicsand aims to vaccinate all children around nine months of age.Two additional opportunities for vaccination also exist: (i) Sup-plementary Immunization Campaigns (occurring in 2007, 2010and 2013) intended to complement routine vaccination and(ii) mother and child health days, targeting children between 9and 11 months, which are bi-annual campaigns intended to pro- vide care to the most remote and vulnerable mother and children populations in the country. Vaccination services are provided bythe national health authorities (MOH) and non-governmentalorganizations, primarily UNICEF. We obtained estimates of rou-tine immunization coverage from the MOH for each of the 22regions (figure 3 b) of Madagascar in 2014. These data measure the number of doses distributed in each region divided by thetarget population size, and values range from 52% (in theregion of Melaky region) to 92% (in Vakinankaratra region),with an average of 77% (table 1). Deviations in population sizeas well as the uneven success of dose delivery make these uncer-tain measures of vaccine delivery [16]. To provide a conservativeyet comparable analysis across regions, we therefore used exist-ing administrative data from 2015, which include dosesdelivered up to 7 July 2015. These estimates range from 5% (inAtsimo-Atsinana) to 70%, (in Vakinankaratra) with an averageof 37% (table 1). The reality of measles vaccination coverage inMadagascar is almost certainly greater than these estimates suggest, but these values provide a conservative baseline fromwhich to evaluate areas at risk for increases in the CRS burdenin the event of rubella vaccine introduction. 2.3. The burden of congenital rubella syndrome To project the burden of CRS in Madagascar in each of the22 regions and evaluate the impact of vaccination programmes,we simulated the age-structured dynamics of rubella in Mada-gascar (electronic supplementary material, figure S2). Withinthe simulation, we classified individuals by their age (usingmonthly age classes up to age 15 and yearly classes thereafter),and epidemiological status (tracking individuals acrossMaternally immune, Susceptible, Infected, Recovered andVaccinated classes). We used region-specific birth rates (fromwww.worldpop.org.uk), and a mortality curve derived fromUN projections to capture demographic patterns; we set the gen-eration time of rubella to be two weeks, introduced knownpatterns of waning of maternal immunity and vaccine efficacy[10], and explored different levels of R 0(defined as the average number of secondary infections from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population). The range of R0values was determined by referencing existing estimates for rubella(ranging from 2 [17] to 12 [18]) and choosing values consistentwith the age range of rubella observed in the epidemiologicaldata described above (using the fact that R 0is approx. equal to G/A, where Gis the inverse of the birth rate and Ais the average age of infection [19]). We also introduced reported levels ofroutine vaccination coverage for each region for measles fromthe two sources described above (table 1), and made the conser-vative assumption that vaccination coverage in StartingCampaigns and Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIA)reaches 60% of the population. The time horizon chosen forevaluation of the burden of CRS and the impact of vaccinationwas 30 years; we also evaluated the number of years duringwhich the burden of CRS was higher than it would have beenat equilibrium pre-vaccination following introduction of CRS burden (c)( d) (a) Figure 3. The burden of CRS. ( a) Simulated deterministic burden of CRS over 30 years in the absence of vaccination for each region; and ( b) Current routine vaccination coverage values per region (taking the lower conservative scale of routine vaccination coverage). ( c) Simulated deterministic burden of CRS over 30 years following introduction of routine vaccination only (set at the conservative lower bound) divided by the simulated deterministic burden of CRS obtained in the absence of vaccination (shown in figure 3 a)). Where the ratio exceeds 1, the introduction of vaccination has resulted in an increase in the burden of CRS. ( d) Similarly, ratio of the simulated deterministic burden of CRS over 30 years following introduction of routine vaccination with a starting campaign reaching up to age 10, and follow-up campaigns to age 5 occurring every 4 years; all campaigns have a coverage of 60%. The full colour scale for ratios encompasses values more than 1.3 not observed here, but to enable comparison of outcomes with R0\u00bc8 (electronic supplementary material, figure S6), and detection of areas where the ratio exceeds 1. See the electronic supplementary material, table S1 for the full set of results. (Online version in colour.)rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 13: 2015110142.4. Metapopulation dynamics and the burden of congenital rubella syndrome The simulations described above provide insight into the deter- ministic burden of CRS. However, previous work indicates thatstochastic dynamics within the broader 'metapopulation', or net- work of communities across which rubella persists, or goes extinct and is reintroduced, can result in increased burden insome locations [12]; these same metapopulation processes candrive spatial inequity in changes in the burden of CRS followingintroduction of the vaccine [11]. Local extinction underpins thesechanges in CRS burden by allowing susceptible individuals toage into later age classes, and potentially their childbearingyears, without exposure to the infection. This leaves them vulner-able to a potential re-introduction of the infection occurringduring their pregnancies. Consequently, we also sought to ident-ify areas in Madagascar most likely to be affected by stochasticmetapopulation dynamics. To do this, we evaluated thenumber of districts with population sizes less than the expectedCritical Community Size (CCS) for rubella. The CCS describesthe minimum population size required to sustain an immunizinginfection without stochastic extinction [20], an empirical measurewhich combines both the theoretical extinction boundary for theinfection (assuming a well-mixed population), but also the impact of patterns of re-introduction. While by convention, theCCS is usually framed in terms of total numbers of individuals[20] in reality, the key value will be number of susceptible indi-viduals in a community. Nevertheless, to align with previouswork, we focus on total population size and concentrate ourevaluations of the CCS only in non-vaccination settings. Wefocused on districts (smaller administrative units than the regionsconsidered above) in this analysis, because these smaller spatialscales are more likely to represent reasonably well-mixed popu-lations. Evidence from South Africa suggests that the CCS forrubella may be of a similar scale to measles [21], i.e. around350 000, although data from other countries suggest that itmight be closer to 1 000 000 [12,21,22]; simulation approachessuggest that this estimate may be biased upwards [21]. Under-reporting of rubella cases in this dataset precludes direct investigation of the CCS [11], instead we independentlyevaluated population sizes and their connectivity for districtsof Madagascar. With gridded population maps from World Pop (www.worldpop.org.uk), we identified districts with popu- lation sizes below the upper the range of previous CCS estimates[11], i.e. 350 000-1 000 000. We then developed expectations forthe number of new arrivals in each location based on classic grav-ity models [23,24]. We used the travel times between centroids ofdistricts as the distance [25-27] using geospatial techniques (seethe electronic supplementary material) to develop an accessibil-ity/travel time matrix. Connectivity is measured based on theamount of outgoing travel from each location from the gravitymodel using travel time distance between district centroids,which yields an index of connectivity for each location (see theelectronic supplementary material). More remote areas havefewer trips to other areas of the country. From this, we identifieddistricts that were both weakly connected (remote) and below theCCS threshold, taking both the upper and lower ranges of CCSreported globally. We used stochastic simulations to test expec-tations for the relationship between connectivity and averageage of infection in a district below the CCS (electronic sup-plementary material, figure S3) finding that more weaklyconnected locations are expected to show higher variance inthe average age of infection. We then plotted average age ofinfection reported in the incidence data against our index of con-nectivity to evaluate the degree to which these estimates are ableto identify locations at risk of later infection associated withextinction-recolonization dynamics. 2.5. Metapopulation dynamics and the potential for rubella extinction in Madagascar Madagascar is an island and rubella dynamics are predomi- nantly driven by national patterns of incidence, extinction and reintroduction. Data on births and population size for each of the 22 regions of Madagascar, and our TSIR estimates of season-ality in rubella transmission, provide us with the means tosimulate stochastic local regional dynamics for rubella. We canextend these simulations to investigate Madagascar-wide meta-population dynamics by using the estimates of travelmagnitude between each of the pairs districts (accessibilitymatrix) described above. As these measures are relative ratherthan absolute [25-27], we first rescaled these measures suchthat they resulted in metapopulation dynamics that reflected esti-mates of the CCS of rubella in the pre-vaccination era within therange reported for rubella globally (350 000-1 000 000; see theelectronic supplementary material, figure S4). Next, we intro-duced RCV into this framework at rates reported for measlesvaccination coverage from administrative coverage in 2014, aswell as increased rates, with the aim of identifying the thresholdrequired for rubella elimination in this setting.Table 1. Measles vaccination coverage in Madagascar. Vaccination coverage in each of the 22 regions, from the 2014 administrative coverage estimates(i.e. doses delivered divided by target population size); and also showing the early 2015 coverage, taken as a conservative lower boundary, as this reflects reports on doses delivered only up until June of 2015, and isaccordingly likely an underestimate of doses delivered. regions2014 admin coverageearly 2015 admin coverage Results 3.1. Epidemiology of rubella in Madagascar Under-reporting in the incidence data affected our ability to estimate the proportion of the population susceptible to rubella (see figure 2 aand the electronic supplementary material, S1). However, the TSIR model indicated a clear pat- tern of seasonality in transmission, with low transmission in February, June and October, which was robust to the rangeof assumptions about starting proportion susceptible (figure 2 b). Surprisingly, the timing of low transmission does not align with summer school holidays, in contrast to whathas been reported for rubella and other immunizing childhood infections in many other parts of the world [22,28,29]. Given low reported incidence (figure 2 a), we focused our initial descriptive analysis of the epidemiology of rubella in Madagascar at the largest administrative scale available, the six provinces of Madagascar. The average age of infectionof rubella is slightly variable across these provinces, ranging from 6.4 years in the province of Antananarivo to 8.8 years in Antsiranana (figure 2 c). Average age broadly negatively cor- relates with province population size (Pearson's correlation between log population size and average age of infection yields r\u00bc20.82, n\u00bc6,p,0.05), suggesting an underlying biological driver for this pattern. Two possible drivers of this average infection age distribution include (i) extinc- tion-recolonization dynamics, which drive up the averageage of infection in smaller population provinces [12]\u2014 implying that provinces with smaller populations also have smaller focal population centres, precluding persistence ofrubella or (ii) a higher R 0for rubella in provinces with larger populations (although see [29] for evidence that measles, a similar directly transmitted infections, shows nosignature of density-dependent transmission). With the data available, it is not possible to distinguish between these two possibilities. Using the approximation R 0\u00bcG/A (which assumes negligible stochastic dynamics), where Gis the inverse of the birth rate, and Ais the average age of infec- tion, the average age of infection in the data yields estimatesofR 0between 3.9 in Antsiranana province and 5.5 in Antana- narivo province. This range is broadly in line with values previously reported for this infection [15,30,31]. 3.2. Consequences of introduction of rubella-containing vaccination: deterministic simulations Simulation of region-specific dynamics built around the esti- mated profile of seasonal transmission (figure 2 b) and with R0\u00bc5 (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S2 for an example time-series), indicates that in the absence ofvaccination, the number of CRS cases varies across the 22 regions of Madagascar between six new CRS cases (in Melaky) and 73 (Analamanga) per year; or between 60 and81 cases per 100 000 births (figure 3 a). Introduction of RCV into the routine programme at the lower reported levels of administrative coverage (figure 3 b) results in a reduction in the burden of CRS in all but five regions (figure 3 c, Androy, Atsimo-Andrefana, Atsimo-Atsinana, Ihorombe and Melaky); CRS burden is reduced in all regions whenthe less conservative 2014 estimates of coverage are used (table 1). In both simulations, a number of years of transient outbreaks with a CRS burden higher than would have beenobserved in the absence of vaccination occur (electronic sup- plementary material, table S1). If an SIA with 60% coverage is introduced at the same time as the start of routine vaccination against rubella, and maintained at 4 year intervals targetingup to 5 year olds, then the burden of CRS is successfully reduced in all 22 regions (figure 3 d), and the transient increases in the CRS burden also disappear. Parallel resultswith R 0\u00bc8 are shown in the electronic supplementary material, figure S6; for this magnitude of transmission, more regions are at risk of an increase if routine vaccinationonly is introduced; again, public health consequences can be mitigated by deployment of SIAs. Finally, in this setting, starting campaigns reaching beyond 10 years of age showvery little improvement relative to those only extending to 10 years of age (results not shown). The full set of results is shown in the electronic supplementary material, table S1. 3.3. The stochastic burden of rubella: exploring risk The majority (54%, 61 out of 114 reporting districts) of districts'populations in Madagascar are below the lower end of therubella CCS range (350 000), and all but one are below the upper threshold of 1 million (99%, 113 out of 114 districts). Population size and connectivity are strongly correlated(figure 4 a) so many districts are both weakly connected (remote) and below both the higher and lower threshold of CCS, shown in figure 4 a(electronic supplementary material, figure S4 aindicates the underlying patterns of connectivity), indicating potential for both local extinction, and a long inter- val before re-introduction of the rubella infection. Although inthe simplest analysis, local extinction of an infectious disease seems a desirable outcome, in the context of rubella, principles from metapopulation dynamics suggest that these remotelocations below the CCS (depicted on the inset map, figure 4 a) may have a higher burden of CRS pre-vaccination, as disease-free periods may allow ageing of susceptibles intotheir childbearing years, leaving them vulnerable to sub- sequent rubella introductions [12], an issue that may be amplified by inequity in vaccination coverage [21]. One way to evaluate the degree to which our measure of connectivity is dynamically relevant is to evaluate the relation- ship between average age of infection and remoteness fordistricts that are below 1 000 000, and thus expected to be vul- nerable to stochastic extinction (figure 4 b). If our connectivity index is capturing a measure of relevance to stochastic extinc-tion, based on simulations of the stochastic dynamics in a location below the CCS (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S3), we expect increased variance in the aver-age age of infection for more remote districts below the upper bound on the CCS. This is broadly what is observed (figure 4) and indicates that higher average age of infection can occur inthese less connected districts and potentially poses risks for an elevated burden of CRS. Qualitatively similar results are obtained for the lower threshold on the CCS. 3.4. Vaccination and extinction of rubella in Madagascar Ultimately, the appropriate epidemiological unit for investi-gating metapopulation dynamics is probably the scale of cities [29]. The closest available scale in this dataset is the districts, as mentioned above. However, in the face ofthe sparseness of the population in Madagascar, and under-reporting of rubella, in considering the potential for extinction of rubella in Madagascar, we focused on regionalrsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 13: 201511016scale dynamics. This is equivalent to assuming that each of the 22 regions is reasonably well mixed, and further subdivi- sions should broadly act to reduce persistence of rubella in Madagascar, by reducing the number of locations above theCCS, so this scale of analysis should be reasonably conserva- tive. Even at this greater spatial scale, the majority of regions (55%, 12 out of 22 regions) have populations that are belowthe upper end of the CCS range of 1 000 000; a few are also below the threshold for measles of 350 000 (14%, 3 out of 22 regions). Given the isolated nature of Madagascar, low burden of CRS, and increased international and national public health support for control of vaccine-preventable diseases,we analysed the potential for rubella elimination, using simu- lations of regional dynamics of rubella (see the electronic supplementary material, figures S4 and S5; figure 5). At thecurrent levels of vaccination coverage, the probability of rubella elimination, corresponding to zero rubella incidence in all 22 regions (i.e. points clustered at the top of the barcharts in figure 5 a) after 20 years of vaccination ranges from 15% (at low levels of connectivity) to 8% (at a high level of connectivity). This probability was estimated as the pro-portion of simulations (across the 100 simulations) that went extinct in all 22 regions. If vaccination coverage was increased to 90% in all locations, the probability of rubellaextinction increases to 39%, regardless of connectivity scalar(from the points clustered at the top of figure 5 b). If vacci- nation coverage is increased in focal, well-connected regions only, the probability of rubella elimination moves from 20% at low connectivity and 9% at high connectivity (valuesclustered at the top of figure 5 c). 4. Discussion With increased support from the Global Alliance of Vaccines, countries that have previously withheld RCV out of concernsfor the potential paradoxical increase in the burden of rubella are now considering introduction of the vaccine. This endea- vour presents an opportunity to reduce the burden of apreventable disease (CRS), but may also have additional public health benefits; in particular, that of strengthening existing measles vaccination programmes [32]. Evaluationof the effectiveness of introduction of RCV into a specific country requires an understanding of (i) the current epide- miology of rubella and burden of CRS; (ii) possible areasof increased burden given the landscape of vaccination cover- age; and (iii) likely sources and sinks for localized extinction and re-introduction. These factors can be combined to evalu-ate the effectiveness of vaccination strategies for both routine and supplementary programmes, as well as the potential of rubella elimination.lowlow high connectivit ymean age of infection population (M) 51015202500.51.01.5(a) (b) med-low Figure 4.

Connectivity is a relative measure derived from the amount of incoming travel estimated from a gravity model to each district; districts are re mote if there is less travel. ( b) For districts below the CCS, mean age of infection ( y-axis) plotted against the index of connectivity ( x-axis), with districts that are weakly connected and below the lower limit of the CCS, but also have experienced a higher average age of infection (and thus might have experienced a higher burden of CRS) shown on the figure and the map in blue.rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 13: 201511017We evaluated this public health question in the context of Madagascar, a country planning to introduce RCV in the upcoming year (2016). Analysis of rubella data yields resultsbroadly consistent with other descriptions of rubella epide- miology, although the characteristic under-reporting often noted for this infection (which may be so mild as to beasymptomatic) results in considerable uncertainty in some of our inference. In particular, the seasonal pattern detected here does not show strong alignment with school terms(figure 2 b), in contrast with frequently reported patterns [22,28,33], but uncertainty is sufficiently high such that an alternate pattern (e.g. alignment with agricultural seasonswith increased rainfall beginning in October-November [34]) cannot be affirmed with certainty. A first major concern associated with introduction of RCV is avoidance of the paradoxical effect, i.e. a reduction in rubella incidence insufficient to offset the average age of infection, thus leading to an increase in the burden of CRS[3]. Our age-structured simulation analyses broadly support introduction of RCV in Madagascar, particularly if introduc- tion is accompanied by wide age range campaigns that couldbe implemented via the existing two forms of additional vaccination opportunities discussed above (SIAs and mother-child health days). When such an additionalvaccination campaign is in place, neither long term nor tran- sient increases in the CRS burden, as previously observed in Greece [35] and Costa Rica [36], are observed in simulationsfor rubella in Madagascar (including simulations with R 0 values as high as 8). These results rest on administrative esti- mates of routine vaccination coverage. As these estimates arefrequently known to be overestimates [16], we also explored scenarios of low routine coverage (table 1) and obtained broadly similar results. A second major concern associated with introduction of RCV is potential for amplification of inequities associated with the metapopulation dynamics of this infection [11], in par-ticular those associated with heterogeneity in vaccine coverage [37,38]. The deterministic simulations described above ignore the role of stochastic dynamics [12], which can interact withvariation in vaccination coverage [11], potentially resulting in local increases in the burden of CRS. To explore these latter issues, we also identified all districts both below the CCS forrubella and weakly connected (remote; figure 4). Variance in the age of incidence broadly increased with diminishing con- nectivity, suggesting a role for metapopulation dynamics(although spatial variance in R 0cannot be excluded) and high- lighting districts that should be a special focus in evaluating the consequences of introduction of the vaccine.

Interface 13: 201511018the underlying cause, districts with higher average age of infec- tion are more at risk of being associated with a higher CRS burden. Having explored the risks of introduction of RCV into Madagascar, we next investigated positive externalities specific to Madagascar\u2014in particular, the degree to which vaccination against rubella might result in elimination ofthe virus from the country, a realistic prospect given Mada- gascar's unique status as an island nation. Assuming that current vaccination coverage estimates reasonably reflect thecontext in Madagascar, our analysis suggests that the prob- ability of elimination of rubella with introduction of RCV might be as high as 15% over 30 years. Improvements in vac-cination coverage, especially targeted at the major hubs of travel (i.e. the most connected areas according to the metrics developed and shown in figure 4) could improve this esti-mate yet further (figure 5), as well as offer considerable potential for improving measles control. Nevertheless, rubella elimination is not a certainty even with extremelyhigh vaccination coverage across all regions (95%, figure 5). This suggests that targeted vaccination efforts\u2014where vac- cine deployment is closely linked to surveillance, either ofcases (i.e. as currently employed in outbreak response vacci- nation for measles [39]), or more powerfully, of serological status within the population\u2014are likely to be more effective components of successful elimination of rubella than blanketvaccination campaigns across broad spatial scales. Very few measles cases have been reported over Madagas- car's fever-rash surveillance system over the past decade,despite regular reports of rubella, suggesting that the system is functioning effectively. These observations also support esti- mates of administrative coverage, which indicate reasonablyhigh vaccination coverage against measles in Madagascar cur- rently, and over the recent past, thus again bolstering the prospect for elimination of rubella. However, should introduc-tion of RCV into Madagascar be accompanied by the positive outcome of elimination of rubella, the risk of a post- honeymoon outbreak must be an important consideration[40]\u2014the absence of reported cases does not mean that the risk of an outbreak is not building. While rubella elimination will invariably reduce the burden of CRS, there is somesense in which such elimination presents a double edged sword\u2014the absence of circulating cases opens the door to accumulation of susceptible individuals should vaccinationcore policy considerations for RCV roll-out Q1: Will introducing RCV increase the burden of CRS?

Susceptible build- up is particularly problematic for rubella, as the opportunity for unvaccinated susceptible girls to age into their childbearing years is of major concern. Rubella incidence or control shouldthus be considered across a long time-horizon [14], with emphasis on maintaining high levels of population immunity via vaccination over the long term. The availability of rubella data from the pre-vaccination era in Madagascar presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of introduction of RCV into the measles vaccinationprogramme. This opportunity could be further enriched by the improvement of current surveillance, as well as collection of further metrics before, and during, deployment of the vac-cine [41]. Some very simple and low-cost extensions of the current system in Madagascar are possible. In particular, mothers whose children present with fever and/or rash arecurrently questioned about the last vaccine a child has received\u2014with no information about the type of vaccine (e.g. poliomyelitis and measles). Narrowing this question to specifi-cally enquire about measles or measles-rubella vaccine would considerably strengthen this element of reporting. There are also opportunities to design surveys specifically focused onthis question\u2014e.g. following previous examples for rotavirus in Malawi [42]. Another question that we did not formally tackle here\u2014and an aspect not currently under considerationin the context of roll-out of the vaccine in Madagascar\u2014is the impact of targeted vaccination of girls or women; previous work has indicated that this may further reduce the risk inan increase in the CRS burden [10] and is a prospect worth con- sidering further in the context of rubella in Madagascar. Here, we lay out the array of core questions for countries considering introduction of RCV following the opening of the GAVI funding window (figure 6), and address them using data from Madagascar. Our analysis indicates that vacci-nation campaigns will be essential upon introduction of RCV to ensure that long- and short-term increases in the burdenof CRS are avoided. It is generally recognized that in the longer term, strengthening of routine programmes and reduced dependence on vaccination campaigns is desirable [43]. If such improvements in routine immunization can beachieved, our results also indicate potential for Madagascar to eliminate rubella over the longer term, especially if targeted vaccination is also deployed. This positive outcome is never-theless one that will require continued public health vigilance. Authors' contributions. Conceived and designed the experiments: A.
