The project area is located in Sections 11 and 12, T50N -R29W of Michigamme Township, Marquette County. The primary objective of the two-day onsite pedestrian survey was to locate and document any surface indications of potential hist oric and/or prehistoric cultural features that are located within the targeted areas th at were defined by Charles Brumleve on the Kennecott Minerals Company Eagle Project ma ps that he provided to Ms. Cohen and I (see green areas in Figure 1). In additi on, a secondary but equally important objective was to also locate and document any potential significant cultur al materials (artifacts) that are lying exposed on the disturbed surfaces within the study area. A brief written description of the ta rgeted study areas was also provided by Mr. Brumleve to Ms. Cohen in a May 15, 2007 co mmunication that accompanied the copies of the project maps. It is as follows: \"The two areas that will be affected the most are labeled on the maps as the Main Surface Facility (north of and surrounding E agle Rock) and the Backfill Facility (near the Salmon Trout River on the s outh side of the Triple A Rd ). Figure 2-3 shows the areas (in green) where Kennecott will scrape the ground surface so (these) are very important for the survey. The most disturbance w ill occur in the north half of Section 12.\" 2 Figure 1: targeted study areas are in green (copied from Brumleve map/Figure 7-3) Part II: Field & Laboratory Methods The two-day field assessment and onsite walkover survey of the Eagle Rock area was conducted by Jim Paquette and Summer Cohe n with the assistance of volunteers Pam Nankervis, Evelyn Ravindran, Char Beasely a nd Chauncey Moran. Inspection of the ground surface within the defi ned study area was conducted using pedestrian survey techniques only. All areas visited during th e walkover survey were examined for surface indications of potential cultural artifacts a nd features, including trails, stone hearths, foundations, mining exploration pits, miscellaneous excava tions, and other suspected 3man-made earthen and/or rock structures. Field notes were kept containing brief descriptions of all notable surficial artif acts and features. Their locations were documented in the field notes and marked with a Global Positioning Satellite waypoint using a MAGELLAN Meridian GPS unit. A digital still image record of the study area was obtained using a SONY Cyber-Shot DCS-T20 (8.1 mega pixel) camera. Pictures of suspected and identifiable man-made cultural features and artifacts observed during th e Eagle Rock area walkover survey were recorded. The locations and orientation of the individual images were noted. All field notes, maps, sketches, and s ite pictures were organized and reviewed for completeness. Digital image copies of the study ar ea maps were produced and then modified using image editing software (MGI Photo Suite) to crea te the site maps that are used in this report. A final summary report was compiled, written, and then sent to Summer Cohen on June 3, 2007. (Note: This Eagle Rock Area Preliminary Surface Cultural Resource Assessment summary report should not be interpreted as being a Phase I or Phase II archaeological survey and site investigation report. It is intended to be \"preliminary\" in nature, and should be viewed as such). 4Part III Eagle Rock Area Preliminary Surface Cultural Resource Assessment Results The Eagle Rock Area PSCRA results have been organized and presented in two separate sections, including: Section A: Area 1 (\"Main Surface Facility area north of and surrounding Eagle Rock\" per Brumleve's maps & 5/15/07 communication) Section B: Area 2 (\"Backfill Facility area near the Salm on Trout\" per Brumleve's maps & 5/15/07 communication) These sections provide a summary report of the May 17/18, 2007 walkover survey events, and documentation of identified and/or suspected cultural artifacts and features found in the Eagle Rock study ar ea during the project. 5Section A: Area 1 (Main Surface Facility area nor th of & surrounding Eagle Rock) Figure 2: Area 1 is in green Area 1 Surface Walkover Survey: Summary of JRP Field Notes May 17, 2007 : I arrived at the Eagle Rock Area 1 at 8:00 a.m. and parked just east of the of the Eagle Rock site (20MQ 251). Immediately after my arri val, I walked in a northerly directions down the Kennecott Eagle Project road that runs N & S along the east border 6of the tree line that marks the edge of the St ate of Michigan property in order to view the project area and compare the actu al layout of the terrain with the maps that were provided to me by Mr. Brumleve and Ms. Cohen. For the next hour, I spen t time walking through the three adjoining State of Michigan 40 acr e lots and the one adjoining Kennecott 40 acre lot that comprise the four qua drants of the Area 1 study area. At 9:00 a.m., I met up with Summ er Cohen and her team of volunteers (Pam Nankervis, Evelyn Ravindran, and Char Beas ely) at Eagle Rock. We spent time reviewing the maps and the surface walkover survey plan. I then conducted an onsite training session for our team of volunteers on how to identify cultural features and prehistoric cultural materials/artifacts. At 10:00 a.m., we started the surface wa lkover survey in the west half of Area 1. Our methodology was quite simple: we lined up 5 abreast in an east to west line at approximately 15 meter intervals, and then be gan our search while slowly walking from south to north. This allowed us to sear ch a 60 meter swath through the study area with each pass. Upon reaching the b ack (far north) boundary of th e search area, we then re- aligned ourselves in same \"sea rch pattern\" and walked from north to south back to the vicinity of Eagle Rock. In the forested areas, we encountered numerous natural surface features (i.e. old tree deadfall root upheaval depressions, animal burrows, etc) and some more recent Kennecott Eagle Project work disturbances (i.e. bulldozed berms and roadways, drill sites, etc). While surveying the extensive clear-cut areas within the study area, we encountered heavily disturbed ground surf aces from the previous commercial logging activities (i.e. deep furrows and ruts, skidding trails, earth and brush/ waste piles, etc), as 7well as additional wide-spread surface ground destruction from recent Kennecott Project related work (see Figure 3). Figure 3: photo of heavily disturbed clear-cut area within Area 1 Although these highly distur bed surface areas made it difficult at best to discern the presence of any possible cultural features, the extensive ground disturbances throughout the Area 1 study area did provide the walkover survey team w ith an excellent opportunity to search for surface cultural artifact deposits (see Figure 4). 8 Figure 4: photo and example of roadway in Area 1 that offered opportunity for team to inspect for newly expose d cultural materials/artifacts. During our second 60 meter sweep, Ms. Cohen encountered two shallow semi-circular depressions in the ground located just outside the clear-cut near the northern edge of the forested area that is adjacent to and north of the Eagle Rock site (see Figure 5). I immediately inspected the depres sions. After a discussion as to whether or not they were man-made or natural features, it was deci ded to document their location for future analysis. 9 Figure 5: Summer Cohen standing near the \"ER1\" ground depressions. One of the ground depressions measured approximately 4' x 5' in size. About 14' to the SW was the second depression that measur ed approximately 4' x 3' in size (see Figure 6). I labeled this gr ound feature locale as \"ER1\" with my GPS unit. The UTM coordinates are: (NAD27) 16 432616E 5177381N . Photos were then taken of the ground depressions. 10 Figure 6: photo of one of the \"ER1\" ground features. No other potential features or a ny surface artifacts were encountered during the morning's walkover. At 12:30 p.m., the three volunteers le ft the site, while C ohen and I resumed the survey. At that point, it seemed obvious to the two of us that it would be fruitless to continue the search for surface cultural features in the deforested/clear-cut areas in light of the overall destruction and very limited surface visibility. As such, we changed our survey strategy to adapt to th e surface conditions that we had encountered in the Eagle Rock area. We decided to focus our \"patterned search\" for surface cultural features primarily in the remaining forested areas of Area 1 where the ground conditions still 11remained relatively undisturbed (see Figure 7). In addition, we also focused on identifying and searching all recently disturbed areas (i.e. all roadways, test drill locations, dozed open areas, et c.) for cultural materials/arti facts that may have been exposed on any of the new surfaces created by the commercial logging and mine project related ground disturbing activ ities. We thus completed the ground walkover su rvey of the remaining forested/wooded areas in Area 1 with a series of patterned sweeps. We then continued our pedestrian surface search in the disturbed portions of the adjoining deforested areas. Figure 7: photo and example of a forested area within Area 1. 12 We completed the surface walkover in th e west half of the study area, and then continued our search in to the eastern half. At 3:00 p.m., Ms. Cohen left the Eagle Rock area, and I continued the surface reconnaissance for cultural materials in the NE and SE quadrants of Area 1using an ATV to both access and search all roadways, drilling sites, and all other exposed areas that were encountered (see Figure 8). Figure 8: photo of one of the exposed surf ace areas in the SE quadrant of Area 1. I continued the surface search until 4: 00 p.m., at which time I left the Eagle Rock project area. 13 Other than the two \"suspicious\" surface features (ER1) that were located by Ms. Cohen early in the day, no additional potential cultural features we re found during the course of the walkover survey on May 17 in Area 1. In addition, no cultural materials/artifacts were identified in any of the areas that were searched during the daylong surface walkover. May 18, 2007: On day 2 of the survey, I arrived at the Eagle Rock site at 8:15 a.m. and walked through the deforested areas that st ill remained to be surface searched in the SE quadrant of Area 1. Again, this initi al walk-through was for the purpose of comparing the actual layout of the terrain in the project area with the site maps. At 9:00 a.m., Ms. Cohen arrived at the site by herself. We immediately set out to complete the walkover survey in the remaining areas in Area 1. Our pedestrian survey of these very heavily disturbed area s (mainly this past winter's Kennecott test drill sites just east of Eagle Rock) consisted solely of a surface search fo r any cultural materials that may have been exposed (see Figure 9). We co mpleted our walkover survey of the Area 1 SE quadrant at 11:00 a.m. Only modern artifacts were identified in this area, including one rusted metal oil can and a fairly large amount of work-related litter left behind by the test drilling crews. In addition, no cultural features were identified in a ny of the ground surface-destroyed areas that we encountered and searched in this quadrant. 14 Figure 9: photo and example of heavily disturbed area in Area 1. 15Section B: Area 2 (Backfill Facility area near the Salmon Trout) Figure 10: Area 2 is in green Area 2 Surface Walkover Survey : Summary of JRP Field Notes May 18, 2007 : Shortly after the completion of our surface walkover of Area 1, Chancey Moran arrived at the Eagle Rock site to volun teer his time and expert ise to our project. Upon his arrival, we left Area 1 a nd drove to the nearby Area 2. At noon, we began a patterned surface wa lkover of the study area. We lined up three abreast approximately 5 meters apart and walk ed from west to east along the deforested upper terrace. We started on the south border of the targeted area and slowly worked our 16way to the north with each sweep until we had searched the entire surface of Area 2. Although the area was heavily impacted by past commercial logging and recent Kennecott Eagle Project development work, th e highly disturbed surfaces again provided us with an excellent opportunity to inspect the exposed areas for cultural artifacts. Figure 11: parking area in Area 2 near survey stakes. In the parking area near a set of Ke nnecott project survey stakes (see Figure 11), we located a quartz flake in the roadway (see Fi gure 12). We marked the findspot of the flake with a GPS waypoint (designated as \"E R2\") and then photographed this probable cultural artifact in situ . The GPS coordinates are: NAD 27 16 431707E 5177332N . 17 The quartz flake was left undisturbed. Figure 12: in situ photo of quartz flake \"ER2\" Approximately 22 meters to the east, we located another quartz flake or small cobble core (see Figure 13). Again, we marked the lo cation of the probable cu ltural artifact with a GPS waypoint (designated as \"ER3\") and photographed it in situ . The GPS coordinates are: NAD 27 16 431723E 5177325N . This quartz flake was also left undisturbed. 18 Figure 13: in situ photo of quartz flake \"ER3\" After we were satisfied with our surv ey coverage of the uppe r terrace area of Area 2, we decided to expand our surface visual reconnaissance efforts to the west and northwest along the exposed surfaces of a roadway that runs along the bottom of the terrace. Our visual inspection of the sandy roadway surface extended approximately 600 meters to the west. We then swung north and up onto the Triple A road that runs atop the terrace and inspected the deflated roadway for surface ar tifacts all the way back to our parked vehicles at Area 2. No other cultural artifacts were identified during this extended effort. With the time we had remaining in th e day, we decided to c onduct one last walkover survey in an area directly south of and ad jacent to the upper terraced section of Area 2. 19This final inspection covered the still-foreste d and grass covered s outh facing steep slope of the terrace that borders the Salmon Trout River and its swampy lowland floodplain. We immediately noticed the remnants of an obvious man-made trail worn into the face of the slope. We marked the trail with two GPS waypoints (designated as \"ER4\" and \"ER6\") and photographed it from vari ous angles (see Figure 14). The two recorded GPS waypoints are: NAD 27 16 431648E 5117729N and NAD 27 16 431759E 5177204N. Figure 14: photo of trail at location \"ER4\" looking west. In the same vicinity at the very bottom of the slope on the edge of the swamp and near the Salmon Trout River, we located another apparent cultural feature\u2014a large man-made 20pile of large rocks (s ee Figure 15). Rough measurements of the rock pile were made and recorded, a GPS waypoint marking its location was established (designated as ER5), and photographs were taken. The GPS coordinates of the rock feature are: NAD 27 16 431667E 5177282N. We did not disturb the feature in any manner whatsoever. Figure 15: photo of rock fe ature \"ER5\" looking south. In addition to the rock feature, we noticed several suspic ious depressions in the side of the nearby slope that appeared to be possibl e man-made excavations of some sort (see 21Figure 16), perhaps associated with the nearby rock feature. Their locations were noted, and one photograph was taken. Figure 16: photo of \"suspiciou s\" depression and possible cu ltural feature in hillside near rock feature and trail. At 3:45 p.m., we completed the Eagle Rock area walkover survey and left the site area. ********************** 22Part V: Discussion & Conclusions As stated earlier in this summary repor t, the objective of the Eagle Rock Preliminary Surface Cultural Resource Assessment was to locate and document any potentially significant surface cultural features and/or ar tifacts that are located within the study area as outlined and defined in the maps that were provided by Mr. Brumleve. The May 2007 pedestrian survey effort s did locate a limited number of suspected surface cultural features within the Eagle Rock study area. Information on these features (brief descriptions, locations as marked by GPS waypoints, digital images) was recorded to provide the necessary documentation to complete this PSCRA summary report. In addition, a small lithic scatter of suspected prehistoric cultural material, consisting of two small quartz flakes, was likewise locat ed within the defined Eagle Rock study area and subsequently documented within this report. As the purpose of the Eagle Rock Area Preliminary Surf ace Cultural Resource Assessment was simply to locate and document the presence of potential cultural features and artifacts located within the defined study area, no attempt was made to evaluate the degree of cultural significance of any of the suspected features and/or artifacts found during the surface survey. However, the info rmation gathered as a result of conducting this walkover investigation of the Ea gle Rock area does provide additional documentation and evidence that potentially significant cultural re sources\u2014in addition to the Eagle Rock site (20MQ251)--currently exis t within the boundaries of the study area. Further research and appropriate fieldwork is now needed to provide the needed data and analysis to accomplish the task of completi ng the necessary archaeological and cultural site evaluations.

Foth Infrastructure & Environment, LLC Dennis Donohue, Warner, Norcross & Judd Master File 04W018-5001 FR: John Starke, Foth Infrastructure & Environment, LLC RE: Location Selection Basis for the Eagle Project Surface Facility This memorandum presents the location selection basis for the Eagle Project surface facilities. Surface ownership of the Eagle Project and surrounding area is shown in Figure 1. There are two parts of surface facilities for the project: the main surface facility comprised of 88 acres of disturbed land; and the backfill facility comprised of 9.8 acres of disturbed land. The backfill facility location is close to the Salmon Trout River and is dictated by the ore body and the underground mine design, therefore no alternative locations are available. Operations at the backfill facility have been kept to a minimum to reduce environmental risk and footprint. The location of the main facility was selected to minimize the environmental footprint of the Eagle Mine and to provide a safe and efficient operational area for mining activities. Criteria used to select the proposed location of the main facility are discussed below. 1. Minimize the environmental footprint of the facility. KEMC designed the main surface facility in the smallest disturbed footprint that would allow safe and effective mining operations. The facility includes: \u0017Two contact water basins, three non-contact water basins, \u0017Temporary development storage area, \u0017Sanitary system, \u0017Parking areas, \u0017Mine office building, \u0017Coarse ore storage area, \u0017Gatehouse, \u0017Powder magazines, \u0017Truck wash, \u0017Treated water infiltration system, \u0017Wastewater treatment plant, \u0017Generator Building, \u0017Fuel storage area, \u0017Other ancillary facilities. J:\\scopes\\04w018\\5000-Client External Correspondence\\memos\\m-design basis for surf fac loc.doc 2 These facilities are contained within the smallest area wi ll allow safe and efficient mine operations. Containing the operations within a smaller area would result in inefficient operations and cause potential vehicle hazards or unsafe operating conditions. 2. Reducing impacts to surface water or groundwater resources. The main surface facility is located east of the local groundwater divide. This location reduces risk to the Salmon Trout River Main Branch from mining activities. The facility has been designed to protect the environment whether it's located west or east of the groundwater divide. However, locating the facility as proposed east of the groundwater divide, provides an extra measure of protection as the closest down gradient surface water is over a mile to the north. 3. Reducing impact to natural wooded areas. KEMC chose a main facility location and alignment to lessen removal of large trees. The proposed position of the surface facilities is located in previously clear-cut areas. As such, wooded tracks of land surrounding the site will remain and will screen the operations from surrounding properties. 4. Provide a facility location that can be screened by natural site features. The location of the main surface facility was selected to make use of natural screening from Triple A Road and the surrounding properties. A large portion of the main surface facility will be screened by existing wooded areas and by the rock outcrop. These natural features will not only reduce visual impacts of the site operations, but will also buffer noise from operations. Although KEMC could position the facility on Kennecott land, this would result in less screening between Triple A Road and the main surface facility. 5. Locate mine portal to provide safest possible access point. The mine portal entering the bedrock near the outcrop will provide stable access to the ore body. Positioning the portal at a location more distant from the rock outcrop would require extending the portal through loose, unstable alluvial soils thus would increase the risk to the aquifer and result in a less safe portal. From a safety perspective, KEMC believes the mine portal is best positioned near the outcrop to utilize the structural benefit of the natural rock mass. 6. Need for state land use. KEMC-owned land was considered for the surface facilities operations. However, for the previously stated reasons, state-owned land better meets the location criteria. These location criteria include: \u008aLowering risk to groundwater and surface water resources, \u008aMinimizing disturbance and cutting of wooded areas, \u008aMinimizing noise and visual impact from the main facility, \u008aProviding safe access to the ore body using the structurally sound rock near the outcrop, and \u008aMinimizing the environmental footprint and risk of the facility by containing operations into the most practicable and safe area. 1.

Jones 1861, 86). One such place is Mt. McKay, a butte just to the west of Thunder Bay, Ontario. This forested mountain is crowned by a flat top supported by sheer rock cliffs, and while local Ojibwes regularly hold powwows under its shadow, few attempt to scale the cliffs to its summit. It is considered a sacred place and, especially when clouds obscure its top, people still consider the thunderbirds to be in residence there. 1 1 The Island of the Anishnaabeg: Th underers and Water Monsters in the Traditional Ojibwe Life-World by Theresa S. Smith 2The reference above and throughou t this research gives signif icance to the importance of Eagle Rocks representation to Ojibwe People not just as a physical entity but also as a place of Traditional Cultural Property that is alive and should be respected as such. Again I stress the importance of the defin ition of Traditional Cultural Property My concern with the Kennecott Eagle Mine Project is that Eagle Rock is a significant Traditional Cultural Property identifi ed by oral tradition a nd historic cultural values of the Anishinaabe Ojibwe culture of the United States, particularly the Ojibwe of the Lake Superior, including Mich igan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The environmental impact of the Kennecott 's Eagle Rock Project would destroy a belief system that is usually not recognized by Euro Americans, but according to the NHPA's definition of traditional cultural significa nce: \"Traditional\" in this context refers to those beliefs, customs, and practices of a living community of people that have been passed down through generations, usually oral ly or through practice. The traditional cultural significance of a historic property th en significance is derive d from the role the property plays in a community's historically rooted beliefs, customs, and practices. Therefore a Traditional Cultural Property is defined as: \u00be A location associated with the trad itional beliefs of a Native American group about its origins, its cultural hi story, or the nature of the world; \u00be ...or patterns of land use reflect the cultural traditions valued by its long term residents; \u00be A location where Native American religious practitioners have historically gone, and are known or thought to go today, to perform ceremonial activities in accordance with traditional cultural rules of practices and, 3\u00be A location where a community has tr aditionally carried out economic, artistic or other cultural practices important in maintaining its historic identity. \u00be A traditional cultural property, then can be defined generally as one that is eligible for inclusion in the National Register because of its association with cultural practices or beliefs of a living community th at (a) are rooted in that community's history and (b ) are important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity the community. The Project will destroy a way of life va lues and traditions of the Ojibwe people of Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin. The effects of a sulfide mine will have a negative impact on the natural resources and traditional cultural properties of the Ojibwe peopl e. The Eagle Rock Project will have adverse effects such as physical destruction, alteration, removal, and changes to the character of the property's use and to the physical features that contribute to its historical significan ce. The Federal agencies should remember that properties of re ligious and cultura l significance are located on ancestral, aboriginal, or cede d lands of Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations and should consid er this when complying with the procedures. Evidence of myths and oral histories provide the influences for this argument. In order to provide some definition of why it is that Eagle Rock and it's 4Surrounding waters are important in the Anishinaabe/Ojibwe/Chippewa culture, one must first have the understanding of the Seven Prophecy belief. The following interpretation of the Seventh Prophecy of the Seven Fires, is told by Eddie Benton-Benai: The People of the Seventh Fire More than 1,000 years ago the Anishinabeg, li ved along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. There were so many and they were so powerful th at it is said that one could stand at the top of the highest mountain, look in all directions, and not se e to the ends of the nation. They traveled the waterways by canoe and in winter they traveled with dog sled. Their life was full of abundance and beauty. The Anis hinabeg developed their natural heritage of wisdom and power through dreams and the way of the circle . They followed the path of the spirit, walking in balance, in harm ony with all beings. Th ey communicated with the animals and fish that provided them with food. Trees and plants told them of their medicines . They knew the magic and mystery of the spirals . Using this knowledge, some of them traveled great distances with ease. Even today, some of th e Hopi people of the Southwest desert in the USA still remember th e stories of my people appearing in their underground chambers. They would speak with the Hopi people, do ceremony with them, and then disappear through the walls of the kiva. These people had no need for police, laws, courts , judges, or prisons. It is the way of the circle to help each other and for each to cont ribute their talents and skills for the well- being of the community. The best hunters a nd fishers would share the hunt. The women 5gathered food together and shared it w ith everyone. They lived by the Original Instructions to love, honor, and respect all beings in the circle of life. This was given to all people at the beginning of the Creation. It's written in the hearts. 2 Seven prophets appeared to the people. The Fi rst Prophet told the pe ople that in the time of the First Fire they woul d leave their homes by the sea and follow the sign of the megis. They were to journey west into strange lands in search of a island in the shape of a turtle. This island will be linked to the purification of the earth. Such an island was to be found at the beginning and at the end of their journey. Along the way they would find a river connecting two large sweet water seas. This river would be narrow and deep as though a knife had cut through the land. They would stop seven times to create villages but they would know that their journey was complete when they found food growing on the water. If they did not leave, there would be much suffering and they would be destroyed. And they would be pursued and attacked by othe r nations along the way so they must be strong and ready to defend themselves. The Second Prophet told them they could rec ognize the Second Fire because while they were camped by a sweet water sea they would lo se their direction and that the dreams of a little boy would point the way back to the true path, the st epping stones to their future. 2 The Seventh Fire: An Ancient Prophecy from the Ojibwe Tradition by Allen Asian Heart/White Eagle Soaring http://www.the7thfire.com/7thfire.htm 6The Third Prophet said that in the Third Fire the Anishinabe would find the path to the lands prepared for them and they would cont inue their journey west to the place where food grows upon the water. The Fourth Prophet was two who came as one. Th e first told them to expect a race of people who had light skin. The future of the Anishinabeg would be known by the face the light-skinned people would wear. If they come in brotherho od there would be a time of wonderful change. New knowledge would be jo ined with the old knowledge and the two peoples would join to make a mighty nation. Tw o other nations would join to make four and they would become the mightiest nation of all. If they brought only their knowledge and their good-will they would be like brothers. The second being of the Fourth Prophet warn ed the light-skinned race might wear the face of death that would almost look the same as the face of brotherhood. \"If they come carrying a weapon and if they seem to be suffering, beware. Behind this face is greed. You shall recognize the f ace of death if the rivers are poi soned and the fish are unfit to eat.\" The Fifth Prophet said that in the time of th e Fifth Fire there will be a struggle between the way of the mind of the light-skinned people and the natural path of spirit of the many nations of natural people. \"As this fire lose s its heat there will come among the people those who promise great joy and salvation. If the people accept this promise and abandon the old ways, the struggle will continue for ma ny generations. This promise is false and it will nearly destroy those who accept it.\" 7The Sixth Prophet told them th at in the time of Sixth Fire it would be clear that the promise accepted during the Fifth Fire was false. \"Those who were deceived by this promise will take their children away from th e teachings of the elders. The elders will lose their purpose in life and many will become sick and die. Many people will be out of balance and the cup of life will become the cup of grief.\" The Seventh Prophet was younger than the others who had come and there was a glowing light from his eyes. He said that there would come a time when the waters had been so poisoned that the animals and plants that live d there would fall sick and begin to die. Much of the forests and prairies would be gone so the air would begi n to lose the power of life.* The way of the mind brought to th e red, black, and yellow nation by the white nation would bring danger to the whole earth. In this time there will arise Osh-ki-bi-ma- di-zeeg , a new people who will emerge from the clouds of illusion. They will retrace their steps to find the treasures that had been left by the trail. The stories that had been lost will be returned to them. They will remember the Original Instructions and find strength in the way of the circle. Their search will take them to the elders and the new people will ask for guidance. But many of the elders will have walked the Path of the Souls to the Star Web. Many elders will have forgotten their wisdom and they will not be able to help. Some of the elders will point in the wrong dire ction and others will remain silent because of their fear. Some of the elders will be si lent because no one has asked them for their wisdom. If the New People will find trust in the way of all things, in the circle, they will no longer need the selfish voice of the ego and they can begin to trust their inner voice. Wisdom 8will be once again be found in dreams of the night and of the day. The sacred fire will once again be lit. The Light-skinned People wi ll be given a choice between two paths. If they choose the right path the Seventh Fire will light the Eighth Fi re and final fire of brotherhood and sisterhood. If they choose the wrong path, remaining on the path of the mind, then the destruction they brought with them will come back to destroy them. The people of the earth will experience much suffering and death. Along the Great Salt Water in the East, lif e was full and rich for the People, the Anishinabeg. After the Seven Prophets came to them, there were many large gatherings to discuss their pred ictions. Many people did not want to move away from their homes with their families and begin a long migra tion through strange lands. Some unselfishly supported those who believed in the power of the prophecies and were ready to follow because they thought it was in some way pa rt of the Creator's Plan. One group supported the plans to follow the Megis into the unknown lands of the se tting sun, but they pledged to stay and care for the eastern fire of the people. They were called the Wa-bun-u-keeg ', the People of the Dawn. Five hundred years la ter they would be among the first to be caught in the death and suffering the Light-s kinned people would bring. By the time of the Fourth Fire, their homes, families, and vi llages would be tom apart. They would be scattered, lose their roots, their power. Today these people are called the \"Abenaki.\" The U.S. government does not recognize their existe nce as a tribe. These are also my people. My great-great grandmother was born in Vermont in about 1841, married a white man and they moved to Wisconsin and then to Mi nnesota. They did not realize that they followed her relatives who had made the jo urney hundreds of years before. Many Ojibwe people live in Wisconsin and Minnesota today. 9 The people followed the Great River to the Setting Sun, the St. Lawrence River, looking for the island shaped like a turtle. Near pr esent-day Montreal they found such an island and the Megis shell rose up out of the water to greet them. There they brought the Sacred Fire and did many ceremonies to cleanse themse lves to be ready to receive their next instructions. After some time they continued to follow the Great River into a sweet water sea until they came to a roaring waterfall that spoke like thunder. They called it Ani-mi- kee'wabu, place of the thundering water. Once agai n the Sacred Megis shell rose up out of the water and greeted them, and the Sacr ed Fire was brought here. Today the Light- skinned people call this place Niagara Falls. The megis is a cowrie shell, very sacred to the Ojibwe. Through the megis Creator breathed life into all beings Again the people moved on along another larg e sweet water sea unt il they came to a narrow river that was cut deep into the ear th. It was the river the First Prophet had described. Many people were drowned trying to cross this river. When the people set up a village there, the Sacred Megis rose up out of the water to greet them. That river is today called the Detroit River. 10At this time there came to be three gr oups among the Anishinabeg. Each group had a special task. One group, called the 0-dah-wahg' , were responsible for providing the people with their food and supplies. They were the hunters and traders. A second group, called the 0-day'wah-to-mee , were the keepers of the Sacr ed Fire as the people moved along. The third group was the faith keepers of the nation, called the 0jib-way . Today, the 0-dah-wahg' are called the Ottawa, the 0-day'wah-to-mee are called the Potawatomi, and the 0-jib-way are called the Ojibwe or incorrectly, Chippewa. These were the nations of the Three Fires, powerful and united by a common purpose-- following the Sacred Megis to an unknown de stination. The nations of the Three Fires were asked to join war expeditions against the Light-skinned invade rs in the East, but they remained focused on their mission and thei r destiny, whatever that was to be. They followed the sissagwad, the soft whisper of spirit, not knowing where it would lead th em. At the time of the Second Fire the people we re encamped along the eas t shore of the third sweet water sea. There they searched for a wa y to cross the sea to continue their journey in search of the food that grows on water. He re they stayed for a long time establishing villages and planting gardens. In attending to basic survival needs, people began to neglect the sacred ways and soon forgot about their journey. Only a few of the elders still remembered the purpose of their migration. Then a little boy had a dr eam about a path of stones that would lead across the waters. They returned to the River that Cuts Like a Knife and retraced their steps. There they found a chain of islands that lead across the sweet water sea. 11Moving the people by canoe they continued thei r western journey in search of the food that grows on water. On the largest island in the chain the Sacred Megis appeared to the people, rising out of the water. This island became the center of the Anishi nabeg nation, the Sacred Fire was brought here, the sacred water drum of the Midewiwin Society was heard again. Then the water drum was moved to the eastern shore of another sweet wate r sea and the Sacred Megis appeared again. Here the people had their fi rst contact with the Light-skinned people, French explorers, voyageurs, and traders, called the Ah-dah-way' wih-nih-neeg . These people brought many gifts, metal knives, axes , kettles, and pots, woven cloth and coats, colored glass beads. These people came in brotherhood, and seemed to be friendly and respectful of the ways of th e people. These people were treat ed as brothers, many of them married women of the Anishinabeg, and they were adopted into the nation. It was the beginning of the Fourth Fire. In the Ea st, other Light-skinned people would come wearing the face of death. These people de stroyed many villages of the People of the Dawn who had remained along the Great Salt Wa ter. They destroyed the garden paradise the Anishinabeg had tended for thousands of years. These people seemed not to know how to be in balance and yet they believed that their way was the best and only way to live. Groups of the Anishinabeg traveled along the no rth and south shores of the fourth sweet water sea and reaching a bay at the western end they found mah-no-men, wild rice, \"the food that grows on water.\" The destination had been reached. Spirit Island in the bay was 12the sixth stopping place. Not very far away along the southern shore of the great sweet water sea they found an island shaped like a turtle, the fina l sign that their journey was complete. They placed tobacco on the shore as an offering to the Great Spirit who had led them to this holy place. They called the island Moh-ning'wun-ih-kawn-ing . This became the capital of a powerful Anishinabeg nation and the Great Sweet Water Sea was called Gii-dzhii Ojibwe-gah-meeng , the Great Sea of the Ojibwe (called Gitchi gumi in Longfellow's poem, Hiawatha). The Sacred Me gis rose up out of the waters and told them that they had reached their destination and that now they must continue to follow the path of the spirit so they could light the pa th in the time of the Seventh Fire. Here they brought the Sacred Fire a nd the sacred water drum sounded for many years. The prophecies of the First, Second, and Third Pr ophets had been reali zed, and the prophecy of the Fourth Prophet continued to unfold. Light-skinned men in long black robes, Muk-a-day-ih-kahn-ah-yayg , came clutching a black book to their chest and carrying something that seemed to honor the four directions. These men were impressed with the ge nerosity, honor, and respect shown by the Anishinabeg. Still, they wanted the Anis hinabeg to change their ways and accept the teachings of a man from far away,. They warn ed that not following this book they would not be able to walk the Path of Souls to the St ar Web to join their relatives. This was very frightening to many of the people and they left their traditional ways to follow the Black Coats and their black book. A wedge was driv en between the peopl e of the Midewiwin Society and the people following the new t eaching. The conflict between the people of the black book and the people of the Sacred Me gis split the community into factions that 13broke the circle of the nati on. People scattered to the sma ller lakes of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Thus began the time of the Fifth Fire. The wa ve of light-skinned people forced all native people into poverty on tiny rese rvations supported by erratic deliveries of promised supplies and equipment. These were usually rotten, poor quality, or insufficient to care for the needs of the people. To educate the children in the new ways the light-skinned people took children away from their parents, put them in boarding schools far away from their homes and families, cut their ha ir, took away their medicine bundles, forbade the use of their na tive language. So the hoop of the nation was broken, taking the young people away from the medicines, the stories, the teachings, the spirit ways, the strength that had brought a spirit-filled people on a j ourney for more than six hundred years. The children were taught to walk the way of the light-skinned people w ho thought that theirs was the superior way, the way of \"progress.\". 3- The prophet of the Sixth Fire said, \"In the time of the Sixth Fire it will be evident that the promise of the First Fire came in a false way. Those deceived by this promise will take their children away from the teachings of the Elders. Grandsons and granddaughters will turn against the Elders. In this way the Elde rs will lose their reason for living ... they will lose their purpose in life. At this time a new sickness will come among the people. The balance of many people will be disturbed. The cup of life will almost become the cup of 3 The Seventh Fire: An Ancient Prophecy from the Ojibwe Tradition by Allen Asian Heart/White Eagle Soaring http://www.the7thfire.com/7thfire.htm 14grief.\" At the time of these predictions, many peopl e scoffed at the prophets. They then had medicines to keep away sickness. They were then healthy and happy as a people. These were the people who chose to stay behind in the great migration of the Anishinaabe. These people were the first to have contact with the light skinned race. They would suffer most. When the Fifth Fire came to pass, a great strugg le did indeed grip th e lives of all native people. The light skinned race launched a milita ry attack on the Indian people throughout the country aimed at taking away their la nd and their independence as a free and sovereign people. It is now felt that the fals e promise that came at the end of the Fifth Fire was the materials and riches embodied in the way of life of the light skinned race. Those who abandoned the ancient ways and accepted this new promise were a big factor in causing the near destruction of the native people of this land. When the Sixth Fire came to be , the words of the prophet rang true as children were taken away from the teachings of the Elders. Th e boarding school era of \"civilizing\" Indian children had begun. The Indian language and religion were taken from the children. The people started dying at a early age ... they had lost their will to liv e and their purpose in living. In the confusing times of the Sixth Fire, it is said that a group of visionaries came among 15the Anishinaabe. They gathered all the prie sts of the Midewiwin Lodge. They told the priests of the Midewiwin Way was in danger of being destroyed. They gathered all the sacred bundles. They gathered all the scroll s that recorded the ceremonies. All these things were placed in a hollowed out log fr om the Ironwood tree. Men were lowered over a cliff by long ropes. They dug a hole in the cliff and buried the log where no one could find it. Thus the teachings of the Elders were hidden out of sight but not out of memory. It is said that when the time came that the Indian people could practice their religion without fear a line boy would dream where the Ironwood log, full of sacred bundles and scrolls, was buried. He would l ead his people to the place. The seventh prophet that came to the people long ago said to be different from the other prophets. He was young and had a strange light in his eyes. He said, \"In the time of the Seventh Fire New People will emerge. They will retrace their steps to find what was left by the trail. Their steps will ta ke them to the Elders who they will ask to guide them on their journe y. But many of the Elders will have fallen asleep. They will awaken to this new time wi th nothing to offer. Some of the Elders will be silent because no one will ask anything of them. The New People will have to be careful in how they approach the Elders . The task of the New People will not be easy. \"If the New People will remain strong in their quest the Water Drum of the Midewiwin Lodge will again sound its voi ce. There will be a rebirth of the 16Anishinaabe Nation and a rekindling of ol d flames. The Sacred Fire will again be lit. \"It is this time that the light skinned ra ce will be given a choice between two roads. If they choose the right road, then the Seventh Fire will light the Eighth and final Fire, an eternal fire of pea ce, love brotherhood and sist erhood. If the light skinned race makes the wrong choice of the roads, then the destruction which they brought with then in coming to this country will come back at them and cause much suffering and death to all the Earth's people.\" Traditional Mide people of Ojibway and people from other nations have interpreted the \"two roads\" that face the light skinned race as the road to technology and the other road to spiritualism. They feel that the road to technology represents a continuation of headlong rush to technological development. Th is is the road that has led to modern society, to a damaged a seared Earth. Could it be that the road to technology represents a rush to destruction? The road to spirituality represents the slower path that traditional native people have traveled and are now seeki ng again. This Earth is not scorched on this trail. The grass is still growing there. The prophet of the Fourth Fire spoke of a tim e when \"two nations will join to make a mighty nation.\" He was speaking of the coming of the light skinned race and the face of brotherhood that the light skinned Brother could be wearing. It is obvious from the history of this country that this was not the face worn by the light skinned race as a whole. That might nation spoken of in th e Fourth Fire has never been formed. 17 If the Natural people of the Earth could just wear the face of br otherhood, we might be able to deliver our society from the road to destruction. Could we make the two roads that today represent two clashing world views come together to form a mighty nation? Could a Nation be formed that is guided by respec t for all living things? Are we the people of the Seventh Fire?4 - Another important view of Ojibwe life philosophy is from Norval Morrisseau : Norval Morrisseau, Copper Thunderbird, born March 14, 1932 on Sand Point Ojibwe Reserve, near Beardmore, Ontario.

They asked him if he could find out. The shaman went to a sacred place and started singing and drumming. He beat on his drum harder and harder until he jumped right out of his body and began to rise up in his consciousne ss. He went up to the third astral plane where he could fly through tim e. He flew through tim e until he reached the year 2000 and then came down to look around.

Most of them are about eighteen inch es high, but some of the water drums we make medicine with are two feet high . The taller you make the drum the more different the sound is. We call it a \"wat er drum\" because there's water in it, and when they pound it they use that water to wet the hide. \"Duu-aa-uu , duu--aau , du- aa-uuu \" -- that's the way it sounds. With a water drum the sound will travel far enough so you could hear it a long, long way off.\"8 Thomas Vennum speaks of the Water Drum: \"the second type of drum known to the Ojibwa was the water drum still used exclusively by members of the medicine lodge. Called mitigwakik, meaning \"wooden vessel,\" it av eraged sixteen to twenty inches in 7 http://norvalmorrisseau.blogspot.com/ 2007/12/in-memoriam-norval-orrisseau_11.html 8 When Everybody Called Me Gah-bay- bi-nayss:\"Forever-Flying-Bird\" An Ethnographic Biography of Paul Peter Buffalo 21height and was made from a section of basswood or cedar, hollowed by charring and scrapping. A separate piece - usually pine\u2014was inserted and sealed with pitch to form the bottom of the drum. For a drum head a si ngle rectangular piece of tanned deerskin was held in place with a removable hoop wound with cloth. The drum was partly filled with water through a bunghole in its side and played with a curved drumstick. Like all water drums, its high pitched tone would carry great distances and characteristics sound informed one instantly that a medicine ceremony was in session. P. 40.9 Please see this website it tells of the Water Drum and its importance to the Ojibwe People as spoken of today: The Water Drum (5:59) The water drum is known as the drum of drums. It was the fist one given, and uses and represents elements of the natural world\u2014plant and animal life, and water. 10 The Drum (6:29) \"Drums represent the heartbea t of the people,\" sa ys traditionalist Eddie Benton-Benai. Young people are once again singing the old songs\u2014and writing new ones. 11 The Mid\u00b4 drum ( Fig. 12 a) differs from the drum commonly used in dances ( Fig. 12 b ) in the fact that it is cylin drical, consisting of an elongate d kettle or wooden vessel, or perhaps a section of the hollow trunk of a tree about 10 inches in diameter and from 18 to 20 inches in length, over both ends of which ra whide is stretched while wet, so that upon drying the membrane becomes hard and tense, producing, when beaten, a very hard, loud tone, which may be hear d at a great distance. 9 The Ojibwa Dance Drum- Its History and Construction by Thomas Vennum Jr. Smithsonian Folklife Studies Number 2, 1982. 10 www. wisconsin stories.org/archives/ - 24k 22 FIG. 12.\u2014Ojibwa drums. Frequently, however, water is put into the bottom of the drum and the drum-head stretched across the top in a wet state, which appears to intensify the sound very considerably.12 Another area of interest and iden tification is the mythos of the Anishinaabe people that there are ma ny animate creatures that exist in Ojibwe Country and other tribes in North America. Theresa S. Smith in her book: Thunderers and Water Monsters in the Traditional Life World, the Island of the Anishinaabeg writes about myth, religion and the survival of Ojibwe Tradition. To help understand how Ojibwe myths are incorporate into O jibwe life and thoughts of myths these animate beings are real to Ojibwe people. The myth is a true story.

In other words, th ey present a web of associations and patterns that is distinctively and consiste ntly Anishinaabe. And the knots which hold this web together, which begin and end the pattern, are the traditional narrativ es, the mythos of the Ojibwe people.(p. 17).15 Things are going wrong when people thin k of the land as a pie that can be sliced up in pieces... No matter how y ou cut the pie, in the end there's nothing holding it together. It gets eate n up like pop and chips, like raisins. It's better for people to live as if they 're inside a ball. The sky, upstairs and downstairs, the four directions: thes e will hold everything together and not let anything escape because a ball has a top to cover and bottom to hold us, and everything works together. - Ron Geyshick, Te Bwe Win (Truth), 13 The Island of the Anishnaabeg: Thunderers and Water Monsters in the Traditional Ojibwe Life-World by Theresa S.

How they are interrelated in the Ojibwe belief system; one cannot live without the other. Thunderers: \"We saw Thunderbirds a few summers ago. Ho! A huge bird it was - a lot bigger than the planes that you see go by today. Many of the people at Shoal Lake saw it go by. It didn't flap its wings, not even once. It was white on the underside and black on top. Ho! A big, big bird. There were some great big thunderclouds making up a stor m and out of the clouds came this great bird.\" - James Redsky (Esquekesik), Great Leader of the Ojibway: Mis-quona-queb, 1972 17 From late spring until the first snow s of winter thunde rstorms regularly roam the Northern Great Lakes. They trav el roughly west to east, usually in large groups at the head of a passing cold front. Less frequently they pop up singly during the course of a hot spe ll, expend some of their energy, and move across the water. Their season here is circumscribed by a winter that normally loosens its grip in May only to return by October. Like the flora of this area, the storms bloom for an exceptionally short growing season. And 16 The Island of the Anishnaabeg: Thunderers and Water Monsters in the Traditional Ojibwe Life-World by Theresa S. Smith, University of Idaho Press, Moscow, Idaho,1995. 17 ibid 25like the animals and humans of the Ojibwe life-world, they travel the earth as organic entities in their own distin ct forms. While thunderstorms are no more frequent or violent in the Grea t Lakes than in many other parts of North America, the Anishinaabe maintain the belief that st orms visit them more often than they do anyone else. (p.65)18 Accordingly in Ojibwe beliefs: thunderst orms don't just happen in this life world; they signal the arrival of powerful people, Thunderers or Thunderbirds, who have a relationship with human beings, the Thunderers, possessing wills like all people, intentionally follow a path which allows them to over fly and so oversee th e island of the Anishinaabeg. As Sam Oswamick told me, \"That's why th e Indians believe there are Thunder spirits. They help people, you know , looking all over, seeing everything's going on all right. That's why they tr avel around.\" As they look below them, the Thunderers sound th eir voices, not merely for show but in order to communicate with human beings. And while Thunder may well speak elsewhere, it doesn't speak Ojibwe. (p.66). 19 An example of where the Thunderbir ds live, \"Naturally enough, given their existence as pinesiwak, the thu nder Manitouk are believed to live in 18 The Island of the Anishnaabeg: Thunderers and Water Monsters in the Traditional Ojibwe Life-World by Theresa S. Smith, University of Idaho Press, Moscow, Idaho,1995. 19 ibid 26huge nests, usually built upon large in accessible mountains: \"the Ojebways believed that the home of the Thunder-bird was on the top of a high mountain in the West where it la ys its eggs and hatches its young like an eagle\" (P. Jones 1861, 86). One such place is Mt. McKay, a butte just to the west of Thunder Bay, Ontario. This forested mountain is crowned by a flat top supported by sheer rock cliffs, and while local Ojibwes regularly hold powwows under its shadow, few attempt to scale the cliffs to its summit. It is considered a sacred place and, especially when clouds obscure its top, people still consider the thunderbirds to be in residence there. Jones also makes special mention of the La Cloche Mountains just to the north of Manit oulin, which are currently referred to as the pathway of the animikeek. This is because thunder seems to sound loudest when it crosses these quartzite mountains. \"It is on these mountains the poor superstitious [s ic] Indians say the thunder-gods, or eagles have their abode, a nd hatch their young\" (43). 20 Such mountains appear to be appropriate places for Thunderbirds to live, and the observation of eagle nests in these places reinforces the idea. (p.81)21 \"While mature Thunderers, those who are properly understood as atisokanak , protect the Anishinaabeg from underground and Underwater manitouk with their lightening strikes, 20 The Island of the Anishnaabeg: Thunderers and Water Monsters in the Traditional Ojibwe Life-World by Theresa S. Smith, University of Idaho Press, Moscow, Idaho,1995. 21 ibid 27the immature members of this group are often both foolish and dangerous. They have not perfected either their flight or their strikes and sometimes thei r behavior is rather pitiable. On the reservations at Fond du Lac and White Earth, we were told a story of the young thunderbird who struck the side of a h ill and broke his wing. He was then caught between the precipices. When he tried to fr ee himself, he kept on striking against the rocks, and he repeatedly broke is wing as he did so. This explains the co ntinuous flash of heat lightening (Coleman, Frogner, and Eich 1962, 102).22 More often, and unfortunately so for humans, the young Thunderers wreak ha voc with their wild shots and generally unruly behavior. In the moon of berries, when the young t hunderbirds go by, they cause destruction because they don't know any better. They are like children and this is the fault of the young birds, not the parents. When they go by in August and September, they are pretty rough on the Ojibways. They knoc k down trees with li ghtening from their beaks. Houses are struck and smashed also. The older Thunde rbirds try to correct these foolish young birds, but they do not learn because they are so young (Redsky 1972, 110-11). 23 Another important creature that needs to be mentioned is the unde r water monster known as Mishebeshu: On the eastern side of Ma nitoulin Island, acros s the bay from the peninsula of Wikwemikong, lies a small villa ge called Manitowaning. The oldest white 22 The Island of the Anishnaabeg: Thunderers and Water Monsters in the Traditional Ojibwe Life-World by Theresa S. Smith, University of Idaho Press, Moscow, Idaho,1995. 23 ibid 28settlement on the island (1838), Manitowaning takes it name from the Ojibwe Munidowaning (den of the manitou) or Mnidoowaanzhig (at the spirit's lair). This picturesque town would appear to sit upon a particularly bles sed spot where the shoreline curves gently around a sheltered bay teaming with bass, pike, splake and even the occasional sturgeon. Tourist publications will tell you that just as Manituolin (from Mnidoonisig) means Island of the Manitou and refers to the traditional home of Kitche Manitou, Manitowaning describes the Great Spirit's favorite haunt. These sources are WRONG. Manitowaning does not belong to Kitche Manitou but to another, entirely different and entirely frightening person: Mishebeshu, the great underwater monster. ( 96). 24 The name Mishebeshu means literally Great Lynx and may be used as \"both a generic word for a class of malignant aquatic feline beings, and the proper name for the ruler of the species\" (Brown and Brightman 1988, 109). My consultants extend the name even further to include not only these great wa ter dwelling lynxes but water serpents and monster ground snakes. In this instance, as in all my analyses of the Ojibwe life-world, use of the term Mishebeshu must be governe d, finally, by prevailing Anishinaabe usage. To the Anishinaabeg, Mishebeshu is at once a manitou and a cl ass of manitouk, the ogimaa of all underwater and und erground creatures, and any of these creatures that might be termed extraordinary. He is not a pe rson with a plurality of forms like Nanabush 24 The Island of the Anishnaabeg: Thunderers and Water Monsters in the Traditional Ojibwe Life-World by Theresa S. Smith, University of Idaho Press, Moscow, Idaho,1995. 29but a kind of \"plural person\" who is met wi thin a complex of symbols and realities. (p.97)25 The particularly feline character of Misheb eshu, as expressed in his name, does require some elaboration, however. While dragon-like form is not a constant in the Anishinaabe experience of Mishebeshu, he is described in the earliest so urces fins\" (Pachot in Kinietz 1965, 287, Bichi-Bichy ). Some modern and contempo rary studies continue the characterize Mishebeshu as a feline monster (Brown and Brightman 1988; Howard 1965; Ray and Stevens 1984; Redsky 1972). Redsky, for example, describes Mishebeshu as an Animal the Indians used to offer tobacco [to] and worship highly... the mishe -beshoo is a huge, brown cat. It has (p.97)26 webbed feet for swimming a nd lives in great big caves or holes in the ground. It acts something like a bear; it gathers moss and grass and places it in a hole where it hibernates until spring. This animal is always seen in the water or close to it. (120-21). (98)27 The Manituolin artist Blake Debassige has painted Mishebeshu and calls his work simply, \"One Who Lives under the Water. \" The most well known rendering of the monster, at Agawa Rock on the North Shor e of Lake Superior, shows him in bodily 25 ibid 26 The Island of the Anishnaabeg: Thunderers and Water Monsters in the Traditional Ojibwe Life-World by Theresa S. Smith, University of Idaho Press, Moscow, Idaho,1995. 27 ibid 30profile with his face turned from the viewer; it is from this pictograph that Debassige, Mel Madahbee, Mamie Migwans, and Anne Beam took their inspiration. The original image done in red ochre sometime before 1850 is attributed to My eengun, a mide shaman who undertook the long voyage from the sout h shore of Lake Superior to Agawa on account of a vision. Mamie Migwans gave me a different version of this painting's creation: \"It's said that they used Mish ebeshu's blood after they killed him. The Thunderbirds, they killed him. They used the bl ood to paint all these pictures.\" one aspect of Mishebeshu's mystery is indicated by Migw an's assertion: \"The Thunderbirds, they killed him.\" Over and over in the myths we are told that Mishebeshu has been killed and 31yet he continues to resurface. Like rough wa ter, Mishebeshu, who is one and many, will always return.(p.101)28 Both tail and horns are indications of Mish ebeshu's immense power. He uses the tail not only to travel swiftly through the water roughen lakes and ri vers and to strike boats of unwary and/or disrespectful humans. The horns here, as in all traditional Ojibwe drawings, are signs of extraordinary power. In the same mnemonic scrolls of the Midewiwin, a powerful shaman is easily iden tified by his horns and in one of Hoffman's scrolls from Red Lake, a shaman compares hi mself to the water monster even while he entreats him: \"The place that is feared I inhabit the swift-running stream I inhabit... I have seen long horns...you [Mishebeshu] to whom I am speaking... See me, whose head is out of the water\" (1891, 291-92). 29 According to Norval Morriseau, whom speaks of the little people as water creatures also: It is said among the Ojibway that the water beings were very wise and powerful. They lived in all the waters of the lakes as we do the land. Th ey were seen by the Ojibway from east to west and from south to nort h. They are men, women and children and they live on fish, but I cannot say here that they live forever as I believe they must die as we do. It is said that our ancestor s traded tobacco and pipes with them in return for medicine that was very powerful. They spoke a little different from us of the Ojibway, as their name was Maymaygwasiwuk that means in E nglish \"a person that speaks strangely.\" 28 The Island of the Anishnaabeg: Thunderers and Water Monsters in the Traditional Ojibwe Life-World by Theresa S. Smith, University of Idaho Press, Moscow, Idaho,1995. 29 ibid 32These Maymaygwasiwuk were also powerful dream guardians. If an Ojibway Indian, when fasting, dreamed of these beings he would become strong enough to prevent a sorcerer from brining him onto his magic shak ing tent. The water beings would help that Indian overcome the sorcery, for they had the power of knowing all matters upon the earth and the water. When seen, according to the Ojibway, they had with them a stone boat with stone paddles. Some say the canoe moved alone, by so me power. Also some say that hey used to steal fish from nets. At one time they we re chased in order to know who they were. The Maymaygwasiwuk would head for the shor e line of cliffs, and the stone boat would go right into the opening as if through a door, which would be shut when the Ojibway got to the place. No door was to be seen. This wa s a very strange indeed. At other times their boat would sink where they lived. When the O jibway got there all they would see were bubbles, then they would know who they were.30, Basil H. Johnston also writes of the little people, The Manitous: The Spiritual World of the Ojibway and Ojibway Heritage The mythical little people are known by many names: Bagwajiwinini (also spelled Bagwajinini, Bagudzin other spellings.) These are mythological little people of the forests. Their name means \"wild man\" and is pronounc ed similar to bug-wuh- jih-wih-nih-nee or buh-gwuh-jih-nih-nee, depending on dialect. (The same creatures are sometimes also called Apa'iins or Pai'iins instead, which literally means \"little person.\") Pukwudjininees Ojibway , 1965 33are mischievous but (also spelled Memengwesi, Memegweshi, Omemengweshii, Maymaygwayshi, and other ways.) These are small riverbank-dwelling water spirits. The Ojibwe plural is Memegwesiwak (or Maym aygwaysiwuk.) They are also generally benign creatures, but sometimes blow canoes as tray or steal things when they are not shown proper respect.32 Another who collected storie s of the Ojibwe myths was Sister Bernard Coleman, she writes of the Little People from her source s of people who have seen or remember the stories: The Little People: Many times when the Indians are traveling in their canoes they see the strange little people, but they can never get near them. Sometimes the little people are in a canoe and sometimes they play on the cliffs along Lake Superior. 33 One time some Ojibwa saw some of these lit tle men in a canoe on the lake. When the Indians tried to get near them, the little men ju mped out of their canoe and ran up the cliff hiding their faces in their arms.

Mt McKa y is respected by the Ojibwe of the Fort William Band and all others who are aware of its significance. Mount McKay Mount McKay in early April 2007 Elevation 483 m (1,585 ft) Location Thunder Bay , Ontario , Canada Coordinates 48\u00b020'43\"N 89\u00b017'8\"W Type Sill 35Mount McKay is a mountain on the southern side of Thunder Bay , Ontario , Canada , on the Indian Reserve of the Fort William First Nation . [1] History McKay was originally known as the \"Thunder Mountain\" ( Animikii-wajiw in the Anishinaabe language and locally written as \"Anemk i-waucheu\"). The mountain was used by the First Nations for sacred ceremonies. Only until the construction of the road were non-First Nations allowed on this land.[2] Features A lookout exists on the lower eastern plateau at an elevation of 150m, providing a view of Thunder Bay and the city's harbour. A sma ll memorial commemorates dead Aboriginal people that fought in wars. There is a path on the eastern face of the mountain than can be used for hiking. Plants on the mountain include red and sugar maple and poison ivy (animikiibag \u2014\"thunder-leaf\" in the Anishinaabe language ). The top of the mountain has glacial erratics and jack pines . A small grove of yellow birch grows just south of the entrance gate. A small, unmaintained trail can be used to reach the top (elev. 300 m) from the lookout via the north face, with a heavy gauge steel cab le that can be used for support. However, due to the grade and geology (mostly shale) of the face, this unsanctioned hike is considered dangerous, and is not recommended for novice hikers. There is also somewhat of a trail on the west side of the mountain with somewhat of a giant stair case which is mostly shale it is mo re dangerous and harder then the north face.
