To address these needs, a continuum of holistic care that includes intensive treatment services and support must be in place (2-4). In collaboration with the North Shore Tribal Council and Benbowopka Treatment Center in Ontario, Canada, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Abstinence-Based treatment model in place prior to implementing a novel treatment approach based on blending Indigenous healing practices and a mainstream treatment model, 'Seeking Safety,' for the treatment of Indigenous patients with a history of IGT and SUD in a four-week residential treatment program in Blind River, Northern Ontario. This paper is a retrospective qualitative analysis of an Indigenous community-run residential treatment program operating under an abstinence-based model prior to implementing a novel treatment paradigm based in Indigenous teachings and Seeking Safety. Methods: The historical data was collected from Benbowopka's patient records; (n=343) from January 2013 to March 2016 (end of the 2015 \u0000scal year). The data has been divided into the \u0000scal year and intake period at the request of Benbowopka. We evaluated the results of the abstinence-based model intervention against three distinct primary outcomes (1. The patient perspective, 2. The program perspective, and 3. The community perspective). The following variables were collected: name, health card number, date of birth, postal code, status card number, gender, date of admission to the program, date of discharge, program completion (Y/N), Indigenous (Y/N), status First Nation (Y/N), on reserve (Y/N), primary substance, and secondary substance(s). Any pertinent notes were also included in the data. All discussions and feedback from the Client Quality Assurance Survey tool was subjected to a qualitative thematic analysis. Results: Four core themes were identi\u0000ed: (1) Motivation to attend treatment; (2) Understanding Benbowopka's treatment program and needs to be met; (3) Satisfaction with all interventions; and (4) Moving forward. We thus utilized a proposed conceptualized descriptive framework for the four core themes depicted in the medicine wheel. The center of the medicine wheel represented headings (self, family, children, worker, and community) or a lens, which participants used to frame their experiences. Conclusion: This research has identi\u0000ed that SUD Indigenous residential treatment programs need to include culture, healing practices, activities and relationships that are part of the treatment process. This study found that the cultural elements and healing practices of the program were highly valued by clients in the Blind River, Northern Ontario, Northern Indigenous residential treatment program.Page 4/20Background Indigenous peoples with substance use disorders (SUD) and intergenerational trauma (IGT) have a variety of needs across the range of symptom severity. Clinically, these patients often present with a challenging dual disorder (1). To address these needs, a continuum of holistic care that includes intensive treatment services and support must be in place (3-5). Understanding of the safety and stability of living environments is essential in the recovery process for individuals with SUD who need structured care (6, 7). Residential treatment is a structured, 24-hour level of care that focuses on intensive recovery activities, such as group sessions, interactive learning about SUD, exercise, yoga, meditation, grounding, spiritual practices, and ceremony. It aims to help people with SUD become stable in their recovery before engagement in outpatient settings and before returning to an unsupervised environment, which may otherwise be detrimental to their recovery process (1). There is consensus in the literature that residential treatment for SUD and IGT within Indigenous communities exposes many challenges, such as cravings, anger, fear, grieving, past trauma, con\u0000icts with peers, and attrition (8, 9). These communities continue to report the need for increased access to evidence-based treatment options (10, 11) and there are examples where a degree of success has been achieved (1, 8). Yet, there is a lack of access and a need for evidence-based treatments (1). Many communities report a lack of services, Indigenous treatment options, culturally sensitive approaches, and the absence of cultural awareness from healthcare professionals and rehabilitation services. (10, 11) Indigenous and non-indigenous scholars agree that the high rate of substance use, suicide, and self-harm are related to residential school abuse and the resultant IGT on Indigenous peoples (6, 12-14). There is a general consensus amongst Indigenous researchers, traditional healers, clinicians, and Elders that interventions that treat IGT and SUD in Indigenous peoples should involve reclamation of cultural and traditional interventions (6, 12, 13). Furthermore, the dramatic increase in the past 20 years in opioid-related deaths makes this approach critical in facilitating healing and fostering positive identity for Indigenous peoples (2, 6, 15, 16). As early as the 1960s, Indigenous communities have struggled with the challenge of healing from IGT and SUD. As such, Indigenous healing programs sprang up across the country addressing issues such as SUD, sexual abuse, parenting, family violence, depression, suicide, anger, rage, and eventually the residential school syndrome (6, 7, 13, 17). Also, creative treatment and strategies to promote \"healing,\" such as residential treatment programs (based on a variety of treatment models), one-on-one therapeutic counselling programs, traditional ceremonies and retreats, Sweat Lodges, healing ceremonies, fasting, prayers, and the application of traditional teachings have been implemented across Canada (8, 18, 19). Despite so many different styles of programming amongst various First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit communities, there appears to be a consensus that healing comes from a deeper place within an individual should include the connection of individuals, families, and communities (5, 20). A growing body of Indigenous authors and clinicians agree that connection to land, family, and community would be the only sustainable outcome for well-being and collective healing (3, 13). Residential treatment of SUD and IGT within Indigenous communities is confronted with many challenges such as funding problems, geographical challenges, and consensus about interventions (7, 8, 21). Other challenges constantly reported in the literature include the need for more innovative research and evidence-based treatment options (10, 11). The geographical challenges that remote communities face are laden with examples including lack of access. This lack of access adds to high mortality rates and limited access to opiate agonist treatment,Page 5/20counseling, and support services for the community and support staff (1, 8). Many communities report insu\u0000cient services, Indigenous treatment options, culturally sensitive approaches, and a lack of cultural awareness from healthcare professional and rehabilitation services (10, 11). The Benbowopka Residential Treatment Center initiated this study due to the need for increased access to evidence-based treatment options, Indigenous treatment options, and culturally sensitive approaches, as well as the opioid crisis, reports of lack of services, and insu\u0000cient cultural awareness from health care providers. The Indigenous Healing combined with Seeking Safety (IHSS) model stems from Dr. Teresa Marsh's research work (8, 22-24). The results from this new treatment model demonstrated that the IHSS can help clients cope with symptoms of addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), intergenerational trauma, and substance use. The Western or mainstream model, Seeking Safety, is an evidence-based, present-focused, coping skills counselling model that was developed in the United States as an integrated treatment for trauma and substance abuse disorder (25). It has also been found to be helpful for clients who are struggling with either issues alone, or for general stabilization. Seeking Safety incorporates techniques from cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, self-care skills, and case management. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the existing abstinence-based treatment model prior to implementing a novel approach based on the validated treatment model Indigenous Healing and Seeking Safety (IHSS) for the treatment of Indigenous patients with a history of IGT and SUD in a four-week residential treatment center. Methods Ethics This research was in line with the tenets of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (2011) Guidelines for Research Involving Aboriginal People and the Tri-Council Policy Statement for Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (26). The study received approval from Laurentian University's Ethics Board in May 2017. The authors used a decolonizing approach to ensure that the process that was ethically and culturally acceptable in conducting research with Indigenous peoples (17, 27, 28). To be consistent with a decolonization approach, the honouring of cultural informants and knowledge was important. Considering the study incorporated Indigenous traditional healing practices, the Elders and the entire staff team as well as Mamaweswen, North Shore Tribal Council, Indigenous scholars, and clinicians (also called cultural informants) were consulted throughout the research process (12, 28, 29). Furthermore, Two-Eyed Seeing was used to honor the strengths of both Indigenous and Western knowledge, research techniques, knowledge translation, and program development (30). Two-Eyed Seeing is an Indigenous decolonizing methodology that provided this project with an inclusive philosophical, theoretical, and methodological approach. Two-Eyed Seeing was \u0000rst discussed in the literature in 2004 by Elder Albert Marshall from the Eskasoni Mik'maw Nation in Nova Scotia (31, 32). Study Context Benbowopka Treatment Centre started in 1991 as a 12-Step Alcoholics Anonymous model of intervention to address alcohol addiction prominent in many First Nation communities during that time. However, the onset of prescription drug use on First Nation communities has shifted the need for addiction treatment towards harm reduction models of service. The shift in prevalent substances has prompted Benbowopka Treatment Centre toPage 6/20undergo a signi\u0000cant transformation, starting in 2016. The changes aimed to ensure that its services are better able to address the SUD needs of First Nations communities. The abstinence model of service that was previously being delivered at Benbowopka Treatment Centre was excluding many individuals who were seeking residential addictions treatment for prescription drug use. Individuals who were prescribed medication by their physician to address SUD or mental health challenges (such as methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone) were not eligible for admission to Benbowopka Treatment Centre because of its abstinence-based model of services. In 2014, Mamaweswen North Shore Tribal Council directed that Benbowopka Treatment Centre should move forward with a plan for the realignment of its services to a harm reduction model that would follow the best practice strategies recommended for addressing substance use disorders. Thus, IHSS treatment for Indigenous patients with a history of IGT and SUD was initiated in 2016. All the staff at Benbowopka Treatment Centre participated in the training on how to use and implement the IHSS treatment model. However, this paper focuses on the client satisfaction with the abstinence based model. The implementation of the IHSS treatment model will be discussed in separate papers (33). Data Collection and Methods of Assessment Benbowopka Residential Treatment Program accepts clients of all gender identities at age 18 years on. The program accepts Indigenous and non-Indigenous clients from all over Canada. The historical data was collected from records for all patients who had enrolled in the Benbowopka Residential Treatment Program from January 2013 to March 2016 (end of the 2015 \u0000scal year). The data was divided by \u0000scal year and intake period at the request of Benbowopka. We used the Drug Use Screening Inventory (DUSI) to collect data on type of primary and secondary substances patients used. The DUSI and a revised version (DUSI-R) were developed by the Center for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) to identify consequences of alcohol and drug involvement (34). The following variables were collected and analyzed descriptively: name, health card number, date of birth, postal code, status card number, gender, date of admission to the program, date of discharge, program completion (Y/N), Indigenous (Y/N), status First Nation (Y/N), on reserve (Y/N), primary substance, and secondary substance(s). Drug classes from primary and secondary substances were further divided into a substance category. Any pertinent notes were also included in the data. The original data included drug classes used by Benbowopka (i.e., alcohol, narcotics, prescription drugs, solvents/inhalants, and other substance). The revised data has been organized by the drug class preference of the research team (i.e., alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, opioids, depressants, hallucinogens, inhalants/solvents). Some drug names were changed to ensure clarity (e.g., brand to generic names, acid to LSD, etc.). Data Analysis We evaluated the results of the abstinence based model intervention against three distinct primary outcomes: i. Patient perspective: We used the Client Quality Assurance Survey tool to assess the appropriateness and satisfaction of the abstinent based model intervention. ii. Program perspective: We used program completion as the primary outcome (program completion) to evaluate the effectiveness of the abstinent based treatment model. iii. Community perspective: Does the revised program serve a broader range of community members requiring treatment for SUD and IGT? Does the impact of residential addiction treatment on reducing broader healthcare utilization (through reduced substance use related emergency room presentations and hospitalPage 7/20admissions in the year following treatment completion) increase following IHSS implementation? This paper only describes the impact of the abstinent base model prior to the implementation of IHSS and only addresses the patient and program perspective. All discussions and feedback from the Client Quality Assurance Survey tool were subjected to a qualitative thematic analysis. This method was selected to be consistent with cultural data analysis models that require more involvement and interpretation from the researcher (31, 35). In step one, the text was read and re-read to identify and describe implicit and explicit ideas within the data (36). Codes were then developed to represent the identi\u0000ed themes and link the raw data as summary markers. Code frequencies and code occurrences were then compared, and the emerging relationships between the codes were graphically displayed. Finally, in step four, emerging themes were identi\u0000ed (31, 37, 38) (see the Medicine Wheel in Fig. 1). These themes were shared with the authors, as well as the director and staff of Benbowopka for validation. During data analysis, the Elders who guided this research process explored the four core themes and con\u0000rmed that these themes connected with the teachings and four quadrants of the Medicine Wheel. The Elders recommended that the results be depicted through the lens of the Medicine Wheel to authenticate the Two-Eyed Seeing and the Indigenous decolonizing methodology (39). Results Retrospective Historical Data The following describes the demographics of participants from the treatment program at Benbowopka from 2013-2016 included in the historical data. Participants (n=343) lived throughout Ontario and Quebec; 67.8% were from northern Ontario, 10.3% from southern Ontario, and 21.9% from Quebec. The average participant age was 34 years old, with the largest age group being 25-34 years old (41.1%) followed by 35-44 years old (20.1%), 18-24 years old (19.2%), 45-55 years old (14.6%), and the smallest group being 55+years old (5%). 61.9% of participants were men, while 38.1% were women. 79.4% of participants were polysubstance users, meaning they used more than one type of substance. 83.8% of participants had alcohol as their primary substance, followed by stimulants at 8.8%, opioids at 5%, Of the polysubstance users, cannabis was the most common secondary substance, with 35.9% poly-users also using this substance. Stimulants followed in second with 29.6%, then opioids at 1.9%, depressants at 1.3%. Out of all the participants, 69.4% of the cohort completed the treatment program, while 30.6% did not complete the program. Qualitative Results The following four core themes were identi\u0000ed: (1) Motivation to attend treatment; (2) Understanding Benbowopka's treatment program and needs met; (3) Satisfaction with all interventions; and (4) Moving forward. Most of the participants reported their experiences through a holistic view\u2014incorporating their mind, body, Spirit and physical health together. Participants also discussed experiences under headings such as self, family, children, worker, and community. We thus utilized a proposed conceptualized descriptive framework for the four core themes depicted in the Medicine Wheel (see Fig. 1 and Table 1). The center of the Medicine Wheel represented headings (self, family, children, worker and community) or a lens, which participants used to framePage 8/20their experiences. This Medicine Wheel was adapted from an article by Rod Vickers and the framework is based on the work of Duran (2006) (12), Martin-Hill (2003) (5), and Nabigon (1999 & 2006) (40, 41).Page 9/20Table 1 Participant quotes to illustrate each core theme within each quadrant of the Medicine Wheel Core theme East (spiritual) West (physical) North (mind) South (emotional) Motivation to attend treatment\"I was tired of doing detox, and I was here in the program before, and I did not \u0000nish. I had to come back to \u0000nish the program. God and Creator, strangers and my family answered my prayers. I was here before, and I needed to re-charge and become self-aware with myself and Spirituality.\"\"I came to gain new life skills that keep me sober and work for me, skills that pertain to cognitive behavioral therapy. The methods and treatment of this program, that will help me get healthier. Becoming sober is a series of steps of other issues that will keep me alive.\"\"I was in\u0000uenced to come here mainly because I was facing jail time, and my welfare worker advised that I come here because of my drug use, but I came here on my own free will.\"\"My drinking was so out of hand that I almost died on many occasions, and that was scary. I wanted to attend the treatment program because I wanted to better my life.\" Understanding Benbowopka Treatment Program and Needs met\"I wanted to go somewhere where I did not know anybody. I am happy I picked Benbowopka because I heard about the culture and Spirituality, I needed that. Big miigwetch (thanks) to my worker for helping me and introducing me to the program.\"\"I am not alone; I am not the only one going through this; this program taught me that I started to use alcohol because of my trauma and that I can heal from both [the trauma and the addiction] concurrently.\"\"Alcohol / mental health treatment is a psychological and Spiritual pathway that offers tools to individuals that aspire to lead sober and healthy lifestyles.\"\"I understand that the program for treatment gives clients a chance to let go of baggage they are carrying while struggling with addiction. I was happy that we all received the knowledge.\" Satisfaction with all interventions\"I am so thankful for the cultural practices because I used to drink every day, and I lost touch with my culture because of my addiction. I forgot what it was like to abide by the Seven Grandfathers.

I learned tools and things about myself I was never aware of.\"\"Yes, the counselors cared and took their time to encourage healthy risks and teach clients to bring down their guard to open up even just a little.\"Page 10/20Core theme East (spiritual) West (physical) North (mind) South (emotional) Moving forward\"Going to access all available resources in Sudbury that will directly help me with my sobriety. Constantly monitor a daily healthy routine.\"\"I will try my best to change, be healthier, have food in my house, take care of my house and just be kind. It's going to be a BIG change. I am kind of scared but mostly excited. New beginnings! I will eat three meals a day. Exercise more, communicate with my partner more positively and pray more.\"\"I will change a lot. Attending meetings and Ceremonies. Practicing healthier thoughts and actions. I know I don't want to drink anymore. Self-care will be the biggest thing, and focusing on my children.\"\"I now have tools to help me apply at home. I can share with my partner and I can work on our communication and how to handle disagreements, and now I can sit and take a look back to see what's going on.\" 1. Core Theme One: Motivation to Attend Treatment The Eastern quadrant of the Medicine Wheel represents the Spiritual aspect of the individual, and for the Anishinaabe the color is yellow (17, 40, 41). In this quadrant, the motivation for coming to treatment included subthemes such as ceremony, Elders and healers, Spiritualty, culture, ritual, prayer, and pain. Most of the participants also had reasons for coming to treatment, such as chaos in their lives, reaching rock bottom, health problems, my worker, family, work, children, and community. As one participant noted: \"My life became unmanageable, my children suffered, I suffered and just focused on the substance.\" Another participant reported that: \"My alcoholism was out of control, and I felt hopeless.\" Similarly, another participant said: \"I was tired of doing detox, and I was here in the program before, and I did not \u0000nish. I had to come back to \u0000nish the program. God and Creator, strangers, and my family answered my prayers. I was here before, and I needed to re-charge and become self-aware with myself and Spirituality.\" The Southern quadrant represents the emotional aspect of the person, and the color is red (17, 40, 41). The subthemes included confusion, shame, pain, and guilt. Several participants mentioned their need for help, just being sick of their life, pain, and needing change. Another participant explained: \"My drinking was so out of hand that I almost died on many occasions, and that was scary. I wanted to attend the treatment program because I wanted to better my life.\" Many participants also remarked that they came to treatment because they needed to learn about their addiction. For example, one participant said: \"I had a relapse and wanted to work on prevention and re\u0000ect on the cause and my drinking. My life became meaningless, and I did not know who I was.\" Many of the participants shared their feelings about the loss of hope, self-esteem, identity, dignity, family, partners, and their jobs. These factors motivated them to seek help and treatment. As one participant stated: \"I needed to look at myself and regain my tools and dignity before I lost everything, even more than I already have. This treatment could help me to \u0000nd my self-worth again and provided me with a whole set of tools.\" Another participant shared: \"My addictions were controlling my life, taking me away from my family and my children. I feel so much guilt and shame.\" The Western quadrant represents the physical aspect of the person, and the color is black (17, 40, 41). The subthemes that emerged included health, self-care, change, sobriety, lifestyle, and pain. Participants talkedPage 11/20about the pain that they felt in their bodies due to neglect of themselves. They uttered the need to change and how they needed sobriety. Others commented about their health, how sick they felt, and how they could not even get themselves to a doctor. As one participant so eloquently stated: \"I came to gain new life skills that keep me sober and work for me, skills that pertain to cognitive behavioral therapy. The methods and treatment of this program that will help me get healthier. Becoming sober is a series of steps of other issues that will keep me alive.\" Another participant said: \"My addiction and the alcohol were killing me, and I do not want to die.\" The Northern quadrant represents the mental aspect/mind of the person, and the color is white (17, 40, 41). The subthemes that emerged included aspects such as making connections, motivation to change, and education. Many clients shared that they have lost connections with themselves, their families, their communities, and even their identities. The suffering and the pain moved them to that place and motivation where they had to \u0000nd a treatment center. Many stated that they knew they needed help to understand this insanity, that they needed education about this disease. As one participant said: \"I was in\u0000uenced to come here mainly because I was facing jail time, and my welfare worker advised that I come here because of my drug use, but I came here on my own free will.\" Another reported: \"My drinking was getting outta control, I came to better myself and get my kids back, to quit drinking, to learn more about culture.\" 2. Core Theme Two: Understanding Benbowopka Treatment Program and Needs Met Most of the participants reported their understanding of Benbowopka and their needs met through a lens that incorporated a holistic approach, hence the themes are conceptualized in the Medicine Wheel. In the Eastern quadrant of the Medicine Wheel, the core themes that emerged were Medicine Wheel and ceremony, Spirituality, guidance, cultural practices, Elder and healers, Sweat Lodge, and Smudging. Most of the participants reported that their needs were met through the daily offered Ceremonies, sharing circles, Smudging, drumming and the teachings of the Elder. They echoed that the Elder and staff helped them to heal and rediscover their identities. One participant stated: \"I wanted to go somewhere where I did not know anybody. I am happy I picked Benbowopka because I heard about the culture and Spirituality, I needed that. Big miigwetch (thanks) to my worker for helping me and introducing me to the program.\" Many participants applauded the teachings of the Medicine Wheel, as well as the guidance that came forth from the Elder, workers, and the counselors. The Sweat Lodge Ceremony and the healing that took place there were impactful according to many participants. Most said that the Benbowopka Treatment Center offered a holistic approach and was far away from the places that took them on the wrong road, and one participant expressed that: \"It helped me with self- respect and respecting my culture more.\" Most participants appreciated the information they received, which helped them feel that most of their needs were met. The information about the program helped them to \u0000nd that peace and structure. For example, a participant explained: I really like all of the teachings and guidance that I received; it was so easy to get back into the culture and I want to share this with my children. Also, the program helped me build a stronger Spiritual connection. Yet another reported: \"I enjoyed the Sacred Fires, Sweats and the morning Smudges. It helped to relieve a lot of emotions, and I got a lot out of the program.\"Page 12/20In the Southern quadrant of the Medicine Wheel, the core themes that emerged were communication, love, understanding dealing with trauma, feelings, emotions, behaviours, and respect. Many participants re\u0000ected on how powerful it was to understand how they brought substances into their lives to help them deal with the pain and suffering of the trauma and abuse. They stated that this new knowledge helped them feel strong again and con\u0000dent that they could heal and get better. The staff always reminded the participants that they had to be in the present moment and to give thanks for the knowledge that they were receiving at Benbowopka. Some participants reported that sitting in the Circles was di\u0000cult at times. Still, they were always there for each other, and they bonded, connected, and became like a family. They talked about the communication from the staff and how the staff encouraged them to express their needs and feelings. For example, one participant said: \"I understand that the program for treatment gives clients a chance to let go of baggage they are carrying while struggling with addiction. I was happy that we all received the knowledge.\" Most of the participants appreciated the fact that the staff handled emotions and feelings very compassionately. Participants knew they could talk during one-on-one sessions. They reported that these sessions helped them with behavioural issues, con\u0000ict and brought connection and healing. A number of participants shared that the staff helped them to meet their needs. For example, one participant stated: \"The staff and counselors, they're awesome; you can't say a bad thing about them, it's unreal; they helped us all; they never judged anyone; they just helped us.\" Participants also reported that they had received lots of wisdom from the treatment. For example, some participants said: \"I experienced more understanding about myself; that's how much this program affected me; it helps you understand why you do what you do and gives you tools to change.\" In the Western quadrant of the Medicine Wheel, the core themes that emerged were: professional help, grounding, good meals, peers, harm reduction, lifestyle changes, safe environment and structure. Most of the participants reported feeling safe, cared for, and empowered. All participants reported how powerful it was to share their stories with others who had similar experiences. As one participant shared: \"I am not alone; I am not the only one going through this; this program taught me that I started to use alcohol because of my trauma and that I can heal from both [the trauma and the addiction concurrently].\" They felt they were exposed to a professional team that taught them how to change their lifestyle, and all of this was given to them in a very safe environment. Hence, they reported that all their needs were met. They spoke in many ways about how they were taught to ground themselves. They expressed constant gratitude to the staff team and the kitchen staff for the great meals that they received. As one client noted: \"Yes, I feel that the program has met my needs. I have learned so much and gained so many tools. I feel so much lighter.\" And yet another said, \"They were all great at what they do here. I feel great because of them, they gave me what I needed to improve self-care.\" The core themes that emerged from the Northern quadrant of the Medicine Wheel were: coping skills, \u0000nding self, education on trauma and addiction, communication, change, and \u0000nding identity. Many participants mentioned that it was a safe environment, a place where they could learn more skills and begin to understand both trauma and addiction. As one participant stated: \"Alcohol/mental health treatment is a psychological and Spiritual pathway that offers tools to individuals that aspire to lead sober and healthy lifestyles.\" Others echoed: \"A place to discover yourself away from the addiction. A place to let go and a place to learn how to feel.\" Another participant said: \"You guys helped us understand all aspects of our disease. See it from all views and how it controls our lives, and you gave us tools to deal with it in a positive, healthy way.\" 3. Core Theme Three: Satisfaction with All InterventionsPage 13/20In the Eastern quadrant of the Medicine Wheel the core themes that emerged were: \u0000nding identity, peace, clarity, and ceremony. Many participants found that the cultural interventions, the programming, and AA information were all equally helpful. Cultural interventions that they often referred to include the Seven Grandfather Teachings, the Sacred Circle, Sacred Fire, Sweat Lodge, Elder and all the spiritual teachings. For example, as one participant stated: \"I am so thankful for the cultural practices because I used to drink every day, and I lost touch with my culture because of my addiction. I forgot what it was like to abide by the seven grandfathers. In coming here, you guys brought me back to my roots and showed me what is important.\" Coming from another participant: \"I really liked the Sacred Fire because it helped me let go and accept the things that I needed to deal with.\" Many of the participants praised all the program activities and reported that the knowledge they received from these activities helped them understand why they used substances. As one participant reported: \"The books were very helpful because answering those questions helped me identify my character defects and how the drinking affected my life.\" Another participant described that: \"I have learned some things I was doing to myself and the person I was before entering the door. I learned to let go of the pain I was carrying around for years and years.\" In the Southern quadrant of the Medicine Wheel, the core themes that emerged were: teamwork, communication, compassion, helpfulness, one-on-one counseling, acceptance, and integrity. Many participants re\u0000ected on their satisfaction with all the interventions and reported that the staff all worked together and that it helped them as a group to pull together as well. They expressed the lessons learned from counselors about communication, openness, compassion, and being supportive and helpful toward each other. They really appreciated that they had a time to meet with a counselor away from the group, so that they could talk about di\u0000cult things that they were experiencing; for example, one participant commented: \"Yes, the counselors cared and took their time to encourage healthy risks and teach clients to bring down their guard to open up even just a little.\" In the Western quadrant of the Medicine Wheel the core themes that emerged were: rules, goals, change in behavior, kitchen staff, counselors, attendants, environment, great food, and resources. Most of the participants reported feeling that they were presented with a safe environment. They also applauded the kitchen staff, the food, and the compassion of the counselors and the attendants. One participant explained, \"My counselor was awesome. Not only was she a role model, but she was also a great teacher (Heather). I was blessed to have two other counselors, working with supportive and good teachers (Allen and Sharon). Trust from each one.\" The participants reported that the kitchen staff was amazing, but that the food was not too healthy\u2014lots of fries and processed meat. They were hoping for more live (fresh) foods. Others only praised all the meals. They all applauded the attendants. For example, one participant said: \"I personally got along with all the attendants.\" Another said: \"They were all good, they were there to chat with you.\" Others complained: \"I feel there needs to be more consistency with staff. More communication between counselors and attendants based on what is allowed and what is not.\" In the Northern quadrant of the Medicine Wheel, the core themes that emerged were: role models, sobriety, support systems, excellent teaching material, understanding self, trauma and addiction connection, and lectures and videos. Like previous themes, participants applauded the team, the teachings, and what they learned. As one participant reported: \"I feel that the treatment program went beyond my needs. I learned tools and things about myself I was never aware of.\" Similarly, another participant described: \"Yes, before coming here my lifePage 14/20was unmanageable, especially my emotions. Being here, I was able to express my emotions in a healthy manner while obtaining the appropriate tools for after the completion of the program.\" Core Theme Four: Moving Forward This theme was rich and powerful, as participants expressed what they had learned, what they were taking away to the outside world or back into their communities. In the Eastern quadrant of the Medicine Wheel, the core themes that emerged were: \u0000nding an Elder, Prayer, Smudging ceremony, sponsor, and culture. Many of the participants, as in one voice, stated that they would \u0000nd an Elder and a sponsor as they continued to follow their cultural practices. Also, many talked about \u0000nding the resources that would support and help them along. As one participant pointed out: \"Going to access all available resources in Sudbury that will directly help me with my sobriety. Constantly monitor a daily healthy routine.\" Another echoed: \"During my stay here at the treatment center, I have developed a comfort with the routine that I followed. I will continue this when I get back home (healthy eating, exercising, praying, smudging, chores, etc.).\" These topics were repeated by several participants. In the Southern quadrant of the Medicine Wheel, the core themes that emerged were: gratitude list, reaching out, family connection, and communication needs. Many participants re\u0000ected on these themes and shared that they learned about practicing daily gratitude. Participants were taught how to reach out to others and practiced gratitude with their peers. Furthermore, they talked about the importance of family connection and how to communicate their needs to others. For example, one participant said: \"I have learned not to be ashamed to reach out for help. I will use my AA sponsor more.\" Others claimed: \"I am con\u0000dent in myself opening up. I can speak up the way I feel. I trust myself now.\" Another participant reported: \"I now have tools I can apply at home. I can share with my partner, and I can work on our communication and how to handle disagreements, and now I can sit and take a look back to see what's going on.\" In the Western quadrant of the Medicine Wheel, the core themes that emerged were: AA, NA, goals, meetings, healthy lifestyle, healthy food, and sobriety. As in the other two quadrants, most of the participants reported the same activities, goals, and plans. Some quotes included: \"I will try my best to change, be healthier, have food in my house, take care of my house and just be kind. It's going to be a BIG change. I am kind of scared but mostly excited. New beginnings! I will eat three meals a day, exercise more, communicate with my partner more positively, and pray more.\" In the Northern quadrant of the Medicine Wheel, the major themes that emerged were: boundaries, healing, triggers, honesty, and self-care. Multiple participants shared about how they healed. They discussed dealing with triggers and boundary issues. One participant described: \"I have neglected so many things that would/will make my life balanced and good quality life for myself, family and personal goals. I can and know how to use the tools and teachings I've learned here, and I can put them into good use.\" Another mentioned: \"I will change a lot. Attending meetings and Ceremonies. Practicing healthier thoughts and actions. I know I don't want to drink anymore. Self-care will be the biggest thing, and focusing on my children.\" DiscussionPage 15/20In collaboration with the North Shore Tribal Council and Benbowopka Treatment Center, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the historical abstinence-based treatment model. The results of the study demonstrate that clients bene\u0000tted from both the program activities and the traditional healing practices. For example, the theme of motivation to attend treatment from the Spiritual perspective demonstrated that participants were motivated to \u0000nd their culture, identity, ritual, and Elders to help with the chaos and pain they experienced in their lives. Similarly, Smith (1999) (27) and Waldram (1997) (42) found that people who recover via traditional healings and Spirituality move faster toward healing (2, 7, 12, 22). Duran (2006) in his seminal work with Indigenous clients concurred that traditional and cultural practices help struggling individuals with healing and letting go of substances (2, 12). Bringing in culture and/or traditional healing into treatment has been reported as a successful element in SUD programs designed for Indigenous peoples (7, 43). Similarly, in the Canadian context, the Round Lake Treatment Centre in British Columbia implemented a program that emphasized cultural awareness through healing circles and family involvement. Evaluation of results from this program from 1991 to 1995 indicated that most participants were no longer struggling with substance use two years after completing the program (44). Yalom and Leszez (2005) shared the power of shared stories and sitting together where clients could bring and see each other's pain. The participants applauded the connections they had with others and how they were validated. Peck (1998), in his book, A Different Drum, also writes about the healing power of creating community. He further shares how connection and wholeness is created through community building (45). This connection participants experienced with others had an even greater effect on their sense of community and moved them to hope and acceptance of their struggles (22, 46, 47). Many of the participants struggled with shame and guilt, therefore, addressing patients' emotional needs or distress such as shame, guilt is vital to healing. In a recent scoping study, Saraiya & Lopez -Castro (2016) found substantial support for an association between shame and PTSD as well as preliminary evidence suggesting that it should be treated during trauma work (48). The \u0000nding of this study resonates with the above \u0000nding. Hence, the teachings about the impact of trauma, guilt, and shame need to be addressed through educational sessions, and this could be offered through the new IHSS treatment model. Overall, all participants concurred that the program activities, supportive staff, and the presence of the traditional healing practices impacted their sense of safety and identity. Findings furthermore point to key principles in creating space for traditional Indigenous healing practices in a residential treatment center. Evidence in the literature suggests that a holistic view of IGT and SUD not only ensures that care is culturally relevant but also encourages connection and building of the community (3, 49). Limitations Our analysis is based on historical and retrospective data, which comes with several limitations. One of the limitations of the dataset is that the information was drawn from January 2013 to March 2016, providing a super\u0000cial record of each participant and intake period. The use of this pre-existing dataset limited the collection of rich qualitative demographic information about the various health and service professionals involved with the clients during each intake period. Another limitation of this study is the themes presented in the results sections, which was based on the thematic analysis performed on the data. Although the thematic analysis helped identify certain patterns in the participants' stories, it also left us with a more fragmented image of their recoveryPage 16/20journey as they were left out of the analysis process. It would have been noteworthy to have included/collaborated with the participants during the analysis phase. A further limitation involves the generalizability of the \u0000ndings, as is the nature of qualitative work. It should be noted that the \u0000ndings cannot be generalized to all residential treatment facilities in Northern Ontario. Conclusion This paper has presented the retrospective qualitative \u0000ndings that indicate the strong and positive impact of teachings and traditional healing practices. However, the abstinence-based model excluded the target group who needed this treatment the most. It is well researched that when people understand the impact of both trauma and SUD and realize that they can heal through understanding, they engage and change (12, 21, 50, 51). The \u0000nding of this study will inform subsequent implementation of a novel treatment approach for Indigenous patients with a history of IGT and SUD. Future research is encouraged to replicate this work in other Indigenous treatment centers to explore the transferability of the research \u0000nding (6, 17, 52).
