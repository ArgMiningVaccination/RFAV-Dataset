Whether you're experiencing chronic pain, stress, depression, anxiety, or any other physical or mental fatigue, there is tremendous value in learning the sources of our imbalances, and seeking the path towards harmony.\" Tobe Hanson has been inspired by Eckharte Tolle, Byron Katie, and Tony Robbins and it is reflected in his motivational and living-in-the-present-moment life coaching and performance coaching style. Tobe Hanson studied acupuncture, Chinese medicine philosophy, alternative medicine physiotherapy, anatomy, physiology, applied kinesiology, reflexology, \"Touch for Health,\" and massage. Upon his graduation in 1983 from the Institute of Alternative Medicine in Stockholm, he had already been a teacher at the school for one year and was managing the school's student practice as well as his own sports medicine practice. Tobe became a syndicated columnist for B&K Magazine, Scandinavia's biggest bodybuilding and fitness publication. The elite bodybuilders, power lifters, and Olympic weight lifters who were his patients, gave Tobe the nickname \"the Witch Doctor\" because of unconventional holistic methods and immediate healing results from his therapy. In 1985, Tobe Hanson immigrated to northern California with nothing more than a promise of a job interview at a chiropractor's office and $400 in his pocket. Tobe did not realize at the time of his immigration that he was not allowed to challenge the board of acupuncture in California to get licensed, so he had to either repeat his three-year acupuncture training in the United States or find another way to practice healing. He chose the latter and started to practice as a certified body worker, using his hands instead of needles, treating acupressure - and trigger- points. Tobe developed Hanson Muscle Therapy - HMT, a revolutionary new and holistic approach to sports medicine, which is a feedback-based manual therapy for immediate pain relief, injury rehabilitation, and performance enhancement. Since 1989, Tobe has had patients referred to him by orthopedic surgeons, family doctors, chiropractors, dentists, athletic trainers, personal trainers, acupuncturists, and massage therapists. His services are frequently sought after by professional athletes from NHL, NFL, UFC, MLB, PGA, Olympians, triathlons, college, and recreational athletes. Tobe has been part of the San Jose Sharks NHL medical staff for over 10 years and currently works weekly with the Stanford University football team. His work is helping pro athletes get pain free, stay on top of their games and prolong their careers.

Tobe has been lifting weights, building his body for over 43 years of healthy living. At age 58 he is at his life best shape. He lives in San Francisco with his wife, true love, and best friend, Sue Epperson. Sue is an independent personal trainer and a natural competitor in bodybuilding and physique (see her website below). Tobe and Sue live with their two rescued dogs, Bella, a 12 year old greyhound/pit bull mix, and Patch, an 8 year old pit bull. Tobe has provided the most holistic approach to healing I have ever experienced and his book includes an interesting look at case studies from throughout his practice as a muscle therapist. The east meets west approach will help you appreciate the connection between your mind and your body. An important work. This book really does change lives, it changed mine completely and my mothers too. For anyone who wants an educational book to read, this should already be in your hand it is very well written and has proof to its methods that the author states. "}
