We eat too much sugar, red meat and fried foods. We don't get enough fruits and vegetables. And, when we do eat fruits and vegetables, we often prepare them in ways that completely defeats the purpose. (Related: [5 Common Veggie Mishaps & How to Avoid Them](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2021/jan/5-common-veggie-mishaps-and-how-to-avoid-them/)) If you want to clear the clutter from your diet, it's time to try eating clean. What is clean eating and why is it good for you? Just like cleaning up the planet, going green can help clean up your diet. Eating clean means eliminating ultra-processed foods and embracing whole foods like fruits and vegetables. \"Eating clean refers to selecting mostly whole, minimally prepared plant-based foods while limiting intake of ultra-processed packaged foods that contain multiple ingredients and excessive amounts of added sugar and salt,\" says Kari Kooi, a clinical dietitian specialist IV at Houston Methodist. \"The more processing a food undergoes from its original form, the less nutritional value it contains.\" Eating clean and eating raw aren't the same thing. Cooking some foods actually helps breakdown vegetables' tough cell structures that make them harder for us to digest. The key is to prepare foods in a way that preserves most of their nutrients. Remember these cooking techniques: steam, roast, bake, grill, saut\u00e9, and, if necessary, microwave. Avoid frying, boiling and smothering your food. Also, fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables are preferred over canned as canned produce often contains added sugar and salt. Frozen produce can be more nutrient-dense than fresh produce thanks to the flash freezing process where the nutrients get locked in.

A change in your food's color palette is a great way to shake things up. Here are five foods to get you started: 1. Asparagus Looking for a natural anti-ager? Emerging in the springtime, these green spears offer a bounty of nutrients. Asparagus is high in glutathione, an antioxidant that can help reduce skin damage from the sun. Additionally, asparagus contains the most folate of any vegetable. Folate plays a vital role in heart health and the prevention of birth defects. Asparagus is in season during the spring. Choose stalks with dry tight tips. Wrap them in a damp paper towel and store them in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for up to four days. Dress asparagus with a little olive oil, salt and pepper before grilling, steaming or roasting it. Recipes to try: 2. Avocado Add some thin slices of smooth avocado to your [sandwich](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2020/jun/how-to-build-a-healthy-sandwich/) or [salad](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2020/jun/how-to-build-a-healthy-salad/) without feeling guilty. The monounsaturated fat in avocado is what's mostly responsible for avocado's super food status. This type of \"happy fat\" can help drive down levels of bad cholesterol. It is also good for your heart, skin and joints.
