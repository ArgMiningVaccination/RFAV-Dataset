The Paris Agreement commits countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. GHG Protocol arose out of the need to help countries and companies account for, report, and mitigate emissions, based on a report that identified an action agenda to address climate change that included the need for standardized measurement of GHG emissions. Greenhouse Gas Protocol provides accounting and reporting standards, sector guidance, calculation tools and trainings for businesses and local and national governments. It has created a comprehensive, global, standardized framework for measuring and managing emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains, products, cities and policies to enable greenhouse gas reductions across the board. WRI and WBCSD created GHG Protocol as an international standard for corporate accounting and reporting emissions, categorizing greenhouse gasses into Scope 1, 2 and 3 based on the source. In 2016, 92% of Fortune 500 companies responding to the Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) used GHG Protocol directly or indirectly through a program based on GHG Protocol. GHG Protocol also provides webinars and e-learning courses on its standards and tools. Greenhouse Gas Protocol offers the following in a protocol that is accessible to all entities looking to reduce emissions and help achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Photo by "}
