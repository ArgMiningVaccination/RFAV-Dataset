However, for the duration for the academic term, we will need to do our best to quickly transition from in person instruction to remote instruction. Be flexible in your expectations as you will not be able to deliver courses in the exact same way and students will not be able to interact in the exact same way as a face to face classroom. Use the information below to ease the transition for yourself and your students.

Once you've created an account, go to the Filters box, click on \"Manage Filters\" and then select \"Link Out\". In the box, type in \"Darnall\" and check off both the boxes for filter and link icon. Next, in the search box, type in \"Free Full Text,\" and check off the box for \"filter.\" Now you can go back to the top of the screen and click on \"MyNCBI\" again to customize your results display. Choose \"NCBI Site Preferences\" then, on the next page, change your highlighting preferences to a color of your choice (it is probably default to a non-color), and your \"result display setting\" to \"abstract\" and whichever number you choose instead of summary. You're all set and ready to search!
