As with any homeopathy remedy you need to understand what you're treating, whether it's a chronic or acute issue so the correct level of potency and number of dosages can be given. As too high a potency can be as dangerous and ineffective in treating an issue, as too little. But as an overall treatment yes Thuja is very good for pets and should be part of your home first aid kit as its application is diverse and more importantly, it uses the energy of the plant to aid and stimulate the body's own healing mechanisms. to eliminate the body of the toxin and symptoms. It's best to consult your homeopathy or holistic vet for your pet's individual health needs, especially when using this as an internal supplement/medicine. As with any herb or plant, they are natural medicines so you also want to find the balance between healing and giving the wrong dosage that it causes an adverse reaction. General-purpose guidelines. The tree: If you know what you're doing and know your trees you can use some fresh leaves or twigs add them to a homemade [bone broth](https://www.authenticapets.com/en/blog/bone-broth) to allow the properties of the plant elements to seep into the broth and form part of the broth to feed to your cat or dog. Creams: With regards to a cream, apply as many times as is recommended for the issue you're treating but take into account that your cat or dog will likely lick off the cream. However, the cream can work well to help give some temporary relief from itchiness or scratching etc. whilst you determine what is actually causing your pet to itch. If you're administering a tincture: then follow the manufactures instructions as any dosages will be dependent upon the potency level of 'the mother' used in the formula. The homeopathy product: This will again be determined by the ailment you're treating and the potency or strength of the dilution. This really should be guided by your homeopathic or holistic vet as the incorrect potency will unlikely give an improvement. Be careful how you handle the pellets, in fact, try to avoid touching them altogether as the medicine normally coats the outside of the pellets and the natural oil from our skin can draw the medicine out from the little balls prior to giving them to your pet. But if things are hectic don't worry too much about the handling just give your pet what is needed in order to help. You can feed the pellets directly into your pet's mouth, mix them with a bit of pure water or crush them between two teaspoons (ideally wooden spoons, not metal), and pop the teaspoon into your pet's mouth with the crushed pellet on. Give away from food or other medications to enable better absorption by the body. As a guide, dilutions such as 200C are high and are good for helping the body rid itself of a severe toxin so this level of potency would help with warts, tumors, and detoxing from vaccinations, although, you may require a stronger potency for combating vaccine side effects in your pet. Most standard products on the market are around 30c potency which gives a good dilution for most acute conditions whilst also allowing for a greater number of dosages throughout the day that can range from hourly to 3 times, 5 times a day, etc. depending on the issue. This level of potency (30c) is good to have around your home for use when needed. For more chronic health issues they could be treated with a greater or higher potency but the frequency dosage per day or week would be lower. Or it may be that there is a mix and match of the level of potencies of Thuja depending on how the treatment is progressing and the speed of elimination of the toxins. No one size fits all as each animal is different and how their individual body processes the toxin out will vary. For example, some dogs that have warts may be able to get rid of them over the course of a few weeks whilst another dog could take a few months and this can come down to a number of different issues such as any underlying health issue, if the warts were a consequence of vaccine toxicity, etc. The body wouldn't just be dealing with the cleanup process but it would also have to clear any toxins from the system. With any natural remedy, you the pet guardian have to be patient especially when dealing with plant remedies and homeopathy as they are normally working on the root cause of the issue and in harmony with the body.
