Waller, PhD Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine factors that influence parent's acceptance of a mandatory school-based human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program. Methods: A convenience sample of 325 parents, with children aged 9 to 17 years old, completed a 53-item survey. Survey questions targeted their opinions about HPV, the HPV vaccine, and a mandatory HPV vaccination program. /H92732tests were used to examine relationships between survey items. Results: Characteristics of parents who believed the HPV vaccine should be mandated included lim- ited their child's susceptibility (P /H11549.03), interest in HPV vaccination for their child ( P/H11549.0001), and knowledge that the vaccine reduces the risk of cervical cancer ( P/H11549.001). Parents of children aged 12 to 14 years old ( P/H11549 .02) or who knew the vaccine reduced their child's risk of developing genital warts ( P/H11549.02) and cervi- cal cancer (P /H11549.001) would be more likely to comply with a mandatory HPV vaccine program. Conclusions: Certain characteristics dene parents who support a mandatory HPV vaccination pro- gram. Greater education of parents and health care providers should improve vaccination uptake, whichultimately reduces morbidity and mortality from HPV related diseases.

Keywords: Human Papillomavirus, Health Care Surveys, Attitude, Vaccination Although the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has demonstrated robust efcacyand reasonable safety, suboptimal vaccination ratesraise concern and questions. 1- 6A survey conducted in 2007 by the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention found that approximately 25% of 13- to17-year-old girls had received at least one dose ofthe HPV vaccine. 5Moreover, far fewer 9- to 12-year-old and 18- to 26-year-old girls and women have initiated the vaccination series. The poor rateof HPV vaccine coverage for 9- to 12-year-old girlsis particularly worrisome because this has beendeemed the ideal age to vaccinate. 7In comparison, coverage for school-entry vaccines during the2007-2008 school year estimated by the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention varied between94% (varicella) and 96% (hepatitis B). 8The differ- ences in these vastly contrasting rates of vaccina- tion are likely because of many factors, includingcost, safety, knowledge, provider issues, access, andcontroversy. 9 -11However, one simple explanation is that school-entry vaccines are mandated and theHPV vaccine is not. Although discussion of mandating vaccines gen- erates conflicting opinions, this approach hasproven very benecial from a public health per-spective. School-mandated vaccination programshave increased coverage for other vaccines. 12-15 However, such an approach for the HPV vaccinehas met some resistance by the medical commu-nity. 16Further, only a minority of parents ap- prove mandating the quadrivalent HPV vac-cine. 17,18Loss of parental autonomy, cost, insufcient data from clinical trials, and tooThis article was externally peer reviewed.

Downloaded from many side effects are the main reasons for lack of parental support.17,18In addition, critical ap - praisal of parental acceptance of a mandatoryHPV vaccination program would be benecialbefore promoting required HPV vaccination forchildren. The purpose of this study was to deter-mine factors that influence parental acceptance ofa mandatory HPV vaccination program. Materials and Methods We asked parents of 9- to 17-year-old children toparticipate in this study. A convenience sample ofeligible parents was recruited from waiting roomsin family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, andpediatric clinics at the Medical College of Georgia,Augusta, and from Women's Health Associates,Atlanta, Georgia. Patients were also recruited fromcommunity sites, including Riverview NorthAugusta, South Carolina; Suwanee Academy theArts, Suwanee, Georgia; and hair and nail salons inAugusta and Atlanta. We excluded parents whowere unable to read English. This study was ap-proved by the Human Assurance Committee at theMedical College of Georgia. The questionnaire has been described previ- ously, but it consisted of 53 questions that collecteddemographic data, opinions about HPV and vac-cines, attitudes about the HPV vaccine, and issuesinvolving a mandatory HPV vaccination pro-gram. 17The main outcome questions determined parental reactions to a mandated HPV vaccinationprogram. Specically, these questions were (1) Doyou think the HPV vaccine should be added to thelist of school entry vaccine requirements? and (2) Ifthe vaccine was mandatory for a child to attendschool, which of the following statements mostagrees with your view? (answer options for question2 were \"I would sign a waiver to prevent my childfrom receiving the vaccine\"; \"I would have my childvaccinated\"; or \"I would do whatever my doctorrecommends.\" Questions were structured as yes/noand multiple choice. Some pertinent questionsfrom previously developed questionnaires were in-cluded. 19 -21 Parents were asked to participate in a study about their opinions of the HPV vaccine and man-datory vaccination programs. Eligible parents whoagreed to participate were given a 1-page coverletter that described HPV and the HPV vaccine.Subjects then completed the self-administered,anonymous survey and returned it in an envelope tothe investigators. Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations, frequencies, and percent-ages, were calculated for responses to each ques-tion./H9273 2tests were used to examine the relation - ship between various questionnaire items. Allstatistical analyses were performed using SASsoftware version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,NC) and statistical signicance was assessed us-ing an /H9251level of 0.05. Results We asked 365 parents to participate in the study;325 parents enrolled in the fall of 2008. The re-sponse rate was 89%, with insufcient time andlength of the questionnaire being the main reasonsfor parents' refusal to participate. Complete demo-graphic data based on the 325 parents have beenpublished previously. 17In summary, subjects tended to be female, 30 to 39 years old, white,protestant, have a family income between $20,000and $50,000, have some college education, andhave private health insurance. Personal history ofHPV-related problems included 13% with a previ-ous HPV infection, 5% with condyloma, and 37%had a previous abnormal Papanicolaou test result. Associations between demographic variables and agreement with adding the HPV vaccine to schoolentry requirements are seen in Table 1. Those withincomes /H11021$20,000, those with no health insurance, Medicaid, or Tricare insurance, or those who haveever had HPV were more likely to agree that theHPV vaccine should be added to school entry re-quirements. Sex, race, and age of children did notpredict support for an HPV vaccine mandate. Associations between various other variables and agreement with mandating the HPV vaccine werealso examined (Table 2). Subjects who were notfamiliar or very familiar with HPV felt it very likelythat their child could contract HPV and thought itwas very important for their child to receive theHPV vaccine; those who thought that the HPVvaccine reduced the risk of cervical cancer morefrequently thought that the HPV vaccine should beadded to school entry requirements. Parents whosupported government-mandated vaccines thoughta mandatory HPV vaccine program would be veryhelpful, and those who want the federal govern-ment to help pay for the HPV vaccine more oftensupported school entry requirements. doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2010.02.090091 Parental Acceptance of a Mandatory HPV Vaccination Program 221copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from We then examined parents' possible reactions to a mandatory HPV vaccine program: signing a waiver to prevent their child from receiving theHPV vaccine, having their child vaccinated, or do-ing what their doctor recommends (Table 3). Par-ents with a child aged 12 to 14 years who were notfamiliar or very familiar with HPV thought it wasvery likely their child could contract HPV andthought the HPV vaccine reduced the risk of cer-vical cancer and genital warts. Those whose physi-cian supported the HPV vaccine more frequentlyagreed with the statement that they would havetheir child vaccinated with the HPV vaccine. Sub-jects who were very comfortable with a mandatoryHPV vaccine program thought the federal govern-ment should pay for a mandatory HPV vaccineprogram and were very interested in the HPV vac-cine for their child; these parents were more likelyto have their child vaccinated. Several associations with government interven- tion in HPV vaccination were also examined. Par-ents who wanted their child to receive the HPVvaccine (45.5%) were more likely than those whodid not want their child to receive the vaccine(8.2%) to want their government representative tomake a law requiring the HPV vaccine ( P/H11005.0001). Subjects who thought the HPV vaccine should beadded to the list of school-entry vaccine require-ments (84.1%) were more likely to want their gov-ernment representative to make a law requiring theHPV vaccine than those who do not think it shouldbe added to the school-entry vaccine requirements(28%; P/H11005.0001). Individuals with incomes /H11021$20,000 were more likely to want the state ofGeorgia (P /H11005.004) and the federal government (P/H11005.003) to pay for the HPV vaccine for school children than parents at all other income levels(84.4% and 86.7%, respectively). Conclusions Our study identied numerous factors that increasethe likelihood of parents accepting a mandatoryHPV vaccination program. Parents with a personalhistory of HPV-related disease (HPV infection orgenital warts) were more likely to support such amandated program. Parents who had greater famil-iarity with the adverse consequences of HPV infec-tion were also more apt to approve a school-basedmandate. Interestingly, mothers with a history of aprevious abnormal Papanicolaou test were notmore inclined to support a mandatory program.Many women were unaware of the viral cause forabnormal cervical cytology. A greater number ofparents with the lowest income would also complywith a mandatory vaccination program; becauseTable 2.

Downloaded from this vaccine is fairly expensive, one could assume that mandating vaccination might have equaled freeavailability in their minds. In fact, the Vaccines forChildren Program provides free HPV vaccines toindigent children 18 years old or younger. This is avoluntary federal vaccination program that is prob-ably underutilized. The sex, age, race, education,and type of health insurance parents had did notinfluence their opinion about the importance of amandated vaccine program. In fact, fewer college-educated parents thought a mandatory HPV vac-cine program should be implemented. Parents who understood the true vulnerability of their child and the possibility of their contractingHPV supported a mandatory HPV vaccine pro-gram. Tragically, most parents do not know theubiquitous nature of HPV 21and awareness of this principle is an important cornerstone for vaccineacceptance. Moreover, no one can advise parentsabout how their child's immune system might re-Table 3.

Downloaded from spond to HPV infection, eg, spontaneous clearance or persistence that may increase the risk for devel-oping a malignancy. Parents who knew that theHPV vaccine reduced the risk of their child devel-oping cervical cancer were more inclined to con-done a mandatory program. Further educationabout HPV and its potential consequences areneeded to improve HPV vaccine uptake. Such ed-ucation could influence response to a mandatedprogram. Parents whose health care providers supported the HPV vaccine were not more likely to support amandatory vaccination program. Yet other studieshave demonstrated the value of medical advice withrespect to HPV vaccine acceptance. 19,21,22The opinion of a trusted health care provider is partic-ularly important with respect to preventive medicalcare. The dialogue between parent and health care provider probably has centered around action (get-ting the vaccine) and not the particular process(voluntary vs mandatory). Many other variables indicated that parents thought the HPV vaccine should be added to thelist of school-entry vaccine requirements. Parentswith no insurance or federally nanced insurancemore often agreed that the HPV vaccine should berequired. Reliance on government-funded heathinsurance may have an affect on parental auton-omy. These parents may be more willing to abdi-cate these health decisions to the medical legislativeprocess. However, others caution that such a man-datory program for the HPV vaccine would place anancial burden on existing government healthprograms, thereby potentially reducing coveragerates for other vaccines. 23 To parents we posed a realistic scenario: that the HPV vaccine was required for school. They couldchoose to sign a waiver to prevent their child fromreceiving the HPV vaccine, have their child vacci-nated, or follow the recommendation of theirhealth care provider. Most parents (66%) wouldsimply select to allow their child to receive thevaccination. Those parents who supported manda-tory vaccination programs knew the potentialharms from HPV, realized their child was verysusceptible to HPV infection, and wanted theirchild to receive the vaccine readily accepted com-pliance with an HPV vaccination mandate. Onceagain, knowledge about the problem seemed con-ducive to parents accepting mandatory health pro-grams designed to prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality. The remaining parents were fairly divided be- tween the other 2 options. A certain number ofparents want to retain the autonomy of makinghealth decisions for their children. In our countryand the state in which our study was conducted,opting out of vaccination for religious, medical, orphilosophical reasons is allowed. However, someargue that society should protect innocent childrenwho may be hurt by the choices of their parents. 24 The issue has been conceptualized as conflict be-tween autonomy and utilitarianism. 25Other par - ents place the decision in the hands of their healthcare provider. Education of these influential peopleis critically necessary to assure proper guidance isgiven. Our study was limited by regional sampling, greater participation by mothers, and limited Asianand Hispanic involvement. A national sample in-cluding more fathers and minorities may have al-tered our ndings. Our study was also conductedimmediately after unjust negative publicity fromthe national media. The HPV vaccine controversyis clouded by too many unproven assumptions andunknown factors. 26Although acceptance of a man - datory policy for the HPV vaccine may improve inthe future, additional research may be benecial toassess changing and evolving attitudes.
