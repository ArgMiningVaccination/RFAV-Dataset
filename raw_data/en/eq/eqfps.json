These treatments have been proven to reduce pain and stress, which can increase vitality and overall functionality. Part of Your Everyday Wellness Routine For years, LG Health has included holistic therapies in our healing programs for patients undergoing treatment for cancer or recovering from surgery or childbirth. Holistic therapies are also known to directly impact everyday wellness, whether your goal is to enhance your overall routine of self-care, or to relieve pain or stress using a non-medicinal approach. We have made it easier and more convenient to access holistic services directly, by offering massage and acupuncture on an outpatient basis, payable out-of-pocket, with no physician referrals needed.* Locations Massage and acupuncture (by a licensed, non-physician practitioner) are offered at the following outpatient locations: [Suburban Pavilion](/patient-and-visitor-information/find-a-location/suburban-pavilion) 2108 Harrisburg Pike, Suite 315 Lancaster, PA [Women & Babies Hospital\u2014Women's Specialty Center](/patient-and-visitor-information/find-a-location/womens-specialty-center) 690 Medical Office Building, 2nd Floor, 690 Good Drive, Lancaster, PA [Ann B.

Queen Street, Suite 200, Lancaster, PA Massage and Acupuncture LG Health offers appointments for massage and acupuncture at three convenient locations. Your first treatment appointment includes an initial consult, during which your therapist will discuss any areas of concern and evaluate your needs. As the name suggests, we take a holistic approach to care, considering the whole person and looking at the root cause of a condition, rather than simply addressing specific symptoms. Massage Our licensed massage therapists offer several types of massage, ranging from light touch to deep tissue, to ease pain or muscle tension, relax the body and mind, and improve circulation. Your therapist will consult with you prior to starting your first session in order to determine the best approach to meet your needs. Massage can also address specific medical issues associated with: - Anxiety\u2014helps reduce high blood pressure and heart rate, and manage overall anxiety - Constipation\u2014encourages digestive track movement, alleviates cramping, bloating, gas - Diabetes\u2014improves circulation for better insulin uptake, reduces stress to regulate blood sugar levels - Fibromyalgia\u2014improves sleep, reduces tender points and stiffness, decreases fatigue - Headaches\u2014relieves tension, corrects posture - Muscular pain\u2014addresses posture and other issues that contribute to pain and joint dysfunction Acupuncture This ancient form of Chinese medicine uses very thin, single-use, sterile needles to stimulate specific points on the body to balance energy flow, reduce pain and improve health. While some people experience mild discomfort when a needle is inserted, the treatment is generally well tolerated. While acupuncture is best known for the treatment of pain, it is also used to improve depression, anxiety, acute and chronic respiratory conditions, osteoarthritis, migraines, digestive complaints, infertility, menopause symptoms, and menstrual difficulties. Many recipients with no major health concerns also use acupuncture to enhance wellness and prevent illness. Acupuncture offered in our Holistic Therapy program is administered by a licensed, non-physician practitioner who consults with each client to identify goals and treat the whole person. LG Health also offers physician-administered acupuncture through its Pain Management program. Those sessions are typically shorter in duration and designed to address a specific medical concern; they may also be covered by some insurance plans. Pricing Holistic therapies are payable out-of-pocket by cash, checks and credit cards, at the time of service.* If your insurance plan covers these services, we may be able to bill for them. Check with our department when scheduling your appointment to learn more.
