Objectives . The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the e ectiveness of the fermented plant extract Iscador , produced from the white-berry European mistletoe, in the treatment of patients with cancer with respect to quality-of-life- (QoL-) associated measures. Methods . We PubMed/Medline, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), CAMbase, and other for controlled clinical studies on parameters associated with QoL. Outcome data were extracted and converted into standardizedmean di erences and their standard errors. Results . Thirteen prospective and controlled studies which met the inclusion/exclusion criteria reported positive e ects in favor of the Iscador application. A random-e ect meta-analysis estimated the overall treatment eect at P<. 0001). However, quality of the studies was poor. Conclusions . The analyzed studies give some evidence that Iscador treatment might have benecial short-time e ects on QoL-associated dimensions and psychosomatic self-regulation. 1. Introduction Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has be- come increasingly popular over the last decades. Accordingto Bausell et al., especially patients with chronic diseasesincreasingly seek for CAM-therapies [ 1]. With a growing amount of health information in the internet, physiciansand therapists and patients are often not prepared tojudge provided information of CAM health care approachesproperly. Information dissemination of published evidenceabout the e ectiveness of remedies and therapies therefore forms a necessary basis for shared decision making forpatients and practitioners. In Europe, extracts from Viscum album (V A-E), the European white-berry mistletoe, are widely used to treatpatients with cancer, in addition to patients with arthrosis,hypertension, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, and so forth [ 2] Historically, the intentions of mistletoe uses were manifold and conflicting in several cases (i.e., swellings or tumors, epilepsy, diseases of spleen and liver, labor pains, \"weaknessof the heart,\" edema, eczema, ulcers of wounds) [ 2]. In 1920, mistletoe extracts were introduced for the rst time as a cancer treatmentby Steiner (1861-1925) [ 3], the founder of anthroposophy.He recommended a drug extract produced in a compli- cated manufacturing process combining sap from mistletoeharvested in the winter and summer [ 4]. Based on his recommendations, several anthroposophical doctors havetreated their cancer patients with these extracts within thelast century. Meanwhile, clinical evaluations of mistletoe as an adju- vant cancer treatment have expanded. Recent scienticresearch has conrmed that mistletoe extracts induceapoptosis, stimulate immunocompetent cells, and protectthe DNA of mononuclear cells (for review see [ 2,5,6]). Several experiments using tumor-bearing animals showedimpressive reduction of tumor growth and/or increasedsurvival with the application of mistletoe therapy (for reviewsee [ 2,5,6]). There are several whole-plant extracts from Viscum album on the market which di er with respect to the extraction process and thus relative proportions of their con-stituents [ 7]. Due to this diversity of mistletoe products and their proportions of pharmacologically relevant constituents,the interpretation of clinical studies is di cult. Consequently it is not too surprising that preceding reviews on theclinical e ects of mistletoe extracts in cancer patients, which summarizes a mixture of studies with di erent designs and plant extracts used, are conflicting in their results [ 6,8-13].2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Several of these reviews detected heterogeneity of studies with respect to the drug extracts used to treat the patientsand thus are not suited to calculate reliable e ects sizes. In fact, there are up to ve di erent pharmaceutical processes of mistletoe extract preparation, and thus the pharmaceuticalproducts show highly specic pattern of active components (i.e., pattern of cytotoxic mistletoe lectins, viscotoxins, etc.) [7]. T o overcome this problem, we intended to determine the e ectiveness of V A-E in the treatment of patients with cancer and focused on the most commonly used V A-Ewhich is covered by a relatively large spectrum of publishedstudies, the fermented plant extract Iscador (WELEDA AG, Switzerland). This whole-plant extract is produced fromfresh leafy shoots and fruits of the summer and winterharvest, is rich on mistletoe lectins and viscotoxins [ 7,14], and is recommended to be applied 2-3 times per weeksubcutaneously. While most clinical studies on the e ects of V A-E focus on the survival of cancer patients, the e ects on the patients' quality of life (QoL), which gains more and more importanceas a relevant outcome variable in cancer therapy, received lessconsideration so far. Thus, we determined the e ectiveness of the V A-E Iscador in the treatment of patients with cancer with respect to QoL-associated dimensions and analyzed thestudies with respect to trials where patients of the controlgroup received only standard care and no extra treatment. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Search Strategy. Between February and April 2008, we searched databases such as PubMed/Medline, the ExcerptaMedica Database on QoL-associated measures of cancer patientsusing Iscador extracts. Search terms were either \" Iscador we asked several experts for gray literaturenot listed in the above-mentioned databases, checked thereference lists of relevant articles and authors, and contactedthe manufacturer of the V A-E. We performed an additionalcheck for new studies in 2010, which did not reveal new results. 2.2. Selection Criteria. Inclusion criteria were all controlled clinical studies (at least historic or literature) on parameters associated with quality of life in cancer patients treated withthe V A-E Iscador , published in English or German language journals. Neither the experts in the eld nor the manufac-turer was aware of any other study published in French,Spanish, Chinese, or other languages. However, one studyfrom Denmark was published in a Danish journal and in anEnglish language journal, and thus we referred to both pub-lications presenting data of the same study. We are not awareof unpublished studies on the e ects of Iscador on QoL. We excluded eld reports, case series, case reports, studies without a control group, abstracts which proceededa full-length publication, translations of already publishedmanuscripts, double publication of similar data (with the exception of the presentation of further data), internalreports, and unpublished manuscripts. 2.3. Analysis of Data. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review. They took partin the extraction of data and assessment of methodologicalquality and external validity. Disagreements were resolvedby consensus. We graded the methodological quality of thestudies by the following checklist (rater assessment): ade-quate description of the design (retrospective, prospective,retrolective, multicenter study, etc.), accrual (randomization,matched pairs, etc.), comparability of groups (controlsand V A-E), description of dropouts, allocation concealment(analysis of concealed treatment allocation was di cult because most studies did not provide su cient data to judge\u2014either there were no statements or information wasat least unclear), description of the intervention (dosage and duration of V A-E application), description of statisti- cal analysis, and external validity (representative patients,relevant therapeutic concepts, generalization of results).Additionally we referred to the JADAD rating score whichassesses randomization, blinding, and dropouts [ 15]. The reporting of the results adhered to the MOOSE [ 16] and QUOROM [ 17] guidelines. 2.4. Statistical Analysis. If a trial was found to be eligible, assessments of its methodological quality were done inde-pendently by two reviewers (A. B \u00a8ussing, T. Ostermann) and recorded on an especially predesigned data form together with the basic trial data and the extracted results. Allocationconcealment was assessed in accordance with the Cochraneguidelines [ 18]: A =adequate (telephone randomization or using consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); B=uncertainty about the concealment (method of concealment is not known); C=inadequate (e.g., alternate days, odd/even date of birth, hospital number). Disagreements on methodological quality ratings were discussed by both assessors until they reached a consensus. Data were independently extracted by two persons (A. B\u00a8ussing, T. Ostermann) and independently entered into a data form which was especially designed for trials onmistletoe by a third person (C. Raak). If the data entriesdiered, both reviewers were contacted to recheck the publications and were forced to come to a consensus, whichcould be reached in all cases. Data on the following details were extracted: (i) details of the publication (rst author, country, year, journal), (ii) details on the dosage and application of Iscador, (iii) type, name, dosage and application of the control therapy/alternative therapies, (iv) grading and location of cancer, (v) age and gender distribution of patients,Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 (vi) methodological quality of the study (see above), (vii) outcome(s). All data were separately analyzed for trials where patients of the control group received only standard care and no extratreatment (or placebo-controlled trials). QoL-associatedoutcome data (QoL questionnaires and scales: mean valuesand standard deviations, mean/median di erences, e ect estimates and condence intervals, odds ratios, etc.) wereextracted as they were given in the publication. They wereconverted into standardized mean di erences (SMD) and their standard errors (STE) using standard formulas [ 18]. Eect sizes<0.5 indicate small e ects and>0.8 large e ects [19]. All studies were analysed in a single analysis, regardless of on what scale the results had originally been measured orreported. The association between sample size and trial results was graphically displayed in funnel plots, by plotting e ect sizes on the horizontal axis (in a logarithmic scale) against theirstandard errors, or against the total patient numbers, on the vertical axis [ 20]. Funnel plots are adequate instruments to detect small study size e ects, including publication bias. In the absence of bias, results from small studies should scatterwidely at the bottom of the graph, with the spread narrowingamong larger studies. Publication bias (and also lack ofequipoise) may lead to asymmetrical funnel plots. Moreover,the asymmetry of the funnel plot was further explored by aweighted linear regression analysis (metaregression) whichmodeled the log SMD as a function of its standard error[21]. Weights were chosen inversely to the squared standard error. From this model, the asymmetry coe cient (AC) was estimated as the slope of the regression line. Heterogeneity between trials was assessed by standard 2- tests and the I2coecient which measures the percentage of total variation across studies due to true heterogeneity ratherthan chance [ 22]. Overall estimates of the treatment e ect were obtained from random-e ect meta-analysis [ 23]. Additionally, from metaregression a predicted SMD was obtained for trials witha standard error as small as the smallest observed standarderror of all included trials. The extent to which study-levelvariables were associated with SMDs was investigated bytting multivariable metaregression models. The followingvariables were considered: standard error of SMD, tumor localization (breast, stomach, lung, colon, ovary, corpus, skin cancer yes/no), randomization (yes/no), and matched-paircomparison (yes/no)\u2014due to the fact that all matched-pairstudies were from the same source. 3. Results 3.1. Search Results. We found 16 studies on the clinical e ects ofIscador usage on QoL-associated dimensions which were described in 11 publications ( Table 1 ). Some described data on di erent sets of patients and/or tumor stages or di erent designs within the same report. Two randomized trialscontrolled Iscador against placebo/alternative treatment (i.e., water or vitamin B, resp. [ 24,25] )a n dt h u sw e r en o te n r o l l e dn=16 n=2 n=1 QoL-associated dimensions NonrandomizedNo results for the control group Figure 1: Flow diagram of study exclusion. in the evaluation \" Iscador versus no extra treatment.\" The results of these studies are nevertheless presented in Table 1 . Moreover, one study with a historic control, reportingjust the QoL results of the V A-E arm [ 35], was excluded from the analysis. Thus, 13 studies provided data on QoLassociated dimensions to extract SMDs and their standarddeviations with respect to a comparison Iscador versus no extra treatment ( Figure 1 ). 3.2. Design of Studies. All of the remaining 13 studies according to specications in the articles had a prospectivedesign. Nine of them were randomized ( Figure 1 ). According to the nature of the control group, no trial was blinded. The oldest study (which was excluded from the analysis because of a lacking control group) dated back to 1984; allothers were published in 2001 or later, the most recent being2008. The number of patients enrolled varied considerablyfrom 32 to 396; overall 734 patients were treated with Iscador and 741 patients served as controls. In most cases, the respective dosage of Iscador , was not given in the original studies. The trials included in this meta-analysis were of poor quality, as indicated by randomization, matched-pair build-ing, blinding, multicenter, description of dropouts, and soforth. ( Table 1 ). Nine investigations reached a JADAD score of 2, ve a score of 1, and one no point ( Table 1 ). Due to methodological problems, an adequate blinding of V A-Eapplication (which results in most cases in observable localreactions at the injection site) is not possible (reviewed in[10]), and thus the most important di erentiating variable was in fact randomisation versus nonrandomisation andthus was used for the multivariable metaregression analysis. 3.3. E ect Sizes. As shown in Figure 2 , all studies reported positive e ects in favor of the Iscador application.

Discussion 4.1. Quality of Studies and Outcome. Although the method- ological quality of investigations on the clinical e ects of V A-E has improved over the last years, as at least morerandomized controlled studies were performed. However,many problems still remain: most trials did not report dataon compliance and completeness of follow up, intention-to-treat analysis was rarely mentioned, and the number ofpatients was in all cases <200. Nevertheless, all studies were prospective and had a parallel group design; most wererandomized, but none was blinded ( Table 1 ).

QoL-associated variables is rather low (all studies <3). Randomisation versus nonrandomisation was thus the mainrelevant variable used in the multivariable metaregressionanalyses which showed that randomized studies did notdier from non-randomized investigations. In all publications addressing the e ects of Iscador appli- cation on QoL-associated variables positive e ects found; however, the funnel plots may indicate either a selectionbias or a lack of equipoise (i.e., the investigators may havejustiable assumptions of drug superiority and thus intendedto prove the e ectiveness of the Iscador ). Two-thirds of the studies were from the same origin and thus had the samemethodological problems. These had a matched-pair design,either with or without randomization, a good descriptionof the methodology, and a profound discussion of potentialbias factors. It is obvious that the strict matching processsignicantly a ected the number of patients enrolled in the evaluation (all studies had had sample sizes of <200 subjects), but it is di cult to explain the data of the funnel plots which indicate a publication bias in favor of positive results. 4.2. Congruence of Results. Although the benet of adju- vant mistletoe treatment has been demonstrated in somerandomized and observational studies, a comprehensivemeta-analytical approach like the present one has not beenpreviously conducted. Ernst et al. published a systematicreview on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) using variousV A-Es and stated that \"statistical pooling was not possiblebecause of the heterogeneity of the primary studies; thereforea narrative systematic review was conducted\" [ 11].

Ernst et al. stated that theweaker studies implied benets of V A-E, particularly in termsof quality of life, while none of the methodologically strongerstudies were able to verify a benet with respect to survival orQoL [ 11]. A Cochrane Review of Horneber et al. published in 2008 analyzed RCTs on various mistletoe extract preparations and indicated weak evidence that V A-E application couldbe e ective with respect to QoL during chemotherapy for breast cancer [ 12]. Both groups [ 11,12] argued that the main reason for the restricted informative value of the ndingsconcerning subjective outcomes in trials with V A-E was theunblinded assessments or the unblinding of the interventionthrough local reactions. Also Kienle et al. summarized in their systematic review of various RCTs from 2003 that most of these publications reported statistically signicant positive outcomes (or at leastpositive trends) for survival or tumor remission and QoL,while several studies reported no e ect on survival, recur- rence, remission, and QoL [ 6]. In 2007, Kienle and Kiene published a systematic review of prospective clinical trialson anthroposophic mistletoe extracts and stated benecialeects of V A-E application with respect to QoL and reduction of side e ects of cytoreductive therapies in most analyzed trials [ 9]. They concluded that the best evidence for e cacy of V A-E exists for the improvement of QoL and the reductionof side e ects of cytotoxic therapies, while the survival benet was a matter of critique [ 9].6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 4.3. Limitations of the Used Measures of QoL and Associ- ated Dimensions. T o avoid a selection bias, we included all studies addressing QoL-associated dimensions, that is,studies using standard health-related OoL-instruments andthose measuring QoL related dimensions. We will discussputative limitations of some instruments used by the primary authors. The investigation of Kjaer, which used a less suited visual analogue scale (V AS) to measure well-being and QoL,was excluded from analysis anyway because the authorspresented just the data of the V A-E arm [ 35,36]. The investigation of Borelli [ 24] used the Spitzer Quality of Life Index [ 37] which covers relevant 5 QoL dimensions. Also the EORTC-QLQ C30 and BR 23 which incorporate 9 multi-item scales is among the best tting QoL instruments [ 38]. The trial of Dold et al. [ 25] used a measure which refers to the Karnofsky performance status scale [ 39], which is the physician's rating of physical activity and self-supply, andrated additional medical conditions such as appetite, cough,dyspnea, pain, fever, and edema. These measures refer toimportant aspects of QoL and can be regarded as more or less suitable. However, this study relied on physician's rating rather than patient's self-assessment; nevertheless, toavoid a selection bias we decided to include this study too(in fact the treatment e ects were rather low, and thus this decision would not promote very positive overall e ects). The authors detected signicant di erences only with respect to subjective improvement of disorders\u2014but there were nodierences between the groups with respect to the outcomes. All other trials used a 16-item instrument to measure psychosomatic \"self-regulation\" [ 26-33,40], which was assumed to asses an important aspect of QoL. Recently wewere able to approve correlations between \"self-regulation\"and QoL; this unique dimension deals with competenceand autonomy of patients and thus should be regarded as an active problem-solving capacity in terms of an active adaptation to stressful situations to restore well-being [ 41]. Nevertheless, this dimension can be regarded as QoL associ-ated. 4.4. Potential Bias Factors. Potential bias factors which might contribute to the overall positive e ects described in the anal- yses of Grossarth-Maticek et al. [ 26-33,40] were discussed in detail by the authors themselves [ 26,29], that is, selection bias and loose matching, Cox proportional hazard models with/without adjustments, and so forth. Because these studies started in 1973, several relevant study objectives werenot available, that is, exact dates of rst diagnosis, operation,initial and follow-up data assessments and matching, socio-economic status, social support, spirituality, and so forth. Inthese studies, attrition bias was less important because withthe drop out of any study patient, the matching partner wasalso excluded and thus the balance of the groups was notseverely a ected [ 26,29]. Altogether, their internal validity was limited by selection bias and confounding; moreover,there were no written protocol, no statistical hypotheses, andno sample size calculation, the sample sizes were in mostcases very small.Patients expectations Activity/adjustment Tumor cell apoptosisActivation un-/specic immune systemBeta-endorphin release Survival QoL' Viscum album application Figure 5: Hypothetical diagram explaining the possible mecha- nisms of Viscum album extract application on QoL. Another intriguing fact could be that the nonrandomized studies of Grossarth-Maticek's group might have a lowerexternal validity (generalisability), because the inclusion andexclusion criteria were not very precise and not all of themwere explicitly formulated in advance. Moreover, apart fromthe matching criteria, there were no explicit procedures forbuilding pairs. The most important fact was raised by theauthors themselves [ 26,29,33], as they cannot exclude the possibility that patients with a good prognosis were preferentially enrolled, since patients from both groups whodied shortly after the diagnosis would not have entered thestudy. Because the investigations with a stronger internal valid- ity yielded similar results as compared to the studies withthe stronger external validity point in the same direction,one can conclude that the results are more or less consistent.Nevertheless, because several patients started with lower self-regulation score during the treatment, one cannot excludethe possibility of normalization and regression to the meaneects. 4.5. Explanation of Outcome E ects. How could the positive eects of Iscador on QoL-related dimensions be explained (Figure 5 )? Direct pharmacological e ect could depend on the applied doses, as suggested by N \u00b4emeth et al. [ 42]. Indeed, a recent study investigated di erent doses escala- tion regimes of Iscador and found signicant erences for the QoL aspects: physical complaints, vitality, mentalbehavior, presence of personality, and social environment[43]; particularly the presence of personality was highest in the group with large local reactions in response to theplant extract, an e ect which was signicantly dependent on the dose escalation. That the plant extract by itself may be crucial for the benecial e ects is supported by ndings showing that the survival of cancer patients is a function ofthe relative duration of Iscador treatment, even in patients with initially identical \"self-regulation\" scores [ 26]. But it is unclear whether the physical improvement may precedea psychical stabilization or whether a mental stabilizationmay have a stress-reducing e ect which in turn may have a benecial e ect on the physical situation. One cannot ignore the fact that positive expectations of the patients are also modulating factors influencing behaviorwhich in turn can have a strong impact on health. Expec-tations are also thought to underlie the so-called \"placeboEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 eects\" , impacting perceptions and biological processes. In f a c t ,i n v a s i v ep r o c e d u r e ss u c ha si n j e c t i o n sh a v eah i g h e r\"placebo response\" compared with oral drugs [ 44]. One should realize that the \"placebo e ect\" itself represents a true measurable correlate of an organism's psychoneurobiologicalresponse and, thereby, influences the healing process [ 45]. The \"placebo e ect\" is taken to mean also the broad array of nonspecic e ects in the patient-physician relationship, including attention, compassionate care, and the modulationof expectations; anxiety; self-awareness [ 46]. At least, one may suggest that all of these explanations could contributeto the observed positive e ects, particularly because the application of V A-E is regarded by most patients as an activeand e ective chance to ght the tumor. Thus, there might be a combination of pharmacological and motivational aspectsmediated by the Iscador application which may contribute to the positive outcome ( Figure 5 ). Whatever the underlying eects are, a recent review of our group found that pooled analysis of clinical studies suggests that adjuvant treatment ofcancer patients with the mistletoe extract Iscador is associated with a better survival [ 13], albeit we found hints for a publication bias which limits the evidence found in thatmeta-analysis, and this better survival is probably associatedwith a better QoL, too. 5. Conclusion T h ea n a l y z e dt r i a l sg i v es o m ee v i d e n c et h a t Iscador treatment might have moderate benecial short-time e ects on QoL- associated dimensions and psychosomatic self regulation.We are aware that the pooled estimates are driven byquite heterogeneous data. Because the results are promis-ing, despite of methodological limitations, large and well-designed randomized controlled trials should be funded.Subsequently, the studies may serve as models for futuretrials in the area.
