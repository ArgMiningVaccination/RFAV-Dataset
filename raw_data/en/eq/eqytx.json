In this episode we discuss twitter, free speech, and why zero is a special number. Bret sings a little, and invokes Ray Bradbury. Then we discuss a surgeon who is proud to do \"non-binary\" surgeries, and another doctor who describes how enforcement of Covid policies helped silence doctors who were critical of trans ideology. We discuss what puberty blockers are, and whether they are safe. ***** Our sponsors: Seed: Start a new healthy habit today with Seed probiotics.

In this episode we discuss medicine, scientific publishing, and just how bad things have gotten. The New England Journal of Medicine declined to publish a letter that would have provided valuable scientific context for a paper they recently published, and we discuss Bret's reserve capacity hypothesis regarding the evolution of senescence and the relationship of telomere length to both aging and cancer. Then we discuss uterine transplants. What can be done for women who are born without uteruses who want to bear children of their own? What about for men who present themselves to the world as women? How about women who have transitioned \"into\" men but have decided that they would like to bear children after all? And who can get Continuing Medical Education credits from the American Medical Association for pretending that up is down, male is female, and reality is a thing of the past?

In this episode we discuss why we are sitting outside: Covid does not transmit outside, and this has been clear for well over three years now. Then we discuss story and storytelling, paths diverging in a wood, and the need for all stories within one universe to reconcile. We discuss narrative, gender ideology, male and female typical modes of engagement, and science. We discuss new research that finds that mammals, but not birds, seem to like fruit that contains alcohol. And we discuss the Cartesian crisis that we are living through, and the Maui fires. ***** Our sponsors: MDHearingAid: Use promo code DARKHORSE to receive a significant discount off your order of already inexpensive, high-quality hearing aids, plus receive a free extra charging case. https://www.mdhearingaid.com Sole: Carefully designed, personally moldable footbeds for healthy feet.
