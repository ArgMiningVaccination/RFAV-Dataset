What follows are the top 75\u2014those that define why we travel now and determine where we're going next. Our team of editors and contributors criss crossed the globe to put together this year's [Hot List](https://www.cntraveler.com/the-bests/hot-list). We started with nearly 500 hotels, and whittled it down to the 75 below, found in 33 countries: in major cities, the dreamiest beaches, and places travelers have rarely heard of before. Our army of hotel sleuths assessed everything from Wif-Fi strength to rooftop pool scene. Ultimately, the hotels that land on this list are the absolute best of the best; the game-changing, boundary pushing, vacation-making openings that are so good, we're already dreaming about going back. Scroll down to see the complete list. And peruse all of our [Hot List](https://www.cntraveler.com/the-bests/hot-list) galleries to find out what we loved most about each winner.
