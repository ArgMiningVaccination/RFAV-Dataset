[Hotline (877) 378-4154](tel:18773784154) Traditional Treatment vs. Holistic Addiction Treatment In a traditional approach, there is no individualized treatment. You check in, detox, and then go to addiction education lectures, group therapy, and AA twelve-step meetings. There is a lack of a customized and personalized approach for everyone. Most programs follow a traditional 28 to 30-day program length. Once they complete these courses of treatment, they go back to the real world. And the real world is filled with temptations, and unfortunately, most people relapse. In fact, according to the Journal of American Medicine Association, 40% to 60% of patients treated for alcohol or other drug dependence return to active substance use within a year following treatment discharge. [2] This emphasizes the need to follow a more holistic drug rehab process for achieving overall recovery and minimizing the possibilities of addiction relapse. In many instances, holistic therapies, such as yoga, meditation, acupuncture, and massage, are used to augment more traditional addiction treatment therapies; like individual counseling, behavioral therapies, and [medical detox](https://welevelupnj.com/addiction/substance-abuse/).

The overall goal of holistic addiction treatment therapy is to discover one's true sense of self and give the addict a purpose in the external world. The therapies used are evidence-based and are an alternative treatment route that works well for many people who did not benefit from the traditional approach to recovery. Holistic Therapies Heal Body, Mind & Spirit Addiction is a complex disease that often creates a sharp dissociation between mind, body, and spirit. On the other hand, successful recovery from drugs and alcohol depends on strengthening the interconnections between them. This is where holistic interventions that treat clients as the whole sum of their parts (body, mind, and spirit) - as opposed to a body needing medication or a spirit needing the [Twelve Steps](https://welevelupnj.com/addiction/12-step-program/) - offer something truly invaluable to people in early recovery. Holistic treatments uniquely strengthen the mind-body-spirit connection that is so essential to becoming a healthy, happy, and fully integrated person, which is the ultimate goal for anyone in recovery.

Long-Term Effects of EMDR Therapy Numerous small studies have discovered evidence that EMDR therapy is effective throughout the long term as well as in the short term. One 2017 study evaluated individuals several months after receiving either \"standard care\" (SC) treatment for PTSD or EMDR therapy. They noticed that EMDR was significantly more effective in reducing PTSD symptoms both during and immediately after therapy. During the three- and eight-month follow-ups, they also realized that participants continued to experience these benefits long after the course of therapy had ended. Overall, the study discovered that EMDR therapy provided people with a longer-lasting reduction in symptoms than SC.

The study discovered that 68 percent of the participants in the EMDR group demonstrated complete remission following treatment.
