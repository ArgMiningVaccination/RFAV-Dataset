At Natural Medical Solutions, allergy symptoms are treated as evidence of a hormonal imbalance triggered by food sensitivities and/or exposure to environmental toxins, or perhaps pets, lotions, chemicals, medications, or even natural substances. \"Generally, we begin with a blood test to detect food allergies or intolerances,\" explained Dr. Gail Ravello, PhD-IMD, ND, MH, CNC, medical director. \"The test will show adjustments needed in diet, and we also detoxify the liver. Toxins cause inflammation and inflammation thwarts function of the body's immune system. Allergies are usually just one manifestation of the hormonal imbalance.\" In addressing whole-body health, naturopathic physicians routinely correct what might otherwise involve cascading medical ailments sharing a root cause. The integrative application of holistic treatment will likely also include use of the [hyperbaric chamber](https://www.natmedsol.com/hyperbaric-chamber-oxygen-therapy.html) along with Omega 3 and Vitamin C supplementation, and doesn't necessarily rule out temporary use of antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, anti-inflammatory medical or corticosteroids, the common remedies of conventional medicine. \"When symptoms are acute, we may need the immediate relief conventional treatment supplies,\" said Dr. Ravello. \"But it's like putting out a fire that is sure to rekindle, unless and until the root cause is addressed.\" \"It takes time for the body to heal itself, but the payoff for patience is lifelong freedom from allergy attacks and the expense of medication that only manages symptoms.\" The most well-known food sensitivity signs and side effects include: As the saying goes, \"We are what we eat,\" which is true when it comes to the types of food that we eat. When we eat foods that our body does not agree with, it can cause inflammation in the body, which brings on toxins that can lead to diseases. Some of those diseases are Chronic Constipation, Colitis (an inflammation of the colon) and Crohn's Disease (a chronic disease of the digestive system). The body's immune system keeps you healthy by fending off diseases and different threats to overall health. Eighty percent of the immune system lives in the gut. Healthy nutrition plays a vital role in good digestion, which has an effect on your mind and body. It is very important to have a food allergy test done by your doctor so that you are aware of the foods that may be causing inflammation in your body. At Natural Medical Solutions, Dr. Gail Ravello does an extensive Food Allergy test that is part of a lifestyle change treatment plan. She assists individuals with foods to avoid and helps to incorporate a nutrition plan of what foods one can eat. Keeping your gut healthy and knowing your food sensitivity will help keep the immune system functioning in optimal health. Natural Medical Solutions is an advocate of the integrative holistic health philosophy which supports the person as a \"whole.\" Each client is unique with individual needs. We strive to build a relationship with each of our clients and support them throughout their journey towards Optimal Health and Wellness. As a teenager, everyone at some point in their lives experiences pimples, zits, boils, cysts, and blackheads. But the worst skin problem is having eczema. Don't you ever get tired of scratching your skin until it bleeds? Or have nasty blisters and scars on your body, because of the uncontrollable itch! What causes this skin disease and how can we treat it? Eczema is a condition that causes the skin to become inflamed or irritated, which usually appears very dry, thickened, or scaly. No matter which part of the skin is affected, eczema is almost always itchy. Sometimes the itching will start before the rash appears, but when it does, the rash most commonly occurs on the face, knees, wrists, hands, or feet. Eczema affects about 20 percent of adults and children in the U.S. Most infants who develop the condition outgrow it by their 10th birthday, while some people continue to experience symptoms on and off throughout their life. The most common type of eczema is known as atopic \"dermatitis,\" or \"atopic eczema.\" Atopic refers to a group of diseases that develops other allergic conditions, such as asthma and hay fever. In fair-skinned people, these areas may initially appear reddish and then turn brown. Among darker-skinned people, eczema can affect pigmentation, making the affected area lighter or darker. In infants, the itchy rash can produce an oozing, crusting condition that occurs mainly on the face and scalp, but patches may appear anywhere. With proper treatments, the disease can be controlled in the majority of sufferers. Conventionally-accepted medical approaches of assessment for this condition may include looking at your skin rash and asking about stress in your life, your diet, drugs you are taking, and any chemicals or materials you may be exposed to at work, to find the cause of your rash. Generally, your medical doctor may prescribe topical corticosteroids to relieve the itching and redness. However, used over a long period of time, these cortisone-based creams can have side effects such as thinning out the skin, especially when used to the sensitive skin of babies. Under the concepts of naturopathic medicine, assessment is oriented toward determining what is impeding your body's ability to function normally. At Natural Medical Solutions & Naturally Ageless Naturopathic Clinic, our naturopathic doctor Dr. Gail Ravello focuses on finding the root cause of the problem and then treating it with naturopathic treatments along with nutrition/diet and lifestyle changes and/or supplements. Dr. Ravello might also recommend acupuncture as part of the treatment, depending on your symptoms. At your initial consultation, Dr. Ravello may recommend food/environmental allergy or intolerance testing, and any other tests that she feels would be helpful in diagnosis and treatment. Here are some natural treatment approaches that I suggest to help soothe eczema: Eczema may be exacerbated with stress and anxiety, so mind-body techniques such as meditation, tai chi, yoga, and stress management may help prevent it. Starch, oatmeal, and other baths may temporarily relieve the symptoms. A healthy lifestyle is of utmost importance to prevent re-occurrence of eczema. Anything that aggravates the symptoms should be avoided. This includes food allergens; although food allergies are a very individual matter, common irritants may include wheat, corn, dairy, soy, peanuts, eggs, beef, and lamb. Here are a few things that you can change in your diet to help reduce the flare-ups that come with eczema: Traditional Chinese Medicine is very effective in treating eczema. Usually, at the naturopathic clinic, we use acupuncture and [herbal therapy](/botanical-medicine.html) to treat various skin disorders, and eczema as well. Acupuncture involves the insertion of sterilized fine steel needles at specific points in the body in order to stimulate the function of internal organs. Three body meridians are essential to the treatment of eczema - the lung, spleen and liver meridians. These three organs have direct influence on the skin. Blood plays a defensive role by delivering nutrients and removing metabolic wastes, toxins and pathogens from the body. Usually, once the preliminary diagnosis is done, our naturopath may suggest acupuncture as part of the treatment plan and may suggest the patient to come in once a week for an hour-long relaxing and pain-free acupuncture treatment. The naturopathic treatments for eczema provided at our clinic aim for the complete elimination of the root cause of eczema. At Natural Medical Solutions, we have an amazing organic eczema cream that we sell. Give us a call at [(770) 674-6311](tel:7706746311) to schedule an appointment. We look forward to hearing from you.
