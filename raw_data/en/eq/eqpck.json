Listing a study does not mean it has been evaluated by the U.S. Federal Government. | |ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05468801| | | Recruitment Status : Recruiting First Posted : July 21, 2022 Last Update Posted : July 21, 2022 - Study Details [Tabular View](/ct2/show/record/NCT05468801) [No randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in adult subjects with diagnosis of migraine with or without aura. All patients will be assessed in a screening visit at the Study Hospital Dept. of Neurology in order to confirm and certify migraine diagnosis and evaluate correctness and stability of usual acute and preventive standardized pharmacological treatment. Patients will fulfill a 30 day baseline period to monitor headache activity, migraine related symptoms, and medication usage. Subjects agreeing to participate in the study and meeting clinical-neurological eligibility criteria will then assist to a first homeopathic consultation to assess viability of homeopathic treatment and selection of the individualized homeopathic remedy. Patients who meet both neurological and homeopathic inclusion criteria will begin a three month treatment phase. An estimated of 72 patients, calculated according to the Open-Epi program ((c) 2003, 2008 Andrew G. Dean and Kevin M. Sullivan, Atlanta, GA, USA) , will be randomized according to statistics Epidat Program (4.2 version, july 2016 Panamerican Health Organization (PHO-WHO); to receive Individualized homeopathic treatment + standard pharmacological treatment OR unidentified placebo + standard pharmacological treatment. Study homeopathic remedy or placebo will be administered for a minimum period of 12 weeks with control visits every 4 weeks to assess neurological and homeopathic evolution, adherence and possible adverse events. During the study period patients will continue filling the migraine diary collecting frequency, length and type of headaches, acute medication usage and migraine associated symptoms. At the end of treatment, a final clinical homeopathic visit will take place as well as a final Neurological visit at study Hospital. Hospital visits are independent of clinical visits and performed by different study physicians. After conclusion of treatment phase patients will have three more follow up visits for the assessment of clinical and homeopathic evolution, possible adverse events and general satisfaction with the study. |Study Type |Masking Description:||Remedy vials will be filled according randomized allocation in 2 number sets; one for the experimental group and two for the control group. Randomization information will be kept by the Study pharmaceutical responsible who will be the only person in possession of the sequence from the beginning of the study. Only the pharmaceutical responsible will have access to the randomization codes during the study and only in case of clinical emergency can break the code of an individual patient. The pharmaceutical responsible will never have any direct nor indirect contact with the study subjects.

Standardized pharmacological treatment will be monitored and approved at first hospital neurological visit and as a requirement needs to be unchanged within 3 months prior inclusion and throughout the study. | Other: Individualized Homeopathic Remedy | An individualized homeopathic remedy selected for each subject according clinical homeopathic parameters will be administered daily in the form of oral globules as an add on to conventional treatment. | Placebo Comparator: Placebo plus Standard Pharmacologic Treatment | Subjects receive an indistinguishable placebo plus the conventional standardized pharmacological treatment he/she is receiving prior and during study. Standardized pharmacological treatment will be monitored and approved at first hospital neurological visit and as a requirement needs to be unchanged within 3 months prior inclusion and throughout the study. | Other: Placebo | Placebo plus Standard Pharmacologic Treatment - Number of migraine attacks [ Time Frame: Baseline - Month 3 ]Assess the efficacy of chosen individualized homeopathic remedy in the preventive treatment of migraine, measuring the change in the number of weekly migraine attacks comparing baseline to the final month of the 3-month treatment period versus placebo. - Number of migraine days [ Time Frame: Baseline - Month 3 ]Assess the efficacy of chosen individualized homeopathic remedy in the preventive treatment of migraine, measuring the change in the number of monthly migraine days comparing baseline to the final month of the 3-month treatment period versus placebo. - Responder in frequency of migraine attacks [ Time Frame: Baseline - Month 3 ]Number of subjects achieving diminution in more than 50% of migraine attacks per month comparing baseline to the final month of the 3-month treatment period versus placebo - Responder in quantity of migraine days [ Time Frame: Baseline - Month 3 ]Number of subjects achieving diminution in more than 50% of migraine days per month comparing baseline to the final month of the 3-month treatment period versus placebo - Migraine acute medication usage doses [ Time Frame: Baseline - Month 3 ]Assess the efficacy of chosen individualized homeopathic remedy in the preventive treatment of migraine, measured by the change of the required doses of standard pharmacological acute migraine drugs comparing baseline to the final month of the 3-month treatment period versus placebo. - Migraine Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ) [ Time Frame: Baseline - Month 3 ]Assess the change in MSQ Questionnaire scores from baseline to end of treatment period versus placebo.
